How Large Employer Health Plans Could Be Affected By Obamacare Overhaul\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Hero Images/Getty Images Hero Images/Getty Images\n\nIf you think that you wouldn't be touched by a Republican overhaul of Obamacare because you get health insurance through your job at a big company, think again.\n\nSeveral of the law's provisions apply to plans offered by large employers, too (with some exceptions for plans that were in place before the law passed in March 2010).\n\nIt's not yet clear how President-elect Donald Trump and congressional Republicans plan to revamp the federal health law, known as the Affordable Care Act or Obamacare. They have not agreed on a plan, and they do not have enough votes in the Senate to fully repeal the current statute. So they are planning to use a budgeting rule to disassemble part of the law, which will limit what they can change. But they also may seek revisions in important regulations and guidance that have determined how the law is implemented.\n\nNonetheless, as tensions grow in Washington over the future of the health law, it is important to understand some of its effects on large-group plans.\n\nNo copays for preventive services\n\nThe health insurance offered by big companies is typically pretty comprehensive, the better to attract and keep good employees. But Obamacare broadened some coverage requirements. Under the law, insurers and employers have to cover many preventive services without charging people anything for them. The services that are required with no out-of-pocket payments include dozens of screenings and tests, including mammograms and colonoscopies that are recommended by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force; routine immunizations endorsed by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices; and a range of services that are recommended specifically for children and for women by the federal Health Resources and Services Administration.\n\nThe change that affects the most people on an ongoing basis is likely the requirement that plans cover without cost sharing all methods of contraception approved by the Food and Drug Administration. (There are limited exceptions for religious employers.)\n\nIn terms of sustained costs, birth control is probably the biggest, said Caroline Pearson, a senior vice president at Avalere Health.\n\nNo annual or lifetime limits on coverage\n\nEven the most generous plans often had lifetime maximum coverage limits of a few million dollars before the health law passed, and some plans also imposed annual coverage limits. The health law eliminated those dollar coverage limits.\n\nAnnual cap on out-of-pocket payments for covered services\n\nThe health law set limits on how much people can be required to pay in deductibles, copayments or coinsurance every year for covered care they receive from providers in their network. In 2017, the limit is $7,150 for individuals and $14,300 for families.\n\nMany employers often had an out-of-pocket limit anyway, but this guarantees protection for people with high needs, said JoAnn Volk, a research professor at Georgetown University's Center on Health Insurance Reforms, who has written on this issue.\n\nAdult kids' coverage expanded\n\nThe law allowed workers to keep their children on their plans until they reach age 26, even if they're married, financially independent and live in another state. Republicans have said they may keep this popular provision in place if they dismantle the law.\n\nGuaranteed external appeal rights\n\nConsumers who disagree with a health plan's decision to deny benefits or payment for services can appeal the decision to an independent review panel.\n\nThe provision applies to all new health plans including those offered by self-funded companies that pay their workers' claims directly and who were previously exempt from appeals requirements.\n\nNo waiting periods to join a plan\n\nEmployers used to be able to make new employees wait indefinitely before they were eligible for coverage under the company plan. No more. Now the waiting time for coverage can be no more than 90 days.\n\nNo waiting periods for coverage of pre-existing conditions\n\nPrior to the ACA, employers could delay covering workers' chronic and other health conditions for up to a year after they became eligible for a plan. Under the ACA, that's no longer allowed. As a practical matter, though, coverage of pre-existing conditions was rarely an issue in large-group plans, say some health insurance analysts.\n\nRepeal could reopen the door to that prohibited practice, however.\n\nStandardized plan descriptions\n\nThe law requires all plans to provide a summary of benefits and coverage in a standard format that allows consumers to understand their coverage and make apples-to-apples plan comparisons.\n\nBasic coverage standards for large-group plans\n\nThe health law isn't as prescriptive with large-group plans about the specific benefits that have to be offered. They aren't required to cover the 10 essential health benefits that individual and small-group plans have to include, for example. But the law does require that big companies offer plans that meet a minimum-value standard, paying at least 60 percent of the cost of covered services, on average. Those that don't could face a fine.\n\nInitially, the online calculator that the federal Department of Health and Human Services provided to help large employers gauge compliance with the minimum value standard gave the green light to plans that didn't cover hospitalization services or more than a few doctor visits a year. Now plans must provide at least that coverage to meet federal standards.\n\nThe result: Large employers generally no longer offer so-called mini-med policies with very skimpy benefits.\n\nIf the health law is repealed, that could change. In some industries with lower-wage workers and smaller profit margins, they might begin to offer them again, and employees might demand it to help make the premiums more affordable, said Steve Wojcik, vice president of public policy at the National Business Group on Health, a membership organization representing large employers.\n\nAlthough the law strengthened coverage for people in large-group plans in several ways, consumer advocates have complained about shortcomings. It aimed to ensure that coverage is affordable by requiring that individuals be responsible for paying no more than 9.69 percent of their household income for individual employer coverage, for example.\n\nIf their insurance costs more than that, workers can shop for coverage on the marketplaces set up by the health law and be eligible for premium tax credits — if their income is less than 400 percent of the federal poverty level (about $47,000). But the standard does not take into consideration any additional costs for family coverage.\n\nConsumer advocates also point to the wellness regulations as a problematic area of the law. The health law increased the financial incentives that employers can offer workers for participating in workplace wellness programs to 30 percent of the cost of individual coverage, up from 20 percent.\n\nSuch incentives can effectively coerce people into participating and sharing private medical information, critics charge, and unfairly penalize sick people.\n\nIt potentially allows [plans] to discriminate against people with medical conditions, which the ACA is supposed to eliminate, said Linda Blumberg, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute's Health Policy Center.\n\nKaiser Health News is an editorially independent news service that is part of the nonpartisan Henry J.

Some Big Health Care Policy Changes Are Hiding In The Federal Spending Package\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Win McNamee/Getty Images Win McNamee/Getty Images\n\nCongress is set to pass a $1.4 trillion spending package this week, which President Trump has said he'll sign. The legislation includes policy changes and funding increases that public health advocates are celebrating, as well as the permanent repeal of three key taxes that were designed to pay for Obamacare — a win for industry groups.\n\nNotably absent from the spending package: legislation to address surprise billing or prescription drug prices. The House passed a prescription drug price bill last week, but a bill that can get through the Senate may be a long way off. Surprise billing proposals had support from both parties in both chambers of Congress as well as in the White House. Still, such legislation have proven difficult to nail down. Lawmakers involved say it is a priority for next year.\n\nOur health reporting team took a look at what is in the package and picked out notable highlights, including some surprising policy reverses for Congress.\n\nRepeal of health taxes designed to pay for ACA\n\nWhen President Barack Obama signed the Affordable Care Act into law in 2010, he said: It is paid for. It is fiscally responsible. But many of the taxes designed to cover the cost of expanding health coverage to 20 million people have been derailed. Now, the so-called Cadillac tax on generous employer health plans is getting permanently nixed, as are taxes on health insurance companies and medical-device makers.\n\nInsurance industry groups applaud the move. But the repeal of these taxes alarmed many health policy and budget watchers. It will contribute $373 billion to the deficit, according to an estimate from Congress' Joint Committee on Taxation.\n\nSo we're cutting the funding out from under Obamacare, but still doing all the spending, says Marc Goldwein, of the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. This whole bill is about reversing the few hard choices that we made to pay for Obamacare.\n\nEverybody seems to want lower deficit in the abstract, but when it comes time to actually cut spending or raise taxes, there doesn't seem to be the political will in either party at the moment, he adds. —Selena Simmons-Duffin, health policy reporter\n\nRaising the age to buy tobacco products to 21\n\nThe measure raises the federal age limit from 18 to 21 and would apply to both cigarettes and e-cigarettes.\n\nAt least 16 states and Washington, D.C., have raised the minimum age to buy tobacco products to 21, according to the American Lung Association. The organization, which has long campaigned to raise the federal age limit, said the move will significantly reduce youth tobacco use and save thousands of lives.\n\nThe national conversation around tobacco age limits gained new momentum thanks to the surging numbers of teenagers who are vaping. The Trump administration had signaled that it planned to introduce an age limit. Some major tobacco companies have backed the idea, such as Altria, which owns Philip Morris USA and partially owns JUUL.\n\nAdvocates against vaping are also pushing for a federal ban on flavors for e-cigarettes, to make them less appealing to kids. Earlier this year, Trump had pledged to impose a flavor ban but has appeared to walk that idea back since then. It's not clear whether further sweeping regulations of the industry are still in store. —Merrit Kennedy, news desk reporter\n\nA foundation for President Trump's plan to end HIV\n\nIn his state of the union address in February, President Trump announced a plan to end the HIV epidemic in America by 2030. This year, not a whole lot has happened toward this goal because there hasn't been funding from Congress — until now. The president's budget had called for $291 million, and Congress will overshoot that slightly.\n\nThis past fall, the Department of Health and Human Services gave grants to 32 state and local health departments where there are HIV hotspots so that they could develop or update programs to reach the goal of ending the epidemic. With this federal funding coming through, the hope is that those places will be able to hit the ground running.\n\nThis is just the foundation — it's the first year of funding, says Carl Schmid of the AIDS Institute and the President's Advisory Council on HIV/AIDS. It's an excellent start, but to achieve the goal of ending the epidemic, we'll need a lot more money to scale it up for next year and the years to come. —Selena Simmons-Duffin, health policy reporter\n\nPaving the way to develop more generic drugs\n\nA bill intended to promote generic drug competition is also expected to get a ride in the budget. The Creating and Restoring Equal Access To Equivalent Samples Act — called the the CREATES Act, for short — aims to make sure branded manufacturers sell samples of their products to companies that want to use them to develop generic versions.\n\nBrand-name companies have, at times, refused to sell samples to would-be generic competitors, citing a Food and Drug Administration program designed to keep potentially harmful drugs from being misused. The FDA says some brands have exploited this program to stall development of generics, maintain their monopolies and keep prices and profits high. With the passage of the CREATES Act, generic companies can sue if they think they've been wrongfully denied samples.\n\nIt's not a panacea, but it's definitely an important step forward in providing relief for Americans struggling with high prescription drug costs, says Harvard Medical School instructor Ameet Sarpatwari. The bill has been introduced five times but never managed to pass despite bipartisan sponsorship. The Congressional Budget Office expects CREATES to save taxpayers $3.7 billion over 10 years. —Sydney Lupkin, pharmaceuticals correspondent\n\nFirst funding for gun violence research since 1996\n\nThe budget provides $25 million for research on preventing deaths and injuries from guns, split equally between the National Institutes of Health and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nThis is a very meaningful, small step in the right direction, says Christian Heyne, vice president of policy at Brady, an organization focused on ending gun violence. He notes that these are the nation's two preeminent public health agencies. The CDC has shied away from gun violence research since 1996, when legislation known as the Dickey Amendment first prohibited the agency from using federal funds to advocate or promote gun control. In 2018, language added to instructions accompanying a spending bill made it clear that the CDC was allowed to conduct research on the causes of gun violence. At that time, Congress provided no funding.\n\nNow, lawmakers have not only allocated money, they're actually naming that this money needs to be spent to research gun violence, says Heyne. —Nell Greenfieldboyce, correspondent\n\nShoring up suicide prevention efforts\n\nThe budget provides SAMHSA with $19 million for the Suicide Prevention Lifeline — this includes an increase of $7 million over last year. The additional funding is a significant improvement, notes Lauren McGrath, the vice president of public policy at Centerstone, a behavioral health care provider working in several states.\n\nCalls to the Lifeline are answered by a patchwork of about 165 local call centers that receive only about $1,500 to 2,000 per year of federal money. Most of the federal funds support the Lifeline's national infrastructure. The additional funding will provide much needed resources to improve consumer access to the National Suicide Lifeline, McGrath wrote in an email. The funds will likely be used to identify areas where there are gaps in coverage and to find ways to fill in those gaps, she adds.\n\nStill, she notes that the service is far from fully funded and centers struggle to keep pace with the rise in call volumes. As call volumes have increased, so have wait times and dropped calls. We have a lot more work to do here, she adds.\n\nThe spending package also includes an increase of $7 million for the Zero Suicide Program, which provides a tools, training and outreach to help health care systems adopt effective suicide prevention approaches.\n\nThis budget doesn't address funding needs for transitioning to the new 988 number that's in the works. That might come in the next fiscal year, notes McGrath. —Rhitu Chatterjee, health correspondent\n\nMedicaid in the territories, community health clinics, and other extenders\n\nThe U.S. territories had been facing a dramatic funding cliff this fall. The ACA gave the territories 10 years of additional money for Medicaid, but that ran out in September — causing a potential $1 billion shortfall in 2020. Guam and the Virgin Islands warned they would need to start cutting their Medicaid rolls, and Puerto Rico would have had to cut benefits to account for the funding cliff.\n\nNow, they won't have to — the spending package restores funding to the territories' Medicaid for two years. In fact, as Politico first reported, the White House agreed to four years of funding, but Trump objected, a source familiar with the negotiations confirmed to NPR.\n\nAlso attached to the budget are several other health extenders, including funding for community health centers and safety net hospitals. However, those only get funding until May, notes Edwin Park, a research professor and the Georgetown Center for Children and Families.\n\nPark thinks the new May deadline might be designed to help push forward legislation on other health priorities like prescription drug prices or surprise billing.\n\nI hope that Congress will come back in the spring of 2020 and will provide a longer-term extension, as opposed to again kicking the can down the road and placing these provisions in limbo, Park says. —Selena Simmons-Duffin, health policy reporter
4 Steps That Could Cut Health Insurance Premiums And Boost Enrollment\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Andrew Harnik/AP Andrew Harnik/AP\n\nCongress and the Trump administration could boost insurance coverage by a couple of million people and lower premiums by taking a few actions to stabilize the Affordable Care Act insurance markets, according to a new analysis by the consulting firm Oliver Wyman.\n\nThe paper, which lays out a simple blueprint for making insurance more affordable for more people while working within the current health law's structure, comes just days before the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee begins hearings on ways to stabilize markets in the short term.\n\nTogether, these approaches could increase enrollment by roughly two million individuals, reduce average premiums by more than 20 percent and be roughly revenue neutral, the analysis by Kurt Giesa and Peter Kaczmarek says.\n\nThe analysis concludes that under current law, about 17 million people will buy insurance in the individual market next year, many of them outside the ACA marketplaces. If the four actions outlined in the paper are implemented, about 19 million people would buy individual insurance, the study finds.\n\nAt the same time, the average monthly premium would fall from $486 to $384.\n\nSome of the actions, including extending the Affordable Care Act's cost-sharing subsidies, are already on the table for next month's committee hearings.\n\nThese are the four steps that Oliver Wyman recommends to stabilize Obamacare.\n\n1. Fund the cost-sharing reduction payments for the long term\n\nThese are payments the government makes to insurance companies as reimbursement for discounts on copayments and deductibles the companies are required by law to give to low-income customers. President Trump has said he wants to end the payments — which a court has ruled are unlawful since Congress never authorized them. But now lawmakers, including Republican Sen. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, chairman of the health committee, say they want Congress to fund the payments through next year.\n\nState insurance commissioners have warned that abrupt cancellation of cost-sharing subsidies would cause premiums, copays and deductibles to increase and more insurance companies to leave the markets in 2018, Alexander said in a statement on Aug. 16. Congress now should pass balanced, bipartisan, limited legislation in September that will fund cost-sharing payments for 2018.\n\n2. Create a reinsurance program\n\nThe ACA included a temporary reinsurance program that protected insurance companies from huge losses while they transitioned to the new market under the new law.\n\nSenate Republicans included a reinsurance program in the Better Care Reconciliation Act, the health care overhaul that failed earlier this summer.\n\nGovs. John Hickenlooper of Colorado and John Kasich of Ohio are publicly advocating such a program.\n\nTop of our list would be this notion of having some sort of reinsurance to make sure the high-cost pool is not causing higher rates for all, Hickenlooper said in an interview with Colorado Public Radio.\n\n3. Strongly enforce the individual mandate\n\nPresident Trump has suggested he doesn't want the Internal Revenue Service to enforce Obamacare's requirement that every person have insurance. Today, individuals who can't prove they have coverage must pay a fine of $695 or more. Oliver Wyman's analysis shows that if the mandate isn't enforced, many young healthy people would drop their coverage.\n\nAs younger and healthier people opt out of the market, the cost of coverage would increase, and market-average premiums would increase in parallel, the study said.\n\n4. Get rid of the health insurance tax\n\nObamacare includes a tax on health insurance companies to help offset the costs of federal subsidies that help people buy policies on the ACA markets. It was in place from 2014 through 2016, but then Congress passed a moratorium on the levy for this year. Insurance companies are lobbying hard to ensure it doesn't return next year. Oliver Wyman's analysis shows that continuing that moratorium would cut premiums by about 3 percent next year.\n\nInsurance companies have until Sept. 27 to commit to selling policies on the ACA marketplaces in 2018. Alexander says he wants some legislation to pass before then to help stabilize the markets and cut premiums.
In Ohio, Trump Loyalists Reflect On His First 100 Days\n\nOhio was key to President Trump's victory in November, and his base of support there among the Tea Party and other loyalists is holding, even amid internal White House battles, the failure to repeal Obamacare and some big reversals of campaign promises. But these voters also make clear they have expectations by which they will judge the president.\n\nAUDIE CORNISH, HOST:\n\nOhio was key to President Trump's victory in November. He succeeded in flipping 10 counties that had gone for President Obama four years earlier. NPR's Don Gonyea recently went back to Ohio to check in on Trump supporters as their candidate nears his 100th day in office. They're still loyal but expect to see some results.\n\nDON GONYEA, BYLINE: Two days after the election, I walked into the Top Notch Diner in Trumbull County, Ohio, and found a group of regulars talking politics, all Trump supporters - among them, 64-year-old Gary Frederick, who owns the diner. He expected the Trump victory to lead to the quick demise of the Affordable Care Act, Obamacare. That didn't happen, but he doesn't blame Trump.\n\nGARY FREDERICK: Well, that...\n\nGONYEA: What was your take on that?\n\nFREDERICK: That's more of Congress, not Trump's doing.\n\nGONYEA: Recently I went back to the diner where Frederick says he still sees Trump as making good progress.\n\nFREDERICK: Trump's a businessman. He knows what has to be done to make things right, and he's already making it happen. The trade policies - bringing all them, like, China, Japan - all them people in, and he's sitting down with them.\n\nGONYEA: But Trump has already reversed some big campaign promises on trade. This week he told Canada and Mexico he won't be tearing up NAFTA, the North American Free Trade Agreement. And he's decided not to label China a currency manipulator. Frederick's take on that...\n\nFREDERICK: I think there's a backdoor going on there. And Trump don't lay his cards on the table for everybody to see.\n\nGONYEA: It's breakfast time at the Top Notch Diner, and the regulars are gathering like they do most mornings.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #1: Two eggs, toast, home fries and meat for 3.95.\n\nGONYEA: The topic of China comes up. 79-year-old Dave Cover, a former truck driver, says it's evidence of Trump adapting to the job. Trump needs China, he says, because he needs help with North Korea.\n\nDAVE COVER: He's come to the conclusion that he has to deal with China 'cause that's the only effective ally that's got any control over basically an uncontrollable entity over there. And he's decided, in my opinion, we've got to make hay with China because of North Korea.\n\nGONYEA: Seated next to Cover is Doyle Smithson, a retired firefighter. He rejects the notion that it's anywhere near time to pass judgment on the president.\n\nDOYLE SMITHSON: What does the first hundred days have to do with it? He's elected for four years.\n\nGONYEA: Tell him the president himself has touted a successful 100 days, and Smithson says, again...\n\nSMITHSON: He's got four years.\n\nGONYEA: Now to another northeast Ohio town - Strongsville, a suburb of Cleveland - and to Jane Porter. She's a Tea Party member.\n\nJANE PORTER: Well, I think that he has very good intentions, and I think that he wants to do the things that he promised.\n\nGONYEA: If she sounds just a bit lacking in enthusiasm, she says that's not so and offers an alternative reality.\n\nPORTER: What I would say is, I could be doing an interview with you today - you know, if Hillary were in, it would be, you know, pretty much everything that we fear upon us.\n\nGONYEA: Porter has high expectations for what Trump and a GOP-controlled Congress should do. Trump has won praise from conservatives for naming Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court. But Porter says there's no real certainty yet how he will vote on the issue most important to her, abortion. And she says a new law allowing states to withhold federal funding for Planned Parenthood is not enough.\n\nPORTER: If he thinks that allowing the states to defund Planned Parenthood is going to, you know, appease us - no.\n\nGONYEA: Now to a small lake not far from Akron, Ohio.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #2: Oh, come on (laughter).\n\nTOM ZAWISTOWSKI: Yeah, come on up the spiral staircase. This spiral staircase was made in my home town of Erie, Pa., and I...\n\nGONYEA: Northeast Ohio Tea Party leader Tom Zawistowski lives in a house that has a lighthouse attached. He likes that Trump is a businessman and a pragmatist, but he also acknowledges that means the Tea Party needs to be vigilant.\n\nZAWISTOWSKI: We knew he wasn't a conservative, so we knew that once he got to Washington, we kind of had to be the guard rails on the highway, OK? He's going to be all over the road. We just need to make sure he doesn't drive off the road.\n\nGONYEA: Here's an example of that. When Trump tweeted attacks on the Freedom Caucus after that group derailed the Obamacare replacement, Zawistowski wrote an open letter to the president, reminding him that the Tea Party helped him get elected.\n\nZAWISTOWSKI: We're good at keeping score, you know? We've had to do this.\n\nGONYEA: Again, he's still a strong supporter, but it's not unconditional.\n\nZAWISTOWSKI: He likes to be liked. He likes to be loved, OK? Well, you know, there's a - that's a two-way street. You know, show us some love, too.\n\nGONYEA: So close to the 100-day mark of the Trump presidency - support from his voters, but it's an ongoing relationship and one that will be tested.

Days Before Democrats Take Over House, Trump Blames Them For Shutdown\n\nLEILA FADEL, HOST:\n\nNow for the political implications of the shutdown, let's turn to NPR's national political correspondent Mara Liasson. Good morning, Mara.\n\nMARA LIASSON, BYLINE: Morning, Leila.\n\nFADEL: So no end in sight for the shutdown, but something is definitely going to change on January 3.\n\nLIASSON: Something is definitely going to change on January 3. Donald Trump's world is going to change when the Democrats take over the House and we have divided government and shared power. And one of the puzzling things about what he's done during this shutdown is that he hasn't done any of the other things a president could do to make his case.\n\nHe hasn't spoken to the country about why he thinks a shutdown is good. He hasn't insisted the Congress stay in session. He hasn't demanded that Democrats come to the White House to negotiate with him. All he's done is tweeted. He even tweeted, I am in the White House waiting for the Democrats to come on over and make a deal. So it's a strangely passive approach. And, of course, mostly, he's been tweeting that the Democrats should take the blame.\n\nFADEL: So why is he so confident about blaming the Democrats?\n\nLIASSON: That's a good question because every day that goes by, Democrats have less reason to negotiate with him. He has less leverage over them because they're about to take over the House. He - they're only going to get stronger, not weaker. And many presidents who've lost one House or both in a midterm make some adjustments, but that is not Trump's way. He's doubling down.\n\nAnd outside advisers I've talked to say that he feels he needs to show his base that he is fighting, fighting, fighting for the wall, even if he loses in Congress or in court. And meanwhile, Republican members of Congress who are going to be more Trumpian in the new Congress since moderates retired or lost - more of them have been publicly questioning his strategy or at least saying they can't figure out what his strategy is.\n\nFADEL: OK. So what's the endgame here? And what will be the political damage?\n\nLIASSON: Well, that's unclear right now. Usually in these shutdown fights - and, of course, we've had three of them during the Trump administration. Someone gets blamed, and someone blinks. We don't know who's going to do it this time. The Republicans did have a very unpopular shutdown during the Obama administration and were blamed. But, of course, just a couple weeks later, the Obamacare website debuted and crashed. And that kind of wiped away any damage the Republicans got from that shutdown.\n\nSo we don't know. Sometimes, the political effects from shutdowns are very fleeting. When Congress comes back into session, things will be apparent. Museums will be closed. Federal workers will not be able to make their mortgage payments. So as the president likes to say, we'll see what happens.\n\nFADEL: Well, last Sunday, the president did make a surprise visit to Iraq. And he actually did talk about the shutdown and the border.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: We need a wall. So when you say, how long is it going to take? - when are they going to say that we need border security? When are the Democrats going to say - don't forget. The Democrats all agreed that you need a wall until I wanted it. Once I wanted it, they didn't agree.\n\nFADEL: So, Mara, putting aside the criticism that he politicized a visit to active duty troops, is he right?\n\nLIASSON: There's no doubt that in the past, the Democrats have voted for fencing. They voted for a lot of money for border security. They even were willing to make a deal with Donald Trump for $25 billion for the wall - full funding for the wall in exchange for legalizing the DREAMers, the young people who were brought here - some of them illegally - as children.\n\nBut then at the last minute, the president insisted on cuts in legal immigration. And that deal fell apart. So it is true that in the past, Democrats have voted for some kind of a barrier but only in exchange for comprehensive immigration reform. And that is not what's on the table right now.\n\nFADEL: NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson, thanks so much.\n\nLIASSON: Thank you.\n\nCopyright © 2018 NPR. All rights reserved.

Fact Check: President Trump's Comments On ACA's Subsidies\n\nNPR's Melissa Block talks to Sarah Kliff, Vox senior policy correspondent, to fact check Trump's claim that subsidies for insurance companies are bailouts and a windfall for those companies.\n\nMELISSA BLOCK, HOST:\n\nAnd now we're going to truth squad some of President Trump's latest claims about health care - in particular, what he's said about his decision to stop paying for subsidies under the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare. The president has called those subsidies bailouts to insurance companies, a windfall. Sarah Kliff joins us for a fact check. She covers health care policy for vox.com. Sarah, good morning.\n\nSARAH KLIFF: Good morning.\n\nBLOCK: And first, why don't you give us a quick review of just how these cost-sharing reduction subsidies work?\n\nKLIFF: Yeah, so these are subsidies for low-income Americans who buy Obamacare to help make their co-payments and deductibles a little bit lower, to make it a little easier to go to the doctor. And these payments have - will continue to be paid by insurance companies, even though the government will not finance them. It is just coming out of insurance companies' own pockets at this point.\n\nBLOCK: So basically, if they get reimbursed by the federal government, that is a wash? They're getting just made up for what they already paid out?\n\nKLIFF: Yeah, so the federal government, you know, makes these payments each month, and insurance companies, in turn, help lower the co-payments and deductibles of their low-income consumers. What President Trump is changing is he's not going to make those payments, so insurance companies have no one on the back end, you know, sending them the payment to make up for that spending.\n\nBLOCK: OK. So when President Trump calls those payments a gift to insurance companies, are they a gift?\n\nKLIFF: I would disagree that they are a gift. You know, for one thing, they are going not necessarily to the insurance companies. They're ultimately going to low-income Americans to help them afford their co-payments and afford their deductibles. So, you know, on that level, they don't seem like a bailout or a gift to the insurance companies. They are required by the law. The law requires these subsidies to be made. So they're really - you know, I see them as part of the Affordable Care Act and not necessarily a bailout.\n\nBLOCK: The president has also said, Sarah, that the insurance companies, in his words, made a fortune with Obamacare. Is that true? What do the numbers show?\n\nKLIFF: The numbers are a lot more mixed. The best data on this probably comes from the nonprofit Kaiser Family Foundation, which looks at quarterly margins - so how much insurance companies have each quarter leftover after paying out all those claims. In 2014 and 2015, insurance companies had a quarterly margin of just about $20 a person. That's not a ton of money. It's gone up as the Obamacare markets have stabilized.\n\nIn 2016, it was about $90 a person, so it's definitely getting better. But the insurance markets - you know, I've covered them since they launched. And they've really been a very rocky experience for insurance companies financially. They didn't know how to price at first. People were sicker than they expected. It's only in the past year that insurance companies have made decent profits there, but I think of them as a mixed bag when it comes to financial performance.\n\nBLOCK: Decent profits, which raises the question - if the insurance companies are losing the federal payments, they began compensating by jacking up the premiums for other people - right? - raising those premiums a lot - in some cases by double digits. Couldn't the insurance companies just absorb the costs themselves, cut into their profits but not pass it along to consumers?\n\nKLIFF: Yeah, so one of the things I've learned as a health care reporter is insurance companies tend to have relatively low profit margins, usually in the 3 to 4 percent range. So there definitely is some space. But one of the things that surprised me a little bit is state regulators often are the ones saying, you have to make those increases. They're really worried that insurance companies might get hit with a big claim and not have enough money to pay for it.\n\nSo they want to make sure that insurance companies are getting enough revenue from their premiums to cover that loss, to make sure they can actually pay out claims. The worst-case scenario for a state regulator is to have an insurance company that just can't pay its medical bills for patients.\n\nBLOCK: That's Sarah Kliff. She's a senior policy correspondent for vox.com and host of the podcast The Impact, which covers health care policy. Sarah, thanks so much for being with us.\n\nKLIFF: Yeah, thanks for having me.\n\nCopyright © 2017 NPR. All rights reserved.

What Would Trumpcare Look Like? Follow GOP's 'Choice And Competition' Clues\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Al Drago/Bloomberg/Getty Images Al Drago/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nWhile many Capitol Hill Republicans would like to avoid another public debate about whether to repeal the Affordable Care Act, President Trump and his appointees keep bringing it up — promising their own health plan that would be phenomenal and make the GOP the party of health care.\n\nWe're actively engaged in conversations on what to do, Medicare chief Seema Verma said last month. And Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway has indicated a health care announcement might come in September.\n\nBehind the pronouncements lies a dilemma: whether or not to stray beyond efforts underway to improve the nation's health care system — loosening insurance regulations, talking about drug prices and expanding tax-free health savings accounts — to develop an overarching plan.\n\nFor the White House, it's a fraught decision.\n\nA comprehensive plan could serve as a lightning rod for opponents. Conversely, not having a plan for replacing some of the most popular parts of Obamacare — such as its coverage protections for people with preexisting medical conditions — could leave the GOP flatfooted if an administration-supported lawsuit now before the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals were to invalidate the sweeping health law.\n\nThis is a real conundrum, says Dean Rosen, a Washington, D.C., health policy consultant who often advises Republicans. There is a risk with action or inaction.\n\nNo matter how the 5th Circuit rules, its decision, which could come soon, is likely to be stayed while the issue heads to the Supreme Court. Such a delay would give the Trump administration time to flesh out a proposal if the appeals judges throw out the ACA. But it would also ensure that a health care debate is front and center during the presidential campaign.\n\nRight now, polls show the public is focused on health costs, says professor Robert Blendon, director of the Harvard Opinion Research Program, which studies public knowledge of health care and policy issues. Consumers are concerned about what they pay at the pharmacy counter or about the sum of their insurance premiums and deductibles.\n\nMost voters are not interested in another debate on a new health plan, Blendon says.\n\nBut if the 5th Circuit upholds a Texas ruling overturning the entire ACA, that changes the entire framework, he adds. The administration could not just say, 'Oh, we'll have something great.' They would have to have something outlined.\n\nSupporters and critics say likely elements are already in plain sight, both in executive actions and proposals in the president's budget as well as in a little-noticed interagency white paper released late last year, called Reforming American's Health Care System Through Choice And Competition.\n\nThe president has won praise both from conservatives and from liberals for initiatives such as his proposal to require hospitals to post their actual, negotiated prices and some strategies to lower drug prices. But legal battles from industry could thwart such initiatives.\n\nOn these topics, a lot of what they've proposed has been pretty smart, says Shawn Gremminger, senior director of federal relations at the liberal Families USA advocacy group.\n\nStill, Gremminger points to other administration actions — such as loosening rules on health insurers to allow sales of what critics call junk insurance policies, because they don't have all the consumer protections of ACA policies, or promoting work requirements for Medicaid recipients — as strong hints to what might be in any eventual election-related plan.\n\nI think what we'll see is a lot of that same sort of stuff, warmed over and put into a new package, Gremminger says. We fully expect it will include a lot of really terrible ideas.\n\nFor other policy clues, some Trump advisers, like Brian Blase, a former special assistant to the president at the National Economic Council now with the Texas Public Policy Foundation, say look no further than that 2018 interagency report.\n\nThe 114-page document, a joint publication of the U.S. departments of Labor, Treasury and Health and Human Services, includes more than two dozen recommendations that broadly focus on loosening federal and state regulations, limiting hospital and insurer market power and prompting patients to be more price-conscious shoppers.\n\nMany are long-standing, free market favorites of Republicans, such as increasing the use of health savings accounts — which allow consumers to set aside money, tax-free, to cover medical expenses. Other ideas are not typically associated with the GOP, such as increased federal scrutiny of mergers of hospitals and insurers; such mergers have driven up prices.\n\nThe white paper also calls for easing restrictions on Medicare Advantage plans, which offer an alternative to the traditional fee-for-service Medicare. The Trump proposal would allow the advantage program to have smaller networks of doctors and hospitals — presumably ones that agreed to charge less.\n\nThe administration knows where it is going on health care, Blase says.\n\nIf the court strikes down the ACA, he expects the administration to release a plan supporting generously funded, state-based high-risk pools.\n\nSuch pools existed in most states before the ACA. They helped provide coverage for people with preexisting conditions who were denied policies by insurers. But the pools were expensive, so they often were underfunded — capping members' benefits and producing long waiting lists.\n\nNot everyone thinks the white paper is a plan, but more of a combination of policy ideas and political statements, says Joe Antos at the conservative-leaning American Enterprise Institute.\n\nStill, he doubts the GOP needs a comprehensive health proposal. Republicans are more likely to gain politically by merely attacking the Democrats' ideas, Antos says, especially if the Democratic nominee backs proposals for a fully government-funded health care system, such as the Medicare for All plans some candidates support.\n\nRepublicans will have their own one-liners, saying they are dedicated to protecting people with preexisting conditions. That might be enough for a lot of people, Antos says.\n\nPolitically, taking on the Affordable Care Act — or not taking it on — are both risky. While many voters don't understand all that the federal health law does, some of its rules enjoy broad support. That's particularly true of the protections for people with medical problems — under the current law, insurers are barred from rejecting them for coverage or charging them more than people without such conditions.\n\nThe Republican effort to repeal the ACA galvanized activists during the 2018 midterm elections and is credited with boosting Democrats to victory in many House districts.\n\nAnalysts on both sides expect concerns about health costs and health law to play a large role again in 2020.\n\nFor Republicans, the risk of doing nothing potentially leaves no port in a storm if the ACA is overturned legally, Rosen says. But a more limited version, which is what most Republicans are for, is likely to be met with the same concerns. No matter what the president says, it won't be enough for the Democrats.\n\nOpinion poll analyst Blendon says there is an additional unknown: Which Democrat will win the nomination — and what type of coverage will she or he back?\n\nEven as the GOP is split on how to address health care concerns, so too are the Democrats.\n\nIf they are reading the same polling data as I am, they would have serious proposals for lowering drug and hospital costs, but not offer a national health plan, Blendon says.\n\nThe Democrats' most progressive wing, led by Sens. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, wants Medicare for All, which would essentially eliminate private and job-based coverage. Recent polls have shown voters are not keen on losing private insurance.\n\nThe party's center, led by former Vice President Joe Biden, wants to keep the ACA but apply fixes to make insurance purchased by individuals more affordable.\n\nIf the Democratic nominee is running on keeping the ACA, the Republican will have to have an alternative, Blendon says. But if the nominee supports Medicare for All, Blendon predicts simply a GOP anti-campaign targeting the Democrat's idea as unworkable, socialist or a danger to Medicare.\n\nKaiser Health News is a nonprofit, editorially independent program of the Kaiser Family Foundation.

A Look At How The Supreme Court Chief Justice May Preside Over Senate Impeachment\n\nChief Justice John Roberts will preside over President Trump's impeachment trial in the Senate. But his role in the process is limited — as seen during the last presidential impeachment trial.\n\nAUDIE CORNISH, HOST:\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi said today she will send the Senate the articles of impeachment soon. But the House and Senate remain at loggerheads over the timing and details of President Trump's impeachment trial. Whatever they are and whenever the trial takes place, the man at the center of it all will be Chief Justice John Roberts. NPR legal affairs correspondent Nina Totenberg has more.\n\nNINA TOTENBERG, BYLINE: The Constitution says that the chief justice shall preside over the Senate trial of a president. Those who envision a powerful role for the chief justice point to Senate rules that would allow him to make decisions on, quote, all questions of evidence. In theory, at least, that might enable Roberts to rule on motions from the House managers seeking to compel testimony from White House aides, like former national security adviser John Bolton and others who, until now, have been blocked by President Trump from testifying.\n\nYet, under Senate rules, it is the senators themselves who have the first and last word. They establish the procedures for the trial and can overturn any of Roberts' rulings.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING, GAVEL SOUNDING)\n\nWILLIAM REHNQUIST: The Senate will convene as a court of impeachment.\n\nTOTENBERG: The extent of the chief's powerlessness, however, was driven home to Chief Justice William Rehnquist at the beginning of President Clinton's Senate trial in 1999.\n\nJAMES ZIGLAR: He asked me - well, how do I turn on my microphone? And I looked at him. And I said, you don't; we control that.\n\nTOTENBERG: James Ziglar was the Senate sergeant-at-arms at the time.\n\nZIGLAR: I don't know if shock's the right word but certainly a sense of dismay to him that even though he was going to be the presiding officer over this so-called jury of senators, that he really had absolutely no control of his courtroom.\n\nTOTENBERG: The Clinton trial was conducted in a far different time. The Republican majority leader and the Democratic minority leader worked closely to conduct the trial in a dignified way. And the rules for the trial were ultimately established by consensus and a unanimous Senate vote. The president, while controversial, had never attacked the Supreme Court or the chief justice personally. And the high court membership itself had remained stable for five years without change. None of that is true today. Trump's relationship with Chief Justice Roberts has been rocky at best during the 2016 presidential campaign. Trump castigated him for failing to strike down Obamacare, calling him disgraceful and more here in an interview with ABC's This Week.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nDONALD TRUMP: Justice Roberts turned out to be a nightmare for conservatives.\n\nTOTENBERG: Although the president and Roberts have been cordial in their rare personal interactions. Trump has repeatedly cast aspersions on the integrity of judges whose decisions he disagreed with, a practice that finally prompted a rare rebuke from Roberts. And, of course, a snarky tweet from Trump firing back at the chief justice. Roberts, a conservative appointed to the court by President George W. Bush 15 years ago, has tried mightily to convey an image of the court as apolitical.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nJOHN ROBERTS: Our role is very clear. We are to interpret the Constitution and laws of the United States and ensure that the political branches act within them. That job obviously requires independence from the political branches.\n\nTOTENBERG: But that image has proved harder to maintain as the court, with the addition of two Trump-appointed justices in the last two years, has veered to the right with the promise of an even more dramatic conservative turn in the near future. Even as Roberts will be presiding over the Senate trial, he and fellow justices are hearing nearly a dozen blockbuster cases this term on issues ranging from abortion to immigration and even a series of cases in which Trump is seeking to block subpoenas for his financial records.\n\nWith that menu dominating his day job, it is unlikely that Roberts will want to insert himself as a major player in the impeachment trial. Rather, he's likely to use as his role model the man he once clerked for - Chief Justice Rehnquist. As presiding officer at the Clinton trial, Rehnquist learned to rely on the Senate parliamentarians for guidance. Robert Schaffer was one of his law clerks back then.\n\nROBERT SCHAFFER: I think he enjoyed sort of being part of history in that sense, but he understood that he had a very limited role.\n\nTOTENBERG: Neil Richards, a professor at Washington University Law School in St. Louis - another Rehnquist clerk - puts it this way.\n\nNEIL RICHARDS: He was a hundred percent focused on his job as presiding judge, no matter how boring or tedious the proceedings.\n\nTOTENBERG: Former Senate sergeant-at-arms Ziglar, who had once clerked on the Supreme Court himself, remembers that Rehnquist was often grumpy at the unplanned breaks that were supposed to be brief but could last for one or two hours or more. So he took the chief to lunch.\n\nZIGLAR: I said, Chief, what can I do to make you less grumpy? And he said - well, he said, I love cookies and cream ice cream and chocolate chip cookies.\n\nTOTENBERG: After that, whenever there was a break, Ziglar would trigger the call for ice cream and cookies. And it seemed to work - not enough, though, to deal with the boredom of those unplanned breaks. On one occasion, Ziglar found the chief with his three clerks sitting in the ornate, gilded President's Room playing poker.\n\nZIGLAR: I looked at him, and I kind of smiled. I said Chief, you may not know this, but I'm also the chief law enforcement officer in the Senate. And gambling is against our rules.\n\nTOTENBERG: Ziglar told the group he needed to do something but would be back shortly.\n\nZIGLAR: Then I walked back in. The cards were still on the table. But instead of nickels and dimes and pennies, there were little pieces of paper on which was written one, five and 10.\n\nTOTENBERG: Chief Justice Roberts may find the going a lot less boring in the upcoming Senate trial, especially if the rules are often in dispute. Word is that he, like Rehnquist before him, has asked that the trial begin on court days at 1 o'clock in the afternoon so that Roberts can preside over the court's oral arguments in the morning.\n\nIn addition, Roberts will have a very full plate of work, including writing his share of opinions, plus the administrative work at the court. He likely will aspire to Rehnquist's puckish evaluation of his role in the 1999 Senate trial. Borrowing a line from Gilbert and Sullivan's play Iolanthe, Rehnquist opined - I did nothing in particular and did it very well.\n\nNina Totenberg, NPR News, Washington.\n\nCopyright © 2020 NPR.

Florida And Georgia Voter Follow Through; Support Their Candidates\n\nOn this morning after the election, we check in with Annie Ruiz of Florida, who supported Donald Trump, and Suzanne Menarcine in Georgia, who supported Hillary Clinton.\n\nSTEVE INSKEEP, HOST:\n\nNow, the millions of Americans listening for results overnight included Annie Ruiz, who is a Cuban-American homemaker and a Republican.\n\nRENEE MONTAGNE, HOST:\n\nWe met her this last fall as we traveled the Divided States. She was preparing to vote for Trump and says she followed through.\n\nANNIE RUIZ: To me, the most important thing is to repeal and replace Obamacare. I think that's the most important thing on the agenda right now. I like the idea of overhauling the system, so to speak. I like the idea of term limits. I like the idea of limiting lobbying. And I really, really like what he talks about as far as the economy and what he plans to do to create jobs and his tax plan. All of that appeals to me.\n\nINSKEEP: So she's in Florida. Now, one state down in Georgia - or up, rather, I should say - we reached Democrat Suzanne Minarsin (ph), who had told us this fall she was proud to support Hillary Clinton.\n\nSUZANNE MINARSIN: But I knew that there were a lot of people who felt disenfranchised.\n\nINSKEEP: So she says she is not so surprised by the result this morning. She wants to see her Democratic Party make some significant changes.\n\nMINARSIN: I think the Democratic Party, first of all, has got to recognize the young people. It needs to mobilize at the grass-roots level, as it did with Barack Obama's first term. I think it needs to be reenergized.\n\nMONTAGNE: That was Suzanne Minarsin from Georgia and Annie Ruiz of Florida, talking about their votes and their parties this morning after an election which brought Donald Trump to power as the next American president.\n\nCopyright © 2016 NPR.

Author David Kaplan On The Political Fight For RBG's Seat\n\nMICHEL MARTIN, HOST:\n\nAs the country mourns the death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Washington is preparing for an epic battle to fill her now-vacant seat. So we're going to spend the next part of our program thinking about what that might look like. And we're going to begin with David Kaplan. He spent years covering the Supreme Court as a legal affairs editor for Newsweek. His most recent book is The Most Dangerous Branch: Inside The Supreme Court In The Age Of Trump. And David Kaplan is with us now. Thank you so much for joining us once again.\n\nDAVID KAPLAN: Good to be with you again.\n\nMARTIN: So one of the revelations of your book, frankly, is that justices are not immune from political calculations about their seats. You said that that was true of the first woman on the court, Sandra Day O'Connor, who thought a lot about that. So we've reported that one of Justice Ginsburg's final wishes is that her replacement not be named until there is a new president. Now, the late justice could have stepped down when Obama was president and the Democrats controlled the Senate. Should she have? Do you think she considered doing so? And why do you think she didn't?\n\nKAPLAN: She says she did not consider doing so. And I think she didn't for two reasons. One, as she's pointed out, there was no guarantee that a replacement ever would've been confirmed. God knows we certainly saw that play out with Merrick Garland in 2016. The second reason is it's a great gig. Most justices don't want to give it up. And the average tenure of recent justices has been close to 30 years.\n\nMARTIN: So let's turn to the political fight ahead. And as, of course, you certainly know, in 2016, after the death of Justice Antonin Scalia, Senator Mitch McConnell made it a point to stall the nomination process until after the presidential election. Now he's reversed course, saying the process will move forward. We've heard from two senators so far, saying that they don't think that that's fair and that they will follow the precedent and not vote to move ahead. That's Lisa Murkowski and Susan Collins. But what about the rest of the Senate? What about the rest of the Republicans in the Senate, I should say?\n\nKAPLAN: Well, they're going to need four opponents. Democrats are going to need four Republicans to come forward and stick with that idea that not only will we not have a vote before Election Day, we won't have one until a new president's inaugurated in January. Obviously, Mitt Romney is going to be key. And then you've got to look to someone like Cory Gardner in Colorado. He has to make the calculation. I'm in a close race. Am I going to do better by tacking toward the Senate or appealing to the hard right? But I think Romney will be very important. If you get to three votes, then there's a certain amount of hydraulic pressure on potential fourths. But if I were in the prediction business, I would think the desire to get another conservative on the bench and put Roe v. Wade and perhaps Obamacare in real jeopardy is just too tempting.\n\nMARTIN: And, of course, Republicans have been successful at making the Supreme Court a voting issue during presidential elections. According to The Washington Post, about a quarter of Trump voters in 2016 said that the Supreme Court was the most important factor in voting for him. And that compares to 18% of Democrats who said it was the most important factor. So, clearly, there sort of was a gap there. Do you think that there will be a similar dynamic this year, or is it different? I mean, could it potentially work both ways? Could it galvanize Democrats as well this year?\n\nKAPLAN: It could, but Republicans have surely demonstrated they're galvanizable on this issue. And every day spent over the next six weeks discussing the Supreme Court appointment is a boon for Trump 'cause that means it's a day not spent discussing COVID.\n\nMARTIN: And, of course, President Trump released a long list of nominees for the Supreme Court as part of this campaign like he did last election. And he recently sort of amplified that list. Now, you've covered the federal courts for years. Do any names in the list stick out to you? And does - do you see the list, and does the list tell you anything about the direction he may go in in picking a nominee?\n\nKAPLAN: I - predictions are always risky. I got Brett Kavanaugh right. I got prior ones not right. But Amy Coney Barrett, a former Notre Dame professor now on the 7th Circuit in the Midwest, sure looks like the obvious candidate. She was one of the finalists for the seat that Kavanaugh got, maybe Joan Larsen, also on the federal appellate bench. But if I had five bucks to place on a nominee, it would be Amy Coney Barrett, 48, a darling of the right wing, former Scalia clerk. You could come up with cases for other names, including some of the men, but that's where I'd be putting my money.\n\nMARTIN: And you made a point of emphasizing she's 48. Why does that matter?\n\nKAPLAN: Younger is better. I mean, if Trump thought he had - if Trump thought he could put someone on the court who was 38, if there was a viable nominee, he would. But 48's pretty young. It would be younger than Kavanaugh was and younger than Gorsuch. It would be the youngest nominee on the court since Clarence Thomas was nominated 30 years ago, when he was in his early 40s. Justices stick around a long time.\n\nMARTIN: Because the impact is longer. Yeah, they stick around a long time, and the impact is that much greater and longer. So before we let you go, a new term - a new Supreme Court term begins on October 5. And, as always, it's expected that there will be, you know, hot-button polarizing issues that come before the justices. Since it's an election, there's a number of last-minute election law matters that the justice will have to hear. How will the fact that there are only eight justices affect how the court conducts its business in such a delicate time?\n\nKAPLAN: Well, there aren't likely to be any big-time rulings coming out before Election Day. But there will be - potentially, in a close election - the worst case, a repeat of Bush v. Gore and not in one state but in many states. And a 4-4 court presents a potential problem because if they tie 4-4, there is no decision. Whatever decision was reached by a lower court stands. And that is an idea. Now, listen, I argue in my book that Bush v. Gore was the worst decision of the court since Dred Scott, and the Supreme Court shouldn't have gotten involved. And I'd still make the case that the Supreme Court should not get involved in most issues in a presidential election. But if they do get involved and it's a 4-4 outcome, it's going to be very unappealing, no pun intended, for everybody.\n\nMARTIN: That is David Kaplan, former legal affairs editor for Newsweek and the author of The Most Dangerous Branch: Inside The Supreme Court In The Age Of Trump. David Kaplan, thank you so much for joining us once again.\n\nKAPLAN: Pleasure, thank you.\n\nCopyright © 2020 NPR. All rights reserved.

GOP Leaders Ready To Pivot From 'Do-Nothing' To Doing A Lot In 2017\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Zach Gibson/Getty Images Zach Gibson/Getty Images\n\nAs the 115th Congress is sworn in Tuesday, Republicans will be poised to control Washington with a stronger hand than they have in a decade — with the Senate, House and the White House in GOP control once President-elect Donald Trump takes office on January 20.\n\nThis past November, Republicans held their congressional losses to a minimum, helped by an unexpectedly strong GOP wave behind Trump. After losing just two Senate seats, they'll hold a 52-48 edge (two independents caucus with Democrats). In the House, Republicans lost six seats, giving them a 241-194 majority.\n\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan boasted shortly after Election Day that the new unified Republican government would be focused on turning President-elect Trump's victory into real progress for the American people.\n\nAnd as NPR congressional correspondent Susan Davis explained, there is precedent for a unified government pushing through sweeping changes early on:\n\nWhen the White House and Congress have been controlled by the same party, Washington has produced some of the most sweeping — albeit politically polarizing — legislation aimed at shifting the political trajectory of the nation toward the cause of the party in power. In particular, the first two-year congressional session of a new administration — when public approval is generally at its highest for the incoming president — has produced some recent presidents' most memorable legislative imprints.\n\nGOP congressional leaders and Trump agree on many things — paramount among them their best chance ever to repeal and replace Obamacare, in addition to rolling back federal regulations and increasing infrastructure projects.\n\nBut there are some looming showdowns between the incoming president and members of his own party on Capitol Hill — many of whom were less than supportive of Trump in the primaries and lukewarm on his prospects in the general election.\n\nTop Republicans have already signaled their break with Trump over alleged Russian cyberattacks intended to interfere with the U.S. elections. After President Obama announced sweeping sanctions against the country last week, Ryan called the response overdue but appropriate. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said the sanctions were a a good initial step and reiterated his support for a congressional investigation into the supposed interference. Senate Armed Services Chairman John McCain is planning a hearing for Thursday into the breach, with three top intelligence officials set to testify.\n\nTrump, however, has said the country should move on from the cyberattacks. During the campaign he repeatedly praised Russia and its president Vladimir Putin, casting doubt that they were behind the intrusion. He even praised Putin as very smart! after his muted response to sanctions from the Obama administration. Trump has, however, agreed to meet with U.S. intelligence officials regarding the cyber breaches this week.\n\nCongress is prepared to get a jump start on confirming Trump's Cabinet nominees as well, with hearings on some top appointees beginning next week. But many of his most important picks are controversial, particularly Secretary of State nominee Rex Tillerson. The Exxon Mobil CEO's ties to Russia and Putin have already raised concern, and he's sure to be pressed about the new sanctions as well.\n\nAlabama Sen. Jeff Sessions's nomination for attorney general could be contentious too. While sitting members typically receive deference from their peers, Democrats will draw attention to his past failure to get confirmation as a federal judge because of alleged racist remarks made in the past.\n\nAnother looming fight will be when Trump makes his pick for the Supreme Court to succeed the late Justice Antonin Scalia. President Obama's nominee Merrick Garland languished last year as Republicans declined to take up his nomination.\n\nThe process of repealing the Affordable Care Act is expected to get started this week as the Senate is expected to take up a budget measure that would begin the process of dismantling President Obama's signature domestic achievement. But it won't come quickly. Without a replacement plan on the table, some Republicans are wary of moving too quickly to dismantle the healthcare law for fear it would roil insurance markets if no fix is ready to be implemented.\n\nSoon after the members of the 115th Congress are sworn in on Tuesday, their next task will be to officially re-elect Ryan as speaker. And while there's little drama expected, there could still be defections once the voice vote is held on the House floor, particularly from hardline Trump supporters. Two years ago, then-Speaker John Boehner had 25 members of his own party vote against him. When Boehner stepped down in October 2015, only nine other Republicans voted for someone other than Ryan.\n\nRyan distanced himself from Trump just before Election Day after damaging audio emerged of Trump bragging about groping women. The two have since reconciled, but there have been signs of discord among the base. At a rally last month in Ryan's home state of Wisconsin, the speaker was booed. And while Trump quieted the dissenters, he did caution that if Ryan ever opposed him their relationship might not be so rosy any longer.\n\nHonestly, he's like a fine wine: Every day goes by, I get to appreciate his genius more and more, Trump told the Wisconsin crowd on Dec. 13. Now, if he ever goes against me, I'm not going to say that, OK?\n\nIt may have been a joke, but speaks to the strain in the most powerful relationship in Washington.
Trump Administration Move Imperils Pre-Existing Condition Protections\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Joe Raedle/Getty Images Joe Raedle/Getty Images\n\nThe Trump administration's decision to abandon the Affordable Care Act in an ongoing court challenge could affect some of the most popular pillars of the law — further intensifying the fight over health care in the middle of an election year.\n\nIt is unusual for the Justice Department to refuse to defend existing law in court challenges. In this case, 20 states sued the federal government in February claiming the individual mandate is unconstitutional after Congress zeroed out the tax penalty for not having health insurance in its 2017 tax cut law. The lawsuit, led by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, contends that without an individual mandate, the entirety of the ACA, commonly known as Obamacare, is unconstitutional.\n\nIf that argument prevails in the courts, it would render unconstitutional Obamacare provisions that ban insurance companies from denying coverage to people with pre-existing conditions — arguably the most popular component of the 2010 health care law.\n\nAs many as 130 million adults under age 65 in the U.S. have pre-existing conditions that could result in their not being able to get insurance coverage in the private market, according to the Department of Health and Human Services. The Kaiser Family Foundation puts the number at about a quarter of the country's under-65 population. A Kaiser tracking poll in June 2017 showed 70 percent of adults want Congress to keep pre-existing condition protections.\n\nBefore the Affordable Care Act became law, insurance companies routinely declined health insurance coverage to people who had ongoing medical conditions or recent illnesses. Even when insurers offered policies to those with health problems, they often excluded those illnesses. And insurance companies could cancel coverage for people who became ill once the policy year ended.\n\nThe ACA made all those practices illegal. By withdrawing from defending the law in court, the Trump administration is saying it no longer supports those consumer protections, which are popular with voters. The move could upend insurance markets for next year and change the dynamic of this fall's elections.\n\nThis suit comes as insurers are proposing individual market premiums for 2019. The lawsuit injects more uncertainty into what is already an uncertain environment for insurers. Insurers hate uncertainty, and they respond to it by hedging their bets and increasing premiums, says Larry Levitt, senior vice president at the Kaiser Family Foundation.\n\nNicholas Bagley, a professor at the University of Michigan Law School who had been a Justice Department lawyer, says DOJ's move is troubling.\n\nThe Justice Department has a long-standing, durable, bipartisan commitment to defend acts of Congress. It's a cornerstone of what they do, he says. For the Trump administration to crumple that up and throw it out the window is galling.\n\nJust hours before the Justice Department officially withdrew from the case, three of the staff attorneys who had been working on it withdrew. These are civil servants. They're not political. They are good soldiers. Their job is to defend federal programs, Bagley says, noting that he has not talked with any of them about the case. They believed they could not in good conscience, consistent with their professional obligations, sign the brief. These are people who defend programs they disagree with all the time.\n\nThe Justice Department has opted not to defend existing law in the courts in other matters. For instance, in 2012 the Obama Justice Department said it would not defend the Defense of Marriage Act, which legally defined marriage as a union between a man and a woman for federal purposes.\n\nAmerica's Health Insurance Plans, the trade association for health insurance companies, supports the pre-existing condition protections under the ACA. Removing those provisions will result in renewed uncertainty in the individual market, create a patchwork of requirements in the states, cause rates to go even higher for older Americans and sicker patients, and make it challenging to introduce products and rates for 2019, AHIP said in a statement.\n\nAHIP said it will file an amicus brief in support of the law that provides more detail about the harm that would come to millions of Americans if the request to invalidate the ACA is granted in whole or in part.\n\nOn Capitol Hill, congressional Republicans' reaction to the Trump administration's decision was muted, with many lawmakers voicing skepticism that the courts would ultimately rule against a law already upheld by the Supreme Court.\n\nWe need to let that go forward and see if it goes anywhere, said Rep. Tom MacArthur, R-N.J. I don't know if that legal logic will fly or not. MacArthur worked on legislation to continue pre-existing condition protections during the GOP's unsuccessful effort to repeal Obamacare last year.\n\nWhile the ACA has been the target of a sharply divided and partisan debate for nearly a decade, pre-existing protections are one of the most popular actions Congress has taken in modern times. I think that's a pretty essential pact with the American people, said MacArthur.\n\nHealth care is already a dominant issue in this year's elections, with voters regularly citing it as a leading determinant for how they will vote.\n\nThere is no doubt that Republicans are responsible for the rising cost of healthcare premiums and the high likelihood that many will no longer be able to afford basic care at all, and they will face serious blowback in the midterms, the House Democrats' campaign operation said in a statement.
Democrats Debate Health Care Policy\n\nVermont Sen. Bernie Sanders entered the 2020 presidential race this week as Democratic candidates engaged in their first big policy fight — centered around health care.\n\nSTEVE INSKEEP, HOST:\n\nThe entry of Bernie Sanders into the presidential race highlights a Democratic policy debate - one that Sanders himself framed four years ago. NPR's Danielle Kurtzleben reports.\n\nDANIELLE KURTZLEBEN, BYLINE: Democratic primary voters are hearing echoes from 2015.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nBERNIE SANDERS: In my view, we must move forward toward a Medicare-for-all, single-payer program.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nKURTZLEBEN: Not just because Bernie Sanders is back, but because one of his signature policies never left. Since he first ran for president, Medicare-for-all has become a mainstream Democratic proposal. Now presidential candidates are trying to figure out how to position themselves around it. New Jersey Senator Cory Booker has stressed that he thinks private insurers should still have a role.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nCORY BOOKER: Even countries that have vast access to publicly offered health care still have private health care.\n\nKURTZLEBEN: Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar says Medicare-for-all is a possibility in the long term. But for now, she wants to let people buy into Medicaid.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nAMY KLOBUCHAR: So what we need is to expand coverage so that people can have a choice for a public option. And that's a start, all right?\n\nKURTZLEBEN: Ohio Senator Sherrod Brown, who's still debating a run, also wants a sort of public option but only for people above age 50.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nSHERROD BROWN: I think Medicare-for-all will take a while, and it's difficult.\n\nKURTZLEBEN: Long story short, in a huge Democratic presidential field, health care is the first issue where candidates are really differentiating themselves. But they also face a problem. Getting into the details can turn voters off.\n\nLARRY LEVITT: Health reform is always more popular as a bumper sticker than as a piece of legislation.\n\nKURTZLEBEN: Larry Levitt is senior vice president for health reform at the Kaiser Family Foundation. This bumper sticker idea applies to any big health care overhaul, he says, whether it's Obamacare or repealing Obamacare or, now, Medicare-for-all.\n\nLEVITT: There's a huge political benefit for candidates to be in favor of the idea of Medicare-for-all in a primary. But the more the details get filled in, the less popular that idea will be.\n\nKURTZLEBEN: For example, polling shows that nearly 7 in 10 Americans like Medicare-for-all if they hear it will eliminate premiums and out-of-pocket costs. But that support drops to around 4 in 10 if people hear it will mean higher taxes. Both of those things could be true of a hypothetical Medicare-for-all system. But trying to sell the good with the bad on the campaign trail, especially this early, is tough, which is why staying broad might be a smart move, says Nadeam Elshami, former chief of staff to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.\n\nNADEAM ELSHAMI: It's OK for a candidate to say, look, this is generally what I believe in; but I'm willing to hear first, and then get into specifics later after I have a deeper discussion of this issue.\n\nKURTZLEBEN: But even this early, President Trump has used the debate over Medicare-for-all to paint Democrats as extreme. Republican strategist Michael Steel advised Jeb Bush's presidential campaign.\n\nMICHAEL STEEL: It's a surprising development that 10 years after the passage of the Affordable Care Act and after a massive political backlash against it and a huge effort to defend it, Democrats are immediately swerving so hard to an even greater government role for health care.\n\nKURTZLEBEN: For now, the debate is around health care. But a similar sort of calculation will likely underpin many more Democratic policy debates ahead of 2020, weighing sweeping, progressive ideas that the president could try to label as socialist against incremental policies that might not excite liberal voters. And deciding which choice is most likely to get a Democrat into office. Danielle Kurtzleben, NPR News, Washington.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF BEASTIE BOYS SONG B FOR MY NAME)\n\nCopyright © 2019 NPR.

Decades In The Senate, McConnell Learns To Play 'The Long Game'\n\nMitch McConnell has been a U.S. senator since 1984. The Long Game is the behind-the-scenes memoir of a man famous for his discretion. Steve Inskeep talks to McConnell about the Senate and his book.\n\nDAVID GREENE, HOST:\n\nSenator Mitch McConnell was voted into office the same year that President Ronald Reagan was re-elected. The senator from Kentucky was the only Republican Senate challenger to win a seat in 1984. He's been in the U.S. Senate ever since. Our colleague Steve Inskeep spoke with McConnell about his decades in the Senate and his role as Senate majority leader.\n\nSTEVE INSKEEP, BYLINE: How would you describe your leadership style?\n\nMITCH MCCONNELL: What I have said is - when the American people elect divided government, what are they saying? I think they're saying we know you have differences of opinion on big things. But why don't you look for the things you can agree on and do those? And that has been the way I have run this new majority.\n\nFirst of all, we're voting again. You would think that'd be pretty simple. But in the last year of the old majority, there were only 15 roll call votes on amendments the whole year. We had over 200 last year. For 4 of the last 5 years, they didn't pass a budget. We did that. And then I focused on things that enjoyed broad bipartisan support. And we've had a very productive year and a half.\n\nINSKEEP: So when I think over time of your leadership style, Senator, it seems to me that you do something that feels, from the outside, rather intricate. You will sometimes say quite fierce partisan things because that is what the situation demands, while quietly, perhaps in private, trying to work some practical way forward. Is that the way you see yourself?\n\nMCCONNELL: Well, it depends on the issue. You know, the three biggest bipartisan deals that have been made during the Obama years, the vice president and I negotiated. We did the two-year extension of Bush tax cuts in 2010. We negotiated the Budget Control Act in August of 2011 and the fiscal cliff deal at the end of 2012, which saved 99 percent of Americans from a tax increase.\n\nSo, you know, there have been occasions where acting was essential. And so I - I've been open to reaching agreement with the Democrats where it doesn't violate any deeply held positions that Republicans almost always advocate.\n\nINSKEEP: In this book, you write that you don't like the label obstructionist. You would rather say that you have a duty to block things when they aren't any good. How do you know the difference?\n\nMCCONNELL: Well, I think you have to have a sense of what you believe in and what you think's important for the country. And I have a right of center philosophy, as most conservatives do, about what's the appropriate way forward for the country. And we were elected as well. I mean, people talk about the president being elected. Well, we were, too.\n\nSo I think you have to decide what things you can agree on. And then are other things that we're just going to differ on. For example, the most conspicuous example has been Obamacare, which was done on a purely partisan basis and upon which all Republicans and all Democrats seem to disagree.\n\nINSKEEP: You've got a chapter in his book called Professor Obama. And I think it is not misstating it to say that you make it clear you don't like him very much.\n\nMCCONNELL: I think that is misstating it. I don't dislike the president. What I do find grating is the tendency to kind of try to tell you what you think to your face (laughter). And on a couple of occasions, I've said look, Mr. President - I know what I think. You know, Professor Obama has been a label applied to him by Republicans and Democrats alike. He's a very smart guy. But I think he'd be, you know, better served not to spend so much time trying to impress us with his particular position on an issue and understand that there are things upon which we simply have a disagreement.\n\nINSKEEP: In the years that you both have been at the top of government - granted you're in different parties, but supposed to be working in the same government - has the president ever asked your advice?\n\nMCCONNELL: Not that I can recall.\n\nINSKEEP: There's never been an occasion where he said, Senator, you know the Senate really well. You know we have to do something here. How would you do it?\n\nMCCONNELL: The thing we worked the closest together on, which was almost an out of-body experience, was Trade Promotion Authority, a situation where both Harry Reid and Nancy Pelosi...\n\nINSKEEP: Democratic leaders and Congress...\n\nMCCONNELL: ...Yeah, were against what the president was trying to achieve. We did have a lot of interaction on that. And his job was to produce enough Democrats to pass it, which he barely did. But that was an important accomplishment, not just for him, but for the next president as well because Trade Promotion Authority will still be there for the next president as well.\n\nINSKEEP: Have you ever asked his advice?\n\nMCCONNELL: Not that I can recall.\n\nINSKEEP: So not much of a - just, it doesn't sound like there's an awful lot of...\n\nMCCONNELL: Why would I want to - with all due respect to your question, I think I have a pretty clear view of the direction I'd like to see the country go. He has a pretty clear view of the direction he'd like to see the country go. When we can find areas of agreement, we discuss them.\n\nINSKEEP: When you talk about your idea of which direction the country should go, how much does your viewpoint on the country grow out of your upbringing in Alabama, later in Kentucky, some other places?\n\nMCCONNELL: Well, I began, I think, early in life to identify with Republicans because my father, who had fought in World War II, decided to vote for Eisenhower. We lived in Alabama. You know, this was pretty unusual (laughter).\n\nINSKEEP: This is a time when Democrats dominated the South, sure.\n\nMCCONNELL: Totally Democratic in the South. The Republican Party was still viewed in that era as the party of the North. So in my little fifth grade photograph out of school, I had an I like Ike button on my (laughter) - on my shirt. And I think I began to identify, like I guess most kids would, with a party your dad was sympathetic toward. And I began to get interested in politics myself. I ran for president of the student council at my high school in Louisville. And ran against a guy who I thought was better known and little bit better student and managed to win. And so one thing led to another.\n\nINSKEEP: Managed to win, I think, doesn't tell enough of the story. You describe how you went about winning. What did you do?\n\nMCCONNELL: Well, you know, I was trying to figure out how to beat a guy who was better known and a better student than me. And I remember my dad and I having a discussion about - he said - well, who are the best-known people in the the school? I said, well, it's the cheerleaders and the athletes. He said well, why don't you get them to support you?\n\n(Laughter) I went and did and asked them. And we made up a pamphlet that said join us in voting for Mitch McConnell for president. And it listed their names and what they did - football, basketball, cheerleaders. It worked. And so I learned the importance of endorsements and a lot of other...\n\nINSKEEP: (Laughter) It sounds like an endorsements meant more then than perhaps they mean in politics today.\n\nMCCONNELL: Yeah, I think today they're probably not worth a whole lot. But in those days, in that high school, at that time, it was a smart strategy. And I learned early on that running the best campaign gives you the best chance of winning.\n\nINSKEEP: Senator McConnell, it's been a pleasure talking with you.\n\nMCCONNELL: Thank you.\n\nAILSA CHANG, HOST:\n\nSenator Mitch McConnell is the author of a new memoir called The Long Game.\n\nCopyright © 2016 NPR.

10 Years Of The Affordable Care Act\n\nTen years ago, President Barack Obama signed the Affordable Care Act into law. Kaiser Health News reporter Julie Rovner speaks with NPR's Ari Shapiro about its impact and how COVID-19 may affect it.\n\nARI SHAPIRO, HOST:\n\nThis was the scene at the White House 10 years ago today.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nPRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: Today after almost a century of trying, today after over a year of debate, today after all the votes have been tallied, health insurance reform becomes law in the United States of America.\n\nSHAPIRO: That was President Barack Obama signing the Affordable Care Act into law. Julie Rovner covered the law's passage and implementation for NPR back then, and she is now at our partner Kaiser Health News. She's with us to talk about how the ACA has changed health care in the past decade and also how the current coronavirus pandemic might change the Affordable Care Act.\n\nHi, Julie.\n\nJULIE ROVNER: Hi, Ari. Thanks for having me.\n\nSHAPIRO: So much of the Affordable Care Act is about access to health insurance. Is it making a difference in this coronavirus outbreak?\n\nROVNER: Well, it is, although not in the way you might think. The health law was mostly about health insurance. Around 20 million more people have insurance than had it before the law was passed, and that insurance means that doctors and hospitals and clinics have all gotten paid over the past several years that might not have otherwise if those people had remained uninsured. It's kept some hospitals open that otherwise would have closed. Meanwhile, other parts of the law shored up other parts of the health care system, particularly things like making preventive care more available and boosting the supply of health professionals. So I think it's safe to say that while the health system is not ready to weather the coming storm if things get really, really bad, it would have been so much worse if not for the Affordable Care Act.\n\nSHAPIRO: Remind us what the health care system looked like before this law passed. What were the biggest problems?\n\nROVNER: Well, there were two big problems. Health care costs too much, which it still does, although for other reasons. And too many people didn't have - and many of them couldn't get - health insurance. For example, back in 2008, I spoke to Barb Fleming. She's a self-employed saleswoman from Missouri with individual insurance who was diagnosed with breast cancer. Her insurer wouldn't renew her policy because it didn't have to. And while she was able to get into her state's high-risk pool, that coverage wasn't very helpful.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)\n\nBARB FLEMING: I was approved for the pool as of March 4, which is the day I needed insurance, but it would not cover my cancer. So I was going to be paying $908 a month for an insurance - and I have been - that was not covering the cancer.\n\nSHAPIRO: Wow.\n\nROVNER: So the Affordable Care Act did solve that problem by requiring that insurance cover pre-existing conditions. It also did other things to boost coverage, like outlawing lifetime dollar limits on medical care and letting parents keep adult children on their health plans until they reach age 26.\n\nSHAPIRO: So by late 2009, the first year of the Obama presidency, Democrats had a large majority in the house. They had 60 votes in the Senate. Those numbers suggest that it might have been easy for them to pass this law, but it wasn't. Why not?\n\nROVNER: Well, Democrats, as well as Republicans, have long had internal splits over what to do about health care. And while a lot of the groundwork was laid for this law even before President Obama was elected, Democrats still argued over big issues like whether to include a public health plan people could sign up for. That's the so-called public option. And the issue that almost derailed the bill several times - abortion. The goal of the sponsors was to make the law what they called abortion-neutral - so to neither expand or contract abortion rights. But actually writing that goal into the legislation turned out to be incredibly difficult.\n\nSHAPIRO: OK. So the law passes, and President Obama signs it on March 23, 2010. And it seems like since then, it has been having constant near-death experiences.\n\nROVNER: Yes, that is absolutely true. The law has been on the edge of elimination several times. The first big threat was a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of the requirement for most Americans to either have insurance or pay a fine, the so-called individual mandate, that went to the Supreme Court in 2012. And to the surprise of many, it was upheld with the pivotal vote of Chief Justice John Roberts. Here was President Obama on that June day.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nOBAMA: The highest court in the land has now spoken. We will continue to implement this law, and we'll work together to improve on it where we can. But what we won't do, what the country can't afford to do, is refight the political battles of two years ago.\n\nROVNER: Well, of course, that's not what happened.\n\nSHAPIRO: Right.\n\nROVNER: Most Republican governors refused to cooperate in their states. They didn't set up their own insurance marketplaces. They wouldn't do any marketing so people could know that insurance was available and affordable. They could get subsidies if they signed up. But most critically, at least in the first years, most of them didn't expand the Medicaid program for people with low incomes, which the Supreme Court ruling had made optional. So even right now in some really big states like Texas and Florida, there are millions of people who were supposed to be able to get Medicaid coverage under the law but instead are still uninsured.\n\nSHAPIRO: So in 2016, Donald Trump runs for president, and he promises to get rid of the Affordable Care Act.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Obamacare has to be repealed and replaced, and it has to be replaced with something much less expensive for the people. And otherwise, this country is in even bigger trouble than anybody thought.\n\nSHAPIRO: It was not repealed and replaced, but the Trump administration did weaken the law. So how strong is the Affordable Care Act today?\n\nROVNER: Well, it has weathered an awful lot of storms. And there's yet another lawsuit that the Supreme Court will hear in the next term that could again get the entire law struck down. It was brought by a group of Republican state attorneys general. Ironically, the Trump administration is supporting that lawsuit even as the Affordable Care Act is being used right now to lessen the impact of the coronavirus crisis.\n\nSHAPIRO: OK, so let's talk a little bit more about the relationship between the ACA and coronavirus. I mean, you've mentioned that millions more people have health insurance now than otherwise would. How else is the ACA being used to fight this outbreak?\n\nROVNER: Well, at least nine states have reopened their Affordable Care Act marketplaces to help enroll people who didn't sign up for insurance and now think they might want it. I should point out that if you lose your job and your health insurance, you're automatically entitled to sign up for coverage mid-year under the law. Meanwhile, California announced Friday that its exchange, which had been open for reasons unrelated to the outbreak, will continue to allow residents to enroll through June because of the upheaval caused by the coronavirus. The Trump administration could choose to reopen enrollment nationwide if it wanted to, and there are reports it's considering doing just that.\n\nSHAPIRO: You know, the health system is under such duress right now. What does the future of the Affordable Care Act look like in light of what the health system is going through with the coronavirus outbreak?\n\nROVNER: Well, as I mentioned earlier, despite its name, the Affordable Care Act did a lot more to fix problems with insurance coverage than it did to actually make health care affordable. Ten years later, people are still complaining about premiums and co-pays and surprise medical bills. People still declare bankruptcy because of medical bills. And most significantly for this crisis, many people with insurance say they still avoid seeking medical care because they worry about what it might cost. And public health experts say that's a big problem and one you're not seeing in most of the other countries dealing with the crisis at the same time. What you don't want is Americans with coronavirus not getting tested or seeking care if they should and then spreading the virus to others.\n\nI think there are also going to be long-term political ramifications to this crisis. I'm already hearing the I-told-you-sos from advocates for a single-payer system, the Medicare for All proponents. People are asking why we can't have faster and better testing like South Korea, and one reason is that they have a single, streamlined national health system compared to our fragmented non-system. So I think when this is all over, Americans and public officials are going to have a very different attitude about our health care system and what it should do and who should pay for it. And I think it really could change the debate very profoundly.\n\nSHAPIRO: That is Julie Rovner, a familiar voice to NPR listeners. She is now chief Washington correspondent at Kaiser Health News.\n\nIt's great to talk to you again, Julie. Thanks.\n\nROVNER: Thank you.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARVO TO ME'S MND WRKS)\n\nCopyright © 2020 NPR. All rights reserved.

Each of our players will have 60 seconds in which to answer as many fill-in-the-blank questions as they can. Each correct answer now worth two points. Bill, can you give us the scores?\n\nBILL KURTIS: I sure can. Peter has two. Roxanne and Roy each have three.\n\nSAGAL: All right.\n\nSAGAL: So that means Peter is in third place.

And when police attempted to arrest him, he gave the cops a fake name. That probably would have worked if Bushman did not have his full name tattooed in giant letters on his neck. It also didn't help that he was also wearing a nametag from a recent forgers convention...\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nSAGAL: ...That said, hello, my name is guilty.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nSAGAL: Bill, how did Peter do on our quiz?\n\nKURTIS: Real good - six right, 12 more points, total of 14.

One of those...\n\nSAGAL: No.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nSAGAL: They had students - during this test to keep them from cheating, they had students wear cardboard boxes on their heads. A recent picture showed university students taking an exam while wearing these cardboard boxes with small cut out eye holes presumably to keep students from looking to their left or right and cheating off the person next to them. Or maybe just every student had ended up with a bad Halloween costume. The school has since apologized for doing this to their students.

Beyond 'Bumper Sticker' Slogans: 2020 Democrats Debate Details Of Medicare-For-All\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Justin Sullivan/Getty Images Justin Sullivan/Getty Images\n\nBernie Sanders is back, but one of his signature policies never left.\n\nIn 2015, he introduced Medicare-for-all to many Democrats for the first time. Since Sanders' first run for president, that type of single-payer health care system has become a mainstream Democratic proposal.\n\nLast week, Sanders launched his second presidential campaign, amid a field of presidential candidates who are trying to figure out how to position themselves around the policy. Trying to stand out from the pack, though — especially on health care — poses a problem: Differentiating yourself means getting into the details, and getting into the details can turn voters off.\n\nOver the last few weeks, candidates have been working to show voters the daylight between their respective health care proposals.\n\nNew Jersey Sen. Cory Booker has stressed that he supports Medicare-for-all, and that he wants private insurers to have a role in that system. Even countries that have vast access to publicly offered health care still have private health care, he told reporters this month.\n\nMinnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar says she wants a public option, in the form of letting people buy into Medicaid. As for single-payer health care, she says it's a possibility in the long-term.\n\nOhio Sen. Sherrod Brown, who says he's still debating a run, also wants a sort of public option, but only for people above age 50, whom he would allow to buy in to Medicare. I think Medicare-for-all will take a while, and it's difficult, he told CNN's State of the Union.\n\nLong story short: In a huge Democratic presidential field, health care is the first issue where candidates are really differentiating themselves.\n\nBumper sticker politics\n\nHealth reform is always more popular as a bumper sticker than as a piece of legislation, said Larry Levitt, senior vice president for health reform at the Kaiser Family Foundation.\n\nHe points to both the Obamacare and the Obamacare repeal efforts as examples — some ideas behind Obamacare, like insuring pre-existing conditions, were popular. But other aspects that proponents said were necessary to make it work, like the individual mandate, infuriated some voters, helping propel Republicans to big wins in 2010.\n\nLikewise, the Obamacare repeal effort fired up many Republican voters, but the implications of the various repeal plans — fewer people with insurance, lack of protections for pre-existing conditions — ultimately helped doom the effort.\n\nMedicare-for-all may prove to be yet another example of this trend, according to Levitt.\n\nThere's a huge political benefit for candidates to be in favor of the idea of Medicare-for-all in a primary, he said. But the more the details get filled in, the less popular that idea will be.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption JIM WATSON/AFP/Getty Images JIM WATSON/AFP/Getty Images\n\nCalifornia Sen. Kamala Harris may be the first to face a big lesson in this. At a recent CNN town hall, host Jake Tapper asked her about her support of Sanders' Medicare-for-all bill, which he said would totally eliminate private insurance.\n\n(A quick note here: Sanders' plan does not totally eliminate private insurance, but it would vastly diminish its role.)\n\nHarris said that she would eliminate private insurance — but after a quick backlash, the next day clarified, with a campaign spokesman saying she also supports more incremental health care overhauls.\n\nPolling also shows how tricky selling Medicare-for-all could be once the details come into play. A January poll from Kaiser shows that nearly 7 in 10 Americans like Medicare-for-all if they hear it will eliminate premiums and out-of-pocket costs. But that support drops to around 4 in 10 if people hear it will mean higher taxes.\n\nBoth of those things could be true of a Medicare-for-all system. But trying to sell even this basic trade-off on the campaign trail — especially this early — is tough.\n\nAt the other, more moderate end of the spectrum, Klobuchar said she's for the broad goal of universal health care, and did get specific on her support of a public option. But when it comes to Medicare-for-all, she remained vague, saying it could be a possibility. Voters will almost certainly try to pin her down more on that in coming months, but for now her answer may help keep her from alienating some more liberal voters.\n\nFor many candidates, keeping health care rhetoric broad might be a smart move for now, says Nadeam Elshami, former chief of staff to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.\n\nIt's okay for a candidate to say, 'Look: This is generally what I believe in. But I'm willing to hear first and then get into specifics later, after I have a deeper discussion of this issue,' he said.\n\nThe socialist threat\n\nProgressive health care overhauls will also likely feed into one of President Trump's main attack lines: labeling Democrats as socialists as a way of painting them as extreme.\n\nIt's a surprising development that 10 years after the passage of the Affordable Care Act and after a massive political backlash against it, and a huge effort to defend it, Democrats are in there immediately swerving so hard to an even greater government role for health care, said Michael Steel, a Republican strategist who worked for former House Speaker John Boehner and Jeb Bush's 2016 campaign.\n\nRepublicans know political backlash well — the backlash to their repeal efforts culminated in the GOP losing the House in 2018. Whatever criticism Trump throws Democrats' way on health care for 2020, they will likely counter by asking him if he has his own alternative to Obamacare, having failed to fully repeal it.\n\nUntil then, Democrats will be doing similar calculations on both health care and a variety of other issues: weighing sweeping, progressive ideas that the president could try to label as socialist against incremental policies that might not excite liberal voters — and deciding which choice is most likely to get a Democrat into office.\n\nVoters want sweeping health care changes ...maybe\n\nA basic tension underlies Democratic plans to overhauls the health care system: Only 1 in 3 Americans rate health care in the U.S. as excellent or good, according to Gallup. But at the same time, a large majority — 7 in 10 — view their own personal health care as excellent or good.\n\nWhich is to say, it's easy to see how voters might want the system massively reformed. In addition, incremental changes that don't go as far as Medicare-for-all might particularly infuriate progressive voters.\n\nBut at the same time, voters will likely bristle if that reform threatens to change their own health coverage, as some major health care overhauls, like Medicare-for-all, might do.\n\nThere is a reason that President Obama's signature promise on Obamacare was 'If you like your plan, you can keep it,' Steel said.\n\nThat promise proved untrue — some Americans saw their health care plans canceled under the new Obamacare rules, and Politifact named Obama's statement the lie of the year in 2013.\n\nShould a Democratic candidate's health care proposal similarly threaten people's current health plans, it's a safe bet that it will become a major Republican line of attack.
Biden Wants To Lower Medicare Eligibility Age To 60, But Hospitals Push Back\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Joe Raedle/Getty Images Joe Raedle/Getty Images\n\nOf his many plans to expand insurance coverage, President-elect Joe Biden's simplest strategy is lowering the eligibility age for Medicare from 65 to 60.\n\nBut the plan is sure to face long odds, even if the Democrats can snag control of the Senate in January by winning two runoff elections in Georgia.\n\nRepublicans, who fought the creation of Medicare in the 1960s and typically oppose expanding government entitlement programs, are not the biggest obstacle. Instead, the nation's hospitals — a powerful political force — are poised to derail any effort. Hospitals fear adding millions of people to Medicare will cost them billions of dollars in revenue.\n\nHospitals certainly are not going to be happy with it, said Jonathan Oberlander, professor of health policy and management at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.\n\nMedicare reimbursement rates for patients admitted to hospitals are on average half what commercial or employer-sponsored insurance plans pay.\n\nIt will be a huge lift [in Congress] as the realities of lower Medicare reimbursement rates will activate some powerful interests against this, said Josh Archambault, a senior fellow with the conservative Foundation for Government Accountability.\n\nBiden, who turns 78 this month, said his plan will help Americans who retire early and those who are unemployed or can't find jobs with health benefits.\n\nIt reflects the reality that, even after the current crisis ends, older Americans are likely to find it difficult to secure jobs, Biden wrote in April.\n\nLowering the Medicare eligibility age is popular. About 85% of Democrats and 69% of Republicans favor allowing those as young as 50 to buy into Medicare, according to a Kaiser Family Foundation tracking poll from January 2019. (Kaiser Health News is an editorially independent program of the Kaiser Family Foundation.)\n\nAlthough opposition from the hospital industry is expected to be fierce, it is not the only obstacle to Biden's plan.\n\nCritics, especially Republicans on Capitol Hill, will point to the nation's $3 trillion budget deficit as well as the dim outlook for the Medicare Hospital Insurance Trust Fund. That fund is on track to reach insolvency in 2024. That means there won't be enough money to pay hospitals and nursing homes fully for inpatient care for Medicare beneficiaries.\n\nIt's also unclear whether expanding Medicare will fit on the Democrats' crowded health agenda, which includes dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic, possibly rescuing the Affordable Care Act (if the Supreme Court strikes down part or all of the law in a current case), expanding Obamacare subsidies and lowering drug costs.\n\nBiden's proposal is a nod to the liberal wing of the Democratic Party, which has advocated for Sen. Bernie Sanders' government-run Medicare for All health system that would provide universal coverage. Biden opposed that effort, saying the nation could not afford it. He wanted to retain the private health insurance system, which covers 180 million people.\n\nTo expand coverage, Biden has proposed two major initiatives. In addition to the Medicare eligibility change, he wants Congress to approve a government-run health plan that people could buy into instead of purchasing coverage from insurance companies on their own or through the Obamacare marketplaces. Insurers helped beat back this public option initiative in 2009 during the congressional debate over the ACA.\n\nThe appeal of lowering Medicare eligibility to help those without insurance lies with leveraging a popular government program that has low administrative costs.\n\nIt is hard to find a reform idea that is more popular than opening up Medicare to people as young as 60, Oberlander said. He said early retirees would like the concept, as would employers, who could save on their health costs as workers gravitate to Medicare.\n\nThe eligibility age has been set at 65 since Medicare was created in 1965 as part of President Lyndon Johnson's Great Society reform package. It was designed to coincide with the age when people at that time qualified for Social Security. Today, people generally qualify for early, reduced Social Security benefits at age 62, but full benefits depend on the year you were born, ranging from age 66 to 67.\n\nWhile people can qualify on the basis of other criteria, such as having a disability or end-stage renal disease, 85% of the 57 million Medicare enrollees are in the program simply because they're old enough.\n\nLowering the age to 60 could add as many as 23 million people to Medicare, according to an analysis by the consulting firm Avalere Health. It's unclear, however, if everyone who would be eligible would sign up or if Biden would limit the expansion to the 1.7 million people in that age range who are uninsured and the 3.2 million who buy coverage on their own.\n\nAvalere says 3.2 million people in that age group buy coverage on the individual market.\n\nWhile the 60-to-65 group has the lowest uninsured rate (8%) among adults, it has the highest health costs and pays the highest rates for individual coverage, said Cristina Boccuti, director of health policy at West Health, a nonpartisan research group.\n\nAbout 13 million of those between 60 and 65 have coverage through their employer, according to Avalere. While they would not have to drop coverage to join Medicare, they could possibly opt to pay to join the federal program and use it as a wraparound for their existing coverage. Medicare might then pick up costs for some services that the consumers would have to shoulder out of pocket.\n\nSome 4 million people between 60 and 65 are enrolled in Medicaid, the state-federal health insurance program for low-income people. Shifting them to Medicare would make that their primary health insurer, a move that would save states money since they split Medicaid costs with the federal government.\n\nChris Pope, a senior fellow with the conservative Manhattan Institute, said getting health industry support, particularly from hospitals, will be vital for any health coverage expansion. Hospitals are very aware about generous commercial rates being replaced by lower Medicare rates, he said.\n\nMembers of Congress, a lot of them are close to their hospitals and do not want to see them with a revenue hole, he said.\n\nPresident Barack Obama made a deal with the industry on the way to passing the ACA. In exchange for gaining millions of paying customers and lowering their uncompensated care by billions of dollars, the hospital industry agreed to give up future Medicare funds designed to help them cope with the uninsured. Showing the industry's prowess on Capitol Hill, Congress has delayed those funding cuts for more than six years.\n\nJacob Hacker, a Yale University political scientist, noted that expanding Medicare would reduce the number of Americans who rely on employer-sponsored coverage. The pitfalls of the employer system were highlighted in 2020 as millions lost their jobs and their workplace health coverage.\n\nEven if they can win the two Georgia seats and take control of the Senate with the vice president breaking any ties, Democrats would be unlikely to pass major legislation without GOP support — unless they are willing to jettison the long-standing filibuster rule so they can pass most legislation with a simple 51-vote majority instead of 60 votes.\n\nHacker said that slim margin would make it difficult for Democrats to deal with many health issues all at once.\n\nCongress is not good at parallel processing, Hacker said, referring to handling multiple priorities at the same time. And the window is relatively short.\n\nKHN (Kaiser Health News) is a nonprofit news service covering health issues.

Joe Biden Gets Boost With Endorsement Of Influential South Carolina Democrat\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Drew Angerer/Getty Images Drew Angerer/Getty Images\n\nUpdated at 12:30 p.m.\n\nHouse Majority Whip James Clyburn offered an emotional presidential endorsement of Joe Biden on Wednesday, just three days ahead of South Carolina's Democratic primary — a contest that could be make-or-break for the former vice president's campaign.\n\nI've known for a long time who I was going to vote for. I'm voting for Joe Biden. South Carolinians should be voting for Joe Biden, Clyburn said at an event in North Charleston.\n\nWe know Joe, the South Carolina Democrat said in a video put out by the Biden campaign. But more importantly, he knows us.\n\nClyburn also referenced his late wife in speaking of the former vice president.\n\nWe often talked about the leadership of this country, and there is nobody who Emily loved as a leader in this country more than she loved Joe Biden, he said at the North Charleston event.\n\nClyburn, 79, is one of the most popular and influential African American politicians in the state. With long-established ties to Biden, his support does not come as a surprise but rather suggests Biden needs all the help he can get to shore up support from black voters, who make up nearly two-thirds of the Democratic electorate in South Carolina.\n\nBiden's campaign is betting heavily on a South Carolina victory to carry him through to victories in the March 3 Super Tuesday contests. His performance so far in the early contests has been lackluster: fourth place in Iowa; fifth place in New Hampshire; and a distant second place in Nevada.\n\nDuring Tuesday night's debate in Charleston, Biden confidently declared: I will win South Carolina. When pressed whether he would continue his campaign if he doesn't come in first in the state's primary, Biden repeated his prediction he would win.\n\nBiden joined Clyburn at the Wednesday event and praised him as a extraordinary leader and said his reputation extends beyond South Carolina. Jim has a voice of powerful, powerful moral clarity.\n\nWithout mentioning Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, the front-runner in the primary, Biden said there is talk about revolution but he argued, what the country is looking for is results and cited his role in passing Obamacare.\n\nVirtually all polling in South Carolina has Biden leading, but his once seemingly insurmountable double-digit lead has eroded to single digits in the closing weeks of the race. The latest CBS News/You Gov poll has Biden leading the field with 51%, followed closely by Sanders with 44%.\n\nAn emotional Clyburn said he was fearful about the state of the country and pointed to Biden as the candidate to lead the party. I know his heart, I know who he is, I know what he is. This country is at an inflection point.\n\nNPR's Juana Summers and Asma Khalid contributed to this story.
Debate Exposes Fault Lines In The Democratic Field Of Presidential Hopefuls\n\nMICHEL MARTIN, HOST:\n\nWe're going to revisit the two Democratic debates held earlier this week, where 20 people hoping to challenge President Trump met over the course of two nights. By now, you've probably heard a lot of hot takes on who won and who lost and who had a breakout moment and who didn't. Instead, we're going to do what we did after the last set of debates. We're going to dig into some of the policy differences that emerged.\n\nWe decided to do that because even though the candidates only had a few minutes - really, a minute or two on each topic - that minute or two did allow the candidates to point up some real differences on issues like health care and climate policy as well as bigger questions about how Democrats should approach the quest for the presidency, like should they put up visionary ideas and try to create momentum behind them? Or should they stick to more modest goals to try to hold the middle, as it were? Of course, we aren't going to be able to get to every issue that came up or that is important, but we're going to start with health care.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nBERNIE SANDERS: Under Medicare for All, the hospitals will save substantial sums of money because they're not going to be spending a fortune doing billing and the other bureaucratic things that they have to do today. Second of all...\n\nJOHN DELANEY: It doesn't add up.\n\nSANDERS: Maybe you'll do that and make money off of health care, but our job is to run a non-profit health care system.\n\n(CHEERING)\n\nMARTIN: Of course, that was Senator Bernie Sanders and former Congressman John Delaney talking about health care. Here to tell us more is Shefali Luthra. She is a correspondent for Kaiser Health News.\n\nShefali, welcome back. Thanks for joining us once again.\n\nSHEFALI LUTHRA: Thanks for having me.\n\nMARTIN: So this time around, the candidates seemed to articulate some distinct proposals on health care - Medicare for All, improve on the Affordable Care Act or Obamacare or add a public option. Can you break those down for us?\n\nLUTHRA: Certainly. So this is a really interesting sort of natural development in how we think about ways to expand access to health care. And you could break this down into the Medicare for All single-payer plan that Bernie Sanders has put forward that's now also backed by Elizabeth Warren in which everyone would get their health care from this one, big government program.\n\nThey would call it Medicare. It looks very different from Medicare as we know it, right? It would cover dental. It would cover prescription drugs. It would cover vision. Basically, everything that you can think of would be taken care of. You would pay nothing at the point of service, so when you go to the doctor, no copay. It would eliminate private insurance. They say that would make it more efficient.\n\nThen you have someone like former Vice President Joe Biden, who says he wants to add to the Affordable Care Act, create what's called a public option in which if you don't have access to health care, you can buy into a government program. He would also add some other consumer protections here and there and try and put a cap on how much we pay out-of-pocket for health care.\n\nThen you also have plans from folks like Kamala Harris, who has said that she backs Medicare for All but has been sort of trying to thread the needle on maintaining a private insurance option. And she rolled out a plan just this past week looking at the idea of expanding Medicare to everyone but giving the option of either getting it from this government program or letting private insurance companies contract with the government. And she says that she would put stricter standards on those companies than exist today said that you have better plans but you have choice.\n\nMARTIN: Is what we heard earlier this week, though, at the debates - was this a clearer articulation of positions that the candidates have put forward already? Or did they offer us some new ideas to consider?\n\nLUTHRA: We're definitely hearing new ideas. Kamala Harris hadn't put out a plan before. And the idea of Medicare for All that maintains Medicare Advantage, which is what we call it when Medicare contracts with these private insurance plans - no one has really talked about a plan in that form. This is very new. Vice President Biden hadn't put out his own health reform plan by the previous debate. Now he has. And it is very different from either the single-payer or Medicare for All-esque (ph) plans that we're talking about. It would certainly expand coverage. It would certainly be far too radical compared to what was passed in the Affordable Care Act. It would also leave, you know, more people uninsured than those other ones. But it would cost less.\n\nMARTIN: And where are the voters on this? Are they intrigued by the idea of a single-payer system? Are they afraid of it? What do we know?\n\nLUTHRA: This is a really complicated question. On the one hand, Medicare for All as a phrase pulls really well. When you tell people they might lose access to private insurance, support drops. When you tell them you might lose private insurance, but you could still keep your doctor, support goes up. It really depends on how you frame it. And this is one area where it seems that voter opinion could be quite malleable going forward.\n\nMARTIN: That is Shefali Luthra. She's a correspondent for Kaiser Health News.\n\nShefali, thank you so much for clearing this up for us once again.\n\nLUTHRA: Thanks for having me.\n\nMARTIN: And now to climate policy.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nJAY INSLEE: The science tells us we have to get off coal in 10 years.\n\nJOE BIDEN: Yes.\n\nINSLEE: Your plan does not do that. We have to have off of fossil fuels in our electrical grid in 15. Your plan simply does not do that. I've heard you say that we need a realistic plan. Here's what I...\n\nBIDEN: No, I didn't say that.\n\nINSLEE: Here's what I believe. I believe that survival is realistic, and that's the kind of plan we need. And that's the kind I have.\n\nMARTIN: That was Washington Governor Jay Inslee in an exchange with former Vice President Joe Biden. We wanted to hear more about how the candidates are distinguishing themselves with their plans to address the changing climate, so we've called reporter Dino Grandoni. He covers energy and environmental policy for the Washington Post, and he's with us now.\n\nWelcome. Thank you so much for joining us.\n\nDINO GRANDONI: Thank you.\n\nMARTIN: So, Dino, how would you say the candidates distinguish themselves on this issue? Did you see some sort of center of gravity emerging there, or...\n\nGRANDONI: So one of the ways the candidates tried to distinguish themselves was over the date by which they want the country to get off of fossil fuels. You have Governor Jay Inslee from Washington wanting to get off fossil fuels, coal, oil, natural gas by the end of this next decade, 2030, whereas Joe Biden's plan calls for the U.S. to get off of that by the middle of the century, 2050.\n\nMARTIN: So the differences between Democratic candidates on a number of issues this year are being framed as a tension between progressives and moderates, and some people see this as - you know, as a generational divide. So is there a similar divide here between people who are seen as bolder or more hawkish and people who are seen as, say, more moderate in their approach?\n\nGRANDONI: Yeah. There's a divide between the so-called progressives or the left wing of the party and the moderates and Democrats agree that we need to get off of fossil fuels in general, but they disagree over how quickly the nation needs to do that.\n\nMARTIN: Is there any through-line to who takes which position? I mean, is it people who live on the coasts tend to take one position, people who come from other places tend not to be as aggressive in their approach? Or is it just a matter of what you happen to believe?\n\nGRANDONI: There is some regional divide here. You have some people in the moderate camp when it comes to climate change from the center of the country, places like Colorado or Montana that have coal and oil natural gas resources. So in that category, you have Governor Steve Bullock from Montana and former Governor John Hickenlooper from Colorado as well as Senator Michael Bennet from Colorado. This makes up that kind of moderate section of the Democratic Party when it comes to climate change - and other issues - where they want the country to move more towards renewable resources, but they want oil and natural gas to play some sort of role in the energy mix in the foreseeable future.\n\nMARTIN: Do we have a sense of where voters are on these issues?\n\nGRANDONI: So traditionally, environmental issues in general and climate change in particular have not been high-priority issues among Democrats. However, some of the early polling you see, including one poll that's gotten a lot of attention from CNN, indicates that Democratic voters are more concerned about climate change than they've ever been. The CNN poll I'm referring to had it as the number one issue among Democrats, which is much different than we've seen in past Democratic primaries. The real issue is going to be whether in the general election the entire voting base is going to be as interested in seeing candidates move aggressively on climate change.\n\nMARTIN: That's Dino Grandoni. He covers energy and environmental policy for The Washington Post.\n\nDino, thanks so much for talking to us.\n\nGRANDONI: Thank you so much.\n\nMARTIN: And finally, we want to talk about what you might call the philosophical divide on the stage at this week's debates.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nELIZABETH WARREN: You know, I don't understand why anybody goes to all the trouble of running for president of the United States just to talk about what we really can't do and shouldn't fight for.\n\n(CHEERING)\n\nMARTIN: That, of course, was Senator Elizabeth Warren, and it is representative of what you hear political strategists talking about behind the scenes, and that is whether it's better to go big and bold and inspire progressives or try to appeal to the Trump voters - to keep an eye on the general election. In other words, keep it practical. Here to talk about that is Domenico Montanaro, NPR's lead political editor.\n\nHi, Domenico. Welcome back.\n\nDOMENICO MONTANARO, BYLINE: Hey, Michel. Thanks for having me.\n\nMARTIN: Well, you know, I've framed it a certain way. How would you frame that difference of opinion that we saw playing out on the stage?\n\nMONTANARO: Well, you know, loosely, I think it is the progressives versus the pragmatists - you know, the pragmatists being the types of people like former Vice President Biden, to a lesser extent obviously someone like former Congressman John Delaney, who we heard that big back-and-forth with Senator Elizabeth Warren from Massachusetts. You know, the Biden campaign - I was talking to some of their senior advisers before the second debate while I was in Detroit, and they are very focused on putting forward policies that have majority support in a general election.\n\nThat doesn't just mean winning over Trump voters - that means winning over those independents and people who may be swaying. That's through a prism of believing that this is still a persuasion election, which 2016 frankly was. But a lot of liberals in response to Donald Trump don't see that as enough. They want more, and they don't see someone like Vice President Biden as the future of the party.\n\nMARTIN: Is there any evidence that either of these strategies work better with voters? You heard the former Obama chief of staff, former mayor of Chicago Rahm Emanuel was on one of the late-night shows after the debates, and he said that Democrats want to fall in love, Republicans fall in line.\n\nMONTANARO: Right.\n\nMARTIN: And his...\n\nMONTANARO: Certainly we've seen that...\n\nMARTIN: Yeah.\n\nMONTANARO: ...Over the years for sure.\n\nMARTIN: He wasn't making a particular case one way or the other. But the stereotype is that Democrats really want to be inspired by something. That's how you get the Democratic base fired up. Whereas other people say no, that that's not true, and they point to the Obama voters who switched to Trump in 2016.\n\nMONTANARO: Well, you know, this is going to be the argument that we're not going to be able to solve. Is this going to be a persuasion election, or is this an election where it's just a base election? And there's a lot of evidence to suggest that President Trump is trying to get the Democratic base and independents to stay home because his base is solidly behind him.\n\nNow, some would argue, like Rahm Emanuel, that that means that there's an opportunity to win over the people who President Trump has not gone beyond to try to win over and keep on board. Despite the strong economy, the president has mediocre approval ratings, and that is a huge opportunity for Democrats. Now, can a Democratic base only beat a conservative base only? Polling would suggest no because there are fewer people who identify as liberal, and there are more people who identify as conservative. So Democrats have to win over a degree more of moderate voters.\n\nMARTIN: And, finally, did you observe a difference of opinion about whether this election is a referendum on President Trump, or is it a referendum about the plans and the biographies of the Democratic candidates?\n\nMONTANARO: Well, look - all of these candidates are Democrats, and they're looking in, you know, moving the country in a direction that's a little more liberal than where it is now - or a lot more liberal, depending on which candidate you're talking about. But when you talk to these voters on the campaign trail, over and over again, they say their main priority is beating Donald Trump. They just want him out whatever way that they can effect that.\n\nMARTIN: So what that seems to suggest - that there was - that Democratic primary voters are willing to give wide latitude to very different policy procedures as long as the person is fit.\n\nMONTANARO: I think that's absolutely true. I mean, you have something like 80% of Democratic voters saying they're not decided on who the candidate is, but they definitely know that they want to win. And they're worried about it because the economy is strong. There's no hot war where you have a rising death toll every day. And with those circumstances, generally a president is re-elected. And I think there's a lot of Democrats biting their nails and even more so watching these debates not sure who it is that they think is definitely that person that they think, you know, can really take him on.\n\nMARTIN: That is NPR's Domenico Montanaro.\n\nDomenico, thank you.\n\nMONTANARO: You're so welcome.\n\nCopyright © 2019 NPR.

Senate Debates GOP Tax Bill: What To Watch For\n\nSenate Republicans have begun debate on their bill to overhaul the nation's tax code. Many GOP members sound hopeful about passing their tax bill, possibly in a matter of hours. But they aren't there yet. To pass, 50 of the 52 GOP senators need to support the legislation. As the bill is debated on the Senate floor Thursday, several amendments are expected to try and get their support.\n\nHere's what to watch for:\n\nANWR Drilling\n\nSen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, says she plans to support the tax legislation. One of the elements that is bringing her on board is a provision to open part of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil and gas exploration. It's been a goal of Alaska Republicans for a long time, and is estimated to bring in over $1 billion in revenue to help pay for a small fraction of the tax cuts being proposed.\n\nThe Senate parliamentarian also has to weigh in on whether this provision can fit with the tax package.\n\nTriggers\n\nDeficit hawks like Sens. Bob Corker, R-Tenn., and Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., are worried about the fact that the tax bill would add to the deficit — possibly beyond the $1.4 trillion price tag the Congressional Budget Office has put on the bill. GOP leaders say economic growth spurred by the tax bill would offset its costs, so there is a compromise in the works to include a provision to raise taxes or cut spending if the promised growth isn't achieved. But it's being questioned because that would mean imposing a tax increase at a time when the economy would not be doing particularly well.\n\nAnother Run At Obamacare\n\nThe Senate bill would cancel out the penalty imposed by the Affordable Care Act on individuals who do not have health insurance. Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, is seeking further legislation be taken up to shore up insurance markets in exchange for this measure, which would give Republicans a small victory in their failed struggle to repeal large parts of the law.\n\nKeeping Score\n\nRepublican leaders want to speed the tax bill to passage by taking advantage of a quirk in Senate Budget rules that allow some tax and spending measures to pass with just 51 votes (including a tie-breaker from Vice President Pence, if needed) rather than the 60 votes needed for most other legislation.\n\nThat means Republicans can pass the bill on their own. But it also means they have to stick to strict rules that say the legislation can't increase the deficit by more than $1.5 trillion over the next ten years. They also have to make sure the tax cuts don't add to the deficit at all after that.\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office has produced scores estimating that the tax bill in its original form would add $1.4 trillion to the federal deficit over 10 years. It has also said the provision to cancel out the Affordable Care Act's mandate for individuals to have health insurance would reduce deficits by $318 billion, as millions fewer people are enrolled in Medicaid and the individual market, where the federal government offers subsidies for lower-income consumers.\n\nBut under Senate rules, an official score of the bill in its current form is needed in order to vote.\n\nChild Tax Credit\n\nSens. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., and Mike Lee, R-Utah, want to make it easier for low and middle-income families to get a refund under the child tax credit. The pair introduced an amendment that would make the whole credit refundable—that means working parents who don't owe taxes at the end of the year could get a refund of up to $2,000 for every child in their family.\n\nRubio and Lee want to pay for that change by increasing the proposed corporate tax rate from 20 percent to 22 percent. That idea has met with some resistance among Republicans who want to keep the corporate rate as low as possible.\n\nNPR Congressional Reporter Kelsey Snell contributed to this report.
Politics Chat: Trump Trying To Return To Campaign Amid Coronavirus Diagnosis\n\nLULU GARCIA-NAVARRO, HOST:\n\nOblivion and chicanery - let's see if we can wring some wisdom out of all that with NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson.\n\nGood morning, Mara.\n\nMARA LIASSON, BYLINE: Good morning, Lulu.\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: Heated rhetoric. What are your plans for Thursday, I'm wondering, because the debate we were all going to watch is off now that the president is refusing to debate Joe Biden if they're not on the same stage.\n\nLIASSON: Right. Well, Biden is going to hold a town hall on Thursday in place of the debate. That debate was going to be a town hall format. Trump is going to hold a rally in Florida tomorrow. And, of course, Vice President Pence is also on the campaign trail. So is Kamala Harris.\n\nThis will be the president's first rally outside the White House since he contracted coronavirus. And the president's health status is still unclear. His doctor issued a statement that said he is, quote, no longer considered a transmission risk to others, but he did not say whether or not the president has tested negative. You'd think if he had, they would say that. He also said that the president's, quote, all symptoms have improved. He didn't say the president has no symptoms. So once again, raising more questions than it answers.\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: It is a pattern. And meanwhile, Trump did have that event at the White House yesterday. It was his first public appearance since returning there from Walter Reed National Military Medical Center. He spoke from the Blue Room balcony to a few hundred guests, maskless. That came after he said he was going to hold more traditional campaign rallies this weekend. Then he didn't. And earlier - let's remind our listeners - he returned to the Oval Office, even though it was all but certain he was still contagious.\n\nLIASSON: Right. This was a wild week, even for the president. He originally pulled out of a relief bill, then decided he wanted negotiations again. That was - you would think he would want this relief bill, and he wouldn't want to take the blame for stopping it. Pulled out of the debate - that's something he also needs if he's going to change the dynamic of this campaign.\n\nHe criticized Gretchen Whitmer after she - it was revealed that she was the target of a kidnapping and perhaps murder plot. He called on his attorney general to indict Barack Obama and Joe Biden. He called on his secretary of state to declassify thousands of Hillary Clinton's emails. This is really causing a lot of angst among Republicans who are starting to ask, does the president want to lose? And, oh, I didn't even mention that he called Kamala Harris a monster.\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: It's hard to keep track.\n\nLIASSON: So the throughline is a lot of confusion. Pardon?\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: Yeah, it's hard to keep - I said it's hard to keep track.\n\nLIASSON: It's hard to keep track.\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: So let's talk a little bit about the coronavirus relief bill because it seems as though even if you do catch the president at a moment when he's willing to strike a deal - like when he tweeted, go big - that deal then may not appeal to Republicans in the Senate. He doesn't seem to be speaking to his own party, and at least a few of them would need to sign on.\n\nLIASSON: Yes. You have House Democrats who want a 2-plus trillion-dollar bill. The president has now apparently settled on 1.8 trillion. Sounds like they're pretty close, but Senate Republicans don't like the details of the bill. There's disagreement over the extension of Obamacare benefits, unemployment benefits, whether a second - another round of checks should be sent to individuals and families.\n\nSo he seems to be at odds with his own Republicans in the Senate. It sounds unlikely that a package will be passed even though negotiations are going on. And the problem is that it's possible Senate Republicans are looking past President Trump and looking to the time when they're going to try to reclaim the mantle of fiscal responsibility and being against big deficits after he goes. Of course, the president raised the deficits to historic levels.\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: Looking ahead to this week, confirming Amy Coney Barrett has been a consistent party priority shared by the White House. Her confirmation hearings begin tomorrow.\n\nLIASSON: Her confirmation hearings begin. Republicans appear to have the votes, and they have decided that whatever political backlash they might engender is worth it to cement conservative control of the Supreme Court, perhaps for generations.\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: You know, and some Democrats call that court packing. And then Republicans want Joe Biden to answer what they call court packing - if he will add justices to the Supreme Court to counteract what would be a 6-3 conservative majority.\n\nLIASSON: That's right, but it's unclear whether this - the idea of court packing, otherwise known as expanding the number of justices on the court, could even happen. Joe Biden has been ambivalent about it. He hasn't said whether he wants it or not. But, you know, if Democrats can expand the courts, so can Republicans. So this is almost like a nuclear arms race here. But that's definitely an issue that Republicans have been pushing on the campaign trail - that somehow, Joe Biden wants to do something to break norms around the Supreme Court, even though they have also done the same thing.\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: That's NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson.\n\nThank you very much.\n\nLIASSON: You're welcome.\n\nCopyright © 2020 NPR.

Donald Trump Likely To Choose Indiana Gov. Mike Pence As Running Mate\n\nThe campaign says Donald Trump has not made the decision on who his running mate will be. But it's clear Indiana Gov. Mike Pence is the frontrunner for the job.\n\nROBERT SIEGEL, HOST:\n\nDonald Trump is set to announce his vice presidential pick tomorrow morning in New York City. The official line from the Trump campaign is that no final decision has been made, but there are lots of signs that he's leaning to Indiana's Republican Governor Mike Pence. Pence is one of several potential running mates who have campaigned with Trump recently in the kind of reality-TV-auditioned tour. Here's Trump with Pence in Indiana earlier this week.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nDONALD TRUMP: I often joke. You'll be calling up Mike Pence. I don't know whether he's going to be your governor or your vice president - who the hell knows?\n\nSIEGEL: So if it is Pence for VP, What does that mean? NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson is here. Hi, Mara.\n\nMARA LIASSON, BYLINE: Hi, Robert.\n\nSIEGEL: If Mike Pence is Donald Trump's pick, what does that choice say?\n\nLIASSON: Well, if it is Mike Pence, it would tell us that Trump is capable of doing something very un-Trump like. And he did - if that's his choice, it turns out he didn't follow his gut, which is an approach he said has always worked for him in the past. This time, he will have done the traditional thing. He will have followed the advice of his campaign chairman Paul Manafort, his new adviser Kellyanne Conway, who previously worked for Pence, and his children who thought Pence was the best pick and the Republican establishment, who given the choices of Newt Gingrich, Chris Christie and Pence were most comfortable with Pence, thought he would be the most unifying pick.\n\nSo if picking a vice president is the first presidential-level decision that a candidate makes, this tells us that Trump can take advice, and he can act like a traditional candidate at least occasionally.\n\nSIEGEL: All right. If it is Pence...\n\nLIASSON: If it is (laughter).\n\nSIEGEL: And we don't know that for a fact. What virtues would Pence bring to the ticket as a running mate?\n\nLIASSON: The first thing he does is he does no harm, and that's the most important criteria. He is very popular with the Christian conservative base of the party. He is a calm, serious candidate. He's not bombastic or provocative, compared to what was reported to be Trump's other two top choices - Chris Christie and Newt Gingrich. Both of them have huge Trump-sized personalities, but they also have a lot of baggage.\n\nSIEGEL: Well, vice presidential nominees often play the role of attack dog going after the opposing presidential candidate. Is Governor Pence suited to a role like that?\n\nLIASSON: That's a good question. He is very soft-spoken. He certainly wouldn't be an attack dog like Newt Gingrich or Chris Christie would have been. Those two figures really relish the role of antagonist. But Pence showed that he can attack Hillary Clinton as required when he was campaigning with Donald Trump in Indiana earlier this week on his kind of reality TV tryout tour. Also, he will have to do what many vice presidential candidates have to do which is reconcile his past criticisms of Donald Trump. Pence had endorsed Ted Cruz. He had - has been described during the primaries as loathing Donald Trump. He said Trump's call to ban Muslims was offensive and unconstitutional.\n\nHe supported the Trans-Pacific trade deal. And he took the Obamacare Medicaid expansion in Indiana. All those things he's at odds with Trump on, but this is really par for the course for...\n\nSIEGEL: We've seen vice presidential candidates...\n\nLIASSON: ...Vice presidential candidates, sure, sure...\n\nSIEGEL: Learn to undo more positions than...\n\nLIASSON: That's right. And all this being said that Trump could wake up tomorrow morning and say, you know what? My gut tells me to go with Chris Christie, and let's just change course altogether. So this is all speculative, but all the signs in the tea leaves seem to be pointing to Pence.\n\nSIEGEL: And very interesting. Mara Liasson, NPR's national political correspondent, thanks.\n\nLIASSON: Thank you.\n\nCopyright © 2016 NPR. All rights reserved.

News Brief: Jeffrey Epstein, Hong Kong Bill, Obamacare Trial\n\nFinancier Jeffrey Epstein pleads not guilty to sex trafficking of minors. Hong Kong's leader says the controversial extradition bill is dead. And, the Affordable Care Act is on trial again.\n\nSTEVE INSKEEP, HOST:\n\nA simple description of the allegations by federal prosecutor Geoffrey Berman is devastating to hear.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nGEOFFREY BERMAN: The charges allege that Epstein sexually abused young girls by enticing them to engage in sex acts for money.\n\nRACHEL MARTIN, HOST:\n\nThe prosecutor is referring to the financier Jeffrey Epstein. He pleaded not guilty to those charges in court Monday. Epstein, though, pleaded guilty to lesser charges in the state of Florida back in 2008, and that was part of a plea deal which protected him from major jail time.\n\nINSKEEP: How much do we understand now of the case against Epstein and how much more is yet to be learned? NPR's Quil Lawrence is on the line from New York. Good morning.\n\nQUIL LAWRENCE, BYLINE: Hey. Good morning, Steve.\n\nINSKEEP: According to prosecutors, how large was this conspiracy?\n\nLAWRENCE: Well, the indictment they unsealed is only covering a period of three years, and that was 15 years ago. But they clearly think that there are more victims and that Epstein sort of continued this pattern of behavior, that he recruited a network of young girls who would then bring in other young girls for money to give him these nude massages, which turned into sexual abuse. Here's Special Agent Bill Sweeney talking about the impact of these crimes alleged.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nBILL SWEENEY: Those who have been victimized by child sexual predators are frequently haunted by memories of these crimes well into their adulthood, often for the rest of their lives. They bear the burden of someone else's criminal behavior.\n\nINSKEEP: Quil, we were reading yesterday this indictment that referred to dozens of victims, and then after hearing of dozens of victims, it's really quite sobering to hear the prosecutor say, we don't even know how many more of you there may be. If you think you're a victim, call this 800 number.\n\nLAWRENCE: Yeah, the most dramatic part for me of that press conference yesterday was that they put up a picture of Epstein and they said, if you have seen this man, if you think you've been harmed by this man, call this FBI 800 number. So they think that this behavior went on for years and years and there must be many more victims.\n\nAnd they found - after arresting him, when he landed at this New Jersey airport, they found that - they got a warrant to break into his home, his mansion in the Upper East Side of Manhattan. And they found, they said, a trove of nude photographs, which they believe are underage girls. So that's also, I would imagine, child pornography charges on top of the other charges.\n\nINSKEEP: Other than entering a not guilty plea, have you heard anything from Epstein's side about how he would say he is not guilty of these charges?\n\nLAWRENCE: Only that he's retained a high-powered law firm. We don't know that he - you know, he said he's not guilty, and there's a bail hearing on Thursday.\n\nINSKEEP: We've also heard that Epstein is very, very well-connected, which has forced some very prominent people to make statements about their links to him.\n\nLAWRENCE: Yes. The Clinton - the office of former President Bill Clinton, it sort of detailed the times that they were together and said that it was all accompanied by Secret Service and that he knew nothing of Epstein's terrible crimes, he said. President Trump hasn't said anything, although in the past, he had said that Epstein was a, you know, fun guy who seemed to like younger women. Alex Acosta, who's President Trump's secretary of labor, had signed off on this plea deal in Florida, which allowed him to escape prison time.\n\nBut what we're looking for next really is whether he will have a chance at bail. Epstein has a private jet. He landed in New Jersey from Paris on Saturday in this private jet. And the prosecutors are saying that he's just so powerful and wealthy, and that he's an extreme flight risk, and he should remain in detention throughout trial.\n\nINSKEEP: Quil, thanks so much.\n\nLAWRENCE: Thank you, Steve. Have a good morning.\n\nINSKEEP: That's NPR's Quil Lawrence.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)\n\nINSKEEP: Some other news now. Hong Kong's chief executive says she is giving up on an extradition bill. It's an apparent victory for protesters who pushed her back, even though the rules were heavily against them.\n\nMARTIN: Her name is Carrie Lam, and she had previously suspended this measure. Protesters, though, weren't satisfied. So now she says the bill is dead. Though she still hasn't formally withdrawn it. Her latest step is another win for protesters who have faced long odds in all this. Under China's complicated system for controlling Hong Kong, Carrie Lam is not really elected by the people; she's chosen under a system that's dominated by Beijing. In the end, though, protesters forced the chief executive to answer to them.\n\nINSKEEP: Does her latest move really end this story? Let's ask NPR's Julie McCarthy, who's been covering the tale. She joins us now from Manila. Hi there, Julie.\n\nJULIE MCCARTHY, BYLINE: Hi.\n\nINSKEEP: How significant is this statement by Carrie Lam?\n\nMCCARTHY: Well, I have to say, taken as a whole, it sounds like a kinder, gentler way of saying no to the protesters and their demands, and this in the face of the biggest challenge to the Beijing-controlled Hong Kong government in decades. Lam sounds like she's trying to stop the turmoil, which she even admits her government started when it pushed this extradition measure. And here's what she said today about the fate of that bill, recognizing that there is a problem.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nCHIEF EXECUTIVE CARRIE LAM: There are still lingering doubts about the government's sincerity or worries whether the government will restart the process in the Legislative Council. So I reiterate here, there is no such plan. The bill is dead.\n\nINSKEEP: Julie, help me understand a thing you said there. In listening to the entirety of her statement, you felt that in some way she's also pushing back on the protesters and trying to reject some of their demands. What do you mean by that?\n\nMCCARTHY: Well, it sounds like it's an unambiguous statement, but there's a lot of semantics involved here, especially for the protesters. The demonstrators said today, the word dead or suspending the bill - another term she's used - has no legal meaning in the Legislative Council, Hong Kong's Parliament; withdrawal does, so use it (ph) - she won't. Instead, when she spoke in Cantonese, she used the word - she used an idiom that means to die in one's bed at a ripe, old age, and the implication is that this bill will not be revived in this session and therefore would simply die at the start of next year.\n\nNow, protesters say, if you're sincere, why the aversion to withdrawing it now? And, you know, beyond the bill, she's rejected all of their other demands today.\n\nINSKEEP: OK, so we should think of this as another half step back, not a complete capitulation to the protesters. And you said other demands - what other demands do the protesters make to Carrie Lam?\n\nMCCARTHY: Well, the demonstrators want amnesty for the protesters who've been arrested. Lam says no, the Department of Justice has got to take its course with no intervention. Demonstrators want authorities to retract the word riot to describe the protests. She says, I never - I don't refer to the protesters that way. And the demonstrators demand an independent inquiry into allegations that the police used excessive force. Lam says a fact-finding by the Police Complaints Commission can do that. Demonstrators say no, they can't (inaudible) all witnesses.\n\nINSKEEP: And I guess there was also a demand that Carrie Lam herself resign. She gave no indication she's doing that, did she?\n\nMCCARTHY: No, she did not, and that's not likely to happen. She may at some point be recalled by Beijing, which is watching this very carefully. She's under a great deal of pressure from China to rein in the social upheaval.\n\nINSKEEP: Julie, thanks so much.\n\nMCCARTHY: Thank you.\n\nINSKEEP: That's NPR's Julie McCarthy.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)\n\nINSKEEP: The Affordable Care Act is on trial today - again.\n\nMARTIN: Yeah, the case is Texas v. the United States, and it's yet another lawsuit meant to overturn President Obama's signature law. It is nearly a decade old at this point, and it survived two previous challenges that ended up in the Supreme Court. Today's hearing is in the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans.\n\nINSKEEP: On the line now from New Orleans is Noam Levey of the LA Times, who's covering the trial. Good morning.\n\nNOAM LEVEY: Good morning.\n\nINSKEEP: How does this suit differ from other legal challenges to the Affordable Care Act, the many other legal challenges?\n\nLEVEY: Well, the crux of this case, which is different than the two other ones that have come before the Supreme Court to some extent, is the requirement that Americans have health insurance. That was what brought about the first suit against the Affordable Care Act. But now there is no more penalty on Americans who have health insurance. And so Texas and a group of other mainly Republican-led states have sued, saying without the mandate, you can't have the rest of the Affordable Care Act. The Trump administration...\n\nINSKEEP: Let me just make sure I figure this out because, I mean, there has been news about this in a lower court ruling, but I want to review it because it's quite remarkable. There was a mandate that was characterized - that was upheld by the Supreme Court because it was a tax. The federal government could use its taxing authority to penalize you if you did not have health insurance. Then the mandate was thrown out by Congress. And so now the argument is that without the tax, without the tax penalty, there is no authority under Congress to mandate health insurance for people - is that right?\n\nLEVEY: That's right. And then the additional piece here, which is so important to this case in New Orleans, is that the states suing here are arguing that because that penalty, that tax penalty was so critical to the Affordable Care Act's program for extending health insurance, for guaranteeing sick people could get health insurance, for expanding Medicaid, so critical to all the reforms in the Affordable Care Act, that if you get rid of that penalty, you've got to take the whole law down with it.\n\nINSKEEP: Let's hypothetically say the appeals court would agree to that, and ultimately, maybe the Supreme Court would agree to that. What would it mean for a law that's now almost a decade old to just be completely obliterated from the books? Does anybody have any idea what that would look like?\n\nLEVEY: I mean, it's hard to even imagine how disruptive that would be to the American health care system. So I think people probably understand at this point that the Affordable Care Act is responsible for extending health insurance coverage to some 20 million previously uninsured Americans. But that's really just the tip of the iceberg, if you will. The law has now, as you said, been in place almost a decade. It now guarantees coverage. People have been used to getting coverage if they are sick. Without that guarantee, presumably insurers could go back to denying coverage to people who are sick. Twenty million - 20-some odd million people who have health insurance would lose it.\n\nINSKEEP: Is the court in a situation where it could even consider the consequences of this? Can they say, this would be an utterly absurd ruling and therefore we can't make it, or do they simply have to say, if they decide they agree with the plaintiffs in this, the law is what the law is, and let the chips fall where they may?\n\nLEVEY: Well, this is just the next step in this lawsuit's journey. So this court can weigh in however it sees fit, and then, of course, we would expect that it may end up once again before the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nINSKEEP: Noam Levey, thanks so much. Really appreciate it.\n\nLEVEY: Good to be with you.\n\nINSKEEP: He writes about national health care policy for the Los Angeles Times.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF EF'S SUN GROWS DIM)\n\nCopyright © 2019 NPR.

Where Insurers' Exits Are Hurting Obamacare Exchanges — And Where They Aren't\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Joe Raedle/Getty Images Joe Raedle/Getty Images\n\nSome of the Affordable Care Act's insurance marketplaces are in turmoil as the fourth open enrollment season approaches this fall. What's ahead for consumers depends very much on where they live.\n\nCompetition on some exchanges will be diminished next year when three of the nation's largest health insurers — Aetna, UnitedHealthcare and Humana — will sell individual plans in many fewer markets. The departure of several Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans in various states will also hurt. These pullbacks also come on top of the closure of 16 nonprofit co-ops, another coverage option, since January 2015.\n\nAetna's exit announcement Monday that blamed financial losses on its marketplace plans gave Obamacare opponents who have from the start predicted the health law's failure a fresh chance to proclaim, I told you so.\n\nThat story line got more complicated Wednesday after the Huffington Post reported Aetna CEO Mark Bertolini sent a letter to the Justice Department on July 5 threatening to withdraw from the Obamacare marketplaces if the government sued to block his company's planned merger with Humana. The Justice Department did just that a couple weeks later.\n\nStill, most marketplace consumers won't see any ill effects from insurers' withdrawals, say the health law's advocates and independent analysts.\n\nThe effect on consumers is going to be mixed around the country, said Katherine Hempstead, a senior adviser at the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. Most of these marketplaces are not dependent on the large national carriers.\n\nAlso, the big insurers' announcements apply generally only to the individual market. The much larger market of employer-sponsored insurance is not part of the health law exchanges.\n\nMany major metropolitan areas, such as those in California, New York and Texas, will still have several insurers for individual health insurance consumers to choose from. In Texas, all major metro areas — including Austin, Dallas, Houston and San Antonio — will have at least three insurers after Aetna and UnitedHealthcare exit.\n\nThat's true also for most urban exchange customers living in the Northwest, the Midwest and New England.\n\nMost hurt will be marketplace consumers in Arizona, North and South Carolina, Georgia and parts of Florida, where only one or two insurers will be left when open enrollment season begins Nov. 1.\n\nRemaining insurers might raise their monthly premiums as a result, but more than 8 in 10 consumers on the marketplaces who get government subsidies would be insulated. Subsidies increase as premiums rise.\n\nOne concern is that with less competition, insurers may tighten their provider networks and give these consumers fewer choices of hospitals and doctors. That trend started several years ago, and some states have responded with regulations requiring insurers to provide customers with reasonable access to doctors and hospitals in each county where they sell plans.\n\nNearly 13 million people signed up for Obamacare marketplace policies for 2016. Aetna, UnitedHealthcare and Humana have 2 million members in total, but their exit from certain states is predicted to affect between 1 million and 1.5 million people who will have to choose new carriers.\n\nWhile changing plans can force people to find new doctors, it's also the best way for consumers get the best deals on coverage.\n\nAetna will exit 11 of 15 states where it sells plans on the exchanges. UnitedHealthcare has said it will quit 22 of 34 states, and Humana will leave four of the 15 states where it operates.\n\nIn late May, the Kaiser Family Foundation estimated the number of rural counties at risk of having one insurer on the exchanges would triple in 2017. That was before Humana and Aetna detailed their plans. (Kaiser Health News is an editorially independent project of the foundation.)\n\nWe could be looking at about 1 in 4 counties in the U.S. with just one exchange insurer next year, though this could change between now and open enrollment in November, said Cynthia Cox, associate director for the Kaiser Family Foundation Program for the Study of Health Reform and Private Insurance.\n\nOvershadowed by the big insurers' withdrawals is the prospect that other carriers will enter markets the three giants are leaving. Smaller insurers Molina and Centene have said they're doing fine on the exchanges. And Cigna, a larger insurer, has said it will move into some North Carolina counties for 2017.\n\nNorth Carolina will be left with just one or two plans in most of the state after it loses UnitedHealthcare and Aetna plans. Health insurance analysts say three insurers are needed for a healthy competitive market.\n\nWe've had a very robust enrollment under the ACA and hope consumers will still see benefits of having coverage even if they have fewer options, said Ciara Zachary, health policy analyst for the North Carolina Justice Center's Health Access Coalition.\n\nRural Americans had few health insurers to choose from even before Obamacare, but some suburban and urban parts of the Southeast will be in the same fix next year. In southeast Florida, consumers in counties near Naples and Fort Myers will have only one marketplace insurer — Florida Blue — next year, unless other insurers step in.\n\nThere are some headwinds, but it's not a question of whether the market will stabilize but how quickly and how well, said Hempstead.\n\nStrong winds are already blowing with hurricane force toward Arizona's Pinal County, southeast of Phoenix, health care advocates say. Nearly 10,000 people enrolled in Obamacare marketplace policies this year and about 85 percent received a federal subsidy.\n\nIn 2017, Pinal stands to lose its only two insurers — UnitedHealthcare and Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Arizona. Clearly this is a big concern for consumers, said Allen Gjersvig, director of navigator and enrollment services for the Arizona Alliance for Community Health Centers. He said he is hopeful another insurer will step in, but not confident.\n\nNeighboring Maricopa County, which includes Phoenix, is expected to have just two relatively small insurers in the area left on its marketplace next year. Gjersvig questions whether those two — Cigna and Phoenix Health Plan — will have enough doctors and hospitals under contract to handle their new members after larger rival Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Arizona gives up its 40,000 customers.\n\nAt least a dozen other counties in Arizona will be left with just one health insurer, he said.\n\nArizona had eight insurers operating in various parts of the state this year, but four are leaving entirely — Aetna, UnitedHealthcare, Humana and Health Choice. Two more, Blue Cross Blue Shield and Health Net, are scaling back their participation.\n\nDespite the problems with the marketplaces, Gjersvig said thousands of people have gained coverage through them and he is confident they will survive. We do not see this as a death knell for the marketplace, he said.\n\nTammie King, an insurance agent in Columbia, S.C., is less sure how insurer departures will affect consumers in the Palmetto State. The pullouts by UnitedHealthcare and Aetna mean there will be only one carrier in the state in 2017 — Blue Cross and Blue Shield of South Carolina.\n\nThat's a particular concern in Columbia, she said, because the Blue Cross plan does not include one of the biggest hospitals, Lexington Medical Center, and its affiliated physicians. People will be left unable to see the doctors they are now using, King said.\n\nKing said she worried the Blue Cross plan will use its monopoly power to further reduce the number of doctors and hospitals in its network and limit its choice of prescription drugs. You can't blame them because ... they have to do something to control costs, she said.\n\nKaiser Health News is an editorially independent news service supported by the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation.You can follow Phil Galewitz on Twitter: @PhilGalewitz.
News Brief: Trump Rallies In Michigan, Venezuelans Leave, Brexit\n\nIn Michigan, President Trump held his first rally since the end of the Mueller investigation. Also, the latest on Venezuelans fleeing to Colombia and Brexit turmoil.\n\nRACHEL MARTIN, HOST:\n\nOn this Friday morning, Americans still do not have the Mueller report. A new survey finds an overwhelming majority want it to be public before they decide what to think.\n\nSTEVE INSKEEP, HOST:\n\nAmericans do have a summary by President Trump's attorney general. In it, William Barr says Russia worked to elect the president. He finds no evidence President Trump's campaign conspired with Russia. And Barr decided not to charge his boss with obstruction of justice. That was enough for the president to celebrate at a campaign rally in Grand Rapids, Mich.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: The Russia hoax is finally dead. The collusion delusion is over.\n\nMARTIN: NPR's White House correspondent, Tamara Keith, was at that rally and joins us now. Good morning.\n\nTAMARA KEITH, BYLINE: Good morning.\n\nMARTIN: So let's start with that poll - the president there clearly saying that this is victory in his mind. But what do these new numbers tell us about how the public sees the Mueller report?\n\nKEITH: Well, 56 percent now say that Robert Mueller conducted a fair investigation. In fact, Robert Mueller's favorability is going up, in large part, because of Republicans. Let's get to this big number, though. Seventy-five percent of people surveyed say the full Mueller report should be made public. That includes a majority of Republicans. Two-thirds also say that they want Mueller to testify before Congress. And a similar number say they want Attorney General Bill Barr to testify. Now, interestingly, almost six in 10 said that questions still exist. And just 36 percent say that President Trump is clear of any wrongdoing.\n\nNow, I was at this rally. I talked to several Trump supporters as they were heading in. And surprisingly - or maybe not surprisingly, given these poll numbers - basically, every one of them said that they either wanted or would be OK with the Mueller report coming out. Here is Jack Korkl. He's 19 years old.\n\nJACK KORKL: I think he's innocent. I think that it should be released in full. Personally, I thought it was, like, kind of, like - they had laid out the groundwork for it in the previous administration. And Trump - Mueller, I think he's an honest guy. And he did the investigation. And I think now everyone should just move forward.\n\nKEITH: And he was not alone in this. A number of people said similar things.\n\nMARTIN: I was looking on Twitter last night and saw this picture of a guy at that rally who was wearing a No Collusion T-shirt, which they've clearly - you know, that was quick response to make some T-shirts after this whole thing. The president - also trying to frame this as a victory - clearly, he sees this as a political opportunity.\n\nKEITH: Well, the president has been saying no collusion for a long time but now he has a little bit something to back him up on that. And this was a victory lap last night. And in addition to declaring victory, he was also mocking the congressmen who are leading some of the House committees that are investigating him.\n\nAnd that belittling has a purpose. It is both the president trying to make them pay for what he sees as two years of overreach. And it's also him trying to undermine the investigations that still linger. And if all that wasn't clear from the mocking and the nicknames, President Trump also made it quite explicit, saying Democrats are, quote, defrauding the public with this ridiculous B.S. And he did not say B.S.\n\nMARTIN: (Laughter) At the same time, the White House - the president - they're talking about this, trying to frame it as win. They're also talking about health care in a way that they haven't before - I mean, clearly seeing this as a potential win for them politically in the election.\n\nKEITH: Yeah. It's a remarkable thing, given that 2018 - the midterms - Democrats ran on health care and won. The president and his administration are now looking to, as he says, get rid of Obamacare through the courts this time and then says that Republicans will become the party of great health care, saying there will be a new plan. Though, it's not clear where that plan...\n\nMARTIN: Right.\n\nKEITH: ...Is right now...\n\nMARTIN: Haven't seen that.\n\nKEITH: ...Because it doesn't seem to exist.\n\nMARTIN: NPR's Tamara Keith.\n\nThanks, Tam.\n\nKEITH: You're welcome.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)\n\nMARTIN: OK. Despite mounting pressure from inside Venezuela and around the world, the sitting president there, Nicolas Maduro, is still holding onto power.\n\nINSKEEP: He has heavily armed supporters, of course, both in the military and in paramilitary groups. Maduro is also being helped by a Russian military contingent that is said to have arrived in the capital Caracas. But none of that seems to be deterring Juan Guaido, the man the United States and most Western states recognize as the legitimate leader now. Guaido declared yesterday that preparations for what he's termed Operation Liberty have begun. Although, it's unclear what Operation Liberty is.\n\nMARTIN: Ari Shapiro is the host of NPR's All Things Considered. And he has spent the last week on Colombia's border with Venezuela. And he joins us now.\n\nAri, thanks for being with us.\n\nARI SHAPIRO, BYLINE: Hi, Rachel - good to be here.\n\nMARTIN: Just tell us what the situation is at the border.\n\nSHAPIRO: You know, the city of Cucuta, right there on the border, is so overcrowded. More than a million Colombians - more than a million Venezuelans, rather - have recently crossed into Colombia. And many of them are still in the city of Cucuta. It feels like a place stretched to the breaking point.\n\nPeople there are desperate. Hyperinflation in Venezuela has wiped out the life's savings that many of them earned. And so I - I met a lot of angry, young men who told me they have nothing to lose. They're willing to fight. People told me, give me a weapon, and I will charge across the country and do what's necessary to try to force Maduro out.\n\nMARTIN: Wow. Tell us more about some of the people that you met.\n\nSHAPIRO: OK. Well, let's start with the guys who have the most training and experience fighting - those would be the military defectors. And they are living in this abandoned luxury hotel resort guarded by Colombian police. It's a place that used to be popular with Venezuelan tourists. But, of course, those tourists are no longer coming.\n\nThese defectors are only allowed out of the hotel a couple hours a day, partly because their Colombian hosts are afraid that the guests might try to spark a war. Four of those guys agreed to spend their time out of the hotel talking with me. So we met in the ruins of this old cathedral that was destroyed in an earthquake more than a century ago. And the informal leader of the group - this guy named Williams Cancino (ph) - told me he and his buddies are just waiting for the order.\n\nWILLIAMS CANCINO: (Through interpreter) We are here to overwhelmingly attack the dictatorial regime of Maduro.\n\nSHAPIRO: He said the defectors are getting impatient. And he told me, if they do not get the green light to attack from Juan Guaido or from the U.S., they might just take action on their own. Some people will say that's just bluster. These guys don't have weapons or money. And the majority of the military still supports Maduro. But the military defectors are not the only ones itching for a fight. There are a lot of people who are getting very impatient.\n\nMARTIN: So not just ex-military, other - just civilians are...\n\nSHAPIRO: Yeah.\n\nMARTIN: ...Ready to start some kind of conflagration.\n\nSHAPIRO: Yeah. I mean, I mentioned disillusioned young men. I heard this from older men too. At a Catholic soup kitchen that serves up to 8,000 hot meals every day to hungry Venezuelans, I met a 58-year-old construction worker named Luis (ph). He crosses the border every day to get food because he can't find any in Venezuela. And we're only using his first name here because what you are about to hear him say could get him in a lot of trouble back home.\n\nLUIS: (Through interpreter) In my state, armed groups are forming to go confront the government of Nicolas Maduro.\n\nMARTIN: Wow. So...\n\nSHAPIRO: Yeah.\n\nMARTIN: People are anxious to bring the fight to Maduro. What would happen, Ari, if violence breaks out?\n\nSHAPIRO: Of course, it's impossible to know for sure. But there are fears that a civil war could become a regional conflict - potentially, even a global conflict. We've seen the U.S. and Russia both digging in. The U.S. wants Maduro out. Russia wants him to stay. When I spoke to the Colombian ambassador to the U.S. about this, he told me that his worst fear is that Venezuela could become like another Syria, where armed groups, backed by global superpowers, fight for dominance.\n\nOf course, that would mean millions more Venezuelans flooding out of the country into Colombia. And that exodus is the story that we're going to explore tonight on All Things Considered.\n\nMARTIN: NPR's Ari Shapiro, thank you so much.\n\nSHAPIRO: Good to talk to you, Rachel.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)\n\nMARTIN: Let's go to London. Today is yet another crucial day for the future of the United Kingdom and its relationship with the EU. We mean it this time.\n\nINSKEEP: So British Prime Minister Theresa May says - twice she has brought her Brexit withdrawal agreement before Parliament. Twice it has suffered staggering defeats. Today she tries a third time, possibly the last time because the European Union has given the U.K. until tonight to approve the agreement or risk crashing out.\n\nMARTIN: Does the prime minister have enough support? Let's ask NPR's Frank Langfitt in London.\n\nHi, Frank.\n\nFRANK LANGFITT, BYLINE: Hi, Rachel.\n\nMARTIN: So the prime minister has been here before. She lost her first vote on her deal by big margins. The second defeat was also big but less bad. What are her prospects?\n\nLANGFITT: Well, Brexit is nothing if not unpredictable. But the odds are still against her. She did pick up some votes this week. James Gray - he's a Brexiteer member of May's Conservative Party. He was actually speaking to MORNING EDITION yesterday and said he would finally back the prime minister's deal. This is what he said.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)\n\nJAMES GRAY: Seventeen-point-four million people voted to leave the European Union. We must now deliver on that promise. And the only way we can do that is by supporting the prime minister's otherwise obnoxious deal.\n\nLANGFITT: But the problem, Rachel, is the opposition Labour Party says they're against this. The Democratic Unionist Party of Northern Ireland - also against it. The margin should be closer today, but it's still very challenging for the prime minister.\n\nMARTIN: Also - I mean, the speaker of the House of Commons, John Bercow, said that the prime minister...\n\nLANGFITT: He did.\n\nMARTIN: ...Couldn't bring back her deal unless it was really changed. And it's not so much - is it?\n\nLANGFITT: Well, this is hairsplitting, frankly. But what she's done is she's brought back one part of the deal - what's called a divorce deal - instead of - the divorce deal and sort of an outline on the future relationship with the EU. And Bercow said, OK. This is just - we're just voting on one part of it. That makes it different enough, so he's accepting it.\n\nMARTIN: OK. So the stakes - I mean, it sounds so cliche. But it's for real now. I mean, this is kind of the final deal for the U.K. This vote is really important, right?\n\nLANGFITT: It's hard to imagine she would bring it up for a fourth vote...\n\nMARTIN: Right.\n\nLANGFITT: ...At this point. And she would be crashing through this deadline. What the EU has said is if it does fail tonight, which is the general expectation - and if not, if they - then they have until April 12, really, to come up with some kind of new plan. So time is very much running out.\n\nAnd what we could - would do is if this goes down, we would expect Parliament to come back early next week to debate other options. And one of the options to look for would be some kind of compromise where there might be a customs union still between the EU and the U.K. so that goods could still travel freely across the borders. And so, basically, looking for some way out of this - Prime Minister May's against that. We'll see what happens next week.\n\nMARTIN: What happens to her? She's promised to step down if Parliament passed her deal. If they don't...\n\nLANGFITT: She's under so much pressure right now. And certainly, if she loses this vote tonight, people don't expect her to last that long.\n\nMARTIN: NPR's Frank Langfitt with the latest on Brexit, reporting from London.\n\nThanks, Frank.\n\nLANGFITT: Happy to do it, Rachel.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF STAN FOREBEE'S REFLECTIONS)\n\nCopyright © 2019 NPR.

Bosses Find Part-Time Workers Can Come With Full-Time Headaches\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Paula Connelly/Getty Images Paula Connelly/Getty Images\n\nStarting in 2016, the federal health law requires small employers to offer their full-time workers health insurance. In anticipation of the change, some fast-food restaurants looked to get around the law by making more workers part time. Now some owners are rethinking that approach.\n\nAt a Burger King off Highway 99 in California's Central Valley, a half-dozen workers in black uniforms scurry around, grabbing packets of ketchup and stuffing paper bags with french fries.\n\nTiana Mua has worked here part time for almost a year. She'd like to be full time, but at this Burger King only the managers are full time. (The company didn't respond to an interview request.)\n\nMua says that's the situation at fast-food joints all over town. They're cutting back on all the jobs, and a lot of people have been let go and everything already, Mua says.\n\nOne reason: The local economy is bad. People aren't eating out as much, and sales are down. But there's another reason that might explain why fast-food employees aren't getting more hours: Obamacare.\n\nStarting Jan. 1, businesses with 50 or more full-time employees must offer health insurance to all full-time staff or pay a hefty fine. Employers with 100 or more workers had to start offering coverage last year. But smaller businesses that operate on lower margins, especially restaurants, complained loudly about the cost.\n\nAnd some fast-food franchise owners figured out a way to avoid paying for coverage: Just make as many workers as possible part time. A U.S. Chamber of Commerce survey found nearly 60 percent of small franchise businesses said they would make personnel changes like this.\n\nThe ones that did it successfully did it three or four years ago, says Kaya Bromley, an attorney who helps employers comply with the Affordable Care Act. But, Bromley says, some of the restaurant owners who cut hours to sidestep the health law now regret it.\n\nA lot of the fast-food franchisees that did this, she says, are now coming back and saying, 'it was a great idea for reducing the number of people that I have to offer benefits, but now I can't run my restaurants.' \n\nThey tell her it has been a nightmare trying to manage a part-time staff.\n\nBecause you've got people who are less loyal, you've got people who are less skilled — who don't understand the business, she says. There's also more employee turnover.\n\nBromley has seen many of those restaurants reverse course. Employers think that there's a shortcut here or there, and then they realize, yeah, that shortcut really hurt me more than it helped me, she says.\n\nThe people hurt most by all the workforce management gymnastics are the people at the bottom of the restaurant pecking order who want to advance, but can't, says Angelo Amador, vice president of labor and workforce policy for the National Restaurant Association.\n\nSomeone who's working part time, but wants more hours so they can move up the ladder, they can't get the hours, he says. It ends up taking out that middle rung of employees.\n\nObamacare has made restaurants less flexible, he says, mainly because it defines full-time work as 30 hours a week or more. Amador says most other laws restaurants have to comply with, like overtime pay, define full time as 40 hours. He thinks the Affordable Care Act should be changed for consistency.\n\nIt would be much easier if we could have one definition of full time, he says.\n\nAt the Carl's Junior in Chowchilla, Calif., manager Silvia Campos tries to keep as many workers full time as possible. She says it makes her job easier. It's a small town, she says. For me, it's hard to find a really good employee.\n\nBut some workers don't want more hours. Their part-time salary is low enough that they're eligible for government coverage in California through Medicaid.\n\nSome workers say they're better off making less money and getting their coverage free from the state.\n\nThis story comes from a reporting partnership of NPR, KQED and Kaiser Health News.
Trump's Address To Joint Session Of Congress, Annotated\n\nPresident Trump gave an address to a joint session of Congress on Tuesday night, outlining his vision for America. We are one people, with one destiny, Trump said, offering a markedly different tone than his inaugural address, which described a country in crisis.\n\nHe touted his executive actions, called again for the repeal and replacement of Obamacare and reiterated his position on immigration and national security.\n\nJournalists across NPR have annotated his full remarks.
Special Coverage: Preview Of Trump Address To Press About Midterm Results\n\nNOEL KING, HOST:\n\nPresident Trump will speak to the press soon from the White House. He'll be talking about the results of last night's midterm elections. Republicans lost the House, held onto the Senate. We'll cut to the president as soon as he starts talking, but in the meantime in studio with us is NPR's congressional reporter Scott Detrow. Hey, Scott.\n\nSCOTT DETROW, BYLINE: Hey there.\n\nKING: And NPR's Tamara Keith is at the White House. Hi, Tam.\n\nTAMARA KEITH, BYLINE: Hello.\n\nKING: So Tam, the president has been talking a little bit this morning. What's he been saying about the midterm results?\n\nKEITH: Well, the president is never one to declare defeat when he could declare victory. And that is exactly what he's doing in a series of tweets. He also says he wants to maybe work with Nancy Pelosi. But I would say take that with a giant grain of salt because he has said those kinds of things before only to make a 180 very quickly. So, you know, he very much is interpreting this as a win. He's also saying that, you know, Democrats shouldn't spend time investigating his administration, or he'll have the Senate investigate the House.\n\nSTEVE INSKEEP, HOST:\n\nOK.\n\nKING: (Laughter).\n\nKEITH: Yeah. So some early threats.\n\nINSKEEP: Well, that's the president's style, isn't it? You don't defend. You just attack, attack, attack. But the reality is - is it not, Tamara Keith? - that the White House - and not just the White House, the entire administration - has to be prepared for examination and oversight by a House that will now have subpoena power over them whatever they may say about it.\n\nINSKEEP: The administration has to be prepared for examination and oversight by a House that will now have subpoena power over them, whatever they may say about it.\n\nKEITH: Oh, absolutely. And it's a target-rich environment. There have been numerous scandals at various agencies that have largely gone uninvestigated by a Republican Congress. Democrats don't intend to let those things rest. And in my reporting, thus far, the White House counsel's office has not staffed up in a way that you would expect or need to be able to be responsive to what will likely be a number of requests. But they are working on it or they will be soon (laughter).\n\nKING: So maybe not prepared for the moment - but, Tam, I wonder, when you talk to Democrats and when you look at what they've been telegraphing, what are some of the areas that you would expect them to begin investigating immediately?\n\nKEITH: Well, you'd expect them to try to get President Trump's tax returns.\n\nKING: Yeah.\n\nKEITH: You would expect them to look at the Department of the Interior and the EPA. You'd expect them to look at the way the Trump administration has dealt with the Affordable Care Act and sort of stealing - not stealing, but not putting full funding into promoting health care plans. You'd expect them to...\n\nINSKEEP: Openly doing whatever they can to undermine it - they've been pretty frank about that.\n\nKEITH: That's true (laughter). And you'd also expect them to investigate whether what the administration has been saying about how it's handling family separation along the border is true. You might well expect them to look into the president's decision to send troops to the border on the eve of the election to deal with the migrant caravan that's hundreds of miles away.\n\nINSKEEP: I want to note one additional point, then take it over to Scott Detrow as we wait for President Trump, who will be making a statement at the White House shortly. Reporters are already in their seats. Ron Klain, a longtime Obama administration aide, is writing in The Washington Post to Democrats, take your time with those investigations. It's going to take a while anyway. Try to actually pass substantive things that matter to people. And he raises a few suggestions such as raising the minimum wage, shoring up the Affordable Care Act or dealing with voting rights and that sort of thing. Scott Detrow.\n\nDETROW: Yeah. I think we're going to hear President Trump declare victory and say that this was a big win for him. Yes, the Republicans did add to their majority in the Senate. And that's a big deal on a couple different fronts, among other things. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell says his top priority for the next two years is going to be the same priority as these two years, and that's confirming as many federal judges that President Trump nominates as he can. It'll be easier for McConnell to do that. And he said, frankly, they'll have more Senate floor time to do that since he doesn't anticipate a lot of agreement with a Democrat-controlled House in terms of trying to pass bills.\n\nBut this was a really big night for Democrats. And the fact that they flipped control of the House of Representatives is a really big deal. First of all, this is a national referendum in the way that the Senate election wasn't because as we talked a lot about, the Senate map was a historically tough map for Democrats - a ton of states deep red, where President Trump is very popular. And the fact that Democrats were able to keep seats in the three states that made Trump president - Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Michigan...\n\nINSKEEP: Yeah.\n\nDETROW: ...I think tempers the idea that this is a big victory for Trump, even though, again, good on the Senate side to pick up seats. But the fact that Democrats were able to regain control of the House of Representatives, even with so many of these seats drawn in a way by Republican legislatures to make it hard for Democrats to do that, I think, says a lot.\n\nINSKEEP: That is an important point, Scott Detrow. Democrats, in order to win the House, had to not just win the popular vote but win it big. And it appears, by all accounts, that they did - seven or eight points, something like that, which is a pretty substantial win in a divided country.\n\nKING: Scott, talk a little bit about the Democratic - sorry, the demographics of how this all played out. We heard a lot about suburban voters, the importance of them, the importance of women voters. What were some of the trends that we saw across the country?\n\nDETROW: The trend was that Democrats retook control of the House of Representatives by and large through the suburbs. Seat after seat that had been in Republican hands for sometimes generations - I'm thinking of one suburban Houston district that was once held by George H.W. Bush, hadn't sent a Democrat to Congress in decades.\n\nKING: Wow.\n\nDETROW: A Democrat won there. Philadelphia suburbs, Miami suburbs - basically every big city, you could probably find one or two Republican control districts that flipped to Democratic control. That was the main way that Democrats retook control of Congress. And they did it by winning a lot of independent voters, by winning a big chunk of women voters and by picking off several Republican voters who seemed to clearly be uncomfortable with the type of hard-line, anti-immigration fearmongering that President Trump really leaned into in the final weeks of the campaign that he credits for helping keep Republican Senate seats.\n\nKEITH: Yeah. I mean, the way the president is going to read this is that candidates who did not hug him closely lost. Now, those candidates also happened to be in districts that demographically are not Trump country. But the White House interpretation of this is this is President Trump's party, and people who lost didn't hug closely enough to him.\n\nDETROW: The one good counterpoint to that is a surprise Democratic win in South Carolina's 1st Congressional District where the Republican candidate Katie Arrington lost. And that's after, in the primary, she defeated Mark Sanford by basically saying, you're not pro-Trump enough; you do not back the president as much as you should; I will be the Trump candidate. That's how she won the primary. It lost her the general election. Same goes for Dean Heller who made a very dramatic pivot from Trump skeptic to standing onstage next to President Trump in the final week saying, Mr. President, everything you touch turns to gold. That did not keep him a Senate seat.\n\nINSKEEP: Let's note another factor in these results and something that broke in the president's favor or the Republicans' favor. There is the issue of race. The president and his party in many specific places injected race into this campaign in various ways. The president's own aides put out an ad that was deemed so racist that various networks, including Fox, declined to air the ad or stopped airing the ad. And the president went to campaign on behalf of Republicans in Georgia and Florida who were running for governor against African-Americans. And in one case in Florida, he said the African-American running for governor, Andrew Gillum, was not equipped to be governor. A remarkable amount of racial language. We don't know that the president is going to be asked about that at the news conference that we expect shortly at the White House. But it is absolutely in the air that this was part of the campaign. We don't know that it particularly hurt the president anywhere. Where there's an argument to be made, it might've helped the president in a few places whatever that says about the electorate.\n\nDETROW: And the smaller Republican conference in the House by and large lost a lot of the Trump critics, the moderate Republicans who did not like that approach. And you have a Republican Party in both chambers that's now much more in President Trump's image and style of kind of populism and culture wars as opposed to limited government. And at the same time, you have a Democratic Party that is increasingly diverse. A ton of first-time candidates coming in. You have the first Muslim woman elected. You have Indian-Americans coming. You have two women under the age of 30 elected to Congress. So that divide is just increasingly clear of a younger, more diverse demographic Democratic Party and an older and whiter Republican Party.\n\nKING: And yet, we had Republicans on the show this morning saying that they could not figure out why the president throughout these midterms was not hammering harder on how well the economy is doing. And I know that you guys were both out on the trail talking to voters and - as were Steve and I. And it was one of the first things you heard from people who support President Trump. The economy's doing great, so I'm sticking by the guy. And I wonder as we go forward, do you think President Trump will come around to the idea that he should play to his strengths, a low unemployment rate and economy that for the moment is booming in most sectors, many sectors?\n\nKEITH: Well, he starts talking about those things in his rallies. And then he says, oh, that's kind of boring; let's move on. And then goes to the culture war things. You know, happy people are not driven by fear to the polls.\n\nKING: Yeah.\n\nKEITH: And so, you know, this strategy of taking a very hard line, in particular, on immigration is something that has worked for President Trump in 2016. The lesson he's absolutely going to take from these results is that at least in the Senate, it worked in 2018. I have done an analysis of the president's tweet endorsements, though, before he comes out to this press conference and fully declares a great night. Of the 84 candidates that he endorsed - this is House, Senate and governor - 84 that he endorsed, 40 won, 31 lost and 13 races have not yet been called.\n\nINSKEEP: OK.\n\nKING: Wow.\n\nKEITH: So this is not...\n\nINSKEEP: So that's a...\n\nKEITH: ...This is not an overwhelming anything.\n\nINSKEEP: ...Winning NBA season but not exactly overwhelming. Scott Detrow.\n\nDETROW: Even as we approach noon on Wednesday on the East Coast, we have an important election update. Jon Tester in Montana has now gone ahead of his Republican opponent, Matt Rosendale. Rosendale had led all last night, but some of those outstanding districts came in. They were in the Democratic favor. Now, Tester is on pace to maybe retain his seat, so not another Democratic pickup for Republicans.\n\nINSKEEP: Now, I want to note that we're hearing from a number of top officials today. We're awaiting this news conference from President Trump and Nancy Pelosi, who is expected to be the next speaker of the House. The past speaker of the House and the next speaker of the House will be talking sometime after the president, we would anticipate. Mitch McConnell, who remains the Senate leader with a bit larger majority, has spoken to reporters today. And let's listen to a little bit of what Mitch McConnell had to say.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF PRESS CONFERENCE)\n\nMITCH MCCONNELL: The one issue that Leader Pelosi and I discussed this morning is where there could be a possible bipartisan agreement would be something on infrastructure. Look, there'll be a lot of other things. I think it...\n\nINSKEEP: OK. Cut off in the middle there but - so he's talking about a list of possible areas of bipartisan cooperation. And maybe it's actually appropriate, Tamara Keith, that he was cut off.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nKEITH: Well, so here's the thing about infrastructure. Since President Trump won in 2016, Democrats or Republicans have at times said, you know, infrastructure, that could be something where we come together. And it just hasn't happened. You know, President Trump has had something like four different infrastructure theme weeks, which have all turned into very weird weeks completely unrelated to infrastructure. And the real problem with infrastructure - everybody talks about it - is that they agree more or less on maybe building roads. They don't agree on how to fund it. They don't agree on the mix of transit versus, you know, roads...\n\nINSKEEP: Yeah.\n\nKEITH: ...And bridges. And it - you know, there's - although the sort of headline seems like something where there could be room for agreement, you know, transportation bills - big transportation bills that used to be bipartisan haven't been for the last five, six, seven years.\n\nINSKEEP: Let's explain what the partisan divide is here. In the broadest terms, if you're a Republican, you like private funding for highways. And if you're Democratic, you like public funding for trains. That's an oversimplification, but that's kind of where it goes. Is that right?\n\nKEITH: Yeah. Yeah. And maybe gas taxes, too, somewhere in there.\n\nINSKEEP: OK. OK. Mitch McConnell used another phrase I want to ask about, Scott Detrow, presidential harassment.\n\nDETROW: Yes.\n\nINSKEEP: He seems to have said it several times. What does that mean, presidential harassment?\n\nDETROW: Democrats will call that oversight.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nDETROW: McConnell did point something out, though, that - a lot of - I know a lot of Democratic leaders are thinking about, though. He said if you go back to 1998, Republicans, when they had control of the House and Bill Clinton was president, leaned very into presidential harassment, as he put it. Impeachment was the term that they used at the time.\n\nINSKEEP: Well, that's true. Yes.\n\nDETROW: They went full-bore, investigating every nook and cranny of President Clinton's life. And in the end, President Clinton had a 65 percent or so approval rating. And Republicans lost seats in the last midterm. Mitch McConnell brought that up and said that's worth Democrats thinking about. I don't think many - well, in terms of impeachment, I know Democratic leaders are very wary of going down that road. They can look at the result of winning back control of the House of Representatives and say, you know, a lot of the candidates that put us back in control of the House were moderates who focused on local issues, focused on things like health care and kept the idea of trying to impeach President Trump at arm's length. The line from Nancy Pelosi and other top Democrats were, well, we'll just have to see what Robert Mueller's investigation leads to, and we'll go from there. But especially now that Republicans have control of the Senate by larger margins, the idea of going down the road to impeachment would kind of be a bridge to nowhere to use another term from the political past.\n\nINSKEEP: Yeah.\n\nKING: Well, it's interesting, and the results seem to bear that out. I mean, it was centrist Democrats that did really well.\n\nDETROW: Exactly.\n\nKING: The progressive Democrats, the ones who even in - you know, who were willing to invoke the word impeachment, they did not fare as well last night, which really seems to be saying something about - I don't know - maybe some cohesion in the party, some agreement about, you know, things that can be discussed and things that can't.\n\nDETROW: Here's a weird split track, though, on the progressive front. Progressive issues did great. In three Republican states, Medicaid expansion passed as referendum. Several other progressive referendums passed as well. And at the same time, the progressive candidates - the ones who got the most attention at least - did not fare well. So I think a lot of Democrats are trying to sort out what exactly this means for messaging and approach to presidential races among other things.\n\nINSKEEP: Can I just mention - we've all been out and talking with a lot of voters this fall. And you folks can share your experiences, but I'm thinking of people that I spoke with in about four states over the last several weeks. And there were one or two people who raised the Mueller investigation and protecting the Mueller investigation and concern about Russia. But people were much more likely to talk about health care and raise their concerns about Medicare or Medicaid or to talk about how Obamacare benefited them. And that was evident in what the individual candidates were saying, not just the Democrats but the Republicans - because as we've covered on the air, there were a lot of Republicans who, despite their past votes against Obamacare, despite their lawsuits to overturn Obamacare, during the campaign, proclaimed their support for a key provision of Obamacare, the protection of people with pre-existing conditions, which suggests, I think, there are a lot of people - for all the millions of people who are upset about President Trump or profoundly supportive of President Trump, there are a lot of people in this country who are not as engaged or engaged in a different way or would just like something practical out of this situation for their lives or for their country and are thinking in a different way than those who are the most intense partisans.\n\nKING: Well, one of the things I thought was so interesting, Steve, when I was reporting in northern Minnesota in the 8th District there, which flipped to the Republican...\n\nINSKEEP: Yeah.\n\nKING: ...You know, people had a lot of concerns about health care, but they were all over the place. It was really hard to get people to pin down exactly what they were worried about. We heard, you know, I have elderly parents and I'm worried about them, I have kids, I'm worried about losing my insurance. But it really did illustrate how complex health insurance is, how difficult it is to make an issue because everybody's got different worries.\n\nAnd I suppose that's maybe one of the reasons why, you know, the Democrats focus on it. To them, it seemed very productive, but to a lot of Americans, it's just still really confusing, isn't it?\n\nINSKEEP: You've just touched on the reason that it was such a landmine for Democrats to step on when they passed Obamacare in the first place, that it's very difficult to explain what you're doing, it's very difficult to persuade people that it's a good thing for them, and for their neighbors, and for their family members and anybody else.\n\nKEITH: Well, and the interactions that a lot of people have with insurance, at least, are not always very positive. You know, they find out that their insurance is more expensive than they thought or covered less than they thought. And for years, any negative interaction that anyone had with the Affordable Care Act was blamed - or had with their health care system as a whole was blamed on the Affordable Care Act. This cycle, Democrats began trying to turn that around. And in some ways, they succeeded by talking about the positives in a way that they were afraid to do in years' past.\n\nINSKEEP: Well, let's talk about the way that this election has changed the Republican Party. We've already touched on it. Scott Detrow, you were pointing out that some of the more moderate Republicans - or let's just say some of the Republicans who wanted to embrace the demographic changes in the country - lost their seats. Carlos Curbelo in Florida comes to mind. And there are some others we could talk about. Nevertheless, there were some Republicans, obviously, who won big races. And that moves the party in a different direction.\n\nOne classic example comes to mind as we await President Trump's remarks today is in Tennessee, where Bob Corker, who had sometimes been a critic of the president - sometimes a quite sharp critic of the president - retired and is replaced by Marsha Blackburn, who is a lawmaker who has been much more supportive - openly and vocally supportive of the president. So she goes to the United States Senate, which is not only a little more Republican, it appears, but also a little more Trumpy, if that's the proper adjective.\n\nDETROW: Absolutely. Look through all, so far, of the Republicans who have picked off Democratic incumbents in the Senate. Mike Braun in Indiana won his primary by saying, essentially, I am the Donald Trump in this Republican primary field. I'm a businessman. I'm anti-establishment. So on and so forth. Josh Hawley, who defeated Claire McCaskill in Missouri, repeatedly embraced President Trump, repeatedly appeared next to him at rallies, ran a very Trump-focused campaign. You mentioned Marsha Blackburn. It goes on.\n\nSo sub out the Bob Corkers and the Jeff Flakes, who were very quick to criticize President Trump, even though Democrats, especially Democrats living on Twitter, always pointed out that they never really backed up their words with actions. But you're losing several of them. You're gaining people who are going to reflexively back the president on almost everything.\n\nOne area where you may see a pretty early example of what that shifted dynamic means is, if President Trump decides in the coming months that he's had enough of Attorney General Jeff Sessions and decides to fire him or ask for his resignation, I think it's now going to be a lot easier for the Senate to confirm a new attorney general. For most of the past two years, you had Republicans in the Senate signaling to the White House, don't fire Jeff Sessions, we're not going to confirm another attorney general. That dynamic, I think, is gone.\n\nINSKEEP: Some of those Republicans are still there, but some of those Republicans are gone. And there are a few votes to spare. I want to mention that we've been told that we are a minute or so away from President Trump stepping out before this group of reporters and a bank of television cameras in the White House. That is the East Room of the White House. Am I describing that correctly, Tamara Keith?\n\nKEITH: That's correct. That's the East Room. It's a much bigger venue for holding a press conference than the White House Press Briefing Room and tends to be where these - you know, President Trump doesn't like to follow precedent set by his predecessors, but in this case, he is doing exactly what past presidents have done on the day after midterms.\n\nINSKEEP: OK. And as we await the president stepping out, let's just review what has happened, what we have learned in the last 24 hours as the election results have become clear. It is clear that Democrats have won the House. It appears they'll be up around 230 votes for the Democrats in the House. They needed 218 to be a majority. There's still a couple of races we're not entirely sure about. There are a couple of races we're not entirely sure about on the Senate side, but Republicans have clearly gained there.\n\nWe should mention - I think we haven't mentioned much - Democrats won a Senate seat in Nevada. Dean Heller, Republican, is down. We did mention it once or twice here, but it's worth underlining. However, Republicans won in more conservative and rural places - North Dakota and Missouri and Indiana. Scott Detrow?\n\nDETROW: And the Republican candidate in Florida is ahead by the slimmest of margins, and that could be headed to a recount. Recount in Florida - nice flashback for everyone.\n\nKEITH: Oh, my gosh. I'm having flashbacks.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nINSKEEP: It's the way to do it. It's the way - but it's the law in Florida. I mean, Bill Nelson, the Democrat who seems to be on the losing side, has already said, we're heading to a recount. But it appears to be the law if when the counting is done it is less than half a percentage point. Although, it is pretty close to half a percentage point, which is a lot of votes in a state as big as Florida.\n\nDETROW: About 30,000 votes separating them right now.\n\nKING: It does make you wonder. We've talked throughout this midterm campaign season about Republicans who feel like they no longer have a home in the party. You know, we spoke to someone this morning, Max Boot, a former conservative, a former lifelong Republican conservative commentator, who has abandoned the Republican Party and is urging others to do so, as well, because he just cannot abide by President Trump's rhetoric and his behavior. Why don't we play a clip of that? In fact, we don't have that clip from Max Boot. But, Scott, Tam, I'm curious. What happens to Republicans without a party?\n\nKEITH: Wilderness?\n\nKING: Where do they go? Yeah. What does the wilderness look like?\n\nDETROW: Well, I think that's a good question. I think we're going to look to see if any of those Republicans tries to challenge President Trump in the 2020 Republican primaries.\n\nINSKEEP: Someone like Jeff Flake, for example.\n\nDETROW: Or John Kasich, the now outgoing governor of Ohio. They would have a very hard road, but I think a small, vocal handful of Republicans have been so critical of the president but haven't taken that drastic step of actually confronting him in that sort of way.\n\nINSKEEP: We should note presidents like Jimmy Carter, George H.W. Bush, who were incumbents who ran for re-election and had a primary challenge, they weathered the primary challenge. But it signaled their weakness. It was difficult. It cost them a lot of energy, a lot of money. And those two presidents lost in the end.\n\nDETROW: The difference, though, would be that they were challenged from their base side. And this would probably be from the moderate side, the more bipartisan approach.\n\nINSKEEP: And you would have to ask, are those votes even there in a Republican primary, or have they gravitated to the Democratic side?\n\nDETROW: Exactly.\n\nKING: President Trump expected to start speaking in just a couple of minutes. Tam Keith, I wonder. Do you think that the president, when he speaks this morning, will admit to any kind of vulnerability whatsoever? Or is this sheerly going to be, you know, a sort of self-congratulatory talk?\n\nKEITH: I don't think that he would be having a press conference if he felt like he didn't have something positive to say.\n\nKING: Yeah.\n\nKEITH: He is not someone who admits defeat. He is someone who had multiple business bankruptcies and said they were a good thing, that he came out ahead. He, when the health care bill went down, said, oh, no, this is great, this is actually a positive. His approach to life - I was speaking to one of his biographers today - is just not to accept defeat. It's to brand, re-brand and market and say, I'm the winner.\n\nINSKEEP: Re-brand defeat. (Laughter).\n\nDETROW: And that's going to be the key difference here because Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama all walked down that hallway in the White House to the East Room the day after a midterm where they lost control of the House and were contrite and said that I'm willing to work with the other party. I don't think, based on the tweets we've seen this morning, that President Trump is going to strike that tone at all.\n\nKEITH: No. You know, we had George W. Bush say that there was a thumpin'. President Obama said that he got shellacked. And you're simply not going - you know, President Trump is going to say that he defied history.\n\nINSKEEP: And he has always also laid the groundwork, has he not, by pointing out that there were just too many House districts for him to personally campaign for them and what he actually focused on was Senate races? And he didn't win every Senate race that he campaigned in, but he campaigned in some. And we should also take note that for a while there, the president was also campaigning in House races. He campaigned in the 6th district in Kentucky, just to give one example. But later on, when it became very, very clear that Democrats were likely to win the House, he noted his lack of involvement in that particular race.\n\nKEITH: Yeah. In the last week, he really shifted course. Earlier in the month of October, he had been campaigning for House candidates, and then he decided that he wanted to campaign for winners. Or what the White House would say is that he wanted to campaign for candidates that were statewide where he felt like he had a better chance of helping them because these were Trump states.\n\nAnd just to go back to my numbers on this, based on the candidates that he endorsed on Twitter, there are still some undecided races, but his record is 24 and 18 in the House. So 24 wins to 18 losses. In the Senate, he's nine wins to six losses. And with governors, it's 7-7. So there very much is - it's not some overwhelming victory that - I mean, he simply, he did lose a lot of seats, including people that he endorsed.\n\nINSKEEP: Yeah. We should be clear about what's going on here because we mentioned the president's arrival was imminent. That is, in fact, what we were told quite some time ago. A news conference was originally scheduled for about 11:30 eastern time, which is 27 minutes ago. And as soon as that begins, we'll take you to it.\n\nBut meantime, we do have an opportunity to review an awful lot of significant results and races around the country. We've talked about the national level. Perhaps we should talk, while we wait on the president a little bit, about the state level. For starters, Democrats have gained, so far, how many governorships, Scott Detrow? About seven?\n\nDETROW: I'm blanking on the exact number, but there were several seats the Democrats flipped.\n\nINSKEEP: OK. And here's the president of the United States.\n\nCopyright © 2018 NPR.

News Brief: Transition Progresses, ACA Challenge, Biden's Education Plan\n\nBiden team presses on with transition despite Trump's roadblocks. Obamacare likely to survive another challenge in the Supreme Court. And, Biden's education agenda must start by confronting COVID-19.\n\nNOEL KING, HOST:\n\nPresident-elect Joe Biden says President Trump's refusal to accept the outcome of the election is not affecting his transition plans.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF PRESS CONFERENCE)\n\nJOE BIDEN: We're going to be going, moving along in a - in a consistent manner, putting together our administration, the White House and reviewing who we're going to pick for the Cabinet positions. And nothing's going to stop that.\n\nDAVID GREENE, HOST:\n\nBut the Trump campaign and a growing chorus of Republicans keep trying to stop it. There is no evidence of widespread voter fraud, as they allege, but they are insisting that legal challenges have to play out.\n\nKING: White House correspondent Franco Ordoñez has been with Biden and following all of this. Good morning, Franco.\n\nFRANCO ORDOÑEZ, BYLINE: Good morning, Noel.\n\nKING: So we heard it there. President-elect Biden is plowing ahead.\n\nORDOÑEZ: Yeah, he held a press conference yesterday in Wilmington to defend the Affordable Care Act, which is currently before the Supreme Court. And as for the transition, he released a list of agency review teams, and, you know, we just heard he plans to release some Cabinet names before Thanksgiving.\n\nBut he also took some questions from reporters. It was the first time reporters were able to ask him directly about the election and kind of get his take on the president refusing to concede. And as you noted, he says nothing is going to slow down their process even though the Trump administration is blocking his team from receiving things like classified reports and important transition funding. He actually downplayed the idea of taking any legal action to force the matter. And he said the standoff is probably hurting Trump and his legacy more than him.\n\nKING: What did he say about Senate Republicans who, again, in denial of reality, have mostly been backing up President Trump?\n\nORDOÑEZ: Yeah, Biden said he hadn't spoke to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, for example, but that he expects to soon. He was kind of solemn on this note and scolded Republicans about the hold that Trump has on the party. He said they were intimidated by Trump. There are a few - and it seems to be a growing number of Republicans, though - who are breaking with the president. But Biden was asked very directly about how he could work with Republicans who will not even acknowledge him as president-elect. And he just kind of smiled. He said, they will; they will.\n\nKING: Makes you wonder if President Trump was watching that. Have we heard anything from the Trump campaign?\n\nORDOÑEZ: Trump himself has been mostly quiet other than on Twitter. The campaign announced that it was filing a new federal lawsuit in Michigan, seeking to block the certification of election results until a review could be done. And it's just one of a series of legal challenges the campaign is pursuing. Many of them have already failed in a court, as we have reported. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo also took some very pointed questions about the transition from the press yesterday. He insisted there will be a smooth transition - but for a second term of the Trump administration. So they're not giving up yet.\n\nKING: Yeah, Mike Pompeo freaked a lot of people out with that statement yesterday. And there are questions about whether he was joking or being sarcastic. Despite all of the mess in this country, foreign leaders - many foreign leaders seem to have accepted the results. They've been calling Joe Biden. And he's been telling them what exactly?\n\nORDOÑEZ: Yeah. I mean, he's telling them that America's back and that the United States, as he says, is back in the game. Biden has routinely criticized, you know, Trump's America First approach to foreign policy, arguing that acting unilaterally has hurt the United States. He said yesterday that he had talked to six world leaders so far, including Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, President Emmanuel Macron of France and Prime Minister Boris Johnson of the United Kingdom, who was a Trump ally. You know, Trump has yet to concede, but all of them are telling Biden that they look forward to working with him.\n\nKING: NPR White House correspondent Franco Ordoñez.\n\nThanks, Franco.\n\nORDOÑEZ: Thank you.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)\n\nKING: All right. The Affordable Care Act looks like it will survive another challenge in the Supreme Court.\n\nGREENE: That's right. So yesterday, the court signaled that even though Obamacare might have some legal problems, it's unlikely that a majority of justices will vote to throw out the entire law. President-elect Biden talked about the high stakes in this court case.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nBIDEN: This argument will determine whether health care coverage of more than 20 million Americans who acquired it under the Affordable Care Act will be ripped away in the middle of the nation's worst pandemic in a century.\n\nKING: NPR national justice correspondent Carrie Johnson has been following this one. Good morning, Carrie.\n\nCARRIE JOHNSON, BYLINE: Good morning.\n\nKING: All right. So this was the third time that the Supreme Court has heard a significant challenge to the Affordable Care Act. What happened yesterday?\n\nJOHNSON: Texas and a big group of other red states argued that since Congress had zeroed out the financial penalty for not having insurance, also known as the individual mandate, that meant the whole law needed to go. But those arguments got a somewhat chilly reception from two conservative justices. Trump appointee Brett Kavanaugh said flat-out that under court precedent, the bulk of the ACA would be likely to survive. And Chief Justice John Roberts seemed to be a skeptic, too. Here's Roberts.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nJOHN ROBERTS: I think it's hard for you to argue that Congress intended the entire act to fall if the mandate were struck down when the same Congress that lowered the penalty to zero did not even try to repeal the rest of the act. I think, frankly, that they wanted the court to do that, but that's not our job.\n\nJOHNSON: So, Noel, this could just be a matter of simple math. If Kavanaugh and Roberts join the court's three liberals, the bulk of the law would survive.\n\nKING: OK. But did the newest justice, Amy Coney Barrett, offer any indication of what she's thinking on this one - because the ACA kept coming up at her confirmation hearing?\n\nJOHNSON: It did. Justice Barrett asked several questions, mostly on the issue of standing, in essence, whether the red states and some individuals had actually suffered harm or an injury that would give them the right to sue in the first place. But Amy Coney Barrett didn't really give a signal one way or another about how she might vote. Remember; she told Democrats last month she'd made no promises about the health care law and she wasn't hostile to it, even though she's written some critical things about the ACA in the past.\n\nKING: It is notable, Carrie, that this case was filed a couple of years ago, but it's being argued during a global pandemic. So the timing's super interesting. Did that come up at all yesterday?\n\nJOHNSON: You know, the U.S. House of Representatives was there to defend the law. Don Verrilli, their lawyer, raised the issue of health care coverage. And here's what Verrilli told the justices.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nDON VERRILLI: In view of all that has transpired in the past decade - the litigation before this court, the battles in Congress, the profound changes in our health care system - only an extraordinarily compelling reason could justify judicial invalidation of this law at this late date.\n\nKING: OK. But because it's 2020 and everything is topsy-turvy, we have to ask. If the court does pull a surprise and throws out the ACA, what happens next?\n\nJOHNSON: What would happen is President-elect Joe Biden could work with Congress early next year to try to impose some new financial penalty, maybe something small, like a dollar for not having insurance. Biden has talked about wanting to make other, bigger changes to the health care system. Republicans have been fighting the ACA for 10 years now. If the court upholds this law in large part this year, that may be the end of the legal road for a while.\n\nKING: Wow. NPR's Carrie Johnson. Thanks, Carrie.\n\nJOHNSON: My pleasure.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)\n\nKING: During his acceptance speech on Saturday night, President-elect Joe Biden gave many shoutouts, including this one.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nBIDEN: For American educators, this is a great day for you all.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF HORNS HONKING, CHEERING)\n\nBIDEN: You're going to have one of your own in the White House.\n\nGREENE: Biden there was talking about his wife, Jill Biden, who is a long-time English professor at a community college. Now, despite those optimistic words, the state of education, we should say, is troubled in this country. Many schools are holding classes remotely because of the pandemic. Teachers, parents are really frustrated.\n\nKING: Anya Kamenetz is on NPR's education team, and she's been talking to people in and around the Biden transition team. Good morning, Anya.\n\nANYA KAMENETZ, BYLINE: Good morning.\n\nKING: So what is Joe Biden's top priority on education?\n\nKAMENETZ: Well, it's pretty basic. It's getting school doors open safely given the pandemic, and he's called that a national emergency. One recent estimate, Noel, says just about 38% of children right now are in public school districts that are open five days a week. And so that raises a lot of worries about learning losses, social and emotional impacts, especially for young children and those with special needs.\n\nKING: Yeah. I mean, it seems like just about everyone would like to be in school right now or would like to - would like their kids to be in school right now. But there's the pandemic. What can Joe Biden do about that?\n\nKAMENETZ: So one thing experts told me is that, regardless of any legislation or any significant funding getting passed, just more coordination at the federal level would help right away for schools to reopen and stay open, talking about things like tracking cases nationally and getting more coordinated safety guidance, for example. And it's interesting to note from some of the doctors that he's named to his COVID safety task force, they've been really vocal about the need to open schools safely and with proper funding. So, for example, Dr. Zeke Emanuel, who Biden named to his task force, said in an op-ed, being safe is not free.\n\nKING: They need funding, you said. What do they need funding for, and where would the money come from?\n\nKAMENETZ: You know, I think the basic thing is social distancing, which means smaller class sizes, which means teachers and educators. The pandemic's recession has actually forced a lot of educators out of work at the worst possible time. One estimate, about a million educators have been laid off. So education groups have asked for $200 billion in emergency relief, which is a big number at least to be starting with. And if there ends up being a new coronavirus stimulus bill, it could be the biggest education package for - from the federal government in a really long time.\n\nKING: OK. So beyond legislation, because you've been talking to the transition team, what are some other areas of education policy that you think we should have an eye on?\n\nKAMENETZ: Well, the president-elect has pledged often and publicly to appoint an educator as the education secretary. And I talked to Becky Pringle, the president of the National Education Association, the nation's largest teacher union, about what that means.\n\nBECKY PRINGLE: It brings a smile to my face to say it. It seems like something we would take for granted that the secretary of education would be an educator. But no, it is something we have to say out loud.\n\nKAMENETZ: Especially, she says, after four years of Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, who had no professional experience with public school classrooms.\n\nKING: NPR's Anya Kamenetz.\n\nThanks, Anya.\n\nKAMENETZ: Thank you.\n\nCopyright © 2020 NPR.

Trump Takes A Post-Mueller Victory Lap At Michigan Rally\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Manuel Balce Ceneta/AP Manuel Balce Ceneta/AP\n\nUpdated at 11:31 p.m. ET\n\nEditor's note: NPR has decided in this case to spell out a vulgar word that the president used because it meets our standard for use of offensive language: It is absolutely integral to the meaning and spirit of the story being told.\n\nAt his Thursday night rally in Grand Rapids, Mich., President Trump and his supporters were in a celebratory mood.\n\nAfter three years of lies and smears and slander, the Russia hoax is finally dead, Trump said, to loud cheers. The collusion delusion is over.\n\nThe rally was the president's first since the end of special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.\n\nIn touting Mueller's findings, Trump also continued spreading an untruth he has been repeating since the investigation ended.\n\nThe special counsel completed its report and found no collusion and no obstruction, he said.\n\nThat's not accurate. While the investigation did not find that Trump's 2016 campaign conspired with Russia, Attorney General William Barr's summary of the Mueller report said the investigation did not come to a conclusion on obstruction of justice, meaning the president was not exonerated on that matter. But, Barr informed Congress, he and the deputy attorney general concluded the evidence developed by the investigation was not sufficient to establish that Trump had obstructed justice.\n\nThe president also took aim at congressional Democrats who have called for Mueller's report to be released publicly and who have said they will continue investigating the president.\n\nThese are sick people. And there has to be accountability, because it is all lies, and they know it is lies, Trump said, specifically calling out House Judiciary Chairman Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., and House intelligence committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., (whom Trump called little pencil-neck Adam Schiff).\n\nDemocrats will now have to decide whether they will continue defrauding the public with ridiculous bullshit, partisan investigations, Trump also told the Michigan crowd, Or whether they will apologize to the American people.\n\nWhile the Mueller report was the news Trump emphasized first, the president's speech sprawled into many other areas, including this week's renewed push by his administration on health care.\n\nWe're going to get rid of Obamacare, and I said it the other day: The Republican Party will become the party of great health care, he said.\n\nWe will always protect patients with pre-existing conditions, he later added. Always, always.\n\nThat shift to health care caught some congressional Republicans by surprise. In the 2018 midterm elections, Republicans lost dozens of House seats after playing defense on health care. In particular, Democrats attacked Republicans on their Obamacare repeal effort that experts said would have made it more difficult for many with pre-existing conditions to get coverage.\n\nThere was another bit of new material in Trump's speech, when he pledged to get full funding of $300 million for the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative. That initiative protects the Great Lakes environment by promoting clean water and fighting invasive species, among other things.\n\nThis statement came weeks after the administration's budget proposed cutting the $300 million initiative's funding down to $30 million, according to the Detroit Free Press. But, it is actually Congress that determines spending for the federal government so the actual level of funding for the initiative won't be determined until Congress takes its action on appropriations in response to Trump's budget proposal.\n\nTrump also spent time looking ahead to the 2020 election, casting Democrats as radical and socialist and railing against the Green New Deal, a sweeping Democratic plan that would combat climate change and overhaul the economy.\n\nI love campaigning against the Green New Deal, he said. I want them to make that a big part of their platform.\n\nAll this came in a speech that was full of Trump's usual rally staples. He bragged about winning the 2016 election after many commentators predicted he'd lose. He touted the nation's continuing job growth, taking care to cite unemployment rates for minorities. He accused the press of trying to sabotage his presidency. He celebrated his declaration of a national emergency to order to obtain funding to build a wall on the southern border, inspiring a crowd chant of build the wall. He also had applause lines about promoting gun rights and opposing abortion.\n\nIn the crowd, at least one Trump supporter was in high spirits over the results of the Mueller investigation.\n\nIt was a good week, and I'm glad it's over with, and I'm ready to move on, and I think the country's ready to move on, said Colleen Boyer, who said she was attending her first Trump rally. But she added that she didn't care if the report was released.\n\nI'm not that really interested, but if they bring it out, I'll take a look at it, she said.\n\nHowever, some supporters were more enthusiastic.\n\nOh, yeah, everything out in the open, said John DeGroot, who was also attending his first Trump rally. All this stuff should be released.
GUY RAZ, HOST:\n\nIt's the TED Radio Hour from NPR. I'm Guy Raz. And on the show today, ideas about Why We Hate. So I'm assuming you've been hated.\n\nSALLY KOHN: Oh, yes, Guy Raz. I think everyone's been hated. Everyone has been the hater. The question is, who takes responsibility for stopping it?\n\nRAZ: This is Sally Kohn. She's a liberal political commentator for CNN.\n\nKOHN: Yes, I'm a lefty.\n\nRAZ: OK. So by doing that, by putting yourself out there in the world as a left-wing commentator or commentator at all, like, you are going to get haters. It just comes with the territory, right?\n\nKOHN: Yeah. I mean, it probably doesn't help that I started my lefty commentating on Fox News.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nUNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: OK. You two could not be further apart in terms of your opinions of Obamacare. Sally, you love it. Betsy (ph), you can't stand it.\n\nKOHN: You know, that pairing is going to lead to some hating, that probably combined with the whole lesbian thing. Maybe add in the Jewish thing.\n\nRAZ: Yeah.\n\nKOHN: Maybe add in the woman thing, the butch thing. I don't - you know, like, this is really a Choose Your Own Adventure of hate.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nKOHN: It is wrong for anyone to fearmonger by going after...\n\nUNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: That's what the president did.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nRAZ: I mean, you have to be kind of a certain type of person, like, really thick skin to do that. Like, I don't think I would ever go out into the world and tell everybody my opinions because I just don't want to deal with that.\n\nKOHN: Yeah. I'll be honest with you, Guy. I'm not that person. Getting hate mail, getting hate tweets - I never had that experience before in my life. It did catch me completely off guard, socked me in the stomach. And it wasn't, honestly, that I took it personally, I guess. I mean, it was really - I couldn't believe that our society had produced a culture and a climate in which people would go to the trouble of finding the contact information for strangers in order to treat them so badly and be so cruel. That hurt my sense of humanity.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)\n\nKOHN: So I did what all overly intellectual people do when they have a problem they want to understand, and I wrote a book.\n\nRAZ: Sally Kohn picks up her story from the TED stage.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)\n\nKOHN: I wrote a book about hate. Spoiler alert - I'm against it.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nKOHN: So in trying to understand and solve hate, I read every book and every research study I could find. But I also went and talked to some former Nazis and some former terrorists and some former genocidal killers because I figured, if they could figure out how to escape hate, surely the rest of us could. Gordon Allport, the psychologist who pioneered the study of hate in the early 1900s, he developed what he called a scale of prejudice.\n\nAt one end are things like genocide and other bias-motivated violence. But at the other end are things like believing that your in-group is inherently superior to some out-group or, you know, avoiding social interaction with those others. I am defining hate in a broad way because I think we have a big problem. And we need to solve all of it, not just the most extreme.\n\nRAZ: What did you learn about the human impulse to hate, like, in sort of writing this book? Do you think we're wired to hate?\n\nKOHN: So that's a great question. I was desperate to find evidence that we're not wired to hate. And it turns out, we are to an extent. All right. I mean, that's like you and I, way back when in our loincloths, we were sitting in the valley banging our rocks together. And, you know, some strange people we didn't know in their loincloths came up over the hill, and we were afraid of them. And that, over thousands of years, turns into wiring in our brains that makes us fear the other.\n\nBut what's useful here - a metaphor someone uses in the book is the difference between hardware and software. So that's the hardware that we all have. But who we hate is the software. That's been encoded into our brains by society and culture and politics. There's not some part of our DNA that makes us racist. And there's not some synapse that makes us hate Republicans or hate Democrats. That's the software. That's the programming. It's what we've all learned. And that means we can unlearn it.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)\n\nKOHN: People tell me I'm a nice person to the point where it's part of my personal and professional identity that I'm so nice and able to get along with anyone, even my most fierce opponents. But what no one knows is that I was a bully. When I was 10 years old, there was a girl in my class at school named Vicki (ph), and I tormented her mercilessly. Vicki was clearly a troubled kid. She would hit herself and give herself bloody noses, and she had hygiene problems. But instead of helping this girl who was plainly suffering from hardships in her life, we called her sticky Vicki. I called her sticky Vicki.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)\n\nRAZ: So Sally, full disclosure - I know you a little bit, and I know that you are an extremely kind person.\n\nKOHN: Thanks, Guy Raz.\n\nRAZ: So I know this story isn't who you are. And, I mean, you were a kid, right? And lots of kids do mean things. But I guess this thing you did to Vicki, it's always been in the back of your mind.\n\nKOHN: Yeah. It was, it was in my mind, but sort of pushed to the edges.\n\nRAZ: Yeah.\n\nKOHN: And it was when I was at Fox and really started getting hate mail and sort of had these - like, who - what kind of person would pick on someone for no good reason? And it was as though the edges of my mind sort of knocked on my conscience and said, oh, hey, wait; you - you're that kind of person; you've done it, too. And it started to haunt me more and more that I thought of myself as a good person.\n\nRAZ: Yeah.\n\nKOHN: And, you know, the reality is, good people do horrible things.\n\nRAZ: Especially kids.\n\nKOHN: Especially kids, but especially adults, too. You know, one of the things that struck me in the book the most was when a philosopher said to me, you know, we don't have mass atrocities in the world because of a handful of psychopaths. There aren't enough psychopaths in Rwanda or Germany or Serbia. We have mass atrocities because masses of people participate in them. And we tend to think those are different people than us, than the good people. And part of it is breaking down this idea that there are good people and bad people. There are people. And we can do good things, and we can do bad things. And the problem is, right now, we have too many excuses, even in small, petty ways that seemingly, you know, aren't that bad, but add up to a culture and a climate that is cruel and allows greater inhumanities and injustices to fester. And we don't see ourselves as complicit in that.\n\nRAZ: What do you think the opposite of hate is?\n\nKOHN: I don't think it's love - not in the sense that we tend to understand that, anyway, because you don't actually have to love someone to not hate them. You don't even have to like them. What I think we have to understand is, in spite of our differences and our disagreements, we share a common humanity. And recognizing that connection, promoting policies and institutional changes and structures that respect that connection and treat people equally is the opposite of hate.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)\n\nKOHN: Let me give you just one example in the West Bank. When Bassam Aramin was 16 years old, he tried to blow up an Israeli military convoy with a grenade. He failed, fortunately, but he was still sentenced to seven years in prison. When he was in prison, they showed a film about the Holocaust. Now, up until that point, Bassam had thought the Holocaust was mostly a myth. But when he saw what really happened, he broke down crying. And eventually, after prison, Bassam went on to get a master's degree in Holocaust studies, and he founded an organization where former Palestinian combatants and Israeli combatants come together, try to find common ground.\n\nBy his own account, Bassam used to hate Israelis. But through knowing Israelis, and learning their stories and working together for peace, he overcame his hate. And Bassam says he still doesn't hate Israelis, even after the Israeli military shot and killed his 12-year-old daughter, Abir, while she was walking to school. Bassam even forgave the soldier who killed his daughter.\n\nRAZ: You know, I'm going to say something that might upset people listening and maybe even you, Sally, which is, I was really moved by the story of Bassam, but I also - I've had a hard time identifying with it. I mean, his child was killed, and he forgave the soldier who killed his daughter and sort of flushed hatred out of his system, which is remarkable and, of course, laudable. But what does that get Bassam?\n\nKOHN: I mean, I have the same struggle, I think, you do. I don't think I could do that.\n\nRAZ: Yeah. Right.\n\nKOHN: In an even more tangible way, I had the experience of being in Rwanda, sitting with a woman who - a Tutsi woman who had invited into her home her neighbor, a man she calls her friend, who had murdered her husband and children. And to watch her talk with him, laugh with him, welcome him in her home, serve him tea - I don't know that I'm capable of that. There is also a part of it that feels unjust, that - it feels it's asking too much of those from whom so much has been taken, those who've been oppressed and victimized. What I walk away with is, we as people are capable not only of brutality and cruelty and injustice, but also compassion and kindness and forgiveness. That, to me, is remarkable and endlessly hopeful.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)\n\nKOHN: The entire time I was traveling around the Middle East and Rwanda and across the United States, hearing these unbelievable stories of people in communities who had left entire histories of hate behind, I was still looking for Vicki. It was so hard to find her, in fact, that I hired a private investigator, and he found her. her. A year after I began my journey, I wrote Vicki an apology. And a few months later, she wrote back. I'm not going to lie, I wanted to be forgiven - I wasn't. She offered me sort of conditional forgiveness. What she wrote was - messages such as yours cannot absolve you of your past actions. The only way to do that is to improve the world, prevent others from behaving in similar ways and foster compassion. And Vicki's right, which is why I am here. Thank you.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nRAZ: Sally Kohn. She's a political commentator for CNN and author of the book The Opposite Of Hate: Field Guide To Repairing Our Humanity. You can see Sally's full talk at ted.com.\n\n[POST-BROADCAST CORRECTION: In Sally Kohn's TED talk, she says that Bassam Aramin's daughter was 12 years old when she was killed walking to school. Bassam's daughter was actually 10 years old when she was killed walking from school.]\n\nCopyright © 2018 NPR. All rights reserved.

Religion, Abortion, Guns And Race. Just The Start Of A New Supreme Court Menu\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption J. Scott Applewhite/AP J. Scott Applewhite/AP\n\nIn January, the U.S. Supreme Court embarks on the second half of a term with a fortified 6-to-3 conservative majority. But unlike the first half of the term, there will be no norm-busting President Trump often railing at the court's election decisions. In tone, President Biden probably will be the functional opposite, but his policies are likely to be greeted with more skepticism.\n\nFor decades, the court's five-justice conservative majority was split between those who wanted to move slowly in a more conservative direction and others who wanted to move more aggressively. But now, with the more centrist conservatives retired and three Trump appointees on the court, there is a conservative supermajority of six, meaning one vote to spare.\n\nNo longer, as during the last term, does the reliably conservative but more incrementalist Chief Justice John Roberts have the controlling vote. The other five can now prevail without him.\n\nBottom line: The current court may well turn out to be the most conservative since the 1930s.\n\nOn religion, abortion, gun rights and race, for example, there is a solid majority to change the law and ... move whip quick, says Supreme Court advocate and SCOTUSblog publisher Tom Goldstein.\n\nObamacare and religion\n\nAlready argued this term, but not decided yet, are two big cases. One tests whether the Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare, must be struck down entirely because one provision — the so-called mandate — was eliminated by Congress. But the law, including the mandate, has already been upheld twice before by the high court.\n\nRepublicans in Congress have failed dozens of times to kill the ACA, even when they controlled the House, the Senate and the White House. In the meantime, Obamacare has become a very popular program, and if the court were to declare the entire law invalid at this late date, Republicans could end up in the position of a dog that chases the car for years and finally catches it. It could be bloody.\n\nThe other case heard earlier this term tests whether the city of Philadelphia may refuse to award some foster care contracts to Catholic Social Services because CSS, based on religious objections, refuses to screen LGBT couples, as required by the city's anti-discrimination laws.\n\nThe tea leaves, as of now, indicate CSS will win. If so, the power of government to make contracts — the one area long viewed as relatively immune to religious challenges — would become fair game for religious objectors.\n\nIt would be quite a significant departure from what the court might have done 15 or 20 years ago, observes professor Josh Blackman of South Texas College of Law Houston and co-author of An Introduction to Constitutional Law: 100 Supreme Court Cases Everyone Should Know.\n\nA decision in favor of CSS would also be quite a departure from the court's 1990 decision written by conservative icon Antonin Scalia. That 6-to-3 ruling declared that a valid and neutrally applied law is constitutional even if it has some incidental negative effects on some religious groups. As Scalia put it back then, allowing exceptions to every state law or regulation affecting religion would open the prospect of constitutionally required religious exemptions from civic obligations of almost every conceivable kind.\n\nStill, the current court appears headed in the direction that Scalia warned against. Indeed, even before the confirmation of Justice Amy Coney Barrett, there was a firm conservative majority in religious liberty cases.\n\nThe only religious liberty case in which Chief Justice Roberts split with fellow conservatives involved the public health measures that governors have taken during the pandemic. Early on, Roberts sided with the liberals in allowing governors to limit attendance at religious services in order to curb the spread of the coronavirus. But that was before the death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.\n\nIn what could be a harbinger of things to come, Roberts' vote became irrelevant after Barrett joined the court and provided a fifth vote against Gov. Andrew Cuomo's actions in New York. Similar orders limiting church and synagogue attendance were soon struck down.\n\nExecutive power\n\nOn a different question, the executive power of the presidency, the Supreme Court's conservative majority has generally deferred to Trump's muscular assertions of presidential power. So, will the conservative court majority be similarly deferential to Biden?\n\nI think the short answer is no, says University of Texas law professor Stephen Vladeck. Some of that is going to reflect ... the fact that the court will be more suspicious and skeptical of some of the policies that the Biden administration attempts to pursue by executive order.\n\nSCOTUSblog's Goldstein agrees, noting that historically, the Supreme Court's view about whether a president has powers [to do certain things] has tended to track whether the justices in the majority like the president and his policies. Goldstein adds that it will be really fascinating to see whether a court that has breathed more life into presidential powers will stick with that even if they don't like the policies of a much more liberal president.\n\nBoth Goldstein and Vladeck note, however, that the conservative majority has been cutting back on the regulatory power of administrative agencies to carry out objectives spelled out in legislation. That trend, they observe, is likely to increase, making it more difficult for agencies to make rules carrying out everything from environmental to consumer protection laws.\n\nThis term is like an iceberg, says Goldstein. There are big cases above the surface, like the ACA case. But below the surface, there are cases being pushed by big business that could make it hard for the little guy to go to court and harder for agencies to enact regulations. If big business prevails, he maintains, it'll be an earthquake in terms of consequences.\n\nAbortion and guns\n\nOn the hot-button issues of abortion, guns and race, the court's conservative majority is most likely to start moving aggressively next term and thereafter.\n\nWill Roe v. Wade, the court's 47-year-old abortion rights precedent, be overturned? There are two schools of thought on that. One is that the court will systematically hollow out the right to abortion so that it is a right on paper only.\n\nThe other school of thought is that leaving Roe a shell is not enough for those opposed to abortion. There is, I think, a galvanizing view within the pro-life movement that the time has come to call the question, observes New York University law professor Melissa Murray.\n\nIf Roe is to be overturned, however, it likely will take more than a year or two to come to fruition. Former Obama-era Solicitor General Donald Verrilli has said that he thinks it likely will happen within five years or so.\n\nOn guns, though, the court looks — for the first time — to have a clear majority that is hostile to gun regulation. Last term, the court once again punted, and punted again on the issue, declining to hear 10 gun-rights cases. Presumably, Chief Justice Roberts' then-deciding vote was still in doubt.\n\nBut now, with Barrett newly on the court and Ginsburg gone, there appear to be five conservative votes ready to march down the path of expansive gun rights, and Second Amendment activists are teeing up new cases.\n\nI can tell you people are getting more aggressive, says professor Blackman, a gun-rights advocate. Gun-rights groups are emboldened to try to push new frontiers now.\n\nElection cases and race plus affirmative action\n\nElection cases are also before the court, though none that will undo Trump's defeat. But, left over from Trump's fight, there is a possible case from Pennsylvania testing whether state supreme courts have the authority to interpret state laws and state constitutions in federal elections. The justices declined to review the case prior to the election — and affected ballots, relatively few in number, would not have changed the outcome. But the justices may yet agree to hear the case to resolve the issue.\n\nAlso on the docket are cases involving state laws that make it more difficult to vote. In 2013, the high court struck down a key part of the Voting Rights Act. Roberts confidently wrote, Our country has changed, and he said that the protections in the law were no longer needed. Within days, though, Republican-dominated state legislatures in the South began writing new laws that made it, once again, more difficult to vote, and they started redrawing legislative lines to further limit minority influence in state and federal legislatures.\n\nSo, will that reality on the ground have any influence in the current voting rights cases before the court? No, say voting rights experts.\n\nUT's Vladeck says that while the current court did hold the line against Trump's post-election attempts to change the outcome, the court's conservatives believe states should be free to enact pre-election laws that restrict early voting and voting by mail, while at the same time allowing states to purge voting roles and tighten voter ID requirements. The conservative majority does not see such restrictions as aimed at intentionally stacking the deck against poor and minority voters.\n\nFor the chief justice and easily a majority of this conservative Supreme Court, their views about race are fully baked, says SCOTUSblog's Goldstein.\n\nIn the same vein, by next term the court will likely hear arguments in one of several cases testing affirmative action in higher-education admissions. The court, for a half-century, has repeatedly ruled that some consideration of race in college admissions is permissible, but a racial quota is not.\n\nBut now, there may well be a conservative majority to reverse those rulings and bar all consideration of racial diversity in college admissions. After that, affirmative action in employment could be next.\n\nIn the coming year, other key developments also could shape the Supreme Court's future.\n\nRetirements on the horizon?\n\nEighty-two-year-old Justice Stephen Breyer, one of the court's three remaining liberals, could step down. But he may feel constrained by the fact that Republicans currently control the U.S. Senate, and GOP leader Mitch McConnell has never hesitated to use his power as Senate majority leader to block or advance Supreme Court nominees based solely on whether the nominating president is a fellow Republican or a Democrat.\n\nSo, Breyer might stay his hand. If, however, the Democrats win two Senate seats in Georgia in January, giving Democrats the upper hand in the Senate for the first time in 10 years, Breyer may well pull the trigger on retirement.
Lightning Fill In The Blank\n\nAll the news we couldn't fit anywhere else.\n\nPETER SAGAL, HOST:\n\nTime for our final game, Lightning Fill In The Blank. Each of our players will have 60 seconds in which to answer as many fill-in-the-blank questions as they can. Each correct answer now worth two points. Bill, can you give us the scores?\n\nBILL KURTIS: I sure can. Peter has two. Roxanne and Roy each have three.\n\nSAGAL: All right.\n\nSAGAL: So that means Peter is in third place. And you're up first.\n\nPETER GROSZ: Great.\n\nSAGAL: The clock will start when I begin your first question, Peter. Fill in the blank. After assurances that the cease-fire in Syria was permanent, the White House announced it was lifting sanctions on blank.\n\nGROSZ: Turkey.\n\nSAGAL: Right.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF BELL)\n\nSAGAL: On Monday, Israeli Prime Minister blank said that he had failed to form a new coalition government.\n\nGROSZ: Netanyahu.\n\nSAGAL: Right.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF BELL)\n\nSAGAL: This week, lawmakers in Hong Kong officially scrapped a blank bill that has prompted pro-democracy protests.\n\nGROSZ: Extradition.\n\nSAGAL: Right.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF BELL)\n\nSAGAL: Last weekend, President Trump reversed his plans to host the blank at his luxury golf club near Miami.\n\nGROSZ: Ha-ha. G7.\n\nSAGAL: Right.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF BELL)\n\nSAGAL: In order to redirect around a 65-foot-long road closure, officials in Britain blanked.\n\nGROSZ: Gave up.\n\nSAGAL: No. They created a 41-mile-long detour.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nSAGAL: On Sunday, Francis Ford Coppola joined Martin Scorsese in criticizing the blank movie franchise.\n\nGROSZ: Marvel.\n\nSAGAL: Yes.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF BELL)\n\nSAGAL: On Tuesday, former President blank was hospitalized with a fracture after falling in his home.\n\nGROSZ: Jimmy Carter.\n\nSAGAL: Right. He was...\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF BELL)\n\nSAGAL: ...Released on Thursday.\n\nGROSZ: Yes.\n\nSAGAL: A man in Illinois trying to avoid arrest gave...\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF GONG)\n\nSAGAL: ...Police a false name but was caught when officers noticed blank.\n\nGROSZ: The name he gave was his name.\n\nSAGAL: No.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nSAGAL: He was caught when they saw that he had his real name tattooed on his neck.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nSAGAL: Matthew Bushman was wanted for forgery. And when police attempted to arrest him, he gave the cops a fake name. That probably would have worked if Bushman did not have his full name tattooed in giant letters on his neck. It also didn't help that he was also wearing a nametag from a recent forgers convention...\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nSAGAL: ...That said, hello, my name is guilty.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nSAGAL: Bill, how did Peter do on our quiz?\n\nKURTIS: Real good - six right, 12 more points, total of 14. He is in the lead.\n\nSAGAL: Very well done, Peter. Now...\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nSAGAL: ...We flipped a coin. And Roy has elected to go next. Roy, fill in the blank. On Tuesday, Britain's Parliament rejected a request to fast track a deal on blank.\n\nROY BLOUNT JR: Brexit.\n\nSAGAL: Right.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF BELL)\n\nSAGAL: On Monday, Democrats blocked a GOP effort to censure House Intelligence Chair blank.\n\nBLOUNT JR: Schiff.\n\nSAGAL: Right.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF BELL)\n\nSAGAL: For the second week, PG&E cut power to customers in California to reduce risk of blank.\n\nBLOUNT JR: Risk of fires.\n\nSAGAL: Right.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF BELL)\n\nSAGAL: A university student in Bangladesh was busted this week when she hired blank to take her exams.\n\nBLOUNT JR: Hunter Biden.\n\nSAGAL: No.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nSAGAL: She hired eight look-alikes to take her exams. On Monday, the last trailer for the ninth and final movie in the blank series was released.\n\nBLOUNT JR: Superman.\n\nSAGAL: No. The Star Wars series...\n\nBLOUNT JR: Oh.\n\nSAGAL: ...At least the Skywalker saga to be specific. In order to keep them from cheating, a college in India...\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF GONG)\n\nSAGAL: ...Had students blank during tests.\n\nBLOUNT JR: They had hung a scimitar. One of those...\n\nSAGAL: No.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nSAGAL: They had students - during this test to keep them from cheating, they had students wear cardboard boxes on their heads. A recent picture showed university students taking an exam while wearing these cardboard boxes with small cut out eye holes presumably to keep students from looking to their left or right and cheating off the person next to them. Or maybe just every student had ended up with a bad Halloween costume. The school has since apologized for doing this to their students.

Olympic Track Star Rebukes Sponsorship Pay Penalties For Pregnant Athletes\n\nMICHEL MARTIN, HOST:\n\nAlysia Montano is an Olympian and a U.S. champion. You might remember her as the pregnant runner. She competed in 2014 when she was eight months pregnant with her first child. Two weeks ago, Montano made headlines again when, in a video for The New York Times, she called out the sports industry in general and sponsors like Nike and ASICS in particular for cutting off pay and health benefits to female athletes when they take time off to give birth and recover. That encouraged other women athletes to speak out about their experiences with sponsors. We called Montano to ask her to tell us more, starting with the financial realities of competing in track and field.\n\nALYSIA MONTANO: We're not paid a huge salary by a league at all. Instead, our income comes almost exclusively from sponsorship deals with inked apparel companies, like Nike and ASICS, that keeps them bound for three to five years. And we don't get rich.\n\nMARTIN: No, point taken. Well, when you decided to have a baby, like, what happened? I mean, did you tell your contact at Nike? Did your agent speak to them? Like, what happened?\n\nMONTANO: Back in 2012, I just finished the Olympic year. And I finished fifth at the Olympics. I noted hey, you know, you guys, it's - I'm looking at my contract here, and there aren't any protections in place. And they would not provide me with what would happen to me. That led us to kind of seeking out other options. ASICS came into play and kind of stated the same thing. Hey, I plan on expanding my family. ASICS at the time had said, we appreciate full athletes. Come over here. And so I did. I finished a year with them in which I finished with a bronze medal at world championships.\n\nAnd so in that off-year, I'd hoped that we would conceive and be able to have our daughter and return to the sport. And I did conceive. I did have my daughter. And my daughter was two months old. And I got a phone call that said, I want to talk about your contracts in regard to your performance this year - which means - you mean the year that I've been with child? And then I was - my payment was reduced.\n\nMARTIN: And what about your health benefits? I mean, that was another thing that emerged in the reporting on this is that there are athletes whose health insurance was terminated. And I can't think a very thing - many things more frightening than either being pregnant or having a child or having a newborn with no health insurance - summarily terminated. So what about you? Did you at least have health insurance to cover the delivery or the postpartum period?\n\nMONTANO: Yes. So the way that it works is a tier system. The luck that I did have with my daughter was I fell within the tier system because I made the Olympic team in 2012, and the protection was there for me. Now, if I didn't make the Olympic team in 2012 and I became pregnant, I would lose my health insurance. My point and my stance is this should not be because I am an Olympian. This needs to be something that is in place for women athletes regardless.\n\nMARTIN: I mean, this whole question of women and their reproductive choices is very much in the news right now. And I just have to ask you very directly, do you feel that you are getting messages from your sport that if you want to be a top-tier athlete, you should not have children?\n\nMONTANO: Yes, absolutely. Before I had my daughter, I had a few examples of women that I looked up to who had returned to sport. I was very excited about - one of them being Kara Goucher. She talked about the difficult part of her motherhood and in resuming training and how she went on all these unpaid appearances with Nike. And her son ends up being extremely ill. And she, you know, she ends up having to leave him while he was dangerously ill to go compete at a race to restart her pay.\n\nAnd that, to me, is a very strong message, like, your family is not first. Running and the sport is first regardless of - and also, we want you to prove to us, are you as focused, are you as dedicated? And the message is being sent that, if you're a serious athlete, you do not want to be a mother, and motherhood is not for serious athletes.\n\nMARTIN: Before we let you go, I do have to ask. There are those who will say it just isn't their job. In fact, this is an argument that came up during the discussions over reauthorizing the Affordable Care Act or Obamacare. There were those who said during testimony well, you know, I'm a man, why should I pay for maternity benefits? It's not my problem. It has nothing to do with me. So for people who feel that way, that, you know what, it's a private decision, there isn't any broader social responsibility to support this. You know, what would you say?\n\nMONTANO: Of course that's what somebody would say that. It's oozing with privilege, right? When we look at women's issues, women's rights, this is a scope in which a man should not have any say on. And I think that it's so asinine for people to - men in particular - to think, like, this is a personal issue. This is something that is true in the world. It's - it can only happen to women. Men will never have to face pregnancy ever. And the people who are going to talk about policies and these protections are going to be men.\n\nMARTIN: Is it true that all the people who negotiate these contracts at Nike are men?\n\nMONTANO: They're all men that are - within house at Nike have been and are all men. It's an old boys club. The culture at Nike is - that's - it remains to be an old boys club. And this is the time for it to be exposed. You know, the time is now.\n\nMARTIN: That was Olympian and former USA champion Alysia Montano. Alysia Montano, thank you so much for talking to us.\n\nMONTANO: Thank you so much for having me.\n\nMARTIN: After we spoke with Montano, two news organizations reported that a Nike vice president, in a memo to staff, said the company was eliminating a performance requirement for 12 months for those athletes who decide to have a baby.\n\nSo we called Alysia Montano back to get her reaction. And she told us she wants to acknowledge movement on this issue, but she has not yet seen an actual contract. She says she wants to make sure Nike writes this protection into the contracts of new and current female athletes because, she says, track and field athletes tend to sign contracts before they are the age in which women typically start thinking about having families, and by the time they do, they are locked into contracts without protections for maternity leave.\n\nCopyright © 2019 NPR.

A Lifetime Investment: Big Money Pours Into Supreme Court Battle\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Zach Gibson/AFP/Getty Images Zach Gibson/AFP/Getty Images\n\nPresident Trump hasn't yet nominated a replacement for Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy, but the fight over confirming that nominee began the day Kennedy gave notice.\n\nThe Judicial Crisis Network, a conservative nonprofit, posted an online ad slamming the extremists who will lie and attack the nominee. It warned, But don't be fooled. President Trump's list [of potential nominees] includes the best of the best.\n\nJudicial Crisis Network YouTube\n\nTo wage this high-decibel debate, each side is expected to spend tens of millions of dollars. That kind of money can win you a Senate seat. But a Senate term only goes for six years; the Supreme Court bench is good for a lifetime.\n\nThe ads, of course, will get more specific once Trump names a nominee on July 9 — and Democrats have begun their attacks.\n\nWe've seen that this has become part of their playbook, to do character assassination and distortions of people's records, said Carrie Severino, chief counsel and policy director of the Judicial Crisis Network. We want to make sure there's someone there to defend the nominee, who is not really in a position to defend him or herself.\n\nSo the Judicial Crisis Network, which pledged $10 million to win confirmation for Justice Neil Gorsuch last year, is gearing up again. Plenty of other groups are mobilizing too: the Koch brothers' Americans for Prosperity, which said it's prepared to commit seven figures, the anti-abortion Susan B. Anthony Fund, Heritage Action and others.\n\nSeverino said, There are well over 100 different organizations — grassroots groups — on the center-right-libertarian, who are very excited about this nomination.\n\nThe obvious flashpoint on the nomination is the 1973 ruling Roe v. Wade, which legalized abortion nationwide. Kennedy has upheld abortion rights, while Trump promised justices who will overturn Roe.\n\nAdrienne Kimmell, vice president of NARAL Pro-Choice America, said the organization's 1.5 million members will be contacting senators. Any nominee that they vote on of Trump's is a vote to overturn Roe, Kimmell said. That is our focus, to ensure that that message is communicated.\n\nThe group published a web video after Kennedy's announcement to press the point.\n\nNARAL Pro-Choice America YouTube\n\nSupreme Court nominees are almost always confirmed. Senate Republicans are looking to waste no time and put a new justice in place by the time the new court term begins in early October.\n\nBut some liberal groups say this won't be like other confirmation fights, and they hope to put the future of the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, at the center.\n\nAt the Leadership Conference, an umbrella group of more than 200 organizations supporting civil and human rights, executive vice president for policy Kristine Lucius said, This president, different than others, has clear litmus tests, and has a short list of 25 nominees who have all passed those litmus tests. And two of those litmus tests go directly to access to health care — that is, abortion rights and the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe Leadership Conference points to an interview Trump gave to Boston public radio station WGBH early in 2016. He discussed litmus tests for new Supreme Court justices.\n\nWe're going to have a very strong test, but we want good, strong conservative people that are extremely smart, Trump said. Referring to Chief Justice John Roberts, a Republican appointee, he said, I'm disappointed in Roberts 'cause he gave us Obamacare. You know he had two chances to end Obamacare. He should have ended it by every single measure and he didn't do it. So that was a very disappointing one.\n\nIf health care is in the debate, Lucius said the battle will look less like other confirmations, and more like Trump's attempts to repeal Obamacare, which the Senate rejected last year.\n\nShe said opposition to the nominee would become bipartisan. I think you're going to see more passion, more people demanding the Senate say, 'No.'
Supreme Court Takes Up Birth-Control Conscience Case\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption J. Scott Applewhite/AP J. Scott Applewhite/AP\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court says it will consider whether employers should be allowed to opt out of providing contraceptive coverage to their workers because of moral or religious objections.\n\nAt issue are Trump administration regulations allowing employers to claim such exemptions to the contraceptive insurance coverage mandate in the Affordable Care Act, which requires most employer-provided plans to include birth control coverage without a copay. Churches and other religious organizations already can opt out of the requirement, but the Trump administration has sought to expand that exemption to include a wider array of businesses and organizations.\n\nPennsylvania and New Jersey challenged the Trump administration regulation and won a nationwide injunction temporarily blocking the rules.\n\nBrigitte Amiri, an attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union's Reproductive Freedom Project, called the Trump administration rules an attempt to rob people of their contraception coverage. The ACLU filed an amicus brief in the case opposing the Trump rule.\n\nIt's not the first time the Supreme Court has considered the issue. In 2014, the court sided with the conservative Christian owners of the national craft chain Hobby Lobby in a case challenging the contraceptive mandate on religious grounds.\n\nAmiri said that this case goes further and that it's hard to predict how many employees could be affected if the court sides with the administration.\n\nWhat we're talking about is very concrete and fundamental to people's daily lives, Amiri said. Nobody should be at risk of losing their contraceptive coverage because of where they work or where they go to school.\n\nKristen Waggoner, an attorney with the religious liberty group the Alliance Defending Freedom, said the case could have far-reaching implications for other businesses and organizations that oppose providing contraception through their health plans.\n\nThey're not interfering [with employees' choices], Waggoner said. This is about whether a person can run their business in a way that's consistent with their beliefs.\n\nWaggoner's group is representing the anti-abortion rights group the March for Life in a related case that is also working its way through the legal system.\n\nIt's about the right of all religious organizations and people of faith, and those who believe that life begins at conception, not to believe that they believe is the taking of human life, Waggoner said.\n\nIn a statement, Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro said, Two federal courts have blocked the Trump Administration's rules because they would allow virtually any employer to deny women access to contraception for any reason—including the belief that women should not be in the workforce and expressed hope that the Supreme Court would ultimately strike down the rules.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Health and Human Services declined to comment on pending litigation.
Obama Argues Against Dark Worldview, Defends Health Care Law\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Jamie McCarthy/Getty Images Jamie McCarthy/Getty Images\n\nFormer President Barack Obama delivered a rebuke of President Trump's America First worldview Wednesday in New York, the same city where Trump is meeting with world leaders on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly.\n\nYou have to start with a premise and believe that multilateral institutions and efforts are important, Obama said, and you don't have to cede all your sovereignty and it doesn't make you less patriotic to believe that. You just have to have some sense — and read.\n\nHe also offered a vigorous defense of his signature health care law, the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, as Senate Republicans in Washington, D.C., try to corral the final votes needed to pass their latest effort to repeal and replace it.\n\nIt is aggravating, the former president said of watching yet another repeal effort, and all of this being done without any ... rationale, it frustrates. And it is certainly frustrating to have to mobilize every couple of months to prevent our leaders from imposing real human suffering on our constituents.\n\nThough he did not name Trump during his speech and a question-and-answer session that followed, Obama argued against a dark and pessimistic world outlook.\n\nWe have to reject the notion that we are suddenly gripped by forces that we cannot control, Obama said at a Goalkeepers conference, a gathering of young, international activists sponsored by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (which is among NPR's financial supporters). [We've] got to embrace the longer and more optimistic view of history and the role that we play in it. And if you are skeptical of such optimism, I will say something that may sound controversial. ... By just about every measure, America is better and the world is better than it was 50 years ago, 30 years ago, or even 10 years ago. And I know that statement doesn't jibe with the steady stream of bad news and cynicism that we're fed through television and Twitter. But it's true. Think about it: I was born at a time, for example, when women and people of color were systematically excluded from big chunks of American life. ... Even if we still have miles to travel and innumerable laws and hearts and minds to change, the shift in what this country is and what it means is astonishing, remarkable and it's happened, when you measure it against the scope of human history [snaps fingers] in an instant.\n\nWatch Obama's Full Remarks The Gates Foundation via YouTube\n\nObama argued that crime, teen birth, dropout, poverty and uninsured rates are all down; and that the share of those with college degrees is up, as are median incomes and life expectancies. He also contended that democratic and civil rights — like the right to vote and the right to marry — have expanded for women, ethnic and racial minorities and gays and lesbians.\n\nAll of this has happened in such a steady march that sometimes we have a tendency to take it for granted, Obama said.\n\nHe added, If you had to choose any moment in history in which to be born, and you didn't know in advance whether you're going to be male or female, what country you're going to be from, what your status was, you'd choose right now because the world has never been healthier or wealthier or better educated or in many ways more tolerant or less violent than it is today.\n\nThat Yes, we can optimism stands in stark contrast to the nostalgia signified by Trump's Make America Great Again slogan. The current occupant of the White House rose to prominence and power by selling millions of Americans on a vision of America and the world now as dark and scary places.\n\nPart of how Trump did that was by channeling their cultural anxieties. Obama hat-tipped to that rising feeling of grievance as a critical problem in the world, describing it as the rise of nationalism and xenophobia and a politics that says it's not 'we' but 'us and them,' a politics that threatens to turn people away from the kind of collective action that's always driven human progress.

FACT CHECK: Trump On Not Expanding Insurance, Democrats And Health Care\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Mandel Ngan/AFP via Getty Images Mandel Ngan/AFP via Getty Images\n\nPresident Trump was asked Wednesday why his administration hasn't reopened the healthcare.gov exchanges to help bridge the insurance coverage gap for those who do not have private insurance and who do not qualify for Medicaid.\n\nThere will be people who don't have insurance who get sick before any of these mitigation efforts are put into place, Fox News' John Roberts asked at the coronavirus task force briefing. Without opening the health care exchanges, where can they find insurance? People who aren't insured by these companies that are covering the cost of the copays, where can people go now to get health insurance if/before they get sick?\n\nVice President Mike Pence responded first, with a non-answer that praised the president for forging relationships with health insurance companies and cited expanded coverage under Medicaid for coronavirus testing and treatment.\n\nBut his response didn't address people who had lost their jobs but wouldn't qualify for Medicaid. A senior administration official confirmed to NPR that a federal special enrollment period for healthcare.gov was not being considered.\n\nTrump seemed to chuckle at Pence's quasi-filibuster.\n\nI think it's one of the greatest answers I've ever heard. Because Mike was able to speak for five minutes and not even touch your question. That's what you call a great professional, Trump said.\n\nBut he followed up by saying it's a fair question and is something we're really going to look at because it doesn't seem fair.\n\nThe president then seemed to imply that Democrats haven't been focused on this issue.\n\nThey're talking about it in the 2020 election too and nobody's gotten to it. Nobody's talked about it at all. I think we're going to get to it. I don't think the other group will get to it. They haven't even spoken about it, he said.\n\nIf by the other group he means Democrats, then he's flat-out wrong.\n\nThe entire primary season for Democrats has had health care at its forefront, with proposals to either build on the Affordable Care Act (commonly referred to as Obamacare) or go further with some form of Medicare for All.\n\nVermont Sen. Bernie Sanders has been holding virtual roundtable discussions where he continues to push for a system of universal health care.\n\nIn fact, Sanders has argued that his ideas, particularly on expanding health care coverage, are gaining more resonance within the country, in part because of this coronavirus pandemic.\n\nPeople might not have thought that the United States Congress, the Republican president, the Republican Senate would do what they did, Sanders said in an interview with Morning Edition's Noel King, referring to the historic passage of the $2 trillion economic relief package. The package includes more than $150 billion for the health care system, including funding for hospitals, research, treatment and equipment.\n\nThere's a reason for that. And that is that millions of people are now demanding that we have a government that works for all, Sanders said.
Could Prescription Heroin And Safe Injection Sites Slow The Opioid Crisis?\n\nTERRY GROSS, HOST:\n\nThis is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. The opioid epidemic is the deadliest drug overdose epidemic in U.S. history. Drug overdoses are now the leading cause of death for Americans under 50. We're going to talk about how the epidemic reached this point. We'll also hear about some of the innovative harm reduction approaches to preventing people addicted to opioids from overdosing or getting sick through dirty needles and approaches to making quality addiction treatment more accessible.\n\nMy guest German Lopez is a senior reporter for Vox and has been covering drug policy since 2010. One of the cities hard hit by the opioid epidemic is Philadelphia. Later in the show, WHYY reporter Bobby Allyn will tell us about how and why some local officials and public health advocates are trying to make Philadelphia the first city in the U.S. to open a legally sanctioned safe injection site. As you can guess, it's a controversial move.\n\nGerman Lopez, welcome to FRESH AIR. Give us an overview of the scope of the opioid epidemic. The CDC recently released a report. What did you learn about the scope of the epidemic from that?\n\nGERMAN LOPEZ: So the CDC report found that there were nearly 64,000 drug overdose deaths last year in the U.S., meaning in 2016. So to put that in context, that's more than gun deaths. That's more than car crashes. It's more than HIV/AIDs during the peak of that epidemic. Another way of looking at it is it's more deaths in the U.S. from drug overdoses than there were U.S. casualties during the entire Vietnam War. It's now the biggest drug overdose epidemic in U.S. history. There seems to be a slight increase so far in 2017 as well. So it just - it seems to just keep getting worse.\n\nGROSS: So, you know, you've written in part about the hidden effects of the opioid epidemic and of all the overdoses that we've been seeing. You've written about, like, morgues that have run out of room and children who have been orphaned. Tell us one of the stories that you found related to these kind of hidden effects.\n\nLOPEZ: Yeah. So I think the most striking story along these lines last year that I found was this morgue that - they'd run out of room. And what they ended up having to do is rent out extra space in these trailers, I think it was, to hold the bodies - the extra bodies that they were getting from drug overdose deaths. And this is something that we need to look at in terms of the overdose crisis. It's just - obviously, the amount of death is a tragedy on its own. But it's really having these rippling effects through society.\n\nAnother example that you mentioned there is these kids who have been orphaned as a result of their parents overdosing or their parents becoming addicted and therefore not being able to take care of the kids anymore. And it - that will forever transform these kids' lives. They're no longer going to be able to rely on their parents. They'll have to move in with their grandparents. There are many quotes by now in newspapers all over the country of grandparents saying, I didn't think I'd be taking care of kids again at this age. And part of that is because, well, they might not want to. And that'll affect the grandparents as well.\n\nSo you see this ripple effect here in terms of, it's now causing all these financial costs for, say, these morgues. It's changing the lives of these children. It's changing retirement plans for these grandparents, and on and on. And that's really one of the things that I think is most pronounced about addiction is that it's not just a disease that kills people. It is definitely that, and that's obviously an awful part about it. But it's also a disease that starts really - it really becomes an epidemic, as it's called, because it affects all aspects of people's lives and not just their own lives but other people's lives as well and really becomes this public health issue.\n\nGROSS: So this is a crisis that's spread way beyond people who started on opioids as a medical way of treating chronic pain.\n\nLOPEZ: Right. I mean, that's usually pinned as the initial catalyst for the crisis - is doctors overprescribing these drugs. And to be clear here, the problem isn't just that pain patients who got the painkillers got the drugs and started getting addicted to them and started overdosing. It's also that because they had so many excess pills, it was also easy for, say, their kids to go to their parents' medicine cabinets and take an extra stash of opioids and use them illicitly or sell them or whatever. So that really led to the proliferation of these painkillers.\n\nBut over time as we've - what we've seen is that there is this transition to heroin and fentanyl. And a lot of that is just because heroin and fentanyl are far cheaper in the illicit market than painkillers. Some of that is also just these people - some of the people who were addicted to painkillers, they've now lost access to painkillers either because they lost their prescriptions or they just became expensive. And that has led people who are addicted to opioids to resort to fentanyl and heroin. And this is one way to avoid withdrawal symptoms or keep getting high or whatever it is that they're using the opioids for. And that has also caused the drug overdose deaths to spike.\n\nGROSS: I think one of the ways that policies have tried to crack down on the opioid epidemic is to restrict, to regulate the number of prescriptions that a doctor can write for a patient for opioids. Am I right about that?\n\nLOPEZ: So in general, it's not that the government is setting a specific quota or number for individual doctors. The DEA sets a quota for opioid painkillers overall in terms of how many companies can manufacture and produce and sell. But individual doctors - they're being told to just watch their prescriptions. And they've also been given these guidelines.\n\nSo one example is doctors are being told, with some exceptions, try to avoid prescribing opioids for chronic pain. And that's because we've seen in the science that opioids aren't even good for treating chronic pain in the first place because of the way people become tolerant to the drugs. And because over time, if you take opioids, you can actually become more sensitive to pain. So in some ways, opioids can make you actually feel that pain more.\n\nAnd it seems to me the general sense is that doctors are now supposed to be thinking of this not as a first-line treatment but sort of as a limited way to address pain in certain situations instead of the way they were approaching it before, which was, hey, this is a first-line treatment for all sorts of pain.\n\nGROSS: So what impact has that had on people who were using opioids for chronic pain and were already addicted?\n\nLOPEZ: If a patient is cut off from opioids - first of all, it's, at the very least, very, very unpleasant to be immediately cut off from your entire supply of opioids because that'll cause withdrawal. And withdrawal is - it's really - just imagine the worst stomach bug imaginable, and then compound that with crippling anxiety. It's really terrible to go through. So people will go through great strides to avoid that, and that's why some people will start buying opioid painkillers in the illicit market or they might start resorting to heroin and possibly fentanyl as a result.\n\nAnd that's why, in general, one thing that experts have told me is that if you are going to reduce the amount of painkillers somebody is taking, you want to taper them off, so slowly reduce their dose over time. But also, you want to talk with this patient and see, are they stable on opioids? Are they actually misusing the drugs? Is there evidence that they're putting themselves at risk? And these are, like, some of the things that doctors should consider when beginning to taper them off these drugs because otherwise, there is this risk that they'll start resorting to the illicit market, and that can heighten their chances of overdose.\n\nGROSS: What is fentanyl, and why is it so dangerous?\n\nLOPEZ: So fentanyl is this synthetic opioid, and it was originally produced for treating very intense pain. The common treatment that it was used for was cancer pain. So we're talking about patients who - many of them were terminally ill. And the risk of addiction when you're terminally ill is obviously much lower because you're thinking, well, we want to give this patient some sense of pain relief in their last few weeks, months, years of life. And that's how fentanyl was commonly advertised. It's, hey, this is a really potent opioid, and we should be giving it to these really terminally ill patients.\n\nBut over time, it turns out that it's actually pretty - relatively easy to produce in a lab. And that has led to its production in places like China, where it's now shipped through Mexico, through Canada, into the U.S. And the biggest risk here is that very often, fentanyl is sold as heroin. So if you're somebody who uses heroin, you think, OK, I'm going to take the dose I've always taken on this drug. But then it turns out you're taking fentanyl, which is multiple times as potent as heroin. And because you don't know that you're actually taking a higher dose - you can't see it based on what you are doing - it increases your chances of overdose without you even knowing it. And that's really what the risk has been, is that as fentanyl has increasingly been sold as heroin or increasingly laced into heroin, the chances of overdose have spiked dramatically. And that's one of the reasons we've seen this rise in deaths.\n\nGROSS: Why is it being sold as heroin or being laced in heroin?\n\nLOPEZ: So the common theory here is that it's just cheaper than heroin. So because it's cheaper than heroin, that makes it - there's a financial incentive there for drug traffickers, drug dealers to essentially cut their drug. So the idea is, well, if you put your fentanyl into heroin, you can put a little more kick into that heroin without actually paying for better-quality heroin. And that means that you can simply sell a stronger product for a lower price or you can sell it for the same price and just make more money in the end.\n\nGROSS: So why is fentanyl cheaper than heroin?\n\nLOPEZ: The simple reason seems to be that it is easy to produce in a lab compared to heroin. So heroin requires getting an opium poppy and then converting that into actual heroin. Fentanyl can just be produced synthetically in a lab. So it's kind of like - I've heard this comparison before of comparing it sort of to producing meth, which is also relatively cheap and easy to make. It's not quite as easy to produce as meth, but that gives you the same general idea of just how easy this is to make in a lab. So that's really the big reason. It's just simply much more easy to produce.\n\nGROSS: Sure, so you don't have to rely on poppy-producing countries like you do for heroin.\n\nLOPEZ: Right. That's exactly right.\n\nGROSS: So a lot of the fentanyl in the U.S. comes from China. Why is it coming from China?\n\nLOPEZ: Apparently the biggest reason there is just, they have the most lax regulations for these kinds of labs, so that has let a lot of this illegal drug trade really just take off there. China is now taking some steps, supposedly, working with the U.S. to crack down on that. We still have to see how well that works out because China has kind of struggled to crack down on these labs before because there are just so many of them.\n\nAnd there's also a question of well, OK, if China does this, will these labs just move to another place that's loosely regulated, such as India? And then the fentanyl production might take off there. So we're still seeing how that will shake out. But that's generally the reason, is just - it's very loosely regulated there. And the laws that do exist are very loosely enforced.\n\nGROSS: Well, let's take a short break here, and then we'll talk some more. If you're just joining us, my guest is German Lopez. He's a senior reporter for Vox and has been covering the opioid epidemic. We'll be right back. This is FRESH AIR.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF RHYTHM FUTURE QUARTET'S IBERIAN SUNRISE)\n\nGROSS: This is FRESH AIR. And we're talking about the opioid epidemic. And we're also talking about the medical model - the public health model - for dealing with it as opposed to the punitive model. My guest is German Lopez. He's a senior reporter for Vox who focuses on drugs, guns, criminal justice, race and LGBTQ issues. He's been reporting on drug policy issues since 2010.\n\nSo one way of dealing with drug epidemics is punishment. You know, you put people in prison, and maybe you put them in prison for a really long time. There're some really bad effects when that happens. So you've been looking into alternatives to prison and into places that are creating alternatives to the punitive model of addiction. And one of the things you write is that we have to stop seeing addiction as a moral failure and think of it as a real medical problem. Describe those two conflicting points of view.\n\nLOPEZ: For a long time in America, we have criminalized drug use. We have seen it as kind of this moral failure. I mean, whenever I write about the opioid epidemic, I get emails to this - that basically voice this argument all the time that - I mean, some of these emails are really awful, saying that, like, these people should be allowed to suffer and die because it's their fault that they're in the mess they're in. And the problem with that is there's just no evidence that that's a good way to deal with addiction.\n\nAnd increasingly, if you talk to experts, if you talk to addiction specialists, they will tell you that this is a chronic, relapsing disease. And what they mean by that is that this is a disease that will need a lot of medical care over time, and that's how you properly treat it. The problem with the criminal justice approach is that when you put people in these prisons for their drug use, you're shutting them off from their communities, you're shutting them off from their families. You might be cutting them off from care because sometimes prisons are very poorly equipped to deal with drug addiction.\n\nAnd if you think about what causes drug addiction, a lot of that simply works against this person going into recovery. So one thing that causes drug addiction is simply a lack of access to treatment. So if a prison doesn't have that, obviously, that's going to cause the addiction to get worse. But the other is just a general sense of despair. There are many studies out there linking addiction with other mental health issues and also linking addiction to just a general sense of existential despair.\n\nSo when you're cutting somebody off from their families and their communities, you're isolating them, you're making them feel worse about their lives. And if you're in that position, some people might become more motivated to quit drug use, but a lot of people will simply become worse as a result of that. They're going to be less happy, and that might give them more reason to use drugs because it might be their escape. And that's really the major way I view this criminal justice approach as not being a good idea. When you put people in prison for these drugs, you're cutting them off from the things that will, over time, probably help them get better.\n\nGROSS: So you've looked into various approaches for harm reduction. Would you explain what harm reduction is?\n\nLOPEZ: Harm reduction is this idea that a lot of people are going to use drugs, no matter how much treatment is available, no matter what you do to prevent drug use in the first place. So if you want to avoid people getting addicted and dying from drugs, one way to do that is just mitigating the risks of these drugs. So a popular - and, really in the research, uncontroversial in terms of the evidence behind it - is these clean needle exchanges.\n\nAnd what these places do is essentially give people who want to get these needles - they can go to the - these stations. They obtain new needles, new syringes. And then they can use those for whatever drug it is that they're using. And the idea is - yeah. To some degree that means that they now have a source for these syringes. But it also means that these syringes are clean in that they aren't contaminated by, say, HIV or hepatitis, which can also obviously cause death by themselves. So that's one way of harm reduction.\n\nThe common criticism of harm reduction is that there is this fear that it will lead to more drug use because they're thinking that if you mitigate the risks of drugs, then people will feel less threatened by drugs and therefore be more willing to use them. But again, there has been a lot of research into this through needle exchanges. And they have found time and time again that there does not seem to be this increase in drug use. What does happen when you make these needle exchanges available is there's lower incidence of HIV, lower incidence of hepatitis. And, therefore, there's less death overall caused by drugs.\n\nGROSS: So in your attempt to visit places that are using harm reduction approaches to dealing with the opioid epidemic, you visited a clinic in Vancouver that deals with prescription heroin. I didn't know this kind of treatment existed. Would you describe this prescription heroin treatment?\n\nLOPEZ: Yeah. When I first approached the story, I was pretty surprised by just what I was finding here. So essentially, the thinking is there is now so much fentanyl out there in the illicit market that drug users don't know what they're going to get. And the thinking is, well, at least if you provide them with prescription heroin, you'll, one, be able to ensure that they get a relatively clean supply of the drug - meaning it won't be laced with fentanyl or something else that will increase the chances of overdose.\n\nThe second thing is that you'll be able to supervise them as they're using or injecting the drug. And that will let you respond in case they overdose to ensure that they get medical help immediately. They'll get the opiate overdose antidote naloxone, which helps revive people from overdoses. Or they'll give them an oxygen tank which can help with respiratory problems that come from overdose. So that's kind of why it's phrased as harm reduction because you don't want - I mean, obviously, in an ideal world, you don't want people using heroin. But if people are going to use heroin anyway, here's one way that you can provide it and at least mitigate some of the risks that could lead people to die from it.\n\nGROSS: I'm sure a lot of people listening to this are just thinking the people who administer prescription heroin are just enabling heroin addicts, are just enabling a horrible addiction with a horrible drug instead of helping them get off the drug.\n\nLOPEZ: Right. And quite frankly, when I first started looking into this, I was deeply skeptical of it. But then I started talking to experts and looking into some of the research about this. And one thing to be clear about is this is not going to be for everyone who uses heroin. The way that this is administered in Vancouver is that after someone has gone through other treatment avenues - so say medications - other medications for opioid addiction or other traditional treatments that we think of in the U.S. - once somebody has gone through that, then prescription heroin will be made available to them. Ultimately, they estimate about 10 to 15 percent of people addicted to opioids will end up needing to use this. And the other thing is that with the research - when you actually look at this, it does seem to lead to better outcomes.\n\nGROSS: My guest is German Lopez, a reporter for Vox who covers the opioid epidemic. We'll continue the conversation after a break. And we'll talk with Bobby Allyn, a reporter at WHYY in Philadelphia about how some public health advocates and Philadelphia city officials are trying to make their city the first in the U.S. to have a legally sanctioned safe injection site, which just to be clear, is not the same as offering prescription heroin. I'm Terry Gross. This is FRESH AIR.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF MARIA SANCHEZ QUINTET'S BOARD)\n\nGROSS: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross back with German Lopez, a senior reporter for Vox who's been covering the opioid epidemic. When we left off, we were talking about one of the approaches to harm reduction practiced at a clinic in Vancouver. They selectively offer prescription heroin to users who have had no success with any approach to getting them off the drug, including rehab.\n\nYou spoke with people who were using prescription heroin in Vancouver. Tell us one of the stories you heard.\n\nLOPEZ: So I think the biggest example of this is John Pinkney (ph). He's one of the people I talked to at Vancouver. He actually passed away last year due to unrelated health issues. But his story was really inspiring to some degree. This was someone who has struggled with illicit drug use for decades. He linked the beginning of his drug using to his teens. He had a horrible family situation. His parents were abusive. He was homeless for some time and on and on.\n\nI mean, really, this guy went through some horrible, horrible things throughout his life. And he used illicit drugs for a decade. Then he found this prescription heroin clinic. And the way he put it to me is that he felt he had finally gotten his life back because he felt that now he can maintain a job. He was a security guard. Now he had a stable housing situation. So he had an apartment. I mean, he bragged to me about having furniture and a TV in his house.\n\nAnd these are some of the things that, like, a lot of us would take for granted. But for somebody who had been struggling with drug use all his life, this was a really monumental step for him. Seeing how this man, after decades of drug use, managed to turn his life around - it really showed to me that, at least for some people, this really can work. This was someone who really had become a productive member of society as a result.\n\nGROSS: Well, how did prescription heroin help him become productive? Because I think the common image of a heroin addict is somebody who's basically, you know, sitting on the floor, nodding...\n\nLOPEZ: Right.\n\nGROSS: ...And not working and not doing much of anything.\n\nLOPEZ: The thing you need to understand, I think, about heroin use is at a certain point, heroin use becomes more - and this is a term commonly used by people who are addicted - it becomes more about getting straight than getting high. And what they mean by that is that heroin no longer makes them feel this sense of euphoria or whatever that we commonly attach to it. It makes them feel normal. And that's due to just how it works in the brain and how you become tolerant to it.\n\nYou do everything you can to avoid withdrawal. And that's really what drug addiction becomes over time - is you really want to avoid this sense of withdrawal. And because of that, when you imagine somebody who is, say, stealing to obtain heroin, it's not just that they want to get high from this drug. For a lot of them, it's that they want to avoid this sickness that comes from dependence to this drug. So when they have a reliable source of heroin, they can go to this clinic and get it two or three times a day. Suddenly, they don't have to worry about how they're going to get their fix that day.\n\nThey're going to start thinking about the other things they can do because they know that they will have a reliable supply of this drug. And, you know, it's not going to be something that everybody feels easy with. The people and staff at the clinic that I talked to - they were - to some degree, they seemed uneasy with it. I mean, they were confident in that they think they're saving lives by doing this. But it's - nobody wants people using heroin. Like I said, in an ideal world, that wouldn't be the case.\n\nBut this seems to enable them to focus on the other aspects of their lives instead of just focusing on how they're going to get their next supply of the drug. And at least in this clinic, they have had zero people under their care overdose and die, which is remarkable. They have a few hundred patients. And they've been seeing them for years. So that's a really remarkable outcome compared to - if you were having a few hundred people using heroin in the street, you would expect at least some of them to die.\n\nGROSS: So we've been talking about approaches to harm reduction. You were describing the prescription heroin approach that's being tried in some countries, including parts of Canada. That is not a legal approach in the U.S. But you said when you went looking for a state in the U.S. that's taking the opioid epidemic seriously and using a medical model instead of a punitive model, you went to Vermont. What did you find there?\n\nLOPEZ: Yeah. So Vermont has really over the past few years built up what they call a hub-and-spoke system. And it's a fancy term for what they've essentially done - is really integrated addiction treatment into the rest of the health care system. So the hub is the place where you would get intensive care. I like to think of this kind of as this emergency-room-like situation where you go in, and you'll be able to sign up, and you'll get really intensive daily care for your opioid addiction.\n\nAnd then the spoke is where you go after you sort of stabilize and get better over time. And this is a place where you'll get treatment, say, on a weekly, monthly - some people bi-monthly basis - over time, you'll need to see it less and less. But the key thing that Vermont did with this is they emphasize this as a public health issue. First of all, they leveraged a Medicaid waiver for this to pay for it, to set up these clinics. And then they've really leveraged other aspects of health insurance expansion under the Affordable Care Act, including the Medicaid expansion, to make sure that patients have insurance to pay for all this treatment.\n\nAnd through this, they've provided these medications for opioid addiction. So some of these medications are Suboxone. That's the brand name for buprenorphine. And then there's methadone. And the idea with these medications is that they stave off withdrawal symptoms without causing patients to get high. And that way, people can focus on improving other aspects of their life that might have led them to drug use in the first place. And so they won't have to worry about withdrawal.\n\nAnd that's really what Vermont has hunkered down on - is really providing this treatment, which is considered the gold standard for opiate addiction care, and making sure that patients have access to it. And the idea is anyone should be able to go to a hub or spoke and get treatment really quickly - within a few days - because one of the risks is if you have these waiting periods, as some states do, of weeks or months for care, then people are going to keep using drugs. And with each time that they use drugs, they're going to be at risk for overdose.\n\nGROSS: So it is the use of methadone or buprenorphine controversial?\n\nLOPEZ: If you talk to addiction specialists and experts about this, it is not controversial. It is widely considered the gold standard of care. There's research that shows if you get people who are addicted to opioids on these medications, their chances of death will drop by more than 50 percent, which is a really remarkable outcome in terms of health.\n\nBut in much of the public discussion, these drugs have been maligned and stigmatized. One common frame that people tend to view this as is that it's replacing one drug with another because you're giving up, say, heroin or opioid painkillers and simply replacing that with another opioid like buprenorphine or methadone. In fact, our former secretary of Health and Human Services, Tom Price - he actually made an argument like this last year. But experts caution that this is not how you're supposed to view these medications because the problem with addiction is not that somebody is using drugs - I mean, I'm sure a lot of people listening to this show will have had a cup of coffee this morning. That has caffeine, which is a drug. I'm sure a lot of people will have had a few drinks maybe last night or over the weekend.\n\nAnd they'll think, you know, I'm fine with that. And that's generally what you want to think. It's like, the problem is not the drug use, per se. The problem was when that drug use leads somebody to do things that aren't good for society or themselves - say, they might be stealing. They might be putting themselves at risk of overdose. And what these drugs enable is that they make it possible to not have to worry about withdrawal. They make it so you get a clean source of these medications, so you do not have to worry about overdose. And in that way, you can get your life back in order. And while you still are technically using opioids, you're doing it in a much more stabilized environment.\n\nGROSS: Well, let's take a short break here and then we'll talk some more. If you're just joining us, my guest is German Lopez. He covers the opioid epidemic for Vox. We'll be right back. This is FRESH AIR.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF AVISHAI COHEN'S GBEDE TEMIN)\n\nGROSS: This is FRESH AIR, and if you're just joining us, my guest is German Lopez, a senior reporter for Vox. He focuses on drugs, guns, criminal justice, race and LGBTQ issues. And as part of that, he's been covering the opioid epidemic.\n\nWhen candidate Donald Trump was running, he promised to address the opioid epidemic and, you know, presented the message that he knew how to do it. What has he done?\n\nLOPEZ: So the biggest thing he's done, and really, the only notable thing he's done so far, is he declared a public health emergency. This is a very limited change in that it might unlock some extra resources, although it's unclear how many, to deal with opiate addiction. Experts are deeply skeptical about this because it seems to be just so limited. So one of the funds that this unlocks only has around $50,000 in it, which is simply not enough to deal with an opioid epidemic of this scale. And otherwise, it's not clear what else this declaration will do.\n\nThe other things he's done are, for the most part, just investigating this issue more thoroughly. So he appointed an opioid commission led by New Jersey Governor Chris Christie to look into this issue, and they made a bunch of recommendations. And he's also had one of his chief advisers, Kellyanne Conway, lead what they call an opioid cabinet into this issue. But so far, there's been a lot of investigation, but it's not really clear if any specific action is being taken. It seems to be a lot of talk but not nearly as much action to accompany that talk.\n\nGROSS: So Trump has said he would do what he can to end the opioid epidemic. At the same time, he's pledged to end Obamacare. What has Obamacare contributed to the treatment of addiction?\n\nLOPEZ: The basic way to understand this is that Obamacare dramatically expanded access to health insurance in the U.S. It also enforced some laws requiring that insurers treat addiction treatment as well as they do, say, physical treatment or surgery. These are called parity laws. They basically require that insurers treat addiction treatment just as seriously as they would treat any other illness. So those are the two ways that Obamacare has really had an impact here. It's dramatically expanded access to health insurance, which lets people pay for addiction treatment, and then it's also made sure that this health insurance will have to cover addiction treatment.\n\nSo going back to Vermont, they really leveraged the Affordable Care Act by, one, getting a waiver through the law that let them set up clinics and hubs and spokes. And two, just the fact that more people within the state now have federally funded health insurance has allowed the state to pay for these programs that they otherwise would not have been able to afford before. And through those two avenues, it has really let Vermont build up this hub-and-spoke system, which is what's let it essentially expand treatment to - for addiction.\n\nGROSS: So since you've been writing about addiction-related issues since 2010, I'm wondering if addiction has hit you close to home, if people who you are close to have been - have become addicts, if you've seen it firsthand in that way.\n\nLOPEZ: Yeah, so I'm from Ohio, which is now the state with the second highest drug overdose death rate in the country, so I've definitely seen this firsthand in my family and friends. I still have friends from high school that have been struggling with addiction. I have family that has struggled with addiction. So I've seen this firsthand. And I had a friend overdose on drugs a couple of years ago, and that's one of the things that led me to start looking at this issue much more seriously. And I think if you live in some of these states that have been really hard hit, it's almost inescapable how much damage this does.\n\nAnd I think people will see the drug overdose statistics, and they'll see some of that. But what's really shocked me about this is just how addiction is all-consuming in people's lives. So I've had friends who ended up not being able to finish school, whether that's high school or college, because of their addiction. That'll forever change their lives. I've had friends who just ended up homeless or ended up not being able to chase the career that they wanted all their lives. And when I see the impact that this has had personally on my communities, it just - it has, of course, moved me to cover this issue more seriously.\n\nGROSS: Well, German Lopez, thank you so much for talking with us.\n\nLOPEZ: Yeah, thanks a lot for having me. I really appreciate it.\n\nGROSS: German Lopez is a senior reporter for Vox who covers the opioid epidemic. Coming up - how some Philadelphia public health advocates and city officials are trying to make their city the first in the U.S. to have a legally sanctioned safe-injection site. This is FRESH AIR.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)\n\nGROSS: This is FRESH AIR. Although in several countries, people addicted to opioids can go to legally sanctioned, medically supervised safe injection sites, there are no such legal facilities in the U.S. Many public health experts in Philadelphia would like to make their city the first. Last week, WHYY reporter Bobby Allyn broke the story that now some top city officials are actively pursuing the idea. And the controversy it's generating in Philly exemplifies some of the obstacles to creating such a site in America.\n\nBobby, thanks for coming on FRESH AIR. How bad is the opioid epidemic in Philadelphia?\n\nBOBBY ALLYN, BYLINE: It's pretty devastating. Officials say when the final count is totaled that there will have been 1,200 lethal overdoses in Philadelphia last year. And for context, that's quadruple the city's murder rate. And Philadelphia is a quite violent city. And it's not that drug use rates in Philadelphia just went up astronomically, but, really, the death rate went up astronomically. And one of the biggest drivers for that is that a lot of heroin that's being bought on the streets is being laced with very potent synthetic fentanyl. And that's made the reaction to using it very unpredictable and sometimes deadly.\n\nGROSS: So in Philadelphia, there are public health advocates and some officials as well who want to see a safe injection site in Philadelphia to help deal with this overdose epidemic. So describe what that might look like if it ever comes to be.\n\nALLYN: So how a safe injection site typically works is, someone will come from off the streets into this facility, and they will bring their own drugs. If the user wants, the drugs can be tested for fentanyl, that very potent synthetic. And it's done very quickly. They have these fentanyl test strips, and they could do it almost instantly and know whether or not there's any fentanyl in that dosage.\n\nMedical staff are sort of waiting, watching, supervising and providing clean, sterilized equipment. So they're providing, you know, all the things you need to do heroin. There's this thing called a cooker. They're given needles. They're given clean swabs. And this way, the people who are using won't contract infectious diseases like hepatitis C or HIV. And nurses are standing by watching people essentially shoot up with oxygen and the overdose-reversing drug naloxone. And when they're done, they go into what's known as this chill area. And there, their breathing is monitored, and other vital signs are monitored. And from that point, they're kind of released back onto the streets.\n\nNow, during this process, if they want, they can be directed toward detox and other drug treatment programs. And that's been a big selling point for the advocates, the so-called harm reductionists who are very much in support of these safe injection sites. They say they can be a bridge to treatment services for people who wouldn't necessarily find it on their own. And that's why advocates don't like to call these sites safe injection sites but comprehensive user engagement sites. That sort of speaks to how people come there, they come to use, but, hopefully, it's a way to turn their life around.\n\nGROSS: What's the status of this now in Philadelphia?\n\nALLYN: So Mayor Jim Kenney of Philadelphia is in support of safe injection sites. He made a new position in Philadelphia City Hall known as a harm reductionist. He started this task force with dozens and dozens of experts that issued a number of recommendations about how to combat the opioid crisis.\n\nAnd one of the most critical factors is our new district attorney in Philadelphia, this guy named Larry Krasner, who is a career defense attorney - he was actually just sworn in recently. He's in his first days as a prosecutor. And he campaigned on this platform of upending the local criminal justice system. He's against mass incarceration. He's against the death penalty. And he is for safe injection sites. And he has said once this starts in Philadelphia, he's not going to have his prosecutors charge the people who are using illegal drugs with any crimes.\n\nGROSS: And when Krasner, who's now the DA in Philly - when he was a defense lawyer, he advocated on behalf of harm reduction.\n\nALLYN: Exactly. So Krasner's advocacy of harm reduction goes back to the '90s when the city and the country was having a debate about needle exchanges. And there was one called Prevention Point in Philadelphia that was involved in a lot of litigation. And Larry Krasner, Philadelphia's current district attorney, represented Prevention Point. So going back decades, this DA has really believed in interventionist strategies like harm reduction, like needle exchange, like safe injection sites.\n\nGROSS: What do the Philadelphia police think of that?\n\nALLYN: The Philadelphia police are far less excited about that prospect. And Philadelphia's police commissioner has said, it's kind of awkward to have beat cops rolling around a facility where people are using heroin and not make arrests. And if there is a incident report, if somebody calls the cops and says something happened at one of these facilities, they're going to have to investigate, and that might result in an arrest.\n\nNow, if that arrest makes its way to the DA's office and the DA's office says, we're going to drop it, that's - that might happen. But nonetheless, there is likely going to be tension between the facility workers and the users in that facility and members of Philadelphia's police department.\n\nGROSS: Well, that might also mean that users would be discouraged from going to a facility knowing that it could lead to prosecution.\n\nALLYN: Absolutely. And so that's why the stage of this in Philadelphia requires the buy-in from local law enforcement. Before this is going to become official, the department head, the police commissioner in Philadelphia and the, you know, 6,000-plus rank-and-file police officers have to agree that this is something that the community needs. And that's going to be an uphill battle.\n\nGROSS: So even if, on a local level, all the officials and police found a way to work it out and agree to the safe injection site, what about on a federal level - law enforcement on a federal level?\n\nALLYN: It's an interesting question. In Vermont, some lawmakers are proposing a similar safe injection site. And the response from federal law enforcement has been, if you do open a safe injection site, we will muster all of the resources of the federal government to come after you. The U.S. attorney in Vermont released this very unambiguous statement saying this. There are federal crimes that will happen here. We will seize your assets, and we will make arrests not just of the supervisors but even the workers in the safe injection site. So that is kind of setting the stage for what will likely be a really intense standoff between - even if local police agree - between local officials and the federal government.\n\nGROSS: Another issue is if a safe injection site was open, would there be protests in the community that it was opening in? Would there be a not-in-my-backyard effect?\n\nALLYN: I think the not-in-my-backyard - NIMBYism - effect is going to be fierce. It's going to be swift. If you look at a number of other cities across the U.S. that have proposed - and proposed is key because there are more than 100 facilities around the globe - safe injection facilities - none of them are in the United States.\n\nA number of proposals here. But none of them have been successful. There have been efforts in Seattle. They're pretty far along. San Francisco, New York, Denver's talking about it. But no U.S. city has been able to accomplish it. And the big - a big reason is because of the community backlash. So people who live in the heart of the epidemic in Philadelphia want it off their streets. They're sick of seeing people overdosing in public bathrooms, in alleyways, you know, shooting up or, you know, dozing off as they're waiting for the bus. They want that to be addressed somehow. That's a consensus.\n\nThey're sick of seeing the piles of syringes. Everyone in the community knows that stakeholders, that elected officials have to do something. But the idea of a safe injection site is just not - there's no clear consensus on that yet. And it's because it's very visceral. When you think about a bunch of people who are often chronic drug users congregating to one place and coming in and out and maybe interacting with you as you're on your way home from the grocery store, interacting with your children or interacting with you as you're walking your dog - I mean, a lot of these are fears that are based in the perception that people who are using opioids are dangerous people who may hurt you and your family.\n\nI mean, that's really what it is. It's an emotional fear, and it's a real fear. And, I mean, there are people who just say, this notion kind of freaks me out to have that many drug users that close to my home.\n\nGROSS: Well, Bobby, thank you very much for sharing your reporting with us.\n\nALLYN: Thanks for having me, Terry.\n\nGROSS: Bobby Allyn is a reporter at WHYY in Philadelphia, the station where FRESH AIR is produced.

Trump: Short-Term Deal To End Shutdown OK If It Has 'Prorated Down Payment' On Wall\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Patrick Semansky/AP Patrick Semansky/AP\n\nUpdated at 9 p.m. ET\n\nAfter an at-times heated debate, the Senate on Thursday, as expected, failed to approve either of the competing measures that would have ended the standoff over border wall funding.\n\nIf nothing else, the votes seemed to spur a flurry of efforts to find a way to end the standoff. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., announced on the Senate floor after the measures failed that he spoke with President Trump about a three-week stopgap bill to reopen the government.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer D-N.Y., met to discuss the proposal. But later Thursday evening, a spokesman for Schumer said, Sen. Schumer and Senate Democrats have made clear to Leader McConnell and Republicans that they will not support funding for the wall, prorated or otherwise.\n\nWhite House press secretary Sarah Sanders released a statement saying that the White House had already made it clear to Graham that a three-week bill would only work if there is a large down payment on the wall.\n\nIt depends\n\nSpeaking to journalists Thursday evening from the White House during an event about trade, Trump said he was open to a compromise with Democrats that reopens the government if it includes a prorated down payment on the border wall that has been the sticking point in the ongoing funding impasse. But no breakthrough appeared to be imminent, based on the president's comments.\n\nThe president said he is open to whatever results from the discussions between McConnell and Schumer, but Trump would not commit beyond a broad statement to assess what the Senate leaders announce.\n\nIt depends on what the agreement is, the president said. If they come to a reasonable agreement, I would support it.\n\nTrump also restated how important he thought a permanent barrier on the Mexico border is to prevent what he called the smuggling of drugs and humans through wide open spaces where no such barrier stands now. He acknowledged that much of the contraband smuggled into the United States arrives at major ports of entry, but he said, The big stuff comes through the areas where you have nobody watching.\n\nDueling proposals fail\n\nDespite Trump's apparent willingness to entertain a short-term deal that would reopen the government, Democrats in Congress have been resistant to supporting any funding that would go toward construction of a wall or other barrier on the border with Mexico.\n\nThe Senate votes followed by a renewed effort to find a deal came on Day 34 of the partial government shutdown, which has left some 800,000 federal employees without their second straight paycheck — which many would have received Friday.\n\nThe first vote, on a proposal by Trump to provide $5.7 billion for a border wall as well as changes in immigration law, received 50 votes in favor, with 47 senators voting against it. Republican Sens. Mike Lee of Utah and Tom Cotton of Arkansas voted against the GOP measure while Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia voted in favor.\n\nThe second proposal, sponsored by Senate Democrats, would have provided for two weeks of operating money for the government but included no funds for a wall while discussions on border security continued. It received 52 votes in its favor, and 44 senators opposed it. Six GOP senators supported the Democratic bill: Susan Collins of Maine, Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, Mitt Romney of Utah, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Johnny Isakson of Georgia and Cory Gardner of Colorado.\n\nBoth measures needed 60 votes to advance.\n\nAs a group of freshman House Democrats visiting the Senate chamber looked on earlier Thursday, tempers rose during the Senate debate. Sen. Michael Bennet, D-Colo., lashed out at Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, who instigated a previous shutdown over funding for the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, during the Obama administration.\n\nWith his arms crossed, Bennet accused Cruz of crying crocodile tears over the current lack of funding for first responders, including the Coast Guard. When the senator from Texas shut this government down in 2013, my state was flooded, Bennet said.\n\nIt was underwater! Bennet continued. People were killed! People's houses were destroyed! Their small businesses were ruined forever! And because of the senator from Texas, this government was shut down for politics.\n\nC-SPAN via YouTube\n\nThe negotiations\n\nEarlier, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., threw cold water on reports that Democrats were working on a deal to fund border security but not a wall. At a Thursday morning news conference, she said Democrats were not engaging in behind-the-scenes planning of an offer.\n\nShe said Democrats are working on the regular appropriations bill for the next fiscal year, which could contain additional money for border security.\n\nTop Democrats and their aides had told reporters about a proposal that would outline the mutual border security priorities for Trump and members of Congress but would include no new funding for any wall on the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nHouse Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md., declined to offer specifics about what is being worked out by Pelosi and the House Homeland Security Committee, but he said Democrats are prepared to make an offer that includes significant new spending on border measures.\n\nWe are prepared to spend a very substantial sum of money because we share the view that the border needs to be secure, Hoyer said. The letter is going to articulate what we believe is an effective investment to accomplish border security.\n\nTrump wants $5.7 billion for the wall, and the Democrats' proposal could exceed that amount.\n\nAppearing on NPR's Morning Edition, White House Director of Strategic Communications Mercedes Schlapp did not immediately rule the idea out. Why don't we have the Democrats come over and propose that over to the president? she said. What we need is a conversation.\n\nBut it's not clear whether Trump would sign off on the offer.\n\nSeveral conservative leaders who met with Trump on Wednesday to discuss immigration policy and strategy told NPR that the president had resolve and believed the ball was in Pelosi's court.\n\nYou don't negotiate against yourself, and that was a clear message, said Ken Cuccinelli of the Senate Conservatives Fund.\n\nAs for a strategy following the failed Senate votes, these conservatives said the White House was looking to peel off or win the support of moderate Democratic House freshmen who were elected last November in traditionally Republican districts. But that has been a White House strategy for more than a week, with few signs of defections.\n\nThere was no sense coming out of Wednesday's White House meeting that the partial shutdown would end anytime soon. We're out of the mentality that this is a sprint, said Cuccinelli.\n\nFood pantries\n\nRoughly 800,000 federal employees are affected by the shutdown. Many will miss their second paycheck this week. Food pantries have been set up in several cities for the workers.\n\nIn an interview on CNBC on Thursday, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said, I don't quite understand why federal workers are going to food banks, suggesting they apply for loans to make ends meet until they receive back pay. There is really not a good excuse for why the affected workers face what Ross termed a liquidity crisis.\n\nIn his remarks from the White House on Thursday, the president defended Ross though he said he hadn't heard Ross' actual remarks. But I do understand perhaps he should have said it differently, Trump said.\n\nThe president continued: Local people know who they are, where they go for groceries and everything else, and I think what Wilbur was probably trying to say is they will work along. I know banks are working along, if you have mortgages, the mortgagees, the folks collecting the interest and all of those things, they work along. And that's what happens in time like this. They know the people, they've been dealing with them for years, and they work along — the grocery store — and I think that's probably what Wilbur Ross meant.\n\nHe's done a great job, I'll tell you that, the president also said about his commerce secretary.\n\nPressure to resolve the shutdown also came from an unexpected source: former White House chief of staff and former Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly. He and four other former DHS secretaries wrote a letter to Congress and the president urging them to end the shutdown.\n\nDHS employees who protect the traveling public, investigate and counter terrorism, and protect critical infrastructure should not have to rely on the charitable generosity of others for assistance in feeding their families and paying their bills while they steadfastly focus on the mission at hand, the former secretaries wrote. This is unconscionable.\n\nNPR's White House correspondent Tamara Keith and congressional reporter Kelsey Snell contributed to this report.
Poll: Americans Not Sold On Trump — Or Democrats\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n\nUpdated at 12:20 p.m. ET\n\nDemocratic presidential candidates are proposing lots of progressive policies in this election. And while those policies may resonate with the party base, some of those ideas are not popular with a general election electorate, according to a new NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll.\n\nAnd overall, independent voters said they were not impressed with the direction either President Trump or Democrats want to take the country at this point ahead of the 2020 election, the findings show.\n\nIndependents are on the fence overall, said Lee Miringoff, director of the Marist Institute for Public Opinion at Marist College, which conducted the poll. They're not willing to grant President Trump reelection, and yet they're not persuaded by Democrats at this point.\n\nTrump did his best in this polling since taking office, but his approval rating is still just 44%. Fewer independents are undecided about the president and give him a 42% approval rating, up from 35% in June.\n\nThe poll was conducted from July 15 to 17, after the president's July 14 tweet that four Democratic congresswomen of color, all American citizens, should go back to their countries of origin. The poll of 1,336 adults has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points.\n\nLoading...\n\nDon't see the graphic above? Click here.\n\nWhat's more, by a 53%-to-39% margin, Americans said they would definitely vote against Trump, statistically unchanged from a month ago; 54% of American voters did not vote for Trump in 2016.\n\nAmong independents, a third said they would definitely vote for the president, up from one quarter. A majority — 54% — say they definitely won't, about the same as last month.\n\nThe economy\n\nThere's a tremendous gap between views of the president overall and how Americans feel about the economy. Even though Trump gets just a 44% approval rating overall, 52% of registered voters approve of his handling of the economy and two-thirds — 65% — of Americans think the economy is working well for them, including 62% of independents.\n\nIndependents are pleased with the economy, but it is not converting to a strong endorsement on his [Trump's] reelect question, Miringoff said.\n\nSo there's a political opportunity for Democrats.\n\nBut what Americans have heard about the primary so far is not necessarily giving them confidence that Democrats offer a better way. Americans split 46%-to-43% on whether Democrats would take the country in the wrong direction or right one.\n\nAnd with all-important independents, more (48%) think Democrats would take the country in the wrong direction than the right one (40%).\n\nDemocratic loyalists vs. independent voters\n\nThere are areas in which Democrats' policy proposals are on solid footing with the overall electorate:\n\n-- Requiring background checks for gun purchases or private sales (89% say it's good idea)\n\n-- Medicare for all who want it, presenting it as an option (70%) rather than doing away completely with private health insurance (41%)\n\n-- Regulating prescription drug prices (67%)\n\n-- Providing a pathway to citizenship for immigrants in the U.S. illegally (64%)\n\n-- Investing in so-called green jobs and energy efficient infrastructure (63%)\n\n-- Increasing taxes on those making more than $1 million (62%)\n\n-- Legalizing marijuana (63%)\n\n-- Banning assault-style weapons (57%)\n\n-- Raising the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour (56%)\n\nAreas that are less popular include:\n\n-- A guaranteed universal basic income of $1,000 per month for American adults (26%)\n\n-- Providing reparations for slavery (27%)\n\n-- Decriminalizing illegal border crossings (27%)\n\n-- A national health insurance program that is available to immigrants in the country illegally (33%)\n\n-- Abolishing the death penalty (36%)\n\n-- Medicare for all replacing private health insurance (41%)\n\n-- Getting rid of the Electoral College (42%)\n\nThese would be issues where people would say the Democratic Party is too far to the left, Miringoff said, and that's warranted within the data.\n\nOn Medicare for All, whether it is a choice or a replacement is a huge distinction in terms of how the public reacts, Miringoff added.\n\nOn rejoining the Paris climate agreement, 53% think it's a good idea and just 31% think it's a bad idea, but that leaves many undecided.\n\nPeople are split or give less support to: giving free college tuition at public colleges and universities (53% said good idea, 43% said bad idea); a tax on carbon-based fuels such as coal, oil and natural gas (50% vs. 44%).\n\nRepealing Obamacare unpopular\n\nOne area that jumps out as a warning for Republicans is repealing the Affordable Care Act.\n\nJust 44% think it's a good idea, while 51% think it's a bad one. The degree to which the tide has turned on that issue is remarkable considering how much the fight over so-called Obamacare helped Republicans in 2010 while President Barack Obama was in office.\n\nRepublicans voted to repeal the law dozens of times while Obama was in office, but with full control in Washington during Trump's first two years, they were not able to repeal or replace the health care law in full.\n\nThe divided states of America\n\nOne major takeaway from the poll is that America is a nation divided. Democrats and Republicans are worlds apart on the things they think are good ideas. Some of the widest splits on what the parties thought were good ideas were:\n\n-- Rejoining the Paris climate agreement (63 points)\n\n-- Investing in green jobs (60 points)\n\n-- Repealing Obamacare (60 points)\n\n-- $15 minimum wage (58 points)\n\n-- Free college at public colleges and universities (57 points)\n\n-- Increasing taxes on those making more than $1 million (56 points)\n\n-- Health care for immigrants in country illegally (54 points)\n\n-- Semi-automatic weapons ban (54 points)\n\nLoading...\n\nDon't see the graphic above? Click here.\n\nOf the 20 policy proposals respondents were asked about, many of which have been floated by Democratic presidential candidates, a majority of Democrats were in favor of 16 of them.\n\nA majority of independents thought 12 were good ideas, while a majority of Republicans, as to be expected, were in favor of just three — repealing Obamacare, stricter gun background checks and regulating prescription drug prices.\n\n2020 Democratic primary\n\nThere are lots of reasons to discount who has the early lead in primary polls, and that is borne out again in this survey — 82% of Democrats or Democratic-leaning independents say they have not yet made up their mind in the Democratic primary.\n\nThat is pretty much unchanged from a month ago, when 84% said their minds were not yet made up. A majority (54%) though say they want a nominee who can beat Trump rather than one who shares their position on most issues (42%).\n\nThat's a 13-point swing from last month when 47% said they wanted someone who shared their position on most issues versus 46% who said they wanted someone who has the best chance of beating Trump.\n\nThe poll of 1,346 adults was conducted from July 15 to 17. The respondents were reached by telephone, both cellphone and landline, with live callers. It has a margin of error of +/- 3.5 percentage points. The survey reached 1,175 registered voters and has a margin of error for that group of +/- 3.7 percentage points. There were 553 Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents interviewed. Results referring to Democrats' views therefore have a margin of error of +/- 5.4 percentage points.
How The Trump Administration Can Reach Latino Voters\n\nNPR's Lulu Garcia-Navarro talks to Las Vegas City Councilwoman Victoria Seaman, a Republican, about why she thinks President Trump could gain the support of some Latino voters.\n\nLULU GARCIA-NAVARRO, HOST:\n\nLatinos make up almost a third of eligible voters in Nevada. They were key in the 2018 election when they helped elect a Democrat senator, flipping the seat. But Republicans see an opening to attract Latinos in this presidential election. As part of our series looking at key groups voting in swing states, we're joined now by Councilwoman Victoria Seaman in Las Vegas. She is a Republican who supports Trump, and she recently attended a Latinos for Trump roundtable. Welcome.\n\nVICTORIA SEAMAN: Thank you for having me, Lulu.\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: It is great to have you. What's the GOP message to Latino voters in Nevada right now?\n\nSEAMAN: Well the message is see what the president has already done for Latinos. In 2018, the poverty rate for Hispanic Americans reached the lowest level on record. Hispanic households reach a historic high with median incomes surpassing 50,000 for the first time on record. His tax cuts are putting more money not only in Hispanic pockets, but everyone. And so the message is the Democrats haven't delivered, and President Trump has.\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: A new poll shows Biden leads among Latinos in Nevada 56 to 32. But this is all about the margins, as you know. I'll quote John Ralston here, editor of the Nevada Independent. He says the Hispanic number is not terrible for Trump and indicates that Biden has yet to close the deal. If Trump is in the 30s among that cohort, he could win here. That's a big jump for Trump. What's behind it in your view?\n\nSEAMAN: First of all, look back at the polls in 2016. We see that President Trump overwhelmingly won despite the polls. But...\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: Well, we should say that the state did go for Hillary Clinton.\n\nSEAMAN: ...It did, but he lost by three points. And right now, he has over 60 paid staff on the ground here. They've made over 2 million voter contacts, and they're working hard with the support of Latinos for Trump, Black Voices for Trump, Asians for Trump. So the support and the response from those different groups are really helping President Trump in Nevada.\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: Well, Councilwoman, let me ask you this. Is there something other than an economic message? You've mentioned that. The economy does matter to Latinos at polls, you know, in the top three, but so does health care. So does immigration.\n\nSEAMAN: Right.\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: And the president on those two issues does not poll well. He has no health care plan that is clear. And his record on immigration is very, very complicated and, some would say, speaks for itself.\n\nSEAMAN: Well, I think his policy on immigration is good. It's not all about, you know, a border for security for illegal immigrants. It's about security for drug trafficking, human trafficking across the border. I think the No. 1 priority for Americans right now is public safety.\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: But not among - not for Latinos, though. For Latinos, really, it is health care. I mean, for example, Obamacare is overwhelmingly popular among Latinos. So I'm just curious - when those issues come up, how do you address them?\n\nSEAMAN: Well, quite frankly, it hasn't worked for most people in general because by the policy of Obamacare, most your hard-working Americans were paying three times or four times more for their health insurance. We're not talking about the wealthy. We're talking about working class families. So I believe, as President Trump believes, it needs to be fixed.\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: Last question - the pandemic. Obviously, it has disproportionately affected the Latino community, and you see that in the numbers specifically in Nevada. Has that been raised as a concern when you talk to Latinos and particularly Latinos who might vote Republican?\n\nSEAMAN: No, it hasn't.\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: Do you find that surprising?\n\nSEAMAN: No. I think everybody's concerned.\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: With 200,000 dead?\n\nSEAMAN: I really think that we're - a vaccine, I believe, is coming. I think people understand that this was something that no one expected. And I think that the president has done a great job with COVID. I have - that is not a concern that people call me up and ask me about. Now that we've come to where we are today, the biggest concern for people is their job. We still have a high rate of unemployment right now due to the pandemic. That is what people are looking forward to the future - to make sure that they're going to be able to go back to work and put food on the table.\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: City Councilwoman Victoria Seaman in Las Vegas, thank you very much.\n\nSEAMAN: Thank you so much for having me. I really appreciate it.\n\nCopyright © 2020 NPR. All rights reserved.

For Republicans, There's More At Stake Than Just A Midterm Victory\n\nBoth parties have a lot at stake this November. Democrats say their survival is on the line. While for President Trump and his GOP allies in Congress, the prize is to stay in power and stay relevant.\n\nRACHEL MARTIN, HOST:\n\nBoth political parties in this country have a lot at stake this November. Some Democrats say their very survival is on the line while for President Trump and his Republican allies in Congress, the prize on election night is not just to stay in power but to stay relevant. NPR's national political correspondent Mara Liasson reports.\n\nMARA LIASSON, BYLINE: If Republicans hang onto their majorities in the House and Senate, their approach to governing will be validated. They can continue to confirm judges, take another whack at Obamacare, help President Trump shut down the Mueller investigation. On the other hand, says former Republican Majority Leader Eric Cantor...\n\nERIC CANTOR: If the Republicans are unable to maintain their majority in the House, Democratic rule no matter who their speaker is will be very much in opposition to a Trump White House.\n\nLIASSON: Just the way the Democrats in Congress saw President Obama's legislative agenda die the minute Cantor and his fellow Republicans took over when they won the House in 2010.\n\nCANTOR: Look; it's no fun to be in perpetual minority - I can tell you that - and especially in the House, where simple majority gives you almost absolute power to, again, set the agenda and get bills across the floor. That will greatly affect the willingness for some who have been at it for a long time and make the decision whether maybe they should retire or not.\n\nLIASSON: Cantor thinks more Republicans will head for the exits if they lose. But Karl Rove, former top adviser to President George W. Bush, has a different prediction about how Republicans will react if they lose the House.\n\nKARL ROVE: I think they will be both miserable and emboldened. They'll be miserable because they're in the minority. They will be emboldened because look; if the Democrats take it by a narrow margin, there will be deep divisions within the Democratic Party.\n\nLIASSON: And Republicans, who are experts at opposition, will do their best to exacerbate those Democratic divisions. There will be other changes in store for Republicans if they lose one or both houses. President Trump, without control of Congress, could decide to triangulate. He's already talked about making deals with Democrats on infrastructure, for instance. And that could leave congressional Republicans on the sidelines. Trump has never hesitated to throw an ally under the bus, says Doug Heye, the former communications director for the RNC.\n\nDOUG HEYE: It could be bad for Republicans if he tries to do that. But it could be good for Trump for his own personal political goals. I think the challenge for a lot of Republicans is what is good for Republicans and what is good for Trump are not necessarily the same thing.\n\nLIASSON: And something else will happen if Republicans lose big in November. Their ranks in Congress will get smaller but also whiter, older, more male and much more conservative - in other words, more like the Trumpian base of the party. Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich says even if the Republicans lose, even if they privately blame Trump for their loss and even if he casts them aside to make deals with the Democrats, they'll have no choice but to stand by him.\n\nNEWT GINGRICH: The Republican Party, first of all, is going to be the Trump party. You know, he's consistently at 42, 43, 44, 45 percent approval 'cause he's at 88 or 90 or 92 percent among Republicans.\n\nLIASSON: So Gingrich says Republicans will have no choice but to become even more committed to Donald Trump after November.\n\nGINGRICH: The first thing they'll say the morning after the election is we are dedicated to the election - re-election of Donald Trump. And that becomes the overriding goal.\n\nLIASSON: And if they manage to hang onto power in Congress, Republicans will still have the task of showing the country they can govern. That means funding the wall, replacing Obamacare, overhauling Medicare and Social Security, accomplishments that eluded them over the past two years. And if they keep the House, they'll certainly have a narrower majority, making it all even harder.

Lightning Fill In The Blank\n\nAll the news we couldn't fit anywhere else.\n\nPETER SAGAL, HOST:\n\nTime for our final game, Lightning Fill In The Blank. Each of our players will have 60 seconds in which to answer as many fill-in-the-blank questions as they can. Each correct answer now worth two points. Bill, can you give us the scores?\n\nBILL KURTIS: I sure can. Peter has two. Roxanne and Roy each have three.\n\nSAGAL: All right.\n\nSAGAL: So that means Peter is in third place. And you're up first.\n\nPETER GROSZ: Great.\n\nSAGAL: The clock will start when I begin your first question, Peter. Fill in the blank.

G7.\n\nSAGAL: Right.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF BELL)\n\nSAGAL: In order to redirect around a 65-foot-long road closure, officials in Britain blanked.\n\nGROSZ: Gave up.\n\nSAGAL: No. They created a 41-mile-long detour.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nSAGAL: On Sunday, Francis Ford Coppola joined Martin Scorsese in criticizing the blank movie franchise.\n\nGROSZ: Marvel.\n\nSAGAL: Yes.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF BELL)\n\nSAGAL: On Tuesday, former President blank was hospitalized with a fracture after falling in his home.\n\nGROSZ: Jimmy Carter.\n\nSAGAL: Right.

And when police attempted to arrest him, he gave the cops a fake name. That probably would have worked if Bushman did not have his full name tattooed in giant letters on his neck. It also didn't help that he was also wearing a nametag from a recent forgers convention...\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nSAGAL: ...That said, hello, my name is guilty.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nSAGAL: Bill, how did Peter do on our quiz?\n\nKURTIS: Real good - six right, 12 more points, total of 14.

One of those...\n\nSAGAL: No.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nSAGAL: They had students - during this test to keep them from cheating, they had students wear cardboard boxes on their heads. A recent picture showed university students taking an exam while wearing these cardboard boxes with small cut out eye holes presumably to keep students from looking to their left or right and cheating off the person next to them. Or maybe just every student had ended up with a bad Halloween costume. The school has since apologized for doing this to their students. They say that when it comes to future ideas for preventing cheating, they'll try and think outside the box.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nSAGAL: Bill, how did Roy do on our quiz?\n\nKURTIS: He got three right, six more points, total of nine.

Conservatives Wonder, Will The Real Donald Trump Please Stand Up?\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Drew Angerer/Getty Images Drew Angerer/Getty Images\n\nHere are some of the ways Donald Trump has described himself during the 2016 presidential campaign:\n\nVery conservative.\n\nA common-sense conservative.\n\nA conservative with a heart.\n\nBut talk to conservative activists, and it's not unusual to still hear things like this:\n\nWell, I remain a skeptic, says activist and GOP campaign veteran Rick Tyler, who adds, I don't know that Donald Trump is a conservative.\n\nBillionaire businessman, reality TV star and first-time candidate Trump challenged, insulted, befuddled, shocked and, finally, took over the Republican Party on his way to becoming president-elect. He managed that accomplishment without adhering to traditional conservative principles. In fact, at times it was hard to discern any ideology at all besides a loyalty to himself and a determination to completely upend the American political process.\n\nWith just weeks until he is sworn in as the 45th president of the United States, conservative activists — like many Americans — will be watching to see just how conservative a president Trump is.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Alex Wong/Getty Images Alex Wong/Getty Images\n\nCabinet picks encourage some; Trump tweets don't\n\nTyler was communication director for Texas Sen. Ted Cruz's presidential campaign. Cruz entered the race thinking he would secure the nomination with help from the GOP's most conservative members — especially evangelicals and members of the Tea Party, who viewed him as a hero for his repeated efforts to repeal Obamacare.\n\nCruz lost, and eventually endorsed Trump in late September, prompting Tyler to say, It's mourning in America for conservatives. We lost our leader today.\n\nOn Election Day, Tyler says, he voted not for Trump, but for independent candidate Evan McMullin.\n\nStill, he says, he's been watching closely as the president-elect assembles his team, and thinks there are at least some indications that Trump will change as president, and actually govern as a conservative.\n\nIf you look at his Cabinet appointments, I can't imagine a more conservative Cabinet than he's picked so far, Tyler says.\n\nThen he adds something he never imagined during the campaign: Some might say it would be even more conservative than Ted Cruz's Cabinet.\n\nHe cautions, though, that Trump's position on free trade and trade deals remains anything but conservative.\n\nThen there's Trump's undisciplined use of Twitter — unprecedented for someone in his position — and a very un-conservative approach to communicating.\n\nHe's talking about the @RealDonaldTrump Twitter account, but also Trump's unscripted rhetoric at his rallies.\n\nYou can say you're joking around, but it confuses a lot of people, Tyler says. It may be OK to say things to confuse our enemies, he adds.\n\nThat's certainly true in war, he says, but I don't think it's OK to confuse the world in diplomacy and foreign policy.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n\nEvangelicals backed Trump, but say they demand results\n\nBob Vander Plaats is one of the country's top evangelical voices. Based in Iowa, Vander Plaats backed Cruz for president, but says he voted for Trump and has been friends with him for years. He recalls a meeting with candidate Trump this summer, after the primaries were over.\n\nAt that time I told him, 'I'm not going to endorse you, but I'll be your friend. And that means when you do things that are worthy of cheering you on, I'll cheer you on,'  Vander Plaats says. But he also told Trump, When you do things that are outside the lines, outside the boundaries, I'm gonna try to hold you accountable.\n\nIn fact, when the infamous Access Hollywood tape emerged, in which Trump talked about being able to force himself on women because when you're a star you can do anything, grab 'em by the [expletive], Vander Plaats called for Trump to quit the race. He says it was just one of many times he thought Trump's campaign was over.\n\nHe was wrong.\n\nVander Plaats did vote for Trump, but says his approach going forward with the new president will be the same as he told the candidate at that meeting in the summer.\n\nOne thing that Vander Plaats has always been happy about was Trump's selection of Indiana Gov. Mike Pence as his running mate. To evangelical voters, the presence of Pence as vice president is very reassuring.\n\nMike Pence is one of us, says Vander Plaats, He comes from us, not just to us.\n\nVery early on, he says, Trump will face an important test, when he decides on a nominee to replace the late Justice Antonin Scalia.\n\nVander Plaats puts it succinctly. The real test: Who does he appoint to the Supreme Court.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Anadolu Agency/Getty Images Anadolu Agency/Getty Images\n\nFor the Tea Party, perhaps a chance to relax?\n\nFinally, to a group that has been an uncompromising attack force against Democrats — and even some Republicans — the Tea Party. Tom Zawistowski leads a Tea Party group in northeast Ohio, where he says they are basking in Trump's victory, and even relaxing a bit. He says it's like they've been at war for almost eight years, and that war is over. Their guys won. That, he says, will allow them to shift the focus from Washington to home.\n\nIt's kind of a takeoff on Trump's 'Make America Great Again,'  he says. But now it's kind of something like, 'Make our communities great again.' \n\nZawistowski says the transition has been everything he has hoped for so far. He applauds Trump's Cabinet choices, including Rep. Mike Mulvaney of South Carolina, picked to be budget director.\n\nFor the first time our people are in the room, you know? At the meeting. So Zawistowski says they now have the luxury of sitting back and watching people you trust go to work. I think you owe them that. You owe them that respect, because they are where they are because you put 'em there.\n\nBut if it's strange to hear a Tea Partly leader say stand down, Zawistowki says they'll still be watching.\n\nAnd if Trump goes astray, or if GOP leaders stand in the way, he promises the Tea Party response will be very loud.
Bitter Feud Heats Up Between Florida's Top Republicans\n\nWhile half of the states have Republicans in control of the legislature and the governor's office, unified GOP control doesn't mean it's easy to push through an agenda. Florida is a prime example, where a public feud is unfolding between two state leaders as the annual legislative session gets underway.\n\nROBERT SIEGEL, HOST:\n\nThe Republican Party is at a high watermark across the country. The GOP controls the White House and Congress and the legislatures and governors offices in 25 states. But unified control isn't the same as unity. Consider Florida. As Gina Jordan of member station WLRN reports, Tallahassee is the scene of an increasingly bitter feud among the state's top Republicans.\n\nGINA JORDAN, BYLINE: Speaker of the House Richard Corcoran and Governor Rick Scott should be close allies. Instead, they're producing campaign-style videos criticizing each other's policies.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MAN: Hundreds of local jobs lost, millions in taxpayer money wasted in a bankruptcy that leaves a big hole on the Treasure Coast.\n\nJORDAN: This video produced on Corcoran's behalf showcases failed businesses that received the kind of state tax breaks that Scott has aggressively promoted. Corcoran wants to cut back the state's support for private businesses. Scott's political action committee fired back with a Facebook video that accused Corcoran of being a career politician who delivers fake news.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nUNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: So what exactly are the Tallahassee politicians up to now - trying to kill our tourism industry. Let's look at their false attacks, and note, none of your tax dollars were spent making this rebuttal.\n\nJORDAN: This fight has divided the state Republican Party at a time when lawmakers are trying to tackle big issues like education funding and property taxes. Governor Scott has been touring the state and calling out Republicans in their districts if they side with Corcoran.\n\nRICK SCOTT: What happens when 44 percent of the homes are underwater on their mortgage? That was - the day I got elected in 2010, that's where we were. Why in God's green Earth would anybody think we should go back to that?\n\nJORDAN: Scott is a former health care executive who believes the state should use tax incentives to bring in more jobs.\n\nSCOTT: How can anybody say, oh, this investment where we get that significant return, we don't want to keep doing that? I mean, the only thing this could be would be politics. You would never think this way in business.\n\nJORDAN: For his part, Corcoran opened the legislative session...\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF GAVEL BANGING)\n\nJORDAN: ...Emphasizing that this is a disagreement about policy.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nRICHARD CORCORAN: I'm not saying it's going to be easy. Debate can be intense, especially when you're dealing with people's lives. But we can be passionate about these issues and never, ever, ever get personal.\n\nJORDAN: Mac Stipanovich is a longtime political consultant and Republican lobbyist in Tallahassee who says this level of bickering among top leaders in Florida is unprecedented.\n\nMAC STIPANOVICH: Corcoran reached out and stuck his finger into the most sensitive spot the governor has, which is economic incentives that allegedly create jobs. He couldn't have done anything else more provocative.\n\nJORDAN: Stipanovich says this is what happens when one party controls the whole government. The big disagreements happen inside the party. He says it's not that different from what's happening in Washington.\n\nSTIPANOVICH: You have the Republicans in charge of both houses of Congress and a Republican in the White House. Yet, they are straining to bring forward a repeal and replace on Obamacare.\n\nJORDAN: For now, lawmakers are still debating whether to give Scott more money for tax breaks to draw businesses. But he'll be able to veto anything they send him. Both men have ambitions for higher office, and the outcome of this fight could determine who stays in the public eye for years to come.

Repeal Ripples: 5 Insurance Exchange Chiefs Contemplate An Uncertain Future\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Gary Friedman/LA Times via Getty Images Gary Friedman/LA Times via Getty Images\n\nWith open enrollment season for buying health coverage under the Affordable Care Act ending Tuesday, it seemed like an apt time to talk with folks in charge of some of the state insurance marketplaces created by the federal health law.\n\nIt's the fifth year these marketplaces, also called exchanges, have been running. The marketplaces are the go-to option for people under 65 who don't get health insurance through work or qualify for Medicaid.\n\nThis time around, there's a last-minute wrinkle: The Trump administration has halted advertising and outreach for HealthCare.gov, the federally run exchange, in the last week of enrollment, when sign-ups typically surge.\n\nBut the states that control their own exchanges also control their own promotion and, for now, their destiny.\n\nAll told, 11 states and the District of Columbia run their own marketplaces. Under the ACA, the marketplaces were supposed to become self-sustaining businesses within a few years, supported by fees insurers pay to offer plans on the sites.\n\nBut the election of Donald Trump as president and Republican majorities in both houses of Congress mean that proposition, like the rest of the health law, is now in doubt.\n\nHere's what five exchange chiefs are looking at now and for the future.\n\nCalifornia Has Ingredients To 'Make The Individual Market Work'\n\nPeter Lee, executive director, Covered California\n\nMore than 5 million Californians — about a quarter of all Americans now covered under Obamacare — gained insurance either through Medicaid expansion or on the state's exchange, called Covered California.\n\nWith the Affordable Care Act now on the political chopping block, California has a lot to lose.\n\nBut Covered California's executive director, Peter Lee, says he is planning for a different scenario. He hopes to position California as a leader in a new model for health coverage nationwide.\n\nI do think that we have a number of the ingredients of what can make the individual market work, Lee says. And we want to take those lessons to members of Congress and to policy leaders.\n\nIn particular, Lee believes California's market-based approach is one that would be in sync, philosophically, with many of the things I hear from Republican and Democratic members of Congress and the Trump administration.\n\nWe have about 1.4 million Californians shopping in our marketplace picking private plans with the leg up of federal tax credits that make health care affordable to 90 percent of them, Lee says.\n\nCalifornia's marketplace has had its share of problems. A reliance on inaccurate provider directories left some consumers exposed to higher-than-expected medical bills. Consumers also complained about narrow networks that left them unable to choose the doctors they wanted.\n\nBut overall, the state is considered an ACA success story, thanks in part to innovative approaches, including state discretion to choose which insurers could operate in its market and then to negotiate premiums and benefits with those insurers.\n\nIt's a consumer-centric market solution, Lee says. Whether you're a Republican or Democrat or independent, it's a market-based solution that has a lesson for the country.\n\nStill, Lee's hopefulness is tempered by the knowledge that California faces a loss of $20 billion in federal funds if the promised Obamacare repeal happens without a replacement that preserves Medicaid expansion and premium subsidies.\n\nUnder that scenario, Lee says, people would have their health insurance pulled out from under them in droves.\n\nThe whole issue of repeal without replace is cataclysmic not just for California or Californians but for any of the 20 million Americans that have coverage because of the Affordable Care Act, he says.\n\nEven in the face of a very fuzzy future, Lee says he is focusing on the present, which includes shepherding more than 300,000 Californians newly enrolled in health care into 2017 coverage. He also wants to get the word out on parts of California's plan that can be adopted elsewhere.\n\nThere have been some things that have not worked great with the Affordable Care Act; there are some things that have worked pretty darn well, Lee says. Let's make sure the laboratory of the states is a laboratory that's sharing the lessons of success and failure with one another.\n\nStephanie O'Neill, freelance reporter based in Ojai, Calif.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Courtesy of NY State of Health Courtesy of NY State of Health\n\nNew York Fears A Return To '$1,000 A Month For An Individual Policy'\n\nDonna Frescatore, executive director, NY State of Health\n\nThe New York state health exchange is fielding its busiest enrollment period yet, even with the uncertainty about the health law's future.\n\nA repeal of the Affordable Care Act, without significant replacement, could cost 2.7 million New Yorkers their health insurance and the state $3.7 billion, according to Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo's office.\n\nWe believe that the stakes here in New York are dramatic — for consumers, for our health care delivery system and for our state budget as well, says Donna Frescatore, executive director of NY State of Health, New York's marketplace.\n\nLosing momentum is one of Frescatore's main concerns. Between 2013 and 2015, the uninsured rate in New York was cut in half, falling from 10 percent to 5 percent, according to the state's health department.\n\nWe talk to moms who are concerned because their children have pre-existing conditions and they're afraid coverage might no longer be available. We talk to self-employed New Yorkers who fear that the premiums could increase to the 2013 levels — over $1,000 a month for an individual policy, Frescatore says.\n\nWithout financial support from the federal government, premiums may increase.\n\nOptions may revert to health insurance plans as they were in New York before the ACA.\n\nNew York had a number of very strong consumer protections in place before the Affordable Care Act, including guaranteed issue, says Frescatore. People could get insurance regardless of whether or not they had a medical condition or illness, as well as other consumer protections. We'll maintain those protections.\n\nBut without an individual mandate bringing enough people into the insurance pool and no financial assistance, she adds, the price of plans is just out of reach financially for many consumers.\n\nFor now, the New York exchange continues outreach to enroll consumers and reassure them that policies won't be disrupted throughout 2017.\n\nAt this point, without knowing more details about repeal or replacement, what we're really focused on is getting people coverage that they deserve, Frescatore says.\n\nKaren Shakerdge, WXXI and Side Effects Public Media\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Courtesy of Access Health CT Courtesy of Access Health CT\n\nConnecticut To Insurers: 'We're Making Changes In The Positive Direction'\n\nJim Wadleigh, CEO, Access Health CT\n\n\n\nConnecticut was an early adopter of the ACA. After the law was enacted, the state expanded Medicaid ahead of schedule to cover roughly 200,000 more people a year. For this year, more than 100,000 people enrolled in coverage they found on the state-based exchange, with nearly 80 percent getting subsidies.\n\nBut while the exchange may have been attractive to many consumers, it was less appealing to insurers. Two of the four original insurance companies in the marketplace are no longer in it. Now, with an uncertain future ahead, Access Health CT CEO Jim Wadleigh says he has one hard goal in mind as he thinks beyond 2017: What can we do to help make the business environment that our carriers are in easier for them to be more successful?\n\nInsurers have told Wadleigh that they lose money on customers who miss open enrollment periods and go through special enrollment — the process reserved for people with big life events or job changes that merit new insurance.\n\nWhat the carriers are telling us is, these customers are coming in ... finding a reason that they have a life event because they're sick, get services, and then drop out, he says.\n\nThat's an expensive pattern. This week, Wadleigh is asking his board to approve a plan to ramp up enforcement.\n\nIf we can do a better job enforcing the special enrollment, we think we can reduce the premiums by potentially 6 percent to 10 percent, he says.\n\nAnother way to reduce costs? Shrink provider networks. So, let's say you live in Hartford. Do you really need to pay for a plan that covers a doctor's visit in Danbury?\n\nCustomers are telling us they would go with a network choice option, or a narrow network, if it was cheaper and/or had a lower deductible, he says.\n\nThat chance, he says, could save another few percentage points in premiums.\n\nThird, Wadleigh says he is considering changes that would push more of the cost of emergency room visits to consumers, hoping to deter frequent ER fliers.\n\nThe question is whether all of this will work. Wadleigh says he thinks it will. He already has had discussions with existing carriers that are curious whether other insurers are looking to get into the marketplace.\n\nSo what that is telling me is that the carriers think that we're making changes in the positive direction, he says. And we expect that other carriers would be interested in joining our exchange with that.\n\nWhether they do — and whether the exchange will even be around for them to join — is still very much unclear.\n\nJeff Cohen, WNPR\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Courtesy of the Massachusetts Health Connector Courtesy of the Massachusetts Health Connector\n\nMassachusetts Chief Says, 'Every Day Is a Good Day of Coverage'\n\nLouis Gutierrez, executive director, Massachusetts Health Connector\n\nA near record number of Massachusetts residents are signing up for coverage through the state's online insurance market, the Health Connector. Enrollment is running 32 percent ahead of last year as the Jan. 31 deadline approaches. Around 47,000 people who didn't have insurance through the exchange last year have purchased insurance for 2017.\n\nSo many members, physicians and others in the health care world were stunned when Louis Gutierrez, who runs the exchange, said he couldn't guarantee coverage through the end of 2017 for the nearly 240,000 enrollees so far.\n\nI don't want to be in the business of speculating or making commitments about things I can't personally control, Gutierrez says. I don't think any of us really know what's going to happen with the repeal of the ACA.\n\nGutierrez says he is not predicting precipitous changes but adds that he can't speak to the future. Every day is a good day of coverage.\n\nHealth insurers, which are threatening to pull out of exchanges in some states, aren't the main concern in Massachusetts. Gutierrez says he is hearing very little from the state's mature and stable market. Most plans that sell insurance through the Health Connector are nonprofits based in the state. And they may have less reason to worry that healthy members will flee, leaving insurers to cover the high costs of ill members. Massachusetts residents would still be required to buy insurance, by state law, even if the ACA mandate is repealed.\n\nBut if federal funds shrink or disappear, it's likely coverage would become very expensive for the 178,000 men and women who expect to receive subsidies or tax credits for insurance purchased through the exchange.\n\nWe're interested in maintaining broad and affordable access to coverage, Gutierrez said, but that will depend on the shape of any subsidies that change or happen in the new scheme.\n\nMany Massachusetts residents are wondering whether the state could revert to the law passed in 2006, which became a model for Obamacare. The individual mandate is still on the books, but the employer mandate and other elements were replaced with provisions in the federal law.\n\nMartha Bebinger, WBUR\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Courtesy of Connect for Health Colorado Courtesy of Connect for Health Colorado\n\nColorado Looks Toward 'Working Together As Western States'\n\nKevin Patterson, CEO, Connect for Health Colorado\n\n\n\nThe view from Kevin Patterson, the CEO of Connect for Health Colorado, might be summarized as sunny with storm clouds on the horizon. I think we're feeling like things are going really well, he says.\n\nPatterson says enrollment numbers for 2017 are running 15 percent ahead of last year. But two things are clouding the future. First, the new Trump administration and congressional Republicans are vowing to undo Obamacare.\n\nSecond, the Colorado exchange is under fire from state lawmakers. As soon as the legislative session got underway in January, Republicans unveiled a bill to repeal the exchange altogether. They are expected to zero in on a recent federal audit that found the exchange improperly spent millions in federal funds and called for refunds.\n\nPatterson says the exchange has made many changes and disagrees with the recommendation to refund the money.\n\nThe exchange is expected to survive the legislative turmoil, but it still faces the possibility of federal subsidies disappearing under a repeal of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nBut Patterson believes the exchange could carry on. I do think there are things that we've learned that could be applied in a new era or whatever post-ACA is, he says.\n\nStill, he worries an Obamacare repeal without a timely, adequate replacement could cause some insurers to pull out of the exchange or charge higher rates. Already consumers saw premiums go up and choice go down this year. And this is pressing — insurers have to file rate requests in Colorado in May. So the clock is ticking, Patterson says. Somebody has to give us a little more guidance I think to the industry around what the new world is going to look like. And I think the sooner we do that the better it is for every consumer.\n\nBut, beyond 2017, he says, the exchange could look to expand its other lines of business beyond the individual marketplace. That could include helping small employers and public sector employers not in the marketplace figure out insurance packages and benefits. I think that's somewhere where we can show some more value, he says.\n\nColorado's exchange is also flirting with the possibility of working with neighboring states, particularly those in the Mountain time zone. We're kind of used to working together as Western states on problems that are really unique to us, Patterson says. That's where I would start.\n\nJohn Daley, Colorado Public Radio\n\nThis story is part of a reporting partnership with NPR, local member stations and Kaiser Health News.
In Georgia Runoffs, Dems Are Running Hard On Health Care. Republicans? Not So Much\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Austin McAfee/Icon Sportswire via Getty Images Austin McAfee/Icon Sportswire via Getty Images\n\nThere was still an hour to go before Vice President Pence took the stage to stump for Georgia's two incumbent U.S. senators, Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue. Both Republicans are fighting to hold onto their seats against Democratic challengers, with a runoff election set for Jan. 5.\n\nBut Pence was clearly the celebrity draw at this Nov. 20 campaign event in Canton, an Atlanta suburb. People were so eager to see him that parking spots were scarce and a long line of cars snaked through the parking lot of a community college. Some drivers jumped the curb and parked in the grass.\n\nHundreds of people, many unmasked, had to undergo temperature checks before boarding large coach buses for a short ride down the road to the rally site. It took place in a large open space outside of a conference center, but people stood close together, with little physical distancing.\n\nNext month's runoff in Georgia was triggered after no candidate in either Senate race won more than 50% of the vote in the Nov. 3 general election.\n\nIn the midst of the coronavirus pandemic and with the fate of the Affordable Care Act in question, Republicans are hoping the two incumbents can hang on to their seats, and thus preserve their party's control of the Senate, by a 50-48 margin.\n\nBut if the two Democratic challengers, the Rev. Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff, both win their runoffs, it will allow Democrats to take narrow control of the Senate, with the help of Vice President-elect Kamala Harris as a tiebreaker.\n\nYana De Moraes had come to the rally from another Atlanta suburb, Buford. She's uninsured, and, after a recent hospital stay, had been thinking a lot about how expensive medical care can be.\n\nWe would like our health care costs lowered, so it could be more affordable, she said, with a rueful laugh. So you don't get another heart attack while you're getting a bill!\n\nDe Moraes added she'd also like to see better price controls on prescription drugs to stop pharmaceutical companies from robbing American people.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Jason Armond /Los Angeles Times via Getty Images Jason Armond /Los Angeles Times via Getty Images\n\nOther voters said they were just looking for any kind of change, ideally one that involves less government involvement in health care.\n\nBarry Brown had made the 40-mile drive from his home in Atlanta for the rally. He's retired but too young to qualify for Medicare, so he has Obamacare insurance, which he affords with the help of a federal subsidy.\n\nIt sort of works. It's better than nothing, Brown said. I would like to see an improved health care situation. I don't know what that will be, so maybe they'll mention that today. I'm hoping so.\n\nBut Brown didn't get the answers he was looking for.\n\nAt the rally, Loeffler made only brief mention of her health care plan, which focuses on reducing drug prices and giving people access to insurance options that cost less but offer fewer benefits.\n\nWhen it was his turn to speak, Perdue didn't talk much about health care either, though he did take a shot at Obamacare, which he's voted multiple times to overturn.\n\nRemember a little thing called the Affordable Care Act? You think that was done bipartisan? Perdue asked the crowd. No! It was done with a supermajority! Can you imagine what they're gonna do if they get control of the Senate?\n\nThis has been typical for how the two Republicans handled health care as they campaigned throughout the state.\n\nIt's common to hear them stoke fears about what Democrats could do if they win the Senate. It's not common to hear them talk about health care despite their potential voters' interest in the issue.\n\nTheir Democrat challengers, however, have been all over health care in their own speeches.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Sam Whitehead/WABE Sam Whitehead/WABE\n\nWarnock opened his runoff campaign to unseat Loeffler with a modestly attended Nov. 12 event that focused entirely on health care. So did Ossoff in his bid to win Perdue's seat.\n\nThis is why these Senate runoffs are so vital, Ossoff said at a small, physically distanced event Nov. 10 in the shadow of the Georgia Capitol in Atlanta.\n\nOssoff and Warnock support adding a public insurance option to the Affordable Care Act. They also have emphasized the role Democrats will play in resurrecting key parts of the law if the U.S. Supreme Court decides to overturn it. The justices are set to make a ruling next year.\n\nIf the Supreme Court strikes down the Affordable Care Act, it will be up to Congress to decide how to legislate such that preexisting conditions remain covered, Ossoff said.\n\nDemocratic voters such as Janel Green connect with that message. She's from the nearby suburb of Decatur and is fighting breast cancer — for the second time. Green is worried that if the protections in the Affordable Care Act disappear, her private health insurance might try to deny her coverage.\n\nI have to worry about whether or not next year in open enrollment that I won't be discriminated against, that I won't have limits that would then potentially end my life, she said.\n\nMore than one-quarter of Georgians have preexisting conditions that could make it hard to get coverage if the Affordable Care Act is struck down, according to an analysis from the Kaiser Family Foundation.\n\nThat possibility is also driving Atlanta resident Herschel Jones to get involved in the runoff. On a recent weekday morning he dropped by an Ossoff campaign office to pick up a yard sign.\n\nJones, who has diabetes, is insured through the Department of Veterans Affairs. He said everyone deserves access to health care.\n\nIt's a main issue, because the Affordable Care Act benefits all those individuals who might have preexisting conditions, Jones said.\n\nOne reason why Ossoff and Warnock are running so much harder on health care than Perdue and Loeffler is because that strategy paid off for Democrats in the general election, said Ken Thorpe, a health policy professor at Emory University.\n\nPresident-elect Joe Biden can thank independent voters for his win in Georgia, Thorpe said, and they were drawn to him because of his promise to uphold Obamacare.\n\nThe threat of potentially losing health insurance in the midst of this pandemic turned out to be probably the major defining issue in the election, he said.\n\nPolling in the days leading up to the Nov. 3 election showed Democrats were motivated on the issues of health care and the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nIf Democrats want to win these Senate runoffs in Georgia, Thorpe said, they'll need to continue to stay focused on those issues. That emphasis could help them attract additional moderate voters as well as provide the motivation to entice those in the party base to come out again and cast ballots for a second time.\n\nThe health care issue is the probably main motivating factor that's gonna get Democrats and independents to the polls, he continued.\n\nBut in a state that's traditionally favored Republicans in runoff races, even with a strong health care message, it'll be tough for Ossoff and Warnock to break that trend and unseat the Republicans, Thorpe said.\n\nThis story comes from NPR's reporting partnership with WABE and Kaiser Health News.
VP Pence On Obamacare Repeal Failure: 'Congress Just Wasn't Ready'\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n\nVice President Mike Pence traveled to West Virginia Saturday where he met with small business owners before delivering public remarks, which included some lines about repealing Barack Obama's health care law, a day after Republicans efforts to gut the Affordable Care Act went down in flames.\n\nWest Virginia and President Trump, we all know the truth about this failed law, that every day Obamacare survives is another day that America suffers, Pence told a crowd gathered at a Charleston construction supply company.\n\nIn his remarks Pence praised the president's resolve and said Trump worked tirelessly over the last couple weeks to get Congress to repeal and replace the health care law.\n\nHe also gave House Speaker Paul Ryan a shout out, saying that both he and the President are grateful to Ryan and all the House Republicans who led the push to begin the end of Obamacare.\n\nUp to that point, it seemed as if the vice president was delivering remarks to build support for the American Health Care Act, the bill Ryan penned that was pulled indefinitely Friday afternoon ahead of a scheduled vote. The bill was supposed to make good on years of Republican campaign promises to finally start the dismantling of Barack Obama's signature law.\n\nAs NPR reported earlier this week, Republicans did not need Democratic support to prevail. In fact, the Republican leadership could have lost up to 22 GOP votes and still passed the bill.\n\nPence, perhaps reflecting on the enormity of the loss, paused before acknowledging what took place Friday afternoon.\n\nBut as we all learned yesterday Congress just wasn't ready. You saw it.\n\nAs NPR's Jessica Taylor reported Friday, it was clear House Republicans had defections from both the right and the center ensuring the bill would fail, even before a single vote was cast.\n\nEchoing remarks President Trump made from the Oval Office on Friday after the GOP bill was dumped, Pence attempted to blame Democrats for the GOP-led bill's failure.\n\nWith 100 percent of House Democrats, every single one, and a handful of Republicans actually standing in the way of President Trump's plan to repeal and replace Obamacare, we're back to the drawing board.\n\nFormer World Wrestling Entertainment head Linda McMahon, who now leads the Trump Administration's Small Business Administration, accompanied Pence at the event.\n\nAt one point, the vice president singled her out and joked her expertise could have been used in Washington a day earlier.\n\nYou know Linda, we're grateful to your leadership, but maybe we could have used some of your WWE superstars on Capitol Hill yesterday.
Who Is Supreme Court Nominee Amy Coney Barrett?\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Olivier Douliery/AFP via Getty Images Olivier Douliery/AFP via Getty Images\n\nUpdated Saturday at 5:22 p.m. ET\n\nPresident Trump's Supreme Court nominee, Judge Amy Coney Barrett, is a judge on the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Chicago and is a favorite among social conservatives. They, and others on the right, view her record as anti-abortion rights and hostile to the Affordable Care Act.\n\nIf confirmed, the 48-year-old Barrett would be the youngest justice on the Supreme Court and could help reshape the law and society for generations to come.\n\nWhen Justice Anthony Kennedy retired from the court in 2018, President Trump passed over Barrett, giving the nod instead to then-Judge Brett Kavanaugh. At the time, Trump told Barrett supporters that he was saving her to fill Ruth Bader Ginsburg's seat, should the justice retire or die, sources say.\n\nBehind the scenes, though, Barrett's interview with Trump then did not go particularly well, say sources close to the process but who are not authorized to speak publicly. She had conjunctivitis, had to wear dark glasses during the interview and was not at her best, as one source put it.\n\nBut this week, Barrett's interview seems to have gone far better. Moreover, these sources say, she has the support of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who views her as a judge with a clearly proven conservative track record.\n\nWhat kind of judge would Barrett be?\n\nBarrett was raised in Metairie, La., a suburb of New Orleans. Her father, Mike, was an attorney for Shell Oil, and her mother was a stay-at-home mom. Barrett attended St. Mary's Dominican High School for girls, then graduated with honors from Rhodes College, a Presbyterian-affiliated school in Tennessee, followed by graduation, summa cum laude, from Notre Dame Law School.\n\nShe clerked for the late conservative Justice Antonin Scalia, and during her clerkships, she was nicknamed The Conenator by fellow law clerks for destroying flimsy legal arguments, the Chicago Tribune reported.\n\nAfterward, Barrett briefly practiced law and then taught for 15 years at Notre Dame Law School in South Bend, Ind.\n\nShe is married to Jesse Barrett, a former prosecutor now in private practice, and the couple have seven children, one with Down syndrome and two adopted from Haiti. They live in South Bend, and she commutes to Chicago — almost an hour and 45 minutes away — where the appeals court sits.\n\nBarrett has been a federal judge for three years. She has written about 100 opinions and several telling dissents in which Barrett displayed her clear and consistent conservative bent, The Associated Press noted of her judicial record.\n\nFrom guns and sexual assault on campus to health care and abortion rights, Barrett has shown herself to be a conservative jurist and legal thinker in her rulings and academic writings.\n\nThe dogma lives loudly within you\n\nBarrett's confirmation hearing for the appeals court in 2017 raised hackles on both the right and the left.\n\nThe left saw Barrett as a socially conservative mirror image of Scalia, famous for his conservative approach to constitutional interpretation and passionate dissents from the high court's abortion- and gay-rights rulings. Barrett, like Scalia, is seen as an originalist or textualist. It's a philosophy that looks strictly at the text of the Constitution or statute and tries to apply original intention from the framers.\n\nDemocratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California, in particular, infuriated Republicans when she ticked off a list of the nominee's writings and speeches about faith and the law.\n\nThe dogma lives loudly within you, and that's of concern, Feinstein told the nominee.\n\nBarrett responded, If you're asking whether I take my Catholic faith seriously, I do, though I would stress that my personal church affiliation or my religious belief would not bear on the discharge of my duties as a judge.\n\nRepublicans charged that Feinstein's question betrayed an anti-Catholic bias, and Barrett was confirmed by a 55-43 vote, with three Democrats voting in favor of confirmation, and two not voting.\n\nBarrett is a member of a particularly conservative Christian faith group, People of Praise. Newsweek reported that the group teaches that husbands should assume authority as the head of the household. (Her parents are also members, and her father was a coordinator of the group's Southern chapters.)\n\nThe New York Times reported that People of Praise grew out of the Catholic charismatic renewal movement that began in the late 1960s and adopted Pentecostal practices such as speaking in tongues, belief in prophecy and divine healing.\n\nIf confirmed for the Supreme Court, Barrett would be the sixth Catholic justice. All but Sonia Sotomayor were nominated by Republican presidents. Justice Neil Gorsuch was raised Catholic but now lists himself as Episcopalian. Two other justices — Stephen Breyer and Elena Kagan — are Jewish.\n\nBarrett has also received thousands of dollars in honoraria for appearances from the Alliance Defending Freedom, according to a 2017 financial disclosure posted by Fix the Court, a group that seeks to reform the Supreme Court and federal court system, advocating for term limits and cameras in the courtroom.\n\nADF describes itself as advocating for religious liberty, the sanctity of human life, freedom of speech, and marriage and family. ADF represented Jack Phillips, who owns Masterpiece Cake shop and declined to bake a cake for a same-sex couple celebrating their marriage.\n\nBarrett reported receiving $4,200 from ADF in the disclosure, which covers 2016 through the first four months of 2017.\n\nBarrett has been critical of Roe v. Wade, the Supreme Court's 1973 abortion decision, but in 2016, she suggested that the court most likely would hollow out the decision, leaving the basic right to abortion in place, but allowing states wide latitude to make abortion difficult to obtain.\n\nI don't think the core case, Roe's core holding that women have a right to an abortion, I don't think that would change, Barrett said in a discussion at Jacksonville University. But I think the question of whether people can get very late-term abortions, you know, how many restrictions can be put on clinics, I think that will change.\n\nYouTube\n\nThat, however, was before Trump's election and the composition of the court moved more starkly to the right, making the outright reversal of Roe more plausible.\n\nSimilarly, the future of Obamacare could be at stake with Barrett's nomination. The court is scheduled to hear a third challenge to the law the week after the election. Twice before the court has upheld much of the law, but that could change now, with a possible Barrett vote pivotal.\n\nIndeed, she criticized Chief Justice John Roberts' reasoning in upholding the Affordable Care Act.\n\nChief Justice Roberts pushed the Affordable Care Act beyond its plausible meaning to save the statute, Barrett wrote in 2017. He construed the penalty imposed on those without health insurance as a tax, which permitted him to sustain the statute as a valid exercise of the taxing power; had he treated the payment as the statute did — as a penalty — he would have had to invalidate the statute as lying beyond Congress's commerce power.\n\nPrecedent\n\nIn her academic work, Barrett has written dismissively about the doctrine of respecting the Supreme Court's precedents, known as stare decisis.\n\nI tend to agree with those who say that a justice's duty is to the Constitution and that it is thus more legitimate for her to enforce her best understanding of the Constitution rather than a precedent she thinks clearly in conflict with it, she wrote in a 2013 law review article.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Patrick Semansky/AP Patrick Semansky/AP\n\nGuns\n\nWhile on the 7th Circuit, Barrett wrote that the Second Amendment did not necessarily ban people convicted of felonies from owning a gun. She declared a Wisconsin law, barring anyone convicted of a felony even if they aren't convicted of a violent crime, to be unconstitutional.\n\n[L]egislatures have the power to prohibit dangerous people from possessing guns. But that power extends only to people who are dangerous, Barrett wrote in a 37-page dissent.\n\nHer reliance on originalism also came through a few lines later: In 1791 — and for well more than a century afterward — legislatures disqualified categories of people from the right to bear arms only when they judged that doing so was necessary to protect the public safety.\n\nImmigration\n\nBarrett voted to uphold the Trump administration's public charge rule, which adds barriers for immigrants seeking green cards if they rely on public benefits, food stamps or housing vouchers, Courthouse News Service reported.\n\nThe 7th Circuit blocked the administration's ability to enforce its interpretation of the public charge rule in Illinois. Barrett wrote in a dissent that the Department of Homeland Security's definition is not unreasonable, especially considering that the text of the current statute ... was amended in 1996 to increase the bite of the public charge determination.
Trump Rescinds Obamacare Birth Control Mandate\n\nDAVID GREENE, HOST:\n\nAnd the Trump administration is making it easier for employers to opt out of covering birth control in their health insurance plans. The coverage was guaranteed under the Obama administration with the exception of employees at some religious organizations. Attorney General Jeff Sessions said the Trump administration is leading by example on religious liberty. But this was a troubling development for Planned Parenthood Federation of America. And its president Cecile Richards is on the line. Good morning.\n\nCECILE RICHARDS: Good morning.\n\nGREENE: Let me just talk through the impact of this. The Trump administration said Friday that 99 percent of women will still have the same access to birth control. And they said less affluent women can still get free or subsidized contraceptives through Medicaid and other programs. I mean, do you agree with those numbers. Or what's your estimate for the number of women who might be affected by this?\n\nRICHARDS: Well, David, I mean, it's incredibly ironic that they would now refer to programs that they've been trying to end through Trumpcare for the last, you know, several months - access to, you know, Planned Parenthood, access to Medicaid and access to the Family Planning Program. And the basic fact here is that millions and millions of women - now about 62 million women - have access to birth control and their insurance plan at no cost. And it's led to amazing successes. Women have saved a lot of money. The estimates are 1.4 billion dollars alone the first year. We've reduced unintended pregnancy - the lowest rate of teen pregnancy in the history of the United States. And women are getting better birth control. All of these are good things. They allow women to plan their families and stay in the workforce. And this decision is basically now going to turn the reins over to your boss to decide whether or not women can get birth control. And that's just not going to be good for women.\n\nGREENE: But do you expect a lot of bosses to actually change that much? I mean, the Trump ministration is saying that this, in terms of numbers, is probably going to have very little impact. I mean, do you accept that?\n\nRICHARDS: Well, one, I don't think they - they don't - certainly don't know. And in fact, I mean, all of the things that they have put out are messages that send - that basically say birth control is dangerous for women, which is really crazy. More than 90 percent of women in this country use birth control for a whole host of reasons. I think the problem is, you know, we fought so hard under Obamacare to get women equal access to health care, including family planning. Because until that bill passed, many, many employers did not provide birth control for women. And again, women are now half the workforce in this country. And a big reason that we've been able to participate and work and go to school is because we've been able to plan our families. And that's really what's at risk here. And frankly, the Trump administration has been on a war against birth control and women's health from day one.\n\nGREENE: You feel like they're sending a message that birth control can be dangerous because it seems the message they're sending to some is that this is a matter of religious liberty and employers not being forced to, you know, sacrifice their religious beliefs.\n\nRICHARDS: Well, I mean, that's not - this is not what that rule says. The rule basically says if any employee or objects to birth control, they don't have to provide it. And look. I think the problem is - you look who's been in charge of Health and Human Services with the Trump administration. It has been filled with key positions, folks who have been against birth control from the very beginning. In fact, ironically, the woman who was appointed to run the National Family Planning Program has said herself she doesn't believe in birth control. This is just the beginning. And I think many of us expect this will not end here. There are rumors of all kinds of other ways in which they're going to restrict birth control access. And I just don't understand it. It's good for women's health. It's good for the economy. And this kind of attack is something that you would have expected in the 1930s, not in 2017.\n\nGREENE: And we just have a few seconds left. But I mean, the Obama administration issued this mandate to cover birth control. Religious organizations filed suit. The Supreme Court ruled that the government can't force private companies, nonprofits to pay for birth control against their religious beliefs. Are you concerned that the law is on the administration's side here?\n\nRICHARDS: Well, I mean, obviously we'll be challenging it along with the ACLU, and that's really important. But there were all kinds of accommodations made for a religious employer. The danger is you have things now like universities that provide birth control for women that are students. You have all kinds of organizations who may have their own political or religious views. Why should they be able to impose that on American women? It's simply not right. And we'll be fighting it every step of the way and ensuring that women continue to get birth control at Planned Parenthood.\n\nGREENE: Cecile Richards is the president of Planned Parenthood Federation of America. We appreciate your time this morning. Thanks a lot.\n\nRICHARDS: Good to see you, David. Thanks.\n\nCopyright © 2017 NPR. All rights reserved.

'The Speech': How Sanders' 2010 Filibuster Elevated His Progressive Profile\n\nIt was 2010, and Sen. Bernie Sanders had already been in Congress for nearly two decades. The Vermont independent had a long — and consistent — track record, but at that point, he hadn't yet emerged as a national figure on the left.\n\nThat quickly changed on Dec. 10, starting at 10:25 a.m. and over the following eight-and-a-half hours.\n\nDie-hard Sanders supporters simply know it as The Speech: a filibuster he launched decrying a bipartisan tax deal crafted primarily by then-Vice President Joe Biden and then-Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell.\n\nYouTube\n\nThe agreement — which extended the Bush-era tax cuts that the Democratic Party had railed against for years, and lowered the estate tax threshold for the mega-wealthy — enraged progressives like Sanders.\n\nWhile Biden and President Obama argued that those concessions paved the way for Democratic priorities like an extension of unemployment benefits, Sanders didn't buy it.\n\nYou can call what I am doing today whatever you want. You can call it a filibuster. You can call it a very long speech, Sanders said toward the top of his marathon. I am simply here today to take as long as I can to explain to the American people the fact that we have to do a lot better than this agreement provides.\n\nThe moment resonates nearly a decade later, as Sanders battles for the Democratic presidential nomination with the chief architect of the deal, Biden.\n\nSanders' filibuster underscored a question that has become central to the current nomination battle: whether compromising to get things done, or fighting on principles, is the better way to chart political progress.\n\nA deal forged by Biden and McConnell\n\nThat December morning, Obama was already facing a lot of pressure.\n\nDemocrats had just lost the House of Representatives. And here was the president, about a month later, asking his party for a major tax deal that would extend the Bush administration's tax cuts for the wealthy — something Democrats had campaigned against for years.\n\nThe issue here is not whether I think the tax cuts for the wealthy are a good or smart thing to do; I've said repeatedly that I think they're not a smart thing to do, Obama told NPR's Morning Edition in an Oval Office interview recorded the evening before. The problem is that this is the single issue the Republicans are willing to scotch the entire deal for.\n\nWith Bush's landmark tax cuts set to expire on New Year's Eve, McConnell and fellow Senate Republicans had laid down a gauntlet to Obama and Democrats: They'd hold up all Senate business unless the tax breaks were extended.\n\nObama tapped Biden to figure out a deal with McConnell, and the two men reached one relatively quickly. According to a Senate Republican aide, Biden and McConnell hammered out the agreement in several phone calls over the course of a single weekend.\n\nRepublicans got the Bush tax cuts extended for two more years — past the 2012 election. They also got a lower estate tax rate. In return, Democrats got an extension of unemployment benefits and a range of broader tax cuts aimed at lower- and middle-income earners, including a temporary reduction in Social Security payroll taxes.\n\nObama and Biden said the whole thing would help the still-recovering economy, and clear the way for a lot of other legislative business to get done by year's end.\n\nWe'd never done anything like this before\n\nTo Sanders, Obama's justifications sounded like something he was used to hearing from Republican presidents.\n\nHe was very frustrated, recalled Warren Gunnels, a longtime Sanders staffer that the 2020 presidential campaign staff now jokingly refers to as the candidate's chief of receipts.\n\nHe wanted to plot out a strategy to do everything that we could to defeat that deal, said Gunnels, and the idea of a filibuster was born.\n\nEven though Sanders said at the beginning of the speech that he wasn't out to set any records, Gunnels said the unofficial goal was to top an eight-hour mark that had been set years earlier by Nevada Sen. Harry Reid.\n\nWe'd never done anything like this before, Gunnels said. He'd done a lot of hour speeches, a lot of half-hour speeches, a lot of 45-minute speeches. But he'd never spoken on the floor for eight hours.\n\nMight we have to compromise? Yeah. Maybe we do. But you've got to wage the fight before you compromise.\n\nSanders didn't want to resort to any gimmicks — like Texas Sen. Ted Cruz's reading Green Eggs And Ham during an hours-long anti-Obamacare speech in 2013 — so he, Gunnels and other staffers hammered out several general refrains that the senator would keep returning to.\n\nSanders kept circling back to two main points as the speech went on.\n\nFirst, that public opinion was on his side. The polls show us the American people do not believe millionaires and billionaires need more tax breaks, he said at one point.\n\nAnd, foreshadowing his future presidential campaigns, Sanders made a point to talk past the other lawmakers — who he likely realized were mostly going to vote for the bipartisan deal. He kept urging people to call Congress to complain.\n\nBy and large, it is not a good deal. We can do better, he said several hours in. And if the American people stand up and work with us, if they get on the phones — if they call up their senators, if they call up their congressmen — if they make their voices heard and said, 'Enough is enough. The rich have got it all right now,'  Sanders thought the deal could be scuttled.\n\nThat's when Democrats really began to take notice. The calls to offices, after a couple hours of the speech, they couldn't get in, Reid said earlier this year. The Senate website was also briefly overwhelmed by traffic. And, at a time when the feat was more of a political novelty, Sanders trended on Twitter and added scores of new followers.\n\nBringing Bill Clinton to the lectern\n\nGunnels noted all those developments from the Senate floor, but it wasn't until the White House responded in a dramatic way that he fully realized how much of an impact the speech was having in progressive circles.\n\nI don't even know if they had a topic in mind, but they just rolled out Bill Clinton while Bernie was speaking, Gunnels recalled, laughing.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Jim Watson/AFP via Getty Images Jim Watson/AFP via Getty Images\n\nIn a move that launched scores of pre-meme memes, Obama had strolled into the White House briefing room with the 42nd president, who looked thrilled to be back at the famous lectern.\n\nAs Obama stood next to him — and then alone, after Obama left to return to a holiday party — Clinton defended the deal for more than a half hour. The agreement taken as a whole is, I believe, the best bipartisan agreement we can reach to help the largest number of Americans, he said.\n\nMeanwhile, on the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue, Sanders kept going.\n\nHe railed on corporate pay and government subsidies for energy giants like Exxon Mobil — familiar themes for his later presidential runs. He decried the deal's increase in deficit spending.\n\nAnd he bluntly criticized Obama. His credibility has been severely damaged. We are caving in on this issue and we should not be, Sanders said.\n\nFinally, after eight-and-a-half-hours, Sanders stopped.\n\nThe spark that set things off\n\nAnd then?\n\nThe Senate overwhelmingly approved the tax package on an 81-19 vote. Despite loud protests from House Democrats, the House approved the measure too, and it became law.\n\nBy all short-term measures, Sanders' filibuster had failed.\n\nAn exhausted Gunnels said his despair quickly turned around, though.\n\nWhen you look back at that, I think it might have been the spark that set things off, he said, sitting in Sanders' presidential campaign headquarters.\n\nAdded Jeff Weaver, the candidate's top strategist: [The filibuster] brought Bernie Sanders to the notice of millions of Americans who didn't know who he was, and I think it laid a lot of the groundwork for the success that he would see in the 2015-2016 election cycle.\n\nThe speech became a book, which became a bestseller. And progressives frustrated by the Obama administration's deal-cutting had a new hero to tout, as Republicans gained more leverage in Washington over the coming years.\n\nThe next year, Biden stood next to McConnell on a stage and defended the deal, which he argued spurred economic growth. We've got a long way to go, Biden said. But it actually was not only a compromise; it was a compromise that was useful for the American economy.\n\nObama did get those top-tier Bush tax cuts eliminated down the line.\n\nStill, in the immediate wake of the filibuster, Sanders told NPR he was tired of compromises. Might we have to compromise? Yeah. Maybe we do. But you've got to wage the fight before you compromise. You've got to take the case to the American people. And we didn't do that.\n\nCompromise, or fight?\n\nNearly a decade later, Sanders and Biden are battling for the Democratic presidential nomination, in a contest that largely revolves around that same key question.
Former KKK Leader David Duke Blames Debate Protests On Black Lives Matter 'Radicals'\n\nFormer Ku Klux Klan grand wizard David Duke drew protesters to a U.S. Senate candidate debate in Louisiana on Wednesday night.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Gerald Herbert/AP Gerald Herbert/AP\n\nHe's in a crowded field to replace retiring Republican Sen. David Vitter and earned enough support in polls to make the cut for this final debate, hosted by Raycom Media at Dillard University, a historically black college in New Orleans.\n\nDillard officials say they didn't know who would be participating when they agreed to rent the hall.\n\nUnlike the presidential debates, this one was closed to the public. Even journalists had to watch a video feed from a side room.\n\nThe six candidates appeared in an empty auditorium. Outside, students and other protesters shouted Let us in! as they pushed against doors to get into the building.\n\nNo Duke, no KKK, no fascist U.S.A., they chanted.\n\nOn the debate stage, Duke acknowledged the protests and blamed them on radicals from the Black Lives Matter movement.\n\nIt is time we stand up now, he said. We're getting outnumbered and outvoted in our own nation.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Gerald Herbert/AP Gerald Herbert/AP\n\nDuke is one of about two-dozen candidates in the contest. Louisiana has an unusual system in which candidates of all parties appear together on the general election ballot. If no one gets a majority, a December runoff between the top two finishers determines the winner.\n\nThe leading contenders are Republican state Treasurer John Kennedy, GOP Reps. Charles Boustany and John Fleming, and two Democrats — Public Service Commissioner Foster Campbell and attorney Caroline Fayard.\n\nEven before the debate, this Senate race has been colorful in the way that Louisiana politics can be. One candidate suggested he would prefer drinking weedkiller to keeping Obamacare; there was an ad starring a terrorist goat; and there have been allegations of hiring prostitutes — something that has dogged the incumbent Vitter, who lost the governor's race last year to Democrat John Bel Edwards.\n\nHaving the former KKK grand wizard in the mix stole focus from the issues at several points in the debate, like when Campbell had to deny allegations from Fayard linking him to David Duke in the past.\n\nIt's not just a lie, it's a damn lie, Campbell said. I have nothing in common with David Duke other than we're probably breathing.\n\nDuke's candidacy comes during an election season in which white nationalists have supported Donald Trump in the presidential race. Trump has disavowed Duke's support.\n\nYet Duke fashions himself an ally, ready to fight what he, too, calls a rigged system and vowing to take care of Hillary Clinton.\n\nThe lady should be getting the electric chair, being charged with treason, he said during the debate.\n\nA former one-term state lawmaker, Duke first gained national attention when he finished second in the 1991 race for Louisiana governor. He lost to Democrat Edwin Edwards in a campaign that featured bumper stickers that said, Vote for the Crook — It's Important, arguing a corrupt Edwards as governor was better than a white supremacist. Both men later served time in federal prison.\n\nDuke is not considered competitive in the Louisiana Senate race yet drew some fire from the front-runner, Kennedy, the state treasurer.\n\nMr. Duke is a convicted felon, Kennedy said. He spent time in prison for lying to his supporters. He swindled them out of their money and took that money and used it for his gambling addiction.\n\nDillard University officials asked students to stay away from the debate. One who didn't was political science major Breial Kennedy. She was briefly detained after pushing her way into the building.\n\nThey're allowing a terrorist, a neo-Nazi Ku Klux Klan member, to be secured in a building in which we paid thousands of dollars to attend annually, says Kennedy.\n\nShe's appalled that such a thing would happen on a historically black campus.
Rep. Carter Says He'll Consider Senate's Revisions To Health Care Plan\n\nThe Senate is about to release its plan to overhaul health care. Steve Inskeep talks to Republican Rep. Buddy Carter of Georgia about how the bill might be different from the House version.\n\nSTEVE INSKEEP, HOST:\n\nAnd I'm Steve Inskeep in Washington, D.C., where we are finding out this hour about a Republican health care bill as drafted in the Senate. Republican leaders have been drafting it in secret. Now they've released it, and they hope to vote as soon as possible. They're moving this way because every vote counts. They have none to spare - don't want debate that would drive votes away. But the secrecy made at least one Republican, Ron Johnson, tell CNN he cannot support it without time to read.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nRON JOHNSON: What I've told leadership, very clearly, is I'm going to need time and my constituents are going to need time to evaluate exactly how this is going to affect them. So I personally think that holding a vote on this next week would definitely be rushed. I can't imagine, quite honestly, that I'd have the information to evaluate and justify a yes vote within just a week.\n\nINSKEEP: We are having a look at the bill. And we'll have analysis later this hour and in days to come. A little bit earlier this morning, we spoke with a congressman who voted for the House version of the health care bill, Georgia Republican Congressman Buddy Carter. Welcome back to the program, sir.\n\nBUDDY CARTER: Well, thank you.\n\nINSKEEP: So we don't know what the Senate's going to do. We do know what President Trump has said he wants. He urged a more generous bill than the one you voted for, one with heart, according to the president, and presumably bigger subsidies for people who would have smaller subsidies under your bill. Can you support that?\n\nCARTER: Well, certainly, I will consider it. And certainly, I - we knew all along that there were going to be changes made to it when it went over to the Senate. That's part of the process. So you know, it really depends on the changes. I haven't had a chance to read the bill. Obviously, it's not finalized yet. It's not over here, but I will tell you that I will be looking at it with an open mind. And there is some urgency to this matter. We know that we've got to do something. I go home so often, and people ask me, are you going to do something? Are you going to do something? Well, we've got to do something. Just look at what happened yesterday in Indiana and Wisconsin when Anthem announced that they were pulling out of the exchange. I mean, this forces us - it forces our hand even more.\n\nINSKEEP: You know, I'm glad you bring this up, Congressman, because there's been a lot of discussion on our air about the fact that a lot of health insurance companies have pulled out of these state exchanges. Many places have only one insurer to choose from. There's fear of zero insurers in some places. But as has also been noted, Republicans have made specific efforts to cause this to happen, for example, a provision sponsored by Senator Marco Rubio of Florida that targeted financing to help steady the insurance markets. If it's a problem that the markets are getting worse, why did you do that?\n\nCARTER: Well, I can't speak on behalf of Senator Rubio. I don't know why he did that. But...\n\nINSKEEP: But it passed both houses of Congress, right?\n\nCARTER: Well, I suspect you're correct. But the point remains that Obamacare is imploding. Obamacare is failing under its own weight. We know we've got to do something. The Affordable Care Act has been a failure, and we've got to get health care back on track here. We've got to get insurance coverage for these people. Otherwise, we're going to really be in a mess in this country.\n\nINSKEEP: Is it bad enough that a bill has to pass the Senate in the next week, do you think?\n\nCARTER: I'm not sure that it's that imminent. But at the same time, we need to get our work done. I'm not sure that, you know, debating this further - and look, we've been talking about this for the six months that we've been in session here. And yes, the Senate is just now getting to it. But at the same time, they've had six months to prepare for this. There's no excuse for us to beleaguer this and to carry it on even further.\n\nINSKEEP: You know, you raised one other thing I want to follow up on, Congressman Carter. You say you want to see what the Senate bill is. You want to see what it looks like. You're reserving judgment, which is totally fair and also raises a very real point. President Trump says, I want a more generous bill with more generous subsidies. You're in a position of not wanting to spend too much on health insurance. Could the Senate bill lose your vote if it becomes too generous, so to speak?\n\nCARTER: Well, it certainly could. To me, one of the most important aspects of this is Medicaid reform. We need to make Medicaid better. Medicaid is a safety-net program. It was intended for the aged, the blind, the disabled, for mothers and children. It was not intended for able-bodied adults, and that's going to be very important to me.\n\nINSKEEP: Making sure that the Medicaid expansion is rolled back or that Medicaid is reshaped - that's important to you?\n\nCARTER: Exactly - and to make it even better because when we roll it back and we make it truly for those who do need it, then it'll be a much better program.\n\nINSKEEP: OK. Congressman Carter, always a pleasure talking with you. Thank you very much, sir.\n\nCARTER: Thank you, sir.\n\nINSKEEP: That is Congressman Buddy Carter of Georgia.\n\nCopyright © 2017 NPR.

Pete Seeger's Legacy Gets Immortalized With 'Smithsonian Folkways' Collection\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Diana Davies/Courtesy of the artist Diana Davies/Courtesy of the artist\n\nThough Pete Seeger, the heralded folk singer, songwriter and social activist died in 2014, his voice has left a lasting impression on American music. May 3, 2019 would have been Seeger's 100th birthday and to mark the centennial, Smithsonian Folkways is set to release a six-CD collection titled Pete Seeger: The Smithsonian Folkways Collection.\n\nThis expansive collection features 20 previously unreleased tracks that spotlight Seeger's pacifist methods, environmental activism and straightforward, inquisitive songwriting style. The collection also comes with a 200-page book on Seeger, written by Smithsonian Folkways curator and archivist Jeff Place.\n\nPlace spoke with NPR's Audie Cornish about Seeger's exploration period while fighting in World War II, the timelessness of his records and his impact on American folk. Hear the radio version of their conversation at the audio link and read on for more that didn't make the broadcast.\n\nThis interview has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nAudie Cornish: We know him as someone who borrows and brings to the mainstream certain things he finds in other cultures. What did you learn about Pete Seeger as a writer looking through his papers?\n\nJeff Place: He was a great writer. He had a column called Appleseeds and a magazine called Sing Out for many, many, many decades and a number of different books where he sort of wrote about the work that he was doing.\n\nAnd, in a way, thought of his work as journalism.\n\nYeah, he was great on going and finding these little, like, quotes in political history books and other books. You know in literature and in kind of taking them out and using them in his columns. Like the song Where Have All The Flowers Gone came out of a Russian novel. He found a line in there which inspired him to do Where Have All The Flowers Gone.\n\nI want to talk about some of the songs that were never released. One of them that's featured here was recorded in the 1940s. Pete Seeger was sent to war, he was stationed in the Pacific and in the collection you have a series of his letters. What was he writing about? And what do we come to understand about this period?\n\nWell, you know, Pete Seeger was in the service and in the Pacific and hanging out with folklorists a lot, you know. So, he kind of went over there and he used the opportunity to record indigenous people from that part of the world and he recorded a lot of other soldier songs. He had this sort of [what] looked like a mimeograph letter or something he'd sent home to all his friends reporting on his findings called Reports from The Marianas.\n\nWe think of Seeger as a pacifist. What do you learn from that period about how he came to that position?\n\nI once heard an interview Pete you being asked by a member of the remembers the audience and he was saying, Well, Mr. Seeger, you don't believe in war ready for any cause? And he said, No, that's not true. There was a time period in 1940s when there was a reason to fight for the cause. And I was there and I would do it again if it happened again.\n\nThis song Ballad of Dr. Dearjohn was recorded in 1963. How did you find it in the collection?\n\nThe thing about Folkways Collection and Pete Seeger and he put out 70 albums for Folkways and he also put out three or four hundred extra tapes of additional material that was never used. So I started going through all those tapes and I found this song that had been written and published in a magazine called Broadside. And what was interesting about it, it was contemporaneous to 1962 and the Canadian health care law, the Saskatchewan Law, and the debates and the song were identical to the whole thing we've been hearing about Obamacare in the last few years.\n\ntoggle caption Courtesy of Smithsonian Folkways\n\nThe thing was, you've got to go back many hundreds of years and before there was, you know, all this media and radio television and all this. What would happen is political events or satires would happen and someone would write a satirical song or a topical song about it and they'd publish it on pieces of paper, selling for like a nickel. They were called broadside ballads. So, this is all sort of out of that tradition of people who are trying to write broadside ballads in the 1960s.\n\nNow, Pete Seeger was born in New York City and the Hudson River was important to him, especially as he lived further up the river and later years. Can you tell us the story behind the song Of Time And Rivers Flowing?\n\nYeah, Pete, he spent years and years traveling the country and all over the world, actually, in the '60s. He was one of the first guys to sing multicultural songs and things like that. And somewhere along the line, apparently it dawned on him that he actually never paid any attention to where he actually lived [and] what was going on there. He says, I'm a total stranger in my own hometown when I go home.\n\nHe'd notice there was, like, sewage floating in the river. But he got to know the shad fishermen. the shad fishermen would take him out and show him all this like you know environmental damage and so, he wrote this song for the shad fisherman.\n\nHe really tried to build movements through his music, or at least connect to movements through his music. How does that connect to what you see going on on the landscape today?\n\nHe has like, what they call Pete's children. It's a lot of movements he was part of that he didn't really start or you know he had lent his hand to, like Civil Rights Movement and things like that. But I think that the environmental thing on the river was really kind of Pete. He thought it was just like completely insane thought that he was gonna build this this boat, a sloop, and sail up and down the bay and, you know... playing music and stuff. But he did it and there's still a festival up there every year and all these people who come and there's still people who are going up and down the river in that boat, even after Pete's gone.
Democratic Presidential Contenders Propose Free College And Student Loan Forgiveness\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Wilfredo Lee/AP Wilfredo Lee/AP\n\nDuring the 2016 election, Bernie Sanders stood out as one of the first major presidential contenders to call for making college free.\n\nFor 2020, Sanders is at it again. Ahead of tonight's debate, he proposed not only eliminating tuition at public colleges, but canceling Americans' outstanding student loan debt — all $1.6 trillion.\n\nThis proposal will make it possible for Americans to get all the education they need regardless of their financial status, Sanders said at a press conference on Monday, introducing a bill — the College for All Act of 2019 — that would amend the Higher Education Act of 1965.\n\nBut this time, Sanders is far from alone among the candidates for the Democratic presidential nomination. Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren has released detailed plans for free college and student debt relief.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption J. Scott Applewhite/AP J. Scott Applewhite/AP\n\nIn her closing statement during last night's debate in Miami, she talked about how she was able to achieve her dream of being a special education teacher by attending a $50-a-semester commuter college at the University of Houston.\n\nShe, along with Sens. Cory Booker, Kamala Harris and Kirsten Gillibrand, have co-sponsored related bills, the Debt-Free College Act and a 2017 version of the College for All Act.\n\nAnd Joe Biden, whose wife Jill is a longtime community college professor, has backed free community college from the beginning.\n\nKevin Carey, who directs education policy at the nonpartisan think tank New America, calls the 2020 Democratic field an arms race for who can be the most ambitious and expansive when it comes to tackling the cost of higher education.\n\nBut, he says, there are important differences among the candidates' proposals — and of course roadblocks along the way. There are questions of equity, fairness, cost and feasibility, as well as the question of which plan will attract the most voters in this early stage of the game.\n\nWhen it comes to feasibility, although they are mentioned in the same breath, there is one big difference between tuition-free and student debt relief proposals.\n\nThe federal government runs the student loan program, but it doesn't run public colleges; states do.\n\nThat means a president can propose matching funds and incentives — as both Warren's and Sanders' plans do — but they can't force states to abolish tuition.\n\nCarey, at New America, compares the situation to what happened when some states refused to increase access to Medicaid despite federal incentives under Obamacare. States are willing to leave money on the table if they don't want to expand their own spending, he says.\n\nBut Sara Goldrick-Rab, a sociologist at Temple University who focuses on the question of college affordability, disagrees. She thinks the federal student aid programs provide plenty of leverage over colleges and universities to incentivize them to eliminate tuition.\n\nBe that as it may, student loan plans are different from free college. Congress has the power to write off outstanding student debt. That's what Warren and Sanders have called for. They both say forgiving hundreds of billions of dollars in debt will stimulate the economy, allowing more millennials to buy homes and start businesses.\n\nThe objection some critics raise to student loan forgiveness is about fairness.\n\nWarren's plan is targeted by income toward those earning less than $100,000. It allows no more than $50,000 of loan forgiveness per person. That makes it cheaper than Sanders' plan to write off all student debt, while still forgiving 75% of outstanding debt.\n\nBoth candidates, by the way, say that they would pay for the plans with new taxes — on the wealthy for Warren, or on Wall Street transactions for Sanders.\n\nBut neither Sanders' nor Warren's student debt relief proposals put any money in the pockets of people who never attended college in the first place (those who would be less advantaged as a group) or who never took out loans to do so (those who tend to be more advantaged).\n\nAnother issue is graduate students. About 40% of outstanding student loans were taken out to attend graduate school, and Carey points out Sanders' plan amounts to a one-time write-down of those loans with no plans to do anything similar in the future.\n\nLaura Hanna of the activist group the Debt Collective says that's not the point. Full debt forgiveness is a matter of principle, she says. We think education is a right. It should be free to everybody.\n\nHanna's group has been organizing for the cancellation of student debt since the height of the Occupy Wall Street protests in 2012. Their members appeared alongside Sanders and several House members at Monday's press conference announcing his debt forgiveness proposal. They are part of the youth and activist base that have transformed student debt into an issue, she says, that won't be ignored in this election cycle.\n\nThere's real anger and frustration around it. This is an issue that candidates aren't going to be able to avoid.
What Trump Said About Health Care, And What He Is Likely To Do\n\nPresident Trump had a lot to say about health care policy in the State of the Union address. How might he act on it?\n\nMARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST:\n\nFor a moment during the State of the Union address last night, President Trump spoke about an issue that reaches beyond party lines.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I'm calling for bipartisan legislation that achieves the goal of dramatically lowering prescription drug prices. Get a bill on my desk, and I will sign it into law immediately.\n\nKELLY: At that point, Democrats in the gallery stood up, held out three fingers and chanted HR 3, the name of the drug-pricing bill the House passed in December.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nUNIDENTIFIED PEOPLE: (Chanting) HR 3, HR 3.\n\nKELLY: Here to talk us through that moment and a few others in the speech is NPR health policy reporter Selena Simmons-Duffin.\n\nHey there, Selena.\n\nSELENA SIMMONS-DUFFIN, BYLINE: Hi, Mary Louise.\n\nKELLY: Give me some context to start with about - I'm not sure I know where Congress is on drug-pricing legislation.\n\nSIMMONS-DUFFIN: Well, Congress has kind of stalled on drug-pricing legislation right now. The bipartisan legislation that Trump mentioned there was - is from Senators Grassley and Wyden. It's actually quite similar to HR 3 except for one key thing. HR 3 allows Medicare to directly negotiate on drug prices. And President Trump used to talk about how it's crazy that we don't negotiate. Currently, that is illegal for Medicare to negotiate. He has not been saying that recently. Republicans generally say that idea is a nonstarter.\n\nSo that chanting during the speech was like a dare to the president. You want to be aggressive on drug prices? Support HR 3.\n\nKELLY: Any chance he is going to support HR 3?\n\nSIMMONS-DUFFIN: Almost certainly no. The question is now whether Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell allows a vote on that bipartisan bill from the senators. He's been resistant on that. So we'll have to see if President Trump prevails. Another health care issue that voters care about that came up last night is coverage for pre-existing conditions. Let's listen to that part of the speech.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nTRUMP: I've also made an ironclad pledge to American families. We will always protect patients with preexisting conditions.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nKELLY: An ironclad pledge there.\n\nSIMMONS-DUFFIN: Yes.\n\nKELLY: The significance of that pledge and that language.\n\nSIMMONS-DUFFIN: Well, he kind of needs to make a pledge because the Trump administration is currently arguing in federal court in the Texas v. Azar case that the Affordable Care Act should be struck down as unconstitutional. And the Affordable Care Act, of course, is the law that protects people with preexisting conditions. So McConnell has made a similar promise that Trump made during his speech last night - don't worry; we'll protect this, you know, very popular provision of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nKELLY: Yeah.\n\nSIMMONS-DUFFIN: But they haven't come up with a plan or legislation that shows how they would do that. So they're aware that this is popular and that voters might be worried about the protection going away if Obamacare does get struck down.\n\nKELLY: One other thing, Selena, before I let you go - a bit of a swipe that the president took last night. He mentioned socialism, which I think...\n\nSIMMONS-DUFFIN: Yes.\n\nKELLY: ...People heard as a not-so-veiled reference to Medicare for All, the legislation championed by Bernie Sanders, among others. This going to be a central campaign theme for President Trump?\n\nSIMMONS-DUFFIN: Yeah, it seems like it. It wasn't the first time he mentioned that. It's worth pointing out that Medicare for All is not a socialist system like the U.K. has, where there are government-run hospitals and government-employed doctors. It is a government-run health plan. So there would still be private doctors, private hospitals. But socialism is an old, old American attack line against universal insurance. Truman wanted that, and obviously, it had an impact. We don't have a single-payer health system today. So that criticism worked then, and Trump wants to see if it'll work now.\n\nKELLY: NPR health policy reporter Selena Simmons-Duffin, thank you.\n\nSIMMONS-DUFFIN: Thanks.\n\nCopyright © 2020 NPR.

Apprehensive About 'Apprehensions' (And 'Crisis' And 'Record')\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption John Moore/Getty Images John Moore/Getty Images\n\nThe language used to describe immigration is one of the most common topics of concern when we hear from NPR listeners and readers. That's no surprise, really, given the rapidly evolving nature of what is happening at the Southwest border and the way some words (crisis and illegal come to mind) have been marshaled for political ends.\n\nAdvocates on both sides of the immigration issue want to paint the situation in stark terms for their own purposes. But, of course, that's not NPR's role. Its reporting should (and does) strive to present the information as factually and fairly as possible, so listeners and readers can make up their own minds about the issues discussed.\n\nApprehensions\n\nThe word apprehensions (and its verb form, apprehended) is one word sparking some recent debate.\n\nWhen U.S. Customs and Border Protection releases its monthly reports about the number of migrants they are processing at the Southwest border, the official statistic is referred to as apprehensions and inadmissibles.\n\nNPR has used the term apprehended, rightly, going back many years, when talking about those arrested trying to enter the country illegally. Some readers and listeners have questioned whether it is the best word choice now that the nature of those apprehensions has so substantially changed in recent months.\n\nHere's an explanation of what NPR is referring to when the word is used, and thoughts on some more precise language.\n\nWebster's New World College Dictionary, Fifth Edition (NPR's dictionary of record) defines apprehend as to take into custody; capture or arrest. That's what I think an average listener or reader would understand when reading that, say, The number of migrants apprehended at the border last month surpassed 103,000 — the highest level in more than a decade. The capture part of the dictionary definition conjures up an element of someone trying to escape, to run away. But increasingly, that's not what's happening at the border. Nor does the 103,000-plus number actually reflect only apprehensions; it also includes what the government describes as inadmissibles (see below).\n\nAccording to NPR's reporting team covering the issue, many migrants are crossing the border somewhere other than an official entry point and then presenting themselves, often in large family groups, to border agents and requesting asylum (though the percentage of the total requesting asylum is not included in the monthly report). Is it accurate, then, to describe these people as having been apprehended, a word that also implies attempting to evade the law?\n\nBrian Lehrer, host of a talk program on WNYC, the NPR-affiliated public radio station in New York City, raised the issue last week in an interview with Washington Post immigration reporter Maria Sacchetti:\n\nLEHRER: By the way, the technical term for being taken into custody at the border is apprehended. That's what's on the official government sites. So when I did those stats and looked all the way back to 2000, that's what they call it: 'apprehensions at the border.' But is that even an accurate word for what's happening today? Aren't so many of these people coming to give themselves up so they can enter the asylum process? SACCHETTI: Well they are... they are a majority — I mean, most them ... the bulk of them are families, parents and children or aunts and children, grandmothers and children. And they, they are surrendering in large groups — some as large as 300 people. And it's ... it's such a dramatic change. I mean, there are still single people adults sneaking in on their own and trying to avoid immigration authorities. But the border now is set up so well to detect them and to deport them that they're often apprehended also very quickly.\n\nA much smaller number of migrants are presenting themselves at official points of entry and requesting asylum. Those migrants are included in the totals, but as inadmissibles. For the month of March, the figures were 92,607 apprehensions and 10,885 inadmissibles. The total is the 103,000-plus number.\n\nI'm not sure that most listeners and readers would hear apprehended and realize what a vast range of actions that encompasses. While shorthand is always tempting to journalists trying to describe the big picture and get to the meat of policy questions, more precision in this case would help NPR's audience better understand the complicated border dynamics.\n\nI like the way this Vox article referred to the broad number: as people who tried to enter the US without valid papers.\n\nAs an alternative to apprehended or apprehensions alone — at least while the current trend of asylum-seekers turning themselves in to authorities persists — I like the way the digital version of this NPR story puts it, talking about people who were apprehended or surrendered. Another good option would be to say these people had been taken into custody.\n\nLaura Smitherman, an NPR deputy national editor who has been overseeing the border coverage, suggested unauthorized border crossings. And Mark Memmott, NPR's standards and practices editor, suggested that, maybe 'detained' is often best because if you are apprehended or you surrender you're going to be detained for at least a while.\n\nMeanwhile, Memmott last week issued this guidance to the newsroom, explaining more about what the U.S. Customs and Border Protection's data encompasses, and steering staff away from referring to them as arrests:\n\nThere's an important footnote with U.S. Customs and Border Protection's data. It states that: Most of the people CBP counts in its data are listed under the heading apprehensions. Don't simply say, then, that those who have crossed the southern border and been detained have been arrested. Not everyone has been, or will be, charged with a crime. The best practice is to use apprehended or detained as the action words when reporting broadly about what is happening to people. Save arrested for those times when we drill down into the data. About that data: When reporting on the recent surge of migrants, many of whom are seeking asylum, there are two categories. As mentioned, the biggest category is migrants who are apprehended after crossing the border between official ports of entry without authorization. The second category is migrants who presented themselves at ports of entry without documentation and were deemed inadmissible. When referring to the total (the two categories added together), we should say more than 100,000 were taken into custody or detained, and we can refer to the migrants as unauthorized. Apprehensions refers to the physical control or temporary detainment of a person who is not lawfully in the U.S. which may or may not result in an arrest.\n\nBut is it a record?\n\nHogan Gidley, White House principal deputy press secretary, was a guest on Sunday's All Things Considered, where he referred to people pouring into this country in record-setting numbers — 100,000-plus just last month alone.\n\nAgain, that number he cited actually includes some people who asked to be admitted and were deemed inadmissible. As for it being a record, it is — if you go back just one decade. As NPR has reported, the 103,000-plus number reported for March was the biggest monthly total in more than a decade, and officials are expecting a much higher total this month. It's also a record number of families.\n\nBut go back to 2000 and the number looks quite different in comparison. In fiscal year 2000, more than 1.6 million people were apprehended, NPR has reported; that works out to a monthly average of more than 130,000. Want to be more confused? The number of border apprehensions (303,916) in fiscal year 2017 (ending Sept. 30, 2017) was the lowest since 1971, making the surge of recent months even more striking (another 111,601 inadmissibles were reported in fiscal 2017).\n\nDoes the current number of people seeking to cross the border represent a crisis, as the Trump administration has said? That's a word many listeners and readers have objected to as taking the administration's side on the issue. Others on the opposite side of the political spectrum also have used the word, and I certainly think it's supportable, given NPR's reporting on how immigration authorities and social service providers at the border have been overwhelmed by the number of families needing help.\n\nHow to talk about illegal immigration\n\nAs a reminder, here is NPR's language policy about the term illegal immigration, as laid out by Memmott:\n\n- The debate is still about illegal immigration and what to do about it. Illegal immigration remains an acceptable term when we're reporting about the issue. - When we're reporting about the people at the center of this story, it's still best practice to begin with action words, rather than labels. Two examples: They are in the country illegally or have entered the country illegally. - In subsequent references, we now think it's OK to mix in the phrases undocumented immigrants and unauthorized immigrants. They are now in common usage. And, unlike the label illegal immigrants, they are not phrases sometimes used to hurt others. (Our approach on this language is similar to what we've said about the debate over health care — it is best practice to first refer to the law Republicans want to replace as the Affordable Care Act. Then it's OK to say Obamacare.) - Undocumented is also OK in headlines.\n\nThe word illegal always sparks email from listeners. Under both U.S. and international law, migrants who ask for asylum at a port of entry are not committing an illegal act. As the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services website notes, You may apply for asylum regardless of your immigration status, whether you are here legally or illegally. But the act of crossing the border without papers, even if the intent is to ask for asylum, is illegal. Those are two different acts, which are often conflated.\n\nImmigration is one of those issues that has become so heated that people read and hear the same words differently. The border situation is also confusing, so the language should be as clear as possible.\n\nJuliette Rocheleau contributed to this report.
Republicans Try Again With Health Care Overhaul\n\nRepublican lawmakers are making another effort to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. We take a look at what the current proposal would do and its chances of being passed.\n\nDAVID GREENE, HOST:\n\nRepublicans are taking another shot at repealing the Affordable Care Act. The bill under consideration now would essentially deconstruct the major programs created by Obamacare and take the money involved and hand it over as block grants to states to run their own health care programs. NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson is on the line.\n\nAnd Mara, do Republicans have a chance with this one?\n\nMARA LIASSON, BYLINE: Yes, they do. They need 51 votes. And so far, Rand Paul says he's against it. Susan Collins of Maine says she has some real big problems with it. So that would mean that the Republicans can't afford to lose any more votes. John McCain, who was a no vote last time, looks like he's a gettable vote this time because his best friend in the Senate, Lindsey Graham, is one of the authors of the bill. And the governor of his home state, Arizona, is for it.\n\nBut on the other side, you have groups like AARP, the American Hospital Association and a bipartisan group of governors who sent a letter against it. That includes Alaska's governor. And Lisa Murkowski of Alaska was one of the no votes last time, so she's a crucial vote this time. And they're all against it because it essentially ends the Medicaid. It sunsets all the Obama subsidies in 2027 and gets rid of the national protections against pre-existing conditions and lifetime caps.\n\nSo the big political question for Republicans remains the same - which is worse, the backlash from people who will have their health care taken away versus the backlash from Republican voters who will be angry at them for not repealing Obamacare?\n\nGREENE: Just doesn't get any narrower than this when it comes to...\n\nLIASSON: No.\n\nGREENE: ...Trying to get...\n\nLIASSON: No.\n\nGREENE: So what about the White House? I mean, does President Trump - does he want to spend political capital on this if there's a risk of yet another defeat on this issue?\n\nLIASSON: The White House says they are all in on this. The president himself has been keeping a lower profile than he did in previous efforts. He has been making calls, but he has been at the U.N. this week. The vice president, Mike Pence, has been working very hard for this, lobbying on the Hill. And they're facing - the Republicans are facing a tremendous deadline because the reconciliation, which is the procedural vehicle that allows them to pass this with only 51 votes, turns into a pumpkin at midnight on September 30. It goes away.\n\nGREENE: Mara, there was this word that we used to use in Washington, bipartisanship, that seems to have cropped up again recently with all this talk of, you know, Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi and President Trump making these deals. Is there any chance that there's a new climate now that maybe Democrats would be willing to work with Republicans on this issue in this tight window?\n\nLIASSON: On this issue, no. They were working with Republicans. Lamar Alexander, a Republican, and Patty Murray, a Democrat, were working on a bipartisan bill to stabilize the Obamacare insurance exchanges. But this push for this bill supersedes that. And Democrats are pretty mad about it. As a matter of fact, yesterday Senator Schumer said this would shut down bipartisanship for years to come if they push this through. It's unclear what that means. Bipartisanship isn't a favor one party bestows on the other.\n\nGREENE: True.\n\nLIASSON: If Chuck Schumer can get a deal on DACA on his terms, why wouldn't he do that just because of this health care bill?\n\nGREENE: OK. NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson. Mara, thanks.\n\nLIASSON: Thank you.\n\nCopyright © 2017 NPR. All rights reserved.

The Affordable Care Act's Fate Is In Flux But 2021 Health Plan Prices Are Stable\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption PhotoAlto/Frederic Cirou/Getty Images PhotoAlto/Frederic Cirou/Getty Images\n\nFacing a pandemic, record unemployment and unknown future costs for COVID-19 treatments, health insurers selling Affordable Care Act plans to individuals reacted by lowering rates in some areas and, overall, issuing only modest premium increases for 2021.\n\nWhat's been fascinating is that carriers in general are not projecting much impact from the pandemic for their 2021 premium rates, said Sabrina Corlette, a research professor at the Center on Health Insurance Reforms at Georgetown University in Washington, D.C.\n\nAlthough final rates have yet to be analyzed in all states, those who study the market say the premium increases they have seen to date will be in the low single digits — and decreases are not uncommon.\n\nThat's good news for the more than 10 million Americans who purchase their own ACA health insurance through federal and state marketplaces. The federal market, which serves 36 states, opens for 2021 enrollment Nov. 1, with sign-up season ending Dec. 15. Some of the 14 states and the District of Columbia that operate their own markets have longer enrollment periods.\n\nThe flip side of flat or declining premiums is that some consumers who qualify for subsidies to help them purchase coverage may also see a reduction in that aid. Subsidies are determined by a mix of a consumer's income and the cost of a benchmark plan.\n\nHere are a few things to know about 2021 coverage:\n\nIt might cost about the same this year — or even less.\n\nDespite the ongoing debate about the ACA — compounded by a Supreme Court challenge brought by 20 states and supported by the Trump administration — enrollment and premium prices are not forecast to shift much.\n\nIt's the third year in a row with premiums staying pretty stable, said Louise Norris, an insurance broker in Colorado who follows rates nationwide and writes about insurance trends. We've seen modest rate changes and influx of new insurers.\n\nThat relative stability followed ups and downs, with the last big increases coming in 2018, partly in response to the Trump administration cutting some payments to insurers.\n\nThose increases priced out some enrollees, particularly people who don't qualify for subsidies, which are tied both to income and the cost of premiums. ACA enrollment has fallen since its peak in 2016.\n\nCharles Gaba, a web developer who has since late 2013 tracked enrollment data in the ACA on his ACASignups.net website, follows premium changes based on filings with state regulators. Each summer, insurers must file their proposed rates for the following year with states, which have varying oversight powers.\n\nGaba said the average requested increase next year nationwide is 2.1%. When he looked at 18 states for which regulators have approved insurers' requested rates, the percentage is lower at 0.4%.\n\nA study by KFF, of preliminary premiums filed this summer, had similar findings: Premium changes in 2021 would be modest, only a few percentage points up or down. (KHN is an editorially independent program of KFF.)\n\nIt's still worth it to shop around.\n\nActuaries and other experts say premiums vary by state or region — even by insurer — for a number of reasons, including the number and relative market power of insurers or hospitals in an area, which affects the ability of insurers to negotiate rates with providers.\n\nFor consumers who rely on subsidies to help cover premium costs, be aware: subsidies are tied to each region's benchmark plan — that's the second-lowest-priced silver plan in a region — and since those premium costs may have gone down, subsidies also could decrease.\n\nSwitching to the benchmark plan can help consumers maintain how much they spend in premiums.\n\nEnrollees should update their financial information, particularly this year when many are affected by work reduction or job losses. They might be eligible for a bigger subsidy, said Myra Simon, executive director of commercial policies for America's Health Insurance Plans, the industry lobbying group.\n\nEnrollees can update their information online or call their federal or state marketplace for assistance. Insurance brokers, too, can aid people in signing up for ACA plans. When shopping, consumers should check whether the doctors and hospitals they want to use are included in the plan's network.\n\nPremiums are just one part of the equation. Consumers should also look closely at annual deductibles, because the trade-off of going with a lower-cost premium may well be higher annual deductibles that must be met before much of the coverage kicks in.\n\nWe encourage people to consider all their options, said Simon.\n\nYour choice of insurers may have widened.\n\nMore insurers, including UnitedHealth Group, either stepped back into that individual market or expanded into new counties.\n\nInsurers are seeing a profit or potential for it, said John Dodd, an insurance broker in Columbus and past president of the Ohio Association of Health Underwriters.\n\nRates are down in general across his state for ACA plans, he said, and he expects agents to be busier than ever, simply because there are more plan offerings and choices to make and people want help.\n\nInsurers, he said, like the way the ACA is working.\n\nPeople on TV who say it's not working, they don't know what they're talking about, said Dodd. It's working well [for insurers] and every year it gets better.\n\nWhat's behind the premium changes?\n\nEnrollees in some states next year will see premium decreases, according to Gaba's website: Maine, for example, shows a 13% drop in weighted average premium prices, while Maryland's is down almost 12%. At the same time, Indiana's average is up 10%. And Kentucky is up 5%.\n\nBoth Maine and Maryland attribute the decrease to state programs that provide reinsurance payments to health insurers to help offset high-cost medical claims.\n\nIn Florida, regulators say insurance premiums will rise about 3%, while the state exchange in California is reporting just over a half-percent increase, its lowest average increase since opening in 2014. Officials in California cite factors that include an influx of healthier enrollees and a reduction in fees that insurers pay.\n\nOther factors affecting rates include how much state regulators step in to alter initial rate filings, along with a provision of the ACA that requires insurers to spend at least 80% of revenue on direct medical care. If insurers don't meet that standard, they must issue rebates to policyholders. Many insurers were already on the hook to return money in 2020 for previous years.\n\nMost insurers did not cite additional COVID treatment or testing costs as factors in their requested rate increase, Gaba said. Even those that did, however, mainly found them unnecessary because of reduced expenditures resulting from patients delaying elective care during the spring and summer.\n\nIndeed, many insurers in the second quarter posted record profits.\n\nSome of them thought, 'We're going to make more than we thought this year in profits, so let's not be aggressive with pricing next year,' said Donna Novak, a member of the American Academy of Actuaries' Individual and Small Group Markets Committee.\n\nA smaller factor may be the repeal of a fee paid by insurers on premiums. Part of the ACA, the fee was permanently eliminated by the Trump administration effective for 2021.\n\nNew marketplaces in some states, and a public option.\n\nResidents of New Jersey and Pennsylvania will buy coverage from new state-based marketplaces for 2021, after those states pulled out of the federal healthcare.gov, which now covers 36 states.\n\nLawmakers in those states said running their own marketplaces gives them more control and may save them money over time.\n\nIn 19 Washington state counties, insurers are offering public option plans, which have all the standard benefits, including lower deductibles, and must meet additional quality standards.\n\nAs envisioned, the public option plans aimed to be less expensive, with the legislation tying payment rates to Medicare. Insurers offering a public option must stick to an aggregate cap of paying doctors, hospitals and other medical providers an average of 160% of what Medicare would pay for the same services.\n\nWhen the premium rates came in, however, the five insurers offering the plans had varying prices. Not all parts of the state have the option, but where they do, two of the public option insurers have premiums that are either lower than other plans in the area or are the lowest-cost plan the insurer offers.\n\nBut three are more expensive.\n\nThe state's marketplace staff said the higher prices may reflect a number of things, from difficulty getting the program started during COVID-19, to a lack of incentives to get providers to participate.\n\nIt could also just be normal first-year jitters.\n\nIt's Year 1. As with any market entry strategy, people are pretty conservative, said Michael Marchand, chief marketing officer of the Washington Health Benefit Exchange.\n\nKHN (Kaiser Health News) is a nonprofit news service covering health issues.

Transcript: NPR's Full Interview With Joe Biden\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption KC McGinnis for NPR KC McGinnis for NPR\n\nMorning Edition host Rachel Martin interviews former Vice President Joe Biden aboard his campaign bus en route to Decorah, Iowa, about his bid for the Democratic nomination and the impeachment inquiry against President Trump.\n\nThis is the transcript of a conversation held on Dec. 6, 2019.\n\nRachel Martin: Mr. Vice President, thank you very much for having us.\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden: Well thanks for being on the bus. I appreciate it.\n\nOn the bus, very exciting. So we're in Iowa.\n\nYup.\n\nYou have been here before.\n\nBeen here a lot.\n\nYou've been here a lot. This is the third time you have campaigned in this state for president.\n\nWell for president, yeah. But I started off way back campaigning for Senator John Culver, when he was running in 1974. I've campaigned for a lot of Iowans.\n\nYou've been here. You've put in a lot of miles. You've got the most name recognition in Iowa right now in this race, or in the race writ large. You have the résumé. You've got the relevant experience, more so than any other candidate. Why aren't you running away with this thing? You're fourth in the polls in Iowa.\n\nWell, you know, you sound like you know a lot about Iowa. You know, they don't make up their minds until after Thanksgiving. They really don't even do it till after Christmas. And you still have in the Iowa polling or favorable rating is still very high — it's in the 70s.\n\nPeople think the most important issue, based on the polling data I've seen, I think from The Des Moines Register, don't hold me to it, but I think it was they said the most important thing, they want someone who can beat Trump.\n\nAnd now we're starting to happen is because I had the most name recognition of my move right to the top in all the polling data. I got all the incoming, and they say [unintelligible] from y'all. And, and now other people are as they move, beginning to look at them as well. And so things are beginning to, you know, move differently.\n\nBut nationally, it's not changed. Nationally we've been had double digits, and we're way ahead in South Carolina as well as in Nevada, and so it's, you know, it's early.\n\nWell, let me ask you: You recently got an endorsement from your friend, Senator John Kerry, former Secretary of State John Kerry. There are some within your party, in particular younger voters, who look to the former secretary of state and it's a warning for them for 2020 because they think about 2004. Because while John Kerry came from behind, while John Kerry came from behind to win Iowa, he still lost the presidential race.\n\nAnd he was, he was the stabilizing force. He was the guy with the name recognition. He was going to right the ship after George W. Bush, who was at the time fairly unpopular. That's the liberal rap on you right now — that a moderate can't beat Donald J. Trump.\n\nLook at all the polling data. Show me where the Democratic Party doesn't want somebody like me.\n\nBut I know you don't even like polls —\n\nNo, I say —\n\nYou can't trust the polls.\n\nNo, you can't. But you just. Just travel with me. Travel with me. Look what's happening. You know, you interview a lot of people on NPR. It's a great facility. No, I really mean it. It's one of the only ones where there's really genuine news, you constantly promote.\n\nBut look, it's like, you know, a moderate. What's moderate about my wanting to make sure everybody has health care? I just have a different view than other people do. And if you notice, the vast majority of people agree with my position on health care. They agree with my position on education. They agree with, and so the idea that there's something that, I am moderate.\n\nOne of the things that I wish I had that label when I was running all the times for the Senate, I was a moderate because I was always rated as one of the most liberal senators in the United States Senate for all the years I was there.\n\nBut you're not nearly as progressive on health care as other candidates in the race —\n\nBecause I'm realistic. Guess what? You're going to find $33 trillion in 10 years. And not raise tax? Look, you all are beginning to be little more honest than you have been. You're looking at now and saying, OK, those of you for Medicare for All, you're going to have to raise taxes on the middle class. You let everybody not answer that question for the longest time.\n\nI'll ask you rhetorical question, you can't answer. Do you think it's remotely possible to raise $3.5 trillion a year, more than every single penny we spend on every single thing in the federal government on a yearly basis, without raising taxes on the middle class? If you answer that question, then I'm ending the interview because you know it's not true. You gotta raise taxes.\n\nNow you're starting to ask these people the same questions you've asked me from the beginning. Tell me how you do it. Tell me how you pay off $1.7 trillion in student debt. Tell me how you provide community college for everyone, no matter what their income, for free.\n\nBut how do you get people excited to show up on Election Day —\n\nWatch.\n\nFor a return to the status quo before Donald Trump?\n\nIt's not the status quo before Donald Trump. It's a totally different world. Look, I promise you. Let's put it this way. Take me out of the equation.\n\nIf, in fact, someone is able to get past, in the United States Congress, a, a Obamacare with a public option that provides for a limitation of $1,000 deductible on, on, on any bills someone gets, makes everybody available to everybody who's on Medicaid, to be able to get involved free, reduces drug prices significantly, turns around and provides for early education, which I'm the only one that's laid it out clearly for everyone, 3-, 4- and 5-year-olds, which will fundamentally change their prospects of succeeding, gets climate change moving. What do you think they'll be talked about in five years?\n\nWhat does get climate change moving? Because there are a lot of people who want revolution on that front. It's not good enough to say it's a priority. There was a recent U.N. report that came out. I'm sure you saw it. It was devastating.\n\nSure it's devastating. But what are they saying? I have the most progressive plan out there. Anybody who tells you they can eliminate carbon in the air by the year 2030 has no notion of the science.\n\nFind me one scientist in the world. You guys, you guys know better than this.\n\nSo what do you do besides rejoin Paris and restore emissions standards?\n\nFundamentally change the way in which we approach things. For example, we're gonna make sure that we have doubling immediately the wind and solar power. We're gonna make sure, by the way; I'm the only guy who's done anything. I would, in the Recovery Act we fund $100 million, reducing the cost of making sun and, excuse me, wind and solar competitive with the price of coal. No one's going to build another coal plant in America because of the work we did in our administration. Number one.\n\nNumber two, we're gonna make sure that we continue to subsidize. When I was out here talking about wind 10 years ago, all of you were looking at me like, What? Are you kidding? What do you mean you're going to have wind out here creating hundreds of thousands — I mean — millions and billions of dollars in revenue and thousands of jobs that are good-paying jobs?\n\nSo those are things that young people would want. Why do you think there's an enthusiasm gap?\n\nThere isn't an enthusiasm gap! What the hell are you talking about?\n\nI'm talking about a lot of young people who say, Joe Biden's got a lot of experience. He's been around a long time. And that's not what we want right now.\n\nCome with me on college campuses. You don't see that. You guys keep saying that.\n\nWell, because I talked to people who say, I want someone from the outside. I met someone tonight at the town hall we were at —\n\nI'm sure you have.\n\nShe said, I want someone who can bring some outside energy because I don't think an insider can beat Donald Trump, because he is so outside the norm that the moment demands someone who is not of the establishment. What do you say to someone like that?\n\nI say the fact of the matter is that's not the case. The case is, look, the next person we elect to be president has to be able to pass something. Name me one thing all the rest of the candidates combined have passed that's got major things done. The Violence Against Women Act. The chemical weapons ban.\n\nIt was such a different time. Do you think —\n\nNo, it's not a different time!\n\nIt's not a different time? You don't think Donald Trump has fundamentally changed how the parties talk to each other and whether or not you can cooperate?\n\nNo, no, I got that. But you still can't cooperate. Look, after he was elected, I was able to get $8, almost $9, billion passed two weeks before he got sworn in in January. You all told me it's impossible. Come on, give me a break here.\n\nDonald Trump is the reason why you need someone who knows what they're doing. Donald Trump. Name me somebody who's going to be able to stand on the world stage and immediately command the respect of everyone in the world. Our enemies as well as our adversaries, as well as our allies. I know all these people. This is the only reason why I'm running this time is because of my experience.\n\nWell, Barack Obama was able to do it, and he didn't have very much experience at all.\n\nNo, that's not true. Think about it. That's not true. What happened was one of the reasons Barack Obama picked me as vice president is because he lacked the background in foreign policy — he's a brilliant guy.\n\nHe knew what he wanted to do. He knew how to get it done. But notice, every time we had a problem on Capitol Hill, who went up and got it fixed? Answer the question. Who went up and got it fixed? See you're not, you know the truth.\n\nIt's not my job to answer the question\n\nI know it's not your job to answer —\n\nI appreciate the sentiment. You brought up the ticket.\n\nThe sentiment [laughter].\n\nSo I want to ask you about the ticket and a running mate.\n\nYup.\n\nAnd so I want to ask you about that.\n\nYeah. Are you available?\n\nBecause Senator Kamala Harris is no longer in the race. And that leaves the debate stage for the next debate in the Democratic primary looking very white, all the, all the people onstage will be white candidates. And that is just not, as you know, that's not representative of the party. If you are the nominee, can you commit to selecting a person of color to be on the ticket?\n\nI have not a little tiny bit of a problem picking a person of color or a woman.\n\nCan you commit to that?\n\nNo, I can't commit to that.\n\nHow come?\n\nBecause here's what I know about vice presidents — you have to have someone who works with you, who believes exactly like you do on the strategic notions that you support.\n\nThe reason why the historians are writing about Barack Obama and I having the closest relations of everybody is we trusted each other completely. He was able to give me entire chunks of responsibility where I didn't have to report back because he knew I knew what he was thinking.\n\nAnd you can't know right now that person would be a person of color?\n\nYou can't know that. But there's plenty of people of color. There's plenty of women who are not, who haven't run. You got senators. I can think of four women senators off the bat that would be great vice presidents. I can think of some, I can think of several women who are, in fact, lost races recently who are completely capable of being vice president of the United States.\n\nStacey Abrams?\n\nAnd look, I'm in a situation where, look at my staff. I have the most diverse staff of anybody running. I've always done that. This is who I, the country has to look like, the administration should look like the American public.\n\nI want to switch gears and ask you —\n\nSure you do. [Laughter]\n\nAbout what happened the other day at your town hall. Because you've got a lot of, you got a lot of attention for it. A man stood up and started throwing false allegations your way about your son, Hunter Biden, and his work in Ukraine and your work as vice president then in Ukraine. And you responded by calling him a damn liar.\n\nBecause he lied.\n\nAnd then you challenged him to pushups.\n\nI was joking with him because he —\n\nAnd then you asked him for an IQ test.\n\nHe came along. What was he saying? He said he's entitled to do this. He said, You're too old. He said, You're too old. I can't vote for somebody as old as you. I said OK. And he was challenging me what kind of shape, and so I kidded. I said, Want to do a pushup contest? I was joking. Look, I'm in pretty good shape.\n\nWhich is what Donald Trump says a lot: Hey, you can't take a joke. I was joking.\n\nNo, no, no, no, no —\n\nBut the point —\n\nDon't compare me to Donald Trump.\n\nBut people did. At the town hall I was just at.\n\nNo, they didn't.\n\nYes, they did. They said to me, the woman you met at the end, 94-year-old Mary, said to me, I was so disappointed in him. This is a direct quote: That is not the Joe I know. He sounded like Donald Trump in that clip.\n\nWell, look. What Donald Trump says, he makes fun of people. He belittles people. He lies. I don't do any of those things. Period. The fact of the matter is this guy stood up, and he was in fact lying. And I just pointed out, You're a liar. It's a fact: He lied. Period. And so, you know, maybe I shouldn't have kidded with him about that — No, let's do pushups. It's like I was out here in a parade, a Fourth of July parade.\n\nBut I think people's point was, in this time when you talk about needing to restore civility, it's so important to so many people.\n\nThat's not civil? To call someone who lied a liar?\n\nTo call someone a damn liar? A voter? This isn't Trump, President Trump.\n\nBut he's lying! He's lying. You acknowledge what he said wasn't even true. None of the mainstream media believes any of that was true.\n\nI think it was the tone. I think it was the tone that was off-putting to people.\n\nMy mother would say, God love you, dear.\n\nI have to ask you about what's happening right now. President Trump is in the process of being impeached. The Senate trial is pending. Republicans have suggested that they might call you or your son, Hunter Biden. If you are subpoenaed, would you comply?\n\nNo. I'm not going to let you take the eye off the ball here. Everybody knows what this is about. This is a Trump gambit he plays. Whenever he's in trouble, he tries to find someone else to divert attention to.\n\nBut this is a real thing that's happening. Republicans are suggesting that they would subpoena you and President Trump — these issues will be parsed out in the Senate trial.\n\nThat's right.\n\nBut the question is, would you comply with the subpoena?\n\nNo, I will not yield to what everybody is looking for here. And that is to take the eye off the ball. Everybody knows the issue here is not what I did, because no one has a proved one scintilla of evidence that I did anything other than do my job for America as well as anybody could have done it. Making sure that we, in fact, got rid of a corrupt prosecutor who everybody, including our allies and including our allies as well as, as, as the IMF and everyone else said has to go. I did my job incredibly well.\n\nAnd even the people in his administration have testified to my character, testified to my honesty. So why would I —\n\nYou know it didn't look good for Hunter Biden to be on that board, even if he did nothing wrong. The optics weren't good. And you talk a lot about what it means to be a Biden and the integrity that is imbued in that family name. But there were former White House aides of yours who tried to warn you about the potential conflicts of interest.\n\nNobody warned me about a potential conflict of interest. Nobody warned me about that. And at the same time —\n\nGeorge Kent, the State Department official, testified that he raised it to you, and your staff.\n\nNo, he didn't say me. He did not say me.\n\nTo your staff. To your staff, I stand corrected.\n\nI never, never heard that once at all.\n\nTo your staff. And your staff told him he has no bandwidth for family matters.\n\nWell, my son was dying, so I guess that's why he said it, because my son was on his deathbed. But that, that's not the reason why — they should have told me.\n\nAnd the fact of the matter is, my son testified and did an interview saying if he, looking back on it, made a mistake, he made a mistake although he did nothing wrong. The appearance looked bad and it gave folks like Rudy Giuliani an excuse to come up with a Trumpian kind of defense, why they were violating the Constitution. His, his words speak for themselves.\n\nI know that you sat down with your family before you decided to run for president this time, because I talked with your wife about it and you had a big conversation about the emotional toll that this takes every single time, but especially this time. This is your third time running for president. Why do you want this so bad?\n\nLook, number one, I'm not sure I'd be running if Trump wasn't the president. I think the country is in such danger. I think our democracy is in danger. And it wasn't about how tough it's going to be — it was about how dirty it would be. My, we have a tradition in our family. You can call for a family meeting, not a joke. Anyone can and is taken seriously.\n\nAnd I got a call from my oldest granddaughter, named after my deceased daughter. She's in law school in New York. And she said, Pop, we want a family meeting. And I said, Who?\n\nThe kids. And with you and Nana. And they came and we had a family meeting and they said, Pop, you know, daddy would want you to run, and dad wants you to run, the two, two fathers.\n\nAnd my little one, Hunter Biden, named after his uncle, but my Beau, my deceased son's child, took out his cell phone and showed me a picture of me walking out of the church, my hand on a flag-draped coffin with my son, reaching down and pulling my little grandson under his chin and whispering to him, and the caption said, Biden molests another child. He said, I know this is going to be ugly, Pop. I know it. But you gotta run, pop. You've got to run.\n\nEach of my, each of my grandchildren gave examples of what they knew was going to happen. But they said, Pop, you gotta run. You gotta run. Daddy would want you to run.\n\nAnd the reason I'm running is because this man, the future of my grandchildren, if he's reelected, are gonna be marginalized in ways that I don't think anybody fully understands.\n\nHe's different than any other president. We are, we're in a battle for the soul of this country, for real, for real. And everything he's done, has done to demean people, to make fun of people, making fun of a reporter who has a physical ailment, making fun of people, talking about people in terms of, the day he announced, coming down an elevator saying, I'm doing this because we're going to get rid of those rapist Mexicans, and we're being invaded by. Have you heard him speak out once against white supremacy?\n\nThis is absolutely a guy who is damaging us around the world. And the issues that need to be dealt with now are issues that have been in my wheelhouse my whole life. How can I walk away? I'm not joking. I'm not saying I'm a savior. But they're the issues that were in my wheelhouse my whole life.\n\nLook. Every morning I get up, I ask myself, Is Beau proud of me? Am I doing? I wrote a whole book about my son, because he was so remarkable, and the title of the book is Promise Me, Dad. And it comes from an exchange we had when he knew he was dying, he knew he had months left to go. We sat at his kitchen table. We'd go home every weekend to be with him. And he said, Dad. He asked his wife to put the kids to bed, the little kids, my two grandchildren.\n\nHe said, Dad, I know no one loves me in the whole world more than you do. But, Dad, I'm going to be OK no matter what happens. But promise me, Dad, promise me, Dad, you're gonna be OK.\n\nI said, I'm gonna be fine, honey.\n\nHe said, No, Dad. Promise me. Give me your word as a Biden. You're gonna be OK.\n\nI knew what he meant.\n\nHe meant he was worried that I would do what my inclination was, to walk away. Not about running for president, just walk away from things I've devoted my whole life to since I've been 24 years old. Walk away. And, and I said anyway. And so this is about, this is about, you know my dad used to have an expression. He'd say it's a lucky a person gets up in the morning, puts both feet on the floor, knows what they're about to do and thinks it still matters. It really matters. It really matters.\n\nI get up in the morning and I know what I'm doing matters, and it gives me purpose. It gives me purpose. And I tell ya, there's such enormous opportunity that exists for the country. But you have to have some authenticity. Those same young people looking for authenticity.\n\nYou're going to stand up and say, I'm gonna spend $34 billion, and no one's taxes are going to go up? You're going to stand up and say, You have to be honest with people. You have to be authentic. I may be wrong about a lot of things. That's worthy debate, to have a debate about. But I really think it's important.\n\nAnd look, I've gotten more. I know all of these world leaders, even the ones that we don't like very much, like Putin. I know him. He knows I know who he is, and he knows who I am. There's no misunderstanding about who we are. And it's really important.\n\nThink about this. If we don't figure out how to bring the world together again, reassure our allies, making sure that our, that those who are opponents know we understand what they're about and we're gonna do something about it. Where do we go? What happens in five years if this, if the president's reelected? You think there'll be a NATO? Do you think there will be national security arrangements we have with European countries? What do you think? I don't think it's possible. I think they'll be gone.\n\nYou saw, have you ever seen a time when you have a president of the United States and a group of world leaders who are our allies, making fun of the president? It's not just a national shame — it goes to, right to our security.\n\nAnd so I, look, I could die a happy man never having lived in the White House and never having heard Hail to the Chief. But as Barack would say to me, basically on which you're gonna make up your mind, I got to know when I walked away, looking in the mirror, that I walked away not because it was going to be hard, not because I didn't think I could do it, but I walked away because I didn't think it was necessary — someone else would be able to do it. We have great candidates running. They really are.\n\nBut you don't think they can do it.\n\nI don't know what the experience is to let you know, to let people know that we can get this done.\n\nThere's going to be no time for on-the-job training. I mean really and truly, no time from the day we take office, because this president's put us in such a deep, deep, deep hole.\n\nSo, I mean, they're, they're bright. They're honorable people. But again, all the things we're talking about, none of it matters, even if you defeat Trump, unless you can pass it. You hear them, you hear anyone else talking about, until recently, unifying the country? Every time I'd be onstage talk about unifying the country, they'd make fun of me. That was the old days. That's the way it was then. I'm going to by executive order. Executive orders are abuse of power when you don't have the constitutional authority to exercise it.\n\nThe fact of the matter is we better figure out how to get this done. And I'm confident. Look, one of the things I learned a long time ago, if you don't question a woman or a man's motive, but just question their judgment, you can still find room to reach compromise. You could still find room. And one of the things that, that I've always been taught is that you have to let people know you understand what their limitations are, what you can't ask them to do that are beyond their capacity to do and work out things from that vantage point.\n\nThat's why, you know, I think I was able to get the republic for the first time in God knows how long to raise taxes by $600 billion when we're going to shut down the government in a deal we made.\n\nThe generic point I'm trying to make is that I think that I don't, have you found many Republican senators or Republican congressmen who say that I've not been honest and level with them and that they can't work with me? And yet, look at my record. I've gotten a lot of really progressive things done. Now that doesn't mean no one else can do it.\n\nBut the reason I'm running is I think so much is at stake that these are the things that have been in my wheelhouse. What I've done my whole life. Every election requires a different set of, I think, assets for a president.\n\nWhat people were looking for when Barack came along and he's brilliant, brilliant, looking about reestablishing a sense of hope and optimism. And he inherited a God awful circumstance where everything had collapsed.\n\nBut so what is it now?\n\nWhat it is now, is they're looking for somebody who can actually bring the world back together and get us off this precipice. They're looking for someone who can actually get things passed.\n\nWhat good does it do if we cannot reach a consensus on issues relating to health care, education, climate change, dealing with guns and assault weapons? I've done those things. Why do you think the president of the United States is spending $12 million running negative ads against somebody 60 days before, 90 days before, the start of before the first caucus and the Democratic Party? He knows. And he knows I'm coming.\n\nMr. Vice President, thank you very much for your time.\n\nThank you. Appreciate it.
Trump Blasts Obamacare At His Miami Golf Course But Misstates Employees' Coverage\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Evan Vucci/AP Evan Vucci/AP\n\nRepublican presidential hopeful Donald Trump seized on rising health insurance premiums Tuesday as evidence that Obamacare is just blowing up.\n\nBut the general manager of a Trump golf course in Florida corrected his boss for suggesting that Trump's own employees would be personally affected.\n\nAll of my employees are having a tremendous problem with Obamacare, Trump told reporters during an appearance at the National Doral Golf Club in Miami. What they're going through with their health care is horrible because of Obamacare.\n\nIn fact, the club's general manager David Feder said more than 95 percent of the club's employees receive health insurance through the company, so they're not affected by the sharp premium increases on government-run exchanges.\n\nThe Obama administration announced this week that premiums for 2017 on those exchanges will increase by an average of 22 percent nationwide.\n\nTrump called that number an understatement.\n\nThat is such a phony number, Trump said. You're talking about 60, 70, 80 percent in increases.\n\nCustomers in some states will see increases in that range, but the premiums vary widely from state to state. The benchmark plan in Arizona will cost 116 percent more next year. Premiums in Indiana and Massachusetts are actually going down by about 3 percent.\n\nThe average increase of 22 percent nationwide follows much smaller increases of 7.5 percent this year and 2 percent in 2015. When Obamacare began, many insurance companies priced their policies too low and ended up losing money. Today's premiums are roughly in line with what government forecasters initially predicted.\n\nThe administration notes that most people who buy insurance on the government-run exchanges receive subsidies, which could offset some or all of the price increase.\n\nBut Trump, like other critics of the Affordable Care Act, is not impressed.\n\nObamacare has to be repealed and replaced, Trump told reporters. Otherwise, this country is in even bigger trouble than anybody thought.\n\nTrump's health care plan calls for an expansion of Health Savings Accounts, which allow consumers to buy insurance with pre-tax dollars. He would also allow insurance companies to market their policies across state lines.\n\nThat would not necessarily help many of the 20 million people who gained health care coverage under the Affordable Care Act, pushing the nation's uninsured rate to an all-time low.
Trump To McConnell: 'Get Back To Work' On Health Care\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Pool/Getty Images Pool/Getty Images\n\nUpdated on Aug. 10 at 4 p.m. ET\n\nPresident Trump is continuing to voice his frustration with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, tweeting on Thursday that the Kentucky Republican should get back to work after last month's failure to pass a health care alternative to the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe president's latest tweets calling out the Kentucky Republican came as Trump himself is taking a working vacation at his own golf resort in New Jersey.\n\nAnd pressed by reporters after a meeting with Vice President Pence later on Thursday as to whether McConnell should step aside as GOP leader, as some conservative commentators have argued, Trump wouldn't give a clear yes or no.\n\nIf he doesn't get repeal and replace done, and he doesn't get taxes done — meaning cuts and reform — and if he doesn't get a very easy one to get done, infrastructure, if he doesn't get them done, then you can ask me that question, Trump said.\n\nYouTube\n\nI just want [McConnell] to get repeal and replace done. ... And all I hear is 'repeal and replace,' and then I get there and I said, 'Where is the bill? I want to sign it, first day.' And they don't have it, Trump said, signaling he was ready to move on to other key agenda items.\n\nThey should have had this last one done. They lost by one vote, the president continued, talking about the Senate's failure last month to move forward on efforts to repeal Obamacare. The White House has confirmed that Trump and McConnell did speak this week and talked about health care.\n\nBut on Thursday, Trump doubled down on the Senate's narrow failure, saying that, For a thing like that to happen is a disgrace. And frankly it shouldn't have happened. That I can tell you. It shouldn't have happened.\n\nTrump's heightened criticism on Thursday toward McConnell — with whom he has had a sometimes strained relationship — came after McConnell first threw down the gauntlet earlier in the week over the GOP's health care collapse. Speaking back home in Kentucky, the Senate veteran argued it was Trump's political inexperience that had led him to set excessive expectations over wanting to speedily repeal Obamacare.\n\nPart of the reason I think that the storyline is that we haven't done much is because, in part, the president and others have set these early timelines about things need[ing] to be done by a certain point, McConnell said on Monday, according to ABC News.\n\nOur new president, of course, has not been in this line of work before. And I think he had excessive expectations about how quickly things happen in the democratic process, the Senate majority leader continued. So part of the reason I think people feel we're underperforming is because too many artificial deadlines — unrelated to the reality of the complexity of legislating — may not have been fully understood.\n\nUnsurprisingly, that explanation didn't sit well with the commander in chief. On Wednesday, Trump fired his first missive at McConnell, asking, After 7 years of hearing Repeal & Replace, why not done?\n\nDan Scavino, Trump's social media director, had shared similar sentiments earlier from his personal account.\n\nAnd Fox News Channel host Sean Hannity, a fervent Trump backer, called McConnell weak and spineless.\n\nNot only is it highly unusual for a sitting president and his allies to attack a Senate leader of his own party, but Trump himself did very little to rally any support for the GOP's health care alternative, which was rushed out and voted on in the middle of the night — a process that drew condemnation from members who even voted for it.\n\nMcConnell's office hasn't responded to Trump's latest criticisms this week, but Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, offered up his support for the majority leader.\n\nStill, the escalating tension doesn't bode well for the rest of the Republican legislative agenda in the Senate when Congress returns to Washington, D.C., next month. Lawmakers face a daunting list that includes a tax overhaul, raising the debt ceiling and more.\n\nAnother thing making the Trump-McConnell spat complicated and even more surprising — McConnell's wife, Elaine Chao, is the president's secretary of transportation.\n\nBut it wasn't just the White House that was, at least initially, pressing for an ambitious legislative agenda.\n\nThe two biggest issues we're moving forward with in the first half of the year obviously are repeal and replacing Obamacare and tax reform, McConnell said back in January at the GOP congressional retreat.\n\nThe latest jab from the president toward the majority leader comes just after Trump gave McConnell a political win on Tuesday night, when the president threw his support behind Sen. Luther Strange, R-Ala., ahead of a primary next week in a special election race.\n\nStrange, who was appointed to fill now-Attorney General Jeff Sessions' seat, has the backing of McConnell, the majority leader's superPAC and the National Republican Senatorial Committee.\n\nThe endorsement was a blow to Rep. Mo Brooks, who is fighting to earn a spot in a runoff as a result of Tuesday's voting — with both Brooks and Strange likely to finish behind Roy Moore, a controversial former Alabama Supreme Court justice best known for refusing to remove a Ten Commandments memorial from a state judicial building. Brooks was critical of Trump last year during the presidential campaign, pointing to his serial adultery, and more recently, the congressman slammed the president for his public waterboarding of Sessions on Twitter.\n\nOn Wednesday, though, as Trump's feud with McConnell was escalating, Brooks tried to seize an opening, urging the president to reconsider his endorsement since Brooks wants to oust McConnell from the GOP leadership.
Immigration Was A Hot Button Issue. Now What?\n\nImmigration was a big issue in the presidential race. Now that Donald Trump has been elected, will he carry through with promises? And, financial markets began the day lower on news Trump would win.\n\nRENEE MONTAGNE, HOST:\n\nLast night, as the election results poured in, NPR's Sarah McCammon was at Donald Trump's victory party, talking to the supporters about the impact of the Republican nominee's victory. Trump supporter Robin Hall (ph) said she expected Trump would work for the many voters who opposed him.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)\n\nROBIN HALL: I do think that all the minorities have been disenfranchised in the past. I think that they really have been. Every four years, they come around, they tell them - but nothing ever gets done for them. So I really feel like he - he will listen, and he will turn this country around and really look at their best interests.\n\nMONTAGNE: Trump's stand on immigration is one of the areas that was a point of concern for many minority voters. And for a closer look at what a Trump immigration policy could look like, we're joined now by NPR's John Burnett in San Antonio. And, John, Trump's two signature issues are the wall and deporting 11 million undocumented aliens, as he would call them. What can you expect?\n\nJOHN BURNETT, BYLINE: Well, that is the question. I mean, this was one of the big, emotional issues that Trump hit with his crowd again and again. Could we expect an earthquake in immigration policy? Certainly - changing from eight years under Barack Obama and even under the prior eight years under George W. Bush. I'm sure the immigration hawks are delirious this morning.\n\nTrump had some of the harshest immigration proposals, really, in modern politics. Speaking of the wall, you know, he had actually started to step back in the last two months on this, saying - you know, not talking as much about, you know, seriously continuously building a wall above ground, but saying, you know, where it was appropriate. You know, does he really think he can get Mexico to pay for this after the country has explicitly said, you know, we're not going to do it?\n\nMONTAGNE: Right.\n\nBURNETT: Deporting 11 million - I'm sure that there - unauthorized immigrants all over the country are just terrified this morning. He had - Trump has bragged about his deportation force, that he wants to to round up all of the unauthorized immigrants. And, of course, that would even require more reliance on private prisons, which the federal government thinks it might be stepping away from.\n\nMONTAGNE: Well, we just have another second or two, but do you think a Congress that's Republican will help with all of this with Donald Trump?\n\nBURNETT: Well, of course they will because now he has a unified government. And so they have said there cannot be comprehensive immigration reform without more border security. So now the issue is, what is that going to look like? Is he going to double the border - border patrol force? I mean, the implications are just profound in this area.\n\nMONTAGNE: John, thanks very much. That's NPR's John Burnett in San Antonio. And with us in our studio this morning is NPR's economics correspondent John Ydstie, keeping an eye on the markets and how they've been reacting.\n\nJOHN YDSTIE, BYLINE: Well, there's a dramatic reaction in Japan, a little less reaction in China and a little less in Europe. Now, it looks like the U.S. markets will open down about 2.5 percent. The markets are just concerned about what Donald Trump's economic policies might be. You can imagine managed healthcare companies could be hurt if they repeal Obamacare. Clean energy companies could be hurt if he backs out of the Paris climate deal. On the other hand, he's talked a lot about infrastructure building, and that could be good for the economy and growth.\n\nMONTAGNE: That's NPR's John Ydstie. Thanks very much.\n\nCopyright © 2016 NPR. All rights reserved.

Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Champion Of Gender Equality, Dies At 87\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Shuran Huang/NPR Shuran Huang/NPR\n\nFollow NPR's coverage of Ginsburg's death and the political aftermath here.\n\nJustice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the demure firebrand who in her 80s became a legal, cultural and feminist icon, died Friday. The Supreme Court announced her death, saying the cause was complications from metastatic cancer of the pancreas.\n\nThe court, in a statement, said Ginsburg died at her home in Washington, D.C., surrounded by family. She was 87.\n\nOur nation has lost a justice of historic stature, Chief Justice John Roberts said. We at the Supreme Court have lost a cherished colleague. Today we mourn but with confidence that future generations will remember Ruth Bader Ginsburg as we knew her, a tireless and resolute champion of justice.\n\nArchitect of the legal fight for women's rights in the 1970s, Ginsburg subsequently served 27 years on the nation's highest court, becoming its most prominent member. Her death will inevitably set in motion what promises to be a nasty and tumultuous political battle over who will succeed her, and it thrusts the Supreme Court vacancy into the spotlight of the presidential campaign.\n\nJust days before her death, as her strength waned, Ginsburg dictated this statement to her granddaughter Clara Spera: My most fervent wish is that I will not be replaced until a new president is installed.\n\nShe knew what was to come. Ginsburg's death will have profound consequences for the court and the country. Inside the court, not only is the leader of the liberal wing gone, but with the court about to open a new term, the chief justice no longer holds the controlling vote in closely contested cases.\n\nThough Roberts has a consistently conservative record in most cases, he has split from fellow conservatives in a few important ones this year, casting his vote with liberals, for instance, to protect at least temporarily the so-called DREAMers from deportation by the Trump administration, to uphold a major abortion precedent and to uphold bans on large church gatherings during the coronavirus pandemic. But with Ginsburg gone, there is no clear court majority for those outcomes.\n\nNPR YouTube\n\nUpcoming political battle\n\nIndeed, a week after the upcoming presidential election, the court is for the third time scheduled to hear a challenge brought by Republicans to the Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare. In 2012, the high court upheld the law in a 5-4 ruling, with Roberts casting the deciding vote and writing the opinion for the majority. But this time the outcome may well be different.\n\nThat's because Ginsburg's death gives Republicans the chance to tighten their grip on the court with another appointment by President Trump so conservatives would have 6-3 majority. And that would mean that even a defection on the right would leave conservatives with enough votes to prevail in the Obamacare case and many others.\n\nAt the center of the battle to achieve that will be Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. In 2016, he took a step unprecedented in modern times: He refused for nearly a year to allow any consideration of President Barack Obama's Supreme Court nominee.\n\nBack then, McConnell's justification was the upcoming presidential election, which he said would allow voters a chance to weigh in on what kind of justice they wanted. But now, with the tables turned, McConnell has made clear he will not follow the same course. Instead he will try immediately to push through a Trump nominee so as to ensure a conservative justice to fill Ginsburg's liberal shoes, even if Trump were to lose his reelection bid. Asked what he would do in circumstances such as these, McConnell said: Oh, we'd fill it.\n\nSo what happens in the coming weeks will be bare-knuckle politics, writ large, on the stage of a presidential election. It will be a fight Ginsburg had hoped to avoid, telling Justice John Paul Stevens shortly before his death that she hoped to serve as long as he did — until age 90.\n\nMy dream is that I will stay on the court as long as he did, she said in an interview in 2019.\n\nTough as nails\n\nHide caption Ruth Bader Ginsburg in a 1977 portrait.

For more than a decade, until her first judicial appointment in 1980, she led the fight in the courts for gender equality. When she began her legal crusade, women were treated, by law, differently from men. Hundreds of state and federal laws restricted what women could do, barring them from jobs, rights and even from jury service. By the time she donned judicial robes, however, Ginsburg had worked a revolution.\n\nThat was never more evident than in 1996 when, as a relatively new Supreme Court justice, Ginsburg wrote the court's 7-1 opinion declaring that the Virginia Military Institute could no longer remain an all-male institution. True, Ginsburg said, most women — indeed most men — would not want to meet the rigorous demands of VMI. But the state, she said, could not exclude women who could meet those demands.\n\nReliance on overbroad generalizations ... estimates about the way most men or most women are, will not suffice to deny opportunity to women whose talent and capacity place them outside the average description, Ginsburg wrote.\n\nShe was an unlikely pioneer, a diminutive and shy woman, whose soft voice and large glasses hid an intellect and attitude that, as one colleague put it, was tough as nails.\n\nBy the time she was in her 80s, she had become something of a rock star to women of all ages. She was the subject of a hit documentary, a biopic, an operetta, merchandise galore featuring her Notorious RBG moniker, a Time magazine cover and regular Saturday Night Live sketches.\n\nOn one occasion in 2016, Ginsburg got herself into trouble and later publicly apologized for disparaging remarks she made about then-presidential candidate Trump.\n\nBut for the most part Ginsburg enjoyed her fame and maintained a sense of humor about herself.\n\nAsked about the fact that she had apparently fallen asleep during the 2015 State of the Union address, Ginsburg did not take the Fifth, admitting that although she had vowed not to drink at dinner with the other justices before the speech, the wine had just been too good to resist. The result, she said, was that she was perhaps not an entirely sober judge and kept nodding off.\n\nThe road to law\n\nBorn in Brooklyn, Ruth Bader went to public schools, where she excelled as a student — and as a baton twirler. By all accounts, it was her mother who was the driving force in her young life, but Celia Bader died of cancer the day before the future justice would graduate from high school.\n\nThen 17, Ruth Bader went on to Cornell University on a full scholarship, where she met Martin (aka Marty) Ginsburg. What made Marty so overwhelmingly attractive to me was that he cared that I had a brain, she said.\n\nAfter her graduation, they were married and went off to Fort Sill, Okla., for his military service. There Mrs. Ginsburg, despite scoring high on the civil service exam, could only get a job as a typist, and when she became pregnant, she lost even that job.\n\nTwo years later, the couple returned to the East Coast to attend Harvard Law School. She was one of only nine women in a class of more than 500 and found the dean asking her why she was taking up a place that should go to a man.\n\nAt Harvard, she was the academic star, not her husband. The couple were busy juggling schedules and their toddler when Marty Ginsburg was diagnosed with testicular cancer. Surgeries and aggressive radiation followed.\n\nSo that left Ruth with a 3-year-old child, a fairly sick husband, the law review, classes to attend and feeding me, Marty Ginsburg said in a 1993 interview with NPR.\n\nThe experience also taught the future justice that sleep was a luxury. During the year of her husband's illness, he was only able to eat late at night; after that he would dictate his senior class paper to her. At about 2 a.m., he would go back to sleep, Ruth Bader Ginsburg recalled in an NPR interview. Then I'd take out the books and start reading what I needed to be prepared for classes the next day.\n\nMarty Ginsburg survived, graduated and got a job in New York; his wife, a year behind him in school, transferred to Columbia, where she graduated at the top of her law school class. Despite her academic achievements, the doors to law firms were closed to women, and though recommended for a Supreme Court clerkship, she wasn't even interviewed.\n\nIt was bad enough that she was a woman, she recalled later, but she was also a mother, and male judges worried she would be diverted by her familial obligations.\n\nA mentor, law professor Gerald Gunther, finally got her a clerkship in New York by promising Judge Edmund Palmieri that if she couldn't do the work, he would provide someone who could. That was the carrot, Ginsburg would say later. The stick was that Gunther, who regularly fed his best students to Palmieri, told the judge that if he didn't take Ginsburg, Gunther would never send him a clerk again. The Ginsburg clerkship apparently was a success; Palmieri kept her not for the usual one year, but two, from 1959-61.\n\nGinsburg's next path is rarely talked about, mainly because it doesn't fit the narrative. She learned Swedish so she could work with Anders Bruzelius, a Swedish civil procedure scholar. Through the Columbia University School of Law Project on International Procedure, Ginsburg and Bruzelius co-authored a book.\n\nIn 1963, Ginsburg finally landed a teaching job at Rutgers Law School, where she at one point hid her second pregnancy by wearing her mother-in-law's clothes. The ruse worked; her contract was renewed before her baby was born.\n\nWhile at Rutgers, she began her work fighting gender discrimination.\n\nThe mother brief\n\nHer first big case was a challenge to a law that barred a Colorado man named Charles Moritz from taking a tax deduction for the care of his 89-year-old mother. The IRS said the deduction, by statute, could only be claimed by women, or widowed or divorced men. But Moritz had never married.\n\nThe tax court concluded that the Internal Revenue Code was immune to constitutional challenge, a notion that tax lawyer Marty Ginsburg viewed as preposterous. The two Ginsburgs took on the case — he from the tax perspective, she from the constitutional one.\n\nAccording to Marty Ginsburg, for his wife, this was the mother brief. She had to think through all the issues and how to fix the inequity. The solution was to ask the court not to invalidate the statute but to apply it equally to both sexes. She won in the lower courts.\n\nAmazingly, he recalled in a 1993 NPR interview, the government petitioned the U.S. Supreme Court, stating that the decision cast a cloud of unconstitutionality over literally hundreds of federal statutes, and it attached a list of those statutes, which it compiled with Defense Department computers.\n\nThose laws, Marty Ginsburg added, were the statutes that my wife then litigated ... to overturn over the next decade.\n\nIn 1971, she would write her first Supreme Court brief in the case of Reed v. Reed. Ruth Bader Ginsburg represented Sally Reed, who thought she should be the executor of her son's estate instead of her ex-husband.\n\nThe constitutional issue was whether a state could automatically prefer men over women as executors of estates. The answer from the all-male Supreme Court: no.\n\nIt was the first time the court had struck down a state law because it discriminated based on gender.\n\nAnd that was just the beginning.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Manuel Balce Ceneta/AP Manuel Balce Ceneta/AP\n\nBy then Ginsburg was earning quite a reputation. She would become the first female tenured professor at Columbia Law School, and she would found the Women's Rights Project at the American Civil Liberties Union.\n\nAs the chief architect of the battle for women's legal rights, Ginsburg devised a strategy that was characteristically cautious, precise and single-mindedly aimed at one goal: winning.\n\nKnowing that she had to persuade male, establishment-oriented judges, she often picked male plaintiffs, and she liked Social Security cases because they illustrated how discrimination against women can harm men. For example, in Weinberger v. Wiesenfeld, she represented a man whose wife, the principal breadwinner, died in childbirth. The husband sought survivor's benefits to care for his child, but under the then-existing Social Security law, only widows, not widowers, were entitled to such benefits.\n\nThis absolute exclusion, based on gender per se, operates to the disadvantage of female workers, their surviving spouses, and their children, Ginsburg told the justices at oral argument. The Supreme Court would ultimately agree, as it did in five of the six cases she argued.\n\nOver the years, Ginsburg would file dozens of briefs seeking to persuade the courts that the 14th Amendment guarantee of equal protection applies not just to racial and ethnic minorities but to women as well.\n\nIn an interview with NPR, she explained the legal theory that she eventually sold to the Supreme Court.\n\nThe words of the 14th Amendment's equal protection clause — 'nor shall any state deny to any person the equal protection of the laws.' Well that word, 'any person,' covers women as well as men. And the Supreme Court woke up to that reality in 1971, Ginsburg said.\n\nDuring these pioneering years, Ginsburg would often work through the night as she had during law school. But by this time, she had two children, and she later liked to tell a story about the lesson she learned when her son, in grade school, seemed to have a proclivity for getting into trouble.\n\nThe scrapes were hardly major, and Ginsburg grew exasperated by demands from school administrators that she come in to discuss her son's alleged misbehavior. Finally, there came a day when she had had enough. I had stayed up all night the night before, and I said to the principal, 'This child has two parents. Please alternate calls.' \n\nAfter that, she found, the calls were few and far between. It seemed, she said, that most infractions were not worth calling a busy husband about.\n\nThe Supreme Court's second woman\n\nIn 1980, President Jimmy Carter named Ginsburg to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. Over the next 13 years, she would amass a record as something of a centrist liberal, and in 1993, President Bill Clinton nominated her to the Supreme Court, the second woman appointed to the position.\n\nShe was not first on his list. For months, Clinton flirted with other potential nominees, and some women's rights activists withheld their active support because they were worried about Ginsburg's views on abortion. She had been publicly critical of the legal reasoning in Roe v. Wade.\n\nBut in the background, Marty Ginsburg was lobbying hard for his wife. And finally Ruth Ginsburg was invited for a meeting with the president. As one White House official put it afterward, Clinton fell for her — hook, line and sinker. So did the Senate. She was confirmed by a 96-3 vote.\n\nOnce on the court, Ginsburg was an example of a woman who defied stereotypes. Though she looked tiny and frail, she rode horses well into her 70s and even went parasailing. At home, it was her husband who was the chef, indeed a master chef, while the justice cheerfully acknowledged she was an awful cook.\n\nThough a liberal, she and the court's conservative icon, Antonin Scalia, who died in 2016, were the closest of friends. Indeed, an opera called Scalia/Ginsburg is based on their legal disagreements, and their affection for each other.\n\ntoggle caption Susan Walsh/AP\n\nOver the years, as Ginsburg's place on the court grew in seniority, so did her role. In 2006, as the court veered right after the retirement of Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, Ginsburg dissented more often and more assertively, her most passionate dissents coming in women's rights cases.\n\nDissenting in Ledbetter v. Goodyear in 2007, she called on Congress to pass legislation that would override a court decision that drastically limited back pay available for victims of employment discrimination. The resulting legislation was the first bill passed in 2009 after Obama took office.\n\nIn 2014, she dissented fiercely in Burwell v. Hobby Lobby, a decision that allowed some for-profit companies to refuse, on religious grounds, to comply with a federal mandate to cover birth control in health care plans. Such an exemption, she said, would deny legions of women who do not hold their employers' beliefs, access to contraceptive coverage.\n\nWhere, she asked, is the stopping point? Suppose it offends an employer's religious belief to pay the minimum wage or to accord women equal pay?\n\nAnd in 2013, when the court struck down a key provision of the Voting Rights Act, contending that times had changed and the law was no longer needed, Ginsburg dissented. She said that throwing out the provision when it has worked and is continuing to work ... is like throwing away your umbrella in a rainstorm because you are not getting wet.\n\nShe viewed her dissents as a chance to persuade a future court.\n\nSome of my favorite opinions are dissenting opinions, Ginsburg told NPR. I will not live to see what becomes of them, but I remain hopeful.\n\nAnd yet, Ginsburg still managed some unexpected victories by winning over one or two of the conservative justices in important cases. In 2015, for example, she authored the court's decision upholding independent redistricting commissions established by voter referenda as a way of removing some of the partisanship in drawing legislative district lines.\n\nGinsburg always kept a backbreaking schedule of public appearances both at home and abroad, even after five bouts with cancer: colon cancer in 1999, pancreatic cancer 10 years later, lung cancer in 2018, and then pancreatic cancer again in 2019 and liver lesions in 2020. During that time, she endured chemotherapy, radiation and, in the last years of her life, terrible pain from shingles that never went away completely. All who knew her admired her grit. In 2009, three weeks after major cancer surgery, she surprised everyone when she showed up for the State of the Union address.\n\nShortly after that, she was back on the bench; it was her husband, Marty, who told her she could do it, even when she thought she could not, she told NPR.\n\nA year later her psychological toughness was on full display when her beloved husband of 56 years was mortally ill. As she packed up his things at the hospital before taking him home to die, she found a note he had written to her. My Dearest Ruth, it began, You are the only person I have ever loved, setting aside children and family. I have admired and loved you almost since the day we first met at Cornell. ... The time has come for me to ... take leave of life because the loss of quality simply overwhelms. I hope you will support where I come out, but I understand you may not. I will not love you a jot less.\n\nShortly after that, Marty Ginsburg died at home. The next day, his wife, the justice, was on the bench, reading an important opinion she had authored for the court. She was there, she said, because Marty would have wanted it.\n\nYears later, she would read the letter aloud in an NPR interview, and at the end, choke down the tears.\n\nIn the years after Marty's death, she would persevere without him, maintaining a jam-packed schedule when she was not on the bench or working on opinions.\n\nSome liberals criticized her for not retiring while Obama was president, but she was at the top of her game, enjoyed her work enormously and feared that Republicans might not confirm a successor. She was an avid consumer of opera, literature and modern art. But in the end, it was her work, she said, that sustained her.\n\nI do think that I was born under a very bright star, she said in an NPR interview. Because if you think about my life, I get out of law school. I have top grades. No law firm in the city of New York will hire me. I end up teaching; it gave me time to devote to the movement for evening out the rights of women and men.\n\nAnd it was that legal crusade for women's rights that ultimately led to her appointment to the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nTo the end of her tenure, she remained a special kind of feminist, both decorous and dogged.
Medical Bills Still Take A Big Toll, Even With Insurance\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Jason Houge for NPR Jason Houge for NPR\n\nFor Barbara Radley, there is before and after. Before was when she could work — moving furniture, and driving a long-haul truck.\n\nIt was nothing for me to throw a couch on my back and carry it up a flight of stairs, says the 58-year-old from Oshkosh, Wis.\n\nThen there's after. After she herniated five disks in her back. And after, she says, her blood pressure medicine destroyed her pancreas.\n\nNow Radley is disabled, suffering from diabetes, liver failure and scleroderma.\n\nAnd she is bankrupt.\n\nWell, the medical bills were just piling up, Radley tells Shots. We couldn't handle it. We just couldn't keep up.\n\nRadley is among the 26 percent of people in a recent poll who say health care expenses have taken a serious toll on family finances. The poll, conducted by NPR, The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and Harvard's T.H. Chan School of Public Health, shows that even people with medical insurance are still struggling to pay medical bills.\n\nRadley and her husband, also a mover, were getting by on his paycheck and her disability payments, which together brought in about $30,000 a year.\n\nBut, two years ago, they were hit with a double whammy. His company changed to a health insurance plan that required the couple to pay higher premiums — about $700 a month — higher copays and a $5,000 deductible.\n\nThen her husband needed emergency surgery and missed a few months of work.\n\nThat just killed us financially, Radley says.\n\nThey moved out of their family home and rented a place from her daughter-in-law. They stopped eating out — except once in a while, when they'd get a free meal at their church.\n\nStill they ended up in bankruptcy early last year. They were able to write off their old medical debt, but the health problems didn't go away. Barbara's costs are constant and her husband had another surgery last fall. In the past 12 months they've racked up an additional $10,000 in unpaid medical bills.\n\nEverybody wants your money and it's like, 'Well, stand in line; you ain't gonna get none,'  Radley says with exasperation.\n\nAccording to the poll, Radley has plenty of company. Of the people who said health costs have caused them serious problems, 7 percent ended up in bankruptcy.\n\nRadley now makes Faustian bargains on a regular basis.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Jason Houge for NPR Jason Houge for NPR\n\nThere are times I check my blood for my insulin and I know I only have two pens left, she says. And I really can't afford it for another week and a half. Well, then I take a lower dose of my insulin. Otherwise I'll just skip it.\n\nBut skipping insulin also can be dangerous, Radley knows.\n\nIf I would skip it for several days that would put me in the hospital, she says, and that just gives me more bills.\n\nOn Monday she was trying to decide whether to take out a payday loan or sell something on Craigslist to cover her insurance plan's $454 copay for two months of insulin.\n\nA study last year by the Kaiser Family Foundation found that companies are shifting health care costs to their employees. Workers' share of health insurance premiums for their families rose 83 percent from 2005 to 2015, the survey shows. The amount employees had to pay for deductibles for individual insurance increased 255 percent from 2006 to 2015. The increases are far higher than growth in workers' wages.\n\nThat hurts the sickest people the most, says Linda Blumberg, a senior fellow in health policy at the Urban Institute. A study by her organization shows health care has become more affordable since the Affordable Care Act was implemented two years ago. Still, the research found, about 17 percent of adults in the U.S. continue to struggle to pay their medical bills.\n\nWhen we see higher deductibles, higher copays, higher coinsurance, higher out-of-pocket maximums on these insurance plans, the people who are most affected are those that have the most need for medical care, Blumberg says.\n\nAbout 15 percent of those in NPR's poll say that at least once in the past two years, they couldn't get the health care they needed. And 58 percent of those said it was because they couldn't afford it.\n\nSeparately, 19 percent of poll respondents say they didn't fill a prescription because of the cost. Mary Lena Warden, 78, of Cleveland, Texas, is among them.\n\nWarden lives alone and uses a wheelchair to get to the drugstore around the corner and to her doctor down the road. She pays $147 a month for Medicare, the government health insurance program for the elderly and the disabled. That's out of the $1,400 she gets each month in Social Security payments.\n\nWarden says she doesn't qualify for extra help, like food stamps or Medicaid, the federal health care program for the poor.\n\nAll my money is gone by the time I pay my rent, my gas, my lights, my water and my copay for the doctor, Warden says. Everything else is gone.\n\nJust two weeks ago, Warden skipped an appointment for an echocardiogram because she couldn't afford the $100 copay. And she is trying to decide whether to fill a prescription for a drug called Neurontin, which dulls the nerve pain in her leg — pain caused by a severe car accident. The last time she picked up the drug, her copay was $159.95.\n\nRight now I'm afraid to even buy medicines, Warden says. I can't afford 'em.\n\nMedicare, like more and more health plans, leaves lot of expenses for patients to cover, says Drew Altman, CEO of the Kaiser Family Foundation.\n\nThe public perception may be that, because Medicare is so popular, it is gold-plated Cadillac coverage, Altman says. But people who are on Medicare know that those costs can really bite.\n\nAltman says Obamacare has given nearly everyone in the U.S. access to health care. About 89 percent of people now have insurance in some form, according to the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nBut simply having insurance isn't always enough.\n\nThe next big challenge, Altman says, is to stop people from going broke when they get sick.
Analysis: Modest Effect If UnitedHealth Withdraws From Exchanges\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Mike Bradley/Bloomberg via Getty Images Mike Bradley/Bloomberg via Getty Images\n\nInsurance giant United Healthcare Group has griped that the Obamacare insurance exchanges for health coverage are money-losers and has threatened to stop selling plans on them.\n\nUnited Healthcare's latest move is to drop out of the Obamacare insurance market in Oklahoma in 2017. It's the fourth state that the company is abandoning because it says selling insurance plans on exchanges there is unprofitable.\n\nUnited Healthcare has already said it's pulling out of the exchanges in Michigan, Arkansas and parts of Georgia. The company may announce more changes when it reports first quarter financial results Tuesday.\n\nIf the company withdraws from markets across the country (and isn't replaced by rivals), premiums for exchange plans could rise modestly — about 1 percent on average — according to a county-by-county analysis released Monday by the Kaiser Family Foundation Monday. The premium increase would amount to about $4 a month.\n\nIn some markets, the rates could go up much more. The study shows premiums rising more than $100 a month in 13 counties where there is little competition. And more than half of U.S. counties would have only two insurance companies offering plans on the exchanges, the analysis found.\n\nWith millions of Americans insured through the marketplaces, it's clear that this is a growing business for insurers, and it's a product consumers want and need, Department of Health and Human Services spokesman Ben Wakana said in a statement. The marketplace should be judged by the choices it offers consumers, not the decisions of any one issuer. That data shows that the future of the marketplace remains strong.\n\nIn January, UnitedHealth said it had recorded losses of $720 million on individual exchange policies, including $245 million put on the books in 2015 for losses the company expected to incur in 2016.\n\nIn February, Peter Lee, who runs Covered California, the state's insurance exchange, said UnitedHealth has only itself to blame. The insurer, he said, blundered on setting its rates and in putting together networks of hospitals and doctors to provide care.\n\nInstead of saying, 'We screwed up,' they said, 'Obamacare is the problem and we may not play anymore,'  Lee said in an interview with California Healthline. It was giving an excuse to Wall Street and throwing the Affordable Care Act under the bus.
Rep. Pete Sessions On The Pace Of ACA Repeal\n\nSCOTT SIMON, HOST:\n\nSome congressional Republicans are openly worried - at least behind closed doors - about how fast their party's moving to repeal the Affordable Care Act. At a meeting this week, lawmakers warned each other about potential political consequences. The Washington Post quoted Representative Tom McClintock as saying, quote, that's going to be called Trumpcare. Republicans will own that lock, stock and barrel, and we'll be judged in the election less than two years away. Another congressman who expressed concern was Representative Pete Sessions of Texas, who joins us. Mr. Sessions, thanks so much for being with us.\n\nPETE SESSIONS: Good morning.\n\nSIMON: You voted for a budget resolution to allow quick repeal of large parts of the Affordable Care Act. Now you want to slow things down.\n\nSESSIONS: No, I don't think that's what the vote was. The vote was a - was really an order that I had presumptively given from the Rules Committee earlier that authorized committees to begin looking at what this might look at. That was what the vote was.\n\nSIMON: You have concerns about a refundable tax credit to potentially replace parts of the ACA.\n\nSESSIONS: In fact, the discussion about health care has been a healthy one but has not come to a conclusion. As some of your listeners may know, I have a bill with Senator Bill Cassidy that's called The World's Greatest Healthcare Plan. And in that plan it gives every single American that does not today receive the tax benefit that companies - large companies and corporations - allow their people to have, it gives every single American that tax advantage. This tax advantage is some $8,000 for a family of four allowing them on a pretax basis or on a advanceable basis to be able to go to the marketplace and apply $8,000 to a non-government-provided insurance.\n\nThis would level the playing field as opposed to others who have suggested it would be a high-standard deduction that all Americans would have, thus allowing them the next April to be able to write that off their taxes. I believe that we must give all Americans an advanceable pretax opportunity to give a tax credit in January of the year that they would want to buy their health care.\n\nSIMON: Do you think it's wise for some members of your party to try to tie repeal of parts of the ACA to defunding Planned Parenthood?\n\nSESSIONS: Let me say this - it is against the law for - and it has been against the law - for the federal government to pay for abortions. This would be a debate that mostly would take place with the executive. As you know, President Obama and any president has a chance to go - we do not specify Planned Parenthood in anything we do. We simply say health care providers. So while I am for not allowing the funding of Planned Parenthood, I don't know it would take shape in this form. I think it would be a law that would need to be debated in the House, passed the House and in the Senate. And that's the issue right there. So would I want this to stop the health care reform? No.\n\nSIMON: I - you know, I have to ask, Congressman, I noticed something in The New York Times edition and The Washington Post. Is there - was there some concern of members of your party about President Trump? Mark Sanford, the congressman from South Carolina, says - was quoted as saying, I think you can move from real to bizarre if you don't watch out and some of what he's done and in tweet world certainly fits that mold. And then he said they were talking about what the president said about counting the popular vote, and Mr. Sanford said a fellow member turned to me and pointed to it and said that's what Third World dictators do.\n\nSESSIONS: Well, let me go to really the issue at hand, which is why I came on, and I'm so delighted to have this opportunity to ask and receive tough questions and to give them back. President Trump and Vice President Pence are personally involved in this issue of health care, and I believe that President Trump believes that every single American, as he said, stands a shot at getting health care. And that is the purpose of this - really this discussion that I want to have with you and the American people. We want to struggle - and that includes with the vice president and the president who I'll meet with this week personally on this matter for all Americans, including disabled people and the American public that need an opportunity to have the tax advantage. And, Scott, as you know, that was what I wanted to talk about today and what you asked me to talk about. The other ideas that President Trump have, we can agree or disagree.\n\nSIMON: Pete Sessions of Texas, thanks very much for being with us, sir.\n\nSESSIONS: Yes, yes, sir.\n\nCopyright © 2017 NPR.

Trump Blasts Court's Travel Ban Block: 'This Ruling Makes Us Look Weak'\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Mark Humphrey/AP Mark Humphrey/AP\n\nUpdated at 10:45 p.m.\n\nPresident Trump blasted a federal judge's decision to temporarily halt his revised travel ban on Wednesday night, telling a campaign rally in Nashville, Tenn., that he wished he had stood his ground and fought for his original, much stricter executive order.\n\nThe order he blocked was a watered-down version of the first order that was also blocked by another judge and should have never been blocked to start with, Trump said, referring to the decision earlier in the day by U.S. District Court Judge Derrick K. Watson of Hawaii. This new order was tailored to the dictates of the 9th Circuit's, in my opinion, flawed ruling. This was, in the opinion of many, an unprecedented judicial overreach.\n\nI think we ought to go back to the first one [executive order] and go all the way to the Supreme Court, the president told the receptive crowd, adding that this ruling makes us look weak.\n\nThe best way to keep foreign terrorists — or as some would say, radical Islamic terrorists — the best way to stop them is to keep them from entering our country in the first place, Trump said.\n\nThose comments get to the heart of the court's concerns with the travel ban, which had been set to take effect at midnight after being revised last week. Judge Watson wrote that — given past public statements made by the president and his staff — a reasonable, objective observer ... would conclude that the Executive Order was issued with a purpose to disfavor a particular religion.\n\nOpponents of Trump's travel ban were ecstatic on Twitter Wednesday evening that the president speech kept giving them more fodder to use against him in court, including American Civil Liberties Union deputy legal director Cecillia Wang:\n\nNevertheless, Trump argued that the president had wide legal authority when it came to decisions on immigration and national security. He also couldn't resist making a election-related jab at what was billed at a campaign event just over 50 days into his presidency.\n\nThe law and the Constitution give the president the power to suspend immigration, when he deems — or she, fortunately it will not be Hillary 'she' — when he or she deems it to be in the national interests of our country, Trump said.\n\nThe very mention of his former Democratic rival Hillary Clinton started off a familiar campaign refrain of lock her up. Trump looked on, neither commenting nor waving the crowd off.\n\nHis remarks on his administration's latest setback came halfway into his speech, after a long windup in which Trump ran through some of his other campaign trail classics — railing against the media, and promising to bring back American jobs and roll back trade agreements.\n\nFrom now on we are going to defend the American worker and our great American companies. And if America does what it says and if your president does what I've been telling you, there is nobody anywhere in the world that can even come close to us, folks. Not even close, Trump boasted.\n\nAnd of course there was Trump's reiteration of his signature campaign pledge to erect a massive wall along the Mexican border — and along with it, chants from the crowd of build the wall!\n\nWe will build the wall --don't even think about it, Trump promised, claiming that the government already had received hundreds of construction bids.\n\nIt's clear that Trump draws energy from such campaign-style rallies, and they've become a way for him to try and change the subject du jour before an adoring crowd, but it's unprecedented to hold such events so early in his term and so far away from his re-election. He held the first rally last month in Florida, and has another scheduled for Monday in Kentucky.\n\nEarlier in the day, he made an official White House stop in Detroit to announce he was rolling back President Obama's fuel economy standards, touting that decision as one that would spur more manufacturing growth in the auto industry.\n\nAfter that, Trump had stopped off at President Andrew Jackson's nearby Hermitage plantation, laying a wreath on his grave for what would have been Jackson's 250th birthday. Trump often likes to draw allusions between himself and the first Democratic president, given the populist zeal that brought them both into office.\n\nTrump repeated at his Nashville rally his claim that he had done much more than any president had in his first 50 days in office — even Jackson — and some in the crowd had been given signs that read, Promises made. Promises kept.\n\nWe've been putting our America First agenda very much in action. We're keeping our promises, Trump said.\n\nThat boast belies the rocky start he's experienced, including fresh setbackson Wednesday — not just another halting of his travel ban, but continued struggles in getting even members of his own party on board with the GOP's Obamacare replacement plan.\n\nEven with health care being one of the most important topics of the day, he didn't address the issue until late in his speech.\n\nThe bill that I will ultimately sign will get rid of Obamacare and make health care better for you and your family, Trump said, decrying many insurers who already had pulled out of federal exchanges in the Volunteer State under Obamacare.\n\nRemember folks, if we don't do anything, Obamacare will be gone, Trump said, promising that he and Republicans would not be intimidated in their quest.
Midterm Election Could Reshape Health Policy\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Mark Wilson/Getty Images Mark Wilson/Getty Images\n\nObamacare — as the Affordable Care Act is commonly known — won't be on the ballot next month. But the fate of the eight-year old health care law could be decided by which party wins control of Congress in November.\n\nMedicare for All — the progressive alternative to Obamacare — also stands to gain or lose ground.\n\nAnd the Trump administration will be looking for a green light to keep making health care changes of its own.\n\nRepublican strategist Karl Rove wrote about what's at stake in a recent Wall Street Journal column. The headline described health care as the sleeper issue of the 2018 midterm elections.\n\nRepublican Lou Hendricks agrees. The Kansas City retiree told pollsters health care is at the top of his list as he ponders his midterm vote.\n\nOne of the big concerns that we have as as a family is making sure that there continues to be coverage for previous conditions, Hendricks said.\n\nSen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., who's in a tough battle for re-election, is trying to tap into that concern. McCaskill describes her own struggle with breast cancer in a new campaign ad.\n\nI don't talk about it much, she says, over video that shows the senator meeting with other women. Those who faced cancer and many other illnesses have a pre-existing condition when it comes to health coverage.\n\nMcCaskill blasts her Republican opponent, Missouri Attorney General Josh Hawley, for joining a lawsuit that seeks to overturn Obamacare and its requirement that insurance companies offer coverage regardless of a person's medical history. Republicans insist they will also protect patients with pre-existing medical conditions, though they've been vague in saying how.\n\nDemocrats around the country have seized on this issue. Health care dominates congressional campaign ads, outpacing jobs, taxes, and immigration.\n\nDemocrats have been laser-focused on health care this year, said Erika Franklin Fowler, who tracks campaign ads for the Wesleyan Media Project.\n\nIt's the mirror image of past election cycles, when Republicans ran a blitzkrieg of ads attacking Obamacare while Democrats stayed largely quiet.\n\nRegardless of how Americans feel about the Affordable Care Act, there are provisions of it that are very popular, Franklin said. Once it became clear that those provisions are in trouble, I think that has sort of changed the landscape of how politicians will talk about it this cycle.\n\nDemocrats are determined to protect those popular provisions if they win one or both houses of Congress in November. On the other hand, if Republicans keep control, they could take another run at repealing Obamacare.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Aaron P. Bernstein/Getty Images Aaron P. Bernstein/Getty Images\n\nMany Republicans want the ability to finish the job, said Jessica Anderson, vice president of the conservative group Heritage Action. They've campaigned on this for over eight years.\n\nAnderson said even if Republicans lose in November, they could mount a last-ditch effort to repeal Obamacare during the lame-duck session. The late Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., who helped torpedo the last repeal effort, has now been replaced by Jon Kyl, a more reliable GOP vote.\n\nNo matter which party controls Congress next year, the Trump administration will likely keep trying to chip away at Obamacare. For example, the administration has already relaxed regulations to allow stripped-down insurance policies with reduced coverage.\n\nThe president will still be in office, and his administration will still be active, Anderson said.\n\nBut if Democrats win control of either chamber, they might be able to put the brakes on those efforts.\n\nWhat you're likely to see is much greater and even fierce oversight of the administration's efforts to change — and many would say undermine the Affordable Care Act, said Drew Altman, president of the Kaiser Family Foundation, a health care research organization.\n\nIn Kansas City, Hendricks described himself as a fan of the Affordable Care Act. But more and more he's leaning towards a single-payer insurance system, which progressive advocates like to describe as Medicare for All.\n\nIt makes it easier and simpler for everybody, Hendricks said, with he exception of Aetna, Blue Cross/Blue Shield, enter the medical insurance company here.\n\nPresident Trump has gone on the offensive, claiming without evidence that any expansion of Medicare will come at the expense of today's seniors.\n\nEven if they win a sweeping victory in the midterms, Democrats won't have the power to pass Medicare for All over a presidential veto. But they might jump start the conversation ahead of the next election in two years.
For Republicans, Partial Obamacare Repeal Carries Political Risks\n\nRepeal of the Affordable Care Act is politically dangerous for Republicans unless they can pass a replacement that covers many of the people who benefit from the health care law.\n\nKELLY MCEVERS, HOST:\n\nDonald Trump and congressional Republicans say repealing the Affordable Care Act is a top priority, but lawmakers might not be able to simply reverse the law without support from Democrats. Republicans could quickly push through a partial repeal of the law without that bipartisan support, but as NPR's Alison Kodjak reports, that comes with big political risks.\n\nALISON KODJAK, BYLINE: Senate Democrats are almost certain to use their filibuster power to block a repeal of the Affordable Care Act, so Republicans may have to invoke special budget rules that can circumvent the Democrats' opposition and defund the law. That would kill the parts of the ACA that Republicans hate most, like the requirement that everybody buy health insurance, but it could also leave many people who have coverage today without any coverage in the future.\n\nRICHARD EVANS: Unless you replace that lost coverage, then you're almost certain to lose the Republican majority in the House in the midterm.\n\nKODJAK: That's Richard Evans, head of the health care practice at the investment research firm SSR, who spoke to us via Skype. He analyzed the election to find out which House members won their seats by a slim majority and who also have a lot of people in their districts whose health care or jobs depend on Obamacare. A bill to repeal the ACA could pass even if about 23 Republicans voted against it. But in Evans' analysis, more than 23 Republican House members are vulnerable. And for those who are...\n\nEVANS: That member of Congress is going to have to make a very tough decision and is in fact likely to lose their seat.\n\nKODJAK: Evans' analysis shows a dozen or more who could fall into that category. In the Senate, lawmakers can repeal much of the Affordable Care Act with just 50 votes, but replacing the law would require the support of at least several Democrats to overcome a filibuster. Gail Wilensky ran Medicare and Medicaid under President George H.W. Bush.\n\nGAIL WILENSKY: The upshot of that is that repealing may be easier than putting in the replacement.\n\nKODJAK: And without a replacement, people could lose their coverage.\n\nWILENSKY: There is not a willingness to have approximately 20 million people who have gained insurance as a result of the Affordable Care Act become uninsured. That would be regarded as a very bad political move, to be running in 2018 as the guys that took away insurance coverage from 20 million people.\n\nKODJAK: But after six years promising to get rid of Obamacare, Republicans pretty much have to follow through, says Paul Howard, director of health policy at the conservative Manhattan Institute.\n\nPAUL HOWARD: They have to take the vote. I mean, they can't help but take the vote because they've run on it so hard and because, you know, this is a major promise that both President-elect Trump and probably virtually every Republican serving in Congress has made.\n\nKODJAK: Howard says the Affordable Care Act's partisan beginnings caused many of its flaws. Democrats in Congress pushed the law through on a party line vote, using the same budget maneuver that Republicans may now use to kill it. Because Republicans never supported it, they refuse to help fix its problems. Republicans now run the risk of making the same mistake if they follow a party line strategy to repeal the ACA, Howard says.\n\nHOWARD: To put it bluntly, the shoe is on the other foot.\n\nKODJAK: He says both sides now have to choose whether to work together to create a lasting health care reform or refuse to cooperate and continue to make voters on one side or the other angry.

Week In Politics: Sessions Recuses Himself From Campaign Investigations\n\nNPR's Audie Cornish talks to political commentators, E.J. Dionne of The Washington Post and Brookings Institution and David Brooks of The New York Times. They discuss Trump's speech to Congress.\n\nAUDIE CORNISH, HOST:\n\nAll right we're going to get past the media strategy and into some substance with our Friday regulars, columnist David Brooks of The New York Times. Hey there, David.\n\nDAVID BROOKS, BYLINE: Hello.\n\nCORNISH: And E.J. Dionne of The Washington Post and Brookings Institution. Welcome back to the studio.\n\nE J DIONNE, BYLINE: Good to be with you.\n\nCORNISH: So I want to go back to the issue of Jeff Sessions, the attorney general. Here's what he said yesterday about why he had to recuse himself from any ongoing or future investigations.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nJEFF SESSIONS: When you evaluate the rules, I feel like I should not be involved investigating a campaign I had role in.\n\nCORNISH: And this is over the issue of contacts with Russia in the Trump campaign. But this is not the take that the administration had at the start of the day. So here's what Press Secretary Sean Spicer said in the morning on Fox & Friends.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, FOX AND FRIENDS)\n\nSEAN SPICER: There's nothing to recuse himself. He is 100 percent straight with the committee. And I think that people who are choosing to play partisan politics with this should be ashamed of themselves.\n\nCORNISH: So even now, even as Sessions has recused himself, you still hear the president, through his tweets, basically saying, this is sour grapes, basically saying, this is a witch hunt. David Brooks, for you, what's the problem with that strategy? Like, how long can you keep saying there's no there there?\n\nBROOKS: Well, you know, I don't know if there's a there there. Never underestimate the possibility for Washington people to have pointless meetings. And it could be Jeff Sessions had a pointless meeting with Cislyak (ph) the Russian ambassador - or Kislyak. And it could've just been one of those get-togethers that happens all the time. On the other hand, there are so many points of contact between Trump - various Trump persona and the Russians that it's like a Seurat painting - the points are beginning to look like something.\n\nAnd, to me, the crucial - two crucial questions, which are completely unanswered at this point - there's, one, did the Trump people know something about the Russian campaign - the WikiLeaks campaign - during the campaign? Two, do the Russians have something on Trump, whether in the form of some blackmail information, or are they so heavily invested in his companies that he has reason to pay attention to Russia? Those are the two open questions in my mind.\n\nCORNISH: And later in the program, we're actually going to hear from Congressman Adam Schiff from the Intel Committee in the House about that. But E.J., you talked about this episode essentially showing the first cracks in the wall of like kind of congressional Republican support because it's been a wall of support, right? Like, whatever he does, it's like we're going to back it.\n\nDIONNE: Well, as soon as this Session's news broke, you had Republican members of Congress saying, OK, now he has to recuse himself. You just didn't see that before. Jason Chaffetz was one of them. And to have Chaffetz...\n\nCORNISH: And he's head of the House Oversight Committee.\n\nDIONNE: Right. And he's been so loyal. That would be like - I don't know - Bill Belichick turning on Tom Brady for a moment. I mean, it was just very...\n\nCORNISH: All gets back to football.\n\nDIONNE: I can't resist. The, you know - and so that's striking. But I think the problem the Trump people have is they cannot talk straight about Russia. If Jeff Sessions had had a couple of meetings with the ambassador and hadn't gone out of his way to tell Al Franken on the committee in response to a question that didn't even ask him whether he had had any meetings that in fact he had had no meetings, this wouldn't be nearly as big a story.\n\nIf Michael Flynn had not lied about exactly what had gone on, I'm not sure he would have survived, but they just can't seem to talk straight about this. And so they create a strong sense that they're hiding something. And Trump contributes to that by blowing up every time that the Russia story comes up. He had actually maintained a Lenten fast on Twitter, and it just blew apart with this story.\n\nCORNISH: Now I want to turn back to the speech earlier this week. Here's a clip of the president addressing Congress.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Everything that is broken in our country can be fixed. Every problem can be solved, and every hurting family can find healing and hope.\n\nCORNISH: Every problem can be solved. So David Brooks, you looked at this through the lens of Trumpism. Who can solve those problems? What's the role of government in that?\n\nBROOKS: Yeah, I thought it was interesting because you got to see Trumpism the thing without Trump the clownish behavior. So it was like a straight-on view - our first sort of straight-on view. What struck me first was how un-Republican it was. The Republican Party has had three big units, all of whom were repudiated by the speech. Social conservatives got nary a mention. Fiscal hawks - he's spending a lot of money. Foreign policy hawks - he does not believe in a lot of our alliances. But what he believes in is a strong government. He's - it's for a lot of big government. But it's very forceful father figure, very rough government against their enemies.\n\nAnd the way I put it in the - one of my columns today was that he's privatized compassion and nationalized intimidation. And what I mean by that is all the compassionate realms of government that help people in trouble - he's cutting them. All that tough - he got tough-man type parts of government - he's spending a lot more money on. So we're going to get a lot stronger government but maybe a little rougher one.\n\nCORNISH: E.J. you disagreed with people who were painting this as some kind of sunny turn by the president (laughter). Though, you noted that he was - you said he was throwing bones of optimism to his party.\n\nDIONNE: Yeah, I shuddered at the thought of Trump as a father figure wondering, what kind of father is that with this roughness? I thought this was the old vinegar in a new bottle. He got a lot of credit he didn't deserve just because he showed he could spend one disciplined hour in relationship - in a relationship with the teleprompter, that what he was trying to do here is continue to scare the daylights out of the country to justify strong leadership and aggrandizing power. He talks about wide-open borders, gang members, drug dealers, criminals. We cannot allow a beachhead of terrorism to form inside America.\n\nAnd his own aids were surprised at the good reviews, according to my colleague Robert Costa, because they thought this was purer Trumpism than the establishment media suggested. And I actually for one time agree with them on that.\n\nCORNISH: I want to mention one quick thing. We just have a little time left. But he did throw a bone behind the idea of tax credits being swapped out for the current subsidies used for Obamacare. But you already have Republican critics saying, wait a second, what's going on? Is this entitlement? Is this Obamacare-lite? David Brooks, is this thing still on the rails - this replacement plan?\n\nBROOKS: Yeah. I mean, we have the comic prospect of people looking for the actual bill around the Capitol building this week.\n\nCORNISH: (Laughter) Yeah.\n\nBROOKS: And so like nobody - it's ludicrous they're going to mark it up next week in a couple of committees, and it's somewhere hiding in a closet somewhere. That part is ludicrous.\n\nCORNISH: Well, reports are it's in a dedicated reading room where people may look at it (laughter) - OK? - one at a time.\n\nDIONNE: A bunker (laughter).\n\nBROOKS: But whether they're going to actually get these tax credit plan, which I think substantively is a good plan - I just think a guy who is offering a lot of security and order is not going to pass a health care bill that would increase a lot of risk for a lot of people.\n\nDIONNE: People react the most when they are about to lose something. And the - a lot of people are worried that what the Republicans have in mind will take health care coverage away. And I don't think they have reassured those people yet. And that's why there's a split in the party.\n\nCORNISH: E.J. Dionne of The Washington Post and Brookings Institution, thank you so much.\n\nDIONNE: Good to be with you.\n\nCORNISH: David Brooks of The New York Times, have a good weekend.\n\nBROOKS: You too.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF GORDON GOODWIN'S BIG PHAT BAND SONG, ON GREEN DOLPHIN STREET)\n\nCopyright © 2017 NPR.

Week In Politics\n\nThe president declared a national emergency in order to supplement the border security funding provided by Congress this week. The question of an emergency will likely end up at the Supreme Court.\n\nSCOTT SIMON, HOST:\n\nGoing to turn now to NPR's Ron Elving. Ron, thank you for being with us.\n\nRON ELVING, BYLINE: Good morning, Scott.\n\nSIMON: You heard the congressman wrestle with constitutional and congressional authority. Is there any chance that Congress will challenge this emergency declaration?\n\nELVING: The House might do that. The House might well do that, but the Senate isn't likely to. If they wish to, they might have included more of a preventive measure against this in the funding deal that they just passed.\n\nAnd as the congressman just said, that funding deal was a compromise between the parties, between the House and Senate and then between the Congress and the president. And the numbers were basically what Trump had agreed to in December before he got so much heat in the conservative media space that he changed his mind and forced the shutdown that then lasted five weeks.\n\nSo with nothing to show for all that and the wall still not funded, the president has chosen a different kind of grand gesture, an assertion of executive power. So now the courts must decide whether the Constitution allows the president to fund something Congress has refused to fund.\n\nSIMON: Mitch McConnell, Senate majority leader, of course, had said that he didn't think an emergency declaration was a great idea. When it was announced yesterday, he said he's behind it. Is it as simple as he looked at a few polls or listened to what you called the conservative media space?\n\nELVING: There have been signs of Mitch McConnell pushing back in recent weeks. But, look, the Senate majority leader is caught in a replay loop. He warns the president the votes aren't there for, say, total repeal of Obamacare. He warns the president about the wall. He warns the president about the shutdown and about the declaration of emergency.\n\nAnd each time, Trump ignores him. And each time, McConnell takes a knee. And he does it because he simply can't resist Trump's dominance in what is now the Republican Party. Much to his chagrin, McConnell has come to embody his party's rather supine relationship to this president.\n\nSIMON: President Trump said yesterday he expects the question of his emergency declaration to wind up at the Supreme Court. A question to be included or not on the 2020 census is already before the court, isn't it?\n\nELVING: Yes, that's right. Now, in the Rose Garden yesterday, Trump essentially said he expects to lose at every level in the courts until the case reaches the Supreme Court, where he hopes his own appointees can tip the balance. He hopes the same on the census question you mentioned.\n\nThat's about adding a citizenship question that was abandoned 60-something years ago. That question was shown to be depressing participation in the census and thereby defeating the constitutional purpose of having a census in the first place.\n\nSIMON: Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg back at work.\n\nELVING: Yes, the legend continues. She was back on the job Friday.\n\nSIMON: Just in - I hear her doc is up for the Academy Awards, too, just in time.\n\nELVING: That is - that's right. And there's another movie about her career as well. She's expected to also be back next week, and her presence on the court has never been more important.\n\nSIMON: Special counsel investigation, Sarah Sanders revealed she was interviewed. Paul Manafort, the president's former campaign chairman, has been found to repeatedly lie during his interviews.\n\nELVING: And the sentencing recommendation is about 20 years. Remember, he was already sentenced to prison in a related case last year. But it's clear Manafort long ago gave up on defending himself in all this. At this point, he's sending signals that he is not cooperating with the government or the Mueller investigation and relying on his hopes for a pardon from the president.\n\nSIMON: NPR senior Washington, D.C., editor and correspondent, Ron Elving. Ron, thanks so much for being with us.\n\nELVING: Thank you, Scott.\n\nCopyright © 2019 NPR. All rights reserved.

GOP Faces A Midterm Report Card, Democrats Seek Control\n\nAfter two years with full control of Congress and the White House, Republicans face a referendum on their performance. Democrats, on the other hand, are hoping to take back some of that control.\n\nRACHEL MARTIN, HOST:\n\nIt is Election Day.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: You got to go out and vote.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nBARACK OBAMA: Don't boo. Vote.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nUNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: What are Democrats for? We are for the people.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nUNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: And President Donald Trump has been delivering.\n\nMARTIN: After two years with full control of Congress and the White House, Republicans face a referendum on their performance. President Trump says he's made good on what he said on election night 2016.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nTRUMP: We have to do a great job. And I promise you that I will not let you down. We will do a great job.\n\nDAVID GREENE, HOST:\n\nNow, we should say the GOP has had some high-profile legislative failures.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nUNIDENTIFIED PERSON #3: Obamacare is the law of the land. It's gonna remain the law of the land until it's replaced. We did not have quite the votes to replace this law. And so, yeah, we're going to be living with Obamacare for the foreseeable future.\n\nGREENE: And here's the sound of one big success.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nUNIDENTIFIED PERSON #4: This is a great day for the country. It's been 31 years since we've done comprehensive tax reform.\n\nMARTIN: For their part, Democrats have been largely on the outside looking in. Now, they're looking for redemption.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nBERNIE SANDERS: So the Democratic Party has got to make it clear which side it's on. And I'm going to do everything I can to make certain that it is on the side of the working families.\n\nMARTIN: And promising to be a check on President Trump.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nUNIDENTIFIED PERSON #5: We have a responsibility to draw a line with these administrative actions and say no.\n\nMARTIN: And by this time tomorrow, we'll have a good idea of what voters have decided. NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson joins us now to talk about this midterm season. Good morning, Mara.\n\nMARA LIASSON, BYLINE: Good morning, Rachel.\n\nMARTIN: So it seems like there's been a lot of hype over these particular midterms ever since Donald Trump was inaugurated. I mean, as you look back, have they shaped up the way you thought they would?\n\nLIASSON: I think that despite all of the twists and turns in this election cycle, the race has been pretty stable. But, you know, we've had a rollercoaster. There were various times, especially in the beginning of the cycle, when Republicans thought they could pick up as many as five Senate seats. Democrats at one point thought they might have had a path to get the majority in the Senate. But I think that everybody's come down to earth now. And we're where we were where Republicans could pick up anywhere between one and three Senate seats. Democrats are just hoping to limit their losses and win the House.\n\nGREENE: I mean, one thing we can say for certain - there's so much energy in both parties right now - a lot of enthusiasm in the country. I mean, there is potential for a record turnout numbers we're talking about. For candidates, is this more about getting undecided voters and winning them over? Or is this all about turning out the base?\n\nLIASSON: Well, it's turned out to be a base election. Certainly, the president believes in that. The president is always all about his base. He tends to operate with a kind of social media or cable news business model, which is he doesn't really worry much about expanding his audience. He just wants them to watch the show more hours a day.\n\nGREENE: Be stuck to the TV, yeah.\n\nLIASSON: Yeah, because - and extreme content or kind of very incendiary rhetoric equals more engagement. That's the social media business model. And for President Trump, it worked in 2016. It got his core base voters - white working-class voters to turn out in greater numbers. And that seems to be what he's hoping will happen this time. The thing that's been unusual about this election is usually you have one side that's energized and the other side that's complacent. That's what we've seen in most midterm elections in the past.\n\nThis time Democrats had the edge all along. They might still have a little edge. But what happened in the last month or so is Republicans have also gotten amped up. The Kavanaugh fight helped them. Also it's October - Republicans starting to come home. So you really do see two tribes very excited and energized about this election.\n\nGREENE: You know, Rachel and I have both been out talking to voters. And I want to dig in a little bit to the Trump appeal. There's one voice that's really stuck with me. She's in Poplar Bluff, Mo. She works at this factory that was actually hit by President Trump's tariffs - lost jobs because of it. And I was asking her, Michelle Spurgeon, about what she thinks of the president.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)\n\nGREENE: I mean, have you lost any faith in him...\n\nMICHELLE SPURGEON: No.\n\nGREENE: ...Since this tariff went into effect?\n\nSPURGEON: No. It's hard right now. I mean, a lot of times when things are hard, they're going to get harder until they start getting better. That's just a fact of life.\n\nGREENE: Mara, she's just not with Trump. She's like totally with him - saying, I'm willing to sacrifice for you because I believe so much in what you're doing.\n\nLIASSON: Right. And, you know, Trump said famously in 2016 he could stand on Fifth Avenue and shoot someone, and he wouldn't lose any voters. The corollary in 2018 is he could stand on a soybean field and put a lot of tariffs out there and hurt soybean farmers, and they'd still stick with him. And that's, I think, what you're hearing there.\n\nBut Trump believes - and there's a lot of evidence to show that he's right - that emotional issues - culture war issues, race, crime, immigration - work better at energizing voters than economic issues. And I think you see that with all these farmers who are being hurt by Trump's policies in their pocketbook. But in their heart, they agree with him on these other issues. And they're sticking with them.\n\nMARTIN: Mara, most Republican candidates have openly embraced the president. I mean, even if they were reluctant early on, most of them have have gotten on the Trump train. What are these elections going to tell us about the GOP's identity going forward?\n\nLIASSON: Well, I think it's going to tell us a lot. Trump has definitely remade the Republican Party in his own image. But if they do lose a lot of seats, they're going to have to rethink that. And there are a lot of suburban House districts where you see the tremendous falloff in white college-educated women who are turning away from the Republican Party. So I think this election is going to tell us a lot about the limits of Trump's base. How big is it? Can he get them out in an election where he's not on the ballot? And I think that Republicans are either going to come out of this triumphant and more Trump-ist or in a place where they have to do a lot of soul-searching.\n\nMARTIN: What about the Democrats? I mean, there's a lot of talk about how Democrats have been reaching out to try to extend their tent - recruiting candidates of color, recruiting more women. In particular, Ayana Pressley - she's a city councilwoman from Boston who unseated a Democratic incumbent in the primary there. She seems likely to become the first black congresswoman from Massachusetts. I want to play a little bit of what she had to say earlier this year.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nAYANNA PRESSLEY: I'm not going to pretend that representation doesn't matter. You cannot have a government for and by the people if it is not represented by all of the people.\n\nMARTIN: Representation matters. What is this year's Democratic slate of candidates going to tell us about the party's future?\n\nLIASSON: I think the Democratic Party is going to look a lot more diverse. It's going to look more female. It's going to look younger and browner when we're finished with this election. One of the things that's historic about this election - in addition to fielding a large number of female candidates, they're competing everywhere. And if there is going to be a blue wave, Democrats have to have their surfboards in the water to catch it. And in the past, they used to leave a lot of House races uncontested. They're not doing that this year.\n\nGREENE: But, Mara, even if the Democratic Party is exciting people by having this roster of diverse candidates - a lot more women - there was a woman who our colleague Leila Fadel spoke to on a piece that aired on our program. Her name is Christina Rodriguez (ph). She lives in El Paso, Texas, and she was talking to Leila about why she thinks she is not going to vote in these midterms.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)\n\nCHRISTINA RODRIGUEZ: I really don't think about it. It's kind of sad to say. But I don't think about like, OK, well, what can be better in my life. It's like I do what I can do to make my life better. I don't depend on them to change things for me.\n\nGREENE: As much as the narrative is there's going to be this big turnout and lots of energy, I mean, a lot of people still don't vote in midterms, right? Is that a problem for Democrats or maybe both parties?\n\nLIASSON: Well, I think that the woman that you just heard from completely crystallizes Democratic nightmares. If they can't get high turnout among Hispanics and young voters - they don't need it everywhere, but they definitely need it in places like Texas and Arizona and Nevada. If they can't do that, then they have failed to convince women like that as to why voting is connected to making her life better.\n\nMARTIN: OK. So, Mara, we've talked an awful lot about Congress. But what other races are you keeping your eye on?\n\nLIASSON: Well, I'm really watching governors' races. They often don't get as much attention as the congressional races, but they are extremely important for the next election cycle 2020. Donald Trump really needs to have a Republican governor in Florida. When you look at the states where he won - Florida, Wisconsin, Ohio, Michigan - all of them had Republican governors in 2016 - and state legislative races because if Democrats are shut out once again from state legislatures, they will have no say in the next redistricting process that happens after the 2020 census.\n\nMARTIN: NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson for us - thanks so much, Mara.\n\nLIASSON: Thanks for having me.\n\nCopyright © 2018 NPR.

She Chose To 'Go Flat' And Wants Other Breast Cancer Survivors To Know They Can Too\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Courtesy of Catherine Guthrie Courtesy of Catherine Guthrie\n\nCatherine Guthrie already knew a lot about breast cancer when she found a lump on her left breast at age 38.\n\nA women's health journalist, Guthrie had written about breast cancer patients' experiences and had followed the latest treatment innovations. But all of that research could not have prepared her for living through breast cancer — and the choices she would have to make about her body.\n\nIn her memoir, FLAT: Reclaiming My Body After Breast Cancer, Guthrie tells of her battle with breast cancer; her relationship with her partner, Mary; and her sometimes-frustrating interactions with the medical system, specifically male surgeons.\n\nFLAT (Skyhorse Publishing) is about Guthrie's journey to feeling comfortable in her own body again after getting a double mastectomy and opting not to get reconstructive breast surgery — after learning it might impair her strength and mobility — and instead choosing to go flat.\n\nAbout 25 percent of double mastectomy patients choose to stay flat after the surgery, and 50 percent of single mastectomy patients do, as well. That's a lot of women, Guthrie says, choosing flat chests over reconstructed breasts.\n\nShe talked to us about her surgeon's big mistake, how she decided to go flat, and why some doctors just won't accept it when women make that decision.\n\nThis interview has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nInterview Highlights\n\nYour physician made a pretty significant error, causing you to need a second operation just after you had your double mastectomy in 2009. What went wrong?\n\nI went back to my surgeon a week later in order to get the drains [which channel fluid from the surgical site] removed. He removed the drains, and reflexively, I reached up to feel the place where the lump had been in my chest. I just wanted to make sure it was gone.\n\nSo I reach up, and my fingers land on the lump. I have no breasts, and yet I have the lump in the same exact spot where it was before my surgery. And I look at my surgeon and I say, There's a lump here, and I'm feeling it. This is not OK.\n\nHe looks at me and says Oh, I'm sure it's nothing, don't worry about it. I was like, I'm worried about it right now, and I need you to feel it. I'm not leaving your office today with a lump in the same exact spot as [where] my cancer was. He acted like, What a pain in the ass you are right now, and this is supposed to be your happy cancer-free moment and you're ruining it.\n\nThe surgeon agreed to send me downstairs for a mammogram and things unfolded from there to show that it was indeed the same exact lump — that he had missed it.\n\nWhat did this experience teach you about the power dynamic in the relationship between doctors and patients?\n\nIt kind of reaffirmed in some ways what I've been feeling all along. When you're the patient and you're sitting there in a paper towel, essentially, and you're speaking with a surgeon, the power imbalance is very stark. No matter who you are. I think as a woman speaking to a male surgeon, the power imbalance is greater because of our cultural attitudes toward gender. Then to have the surgeon be dismissive, and kind of wave off my concern as like, Oh you're just getting hysterical.\n\nThere's also a long history of women being treated dismissively by the medical establishment. And it's one thing to know that happens as a feminist and as a woman who writes about these issues, but it's another thing to physically live that experience and to stand up for yourself. It drove me to write the book, and it inspires me to talk publicly to patients and doctors about these issues.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Mary Maths/NPR Mary Maths/NPR\n\nHow did you make the decision to go flat, to not get reconstructive surgery? Was it hard to make that choice?\n\nIt's always absolutely hard to make a choice to amputate part of your body. When I first found the lump, I thought, OK, I'll probably get a lumpectomy and radiation. As a health reporter, I knew that was my least invasive option, and it had a really good track record. Because my lump was high on my breast and my breast was small, [I wasn't] a candidate for lumpectomy. [My surgeon] said it would decimate my breast, there would be nothing left.\n\nHe immediately switched gears and he said, Don't worry. Here's what we're going to do: We're going to give you a single mastectomy, and we're going to reconstruct your breasts by severing the largest muscle in your back, cutting a flap out of that muscle, leaving one end of the flap connected to the blood supply in your back, and then wrapping the other end of the flap under your arm until it reaches the front of your body. And then we're going to put a breast implant in the cavity where we just took out all the breast tissue, and then lay this muscle over the breast implant, and that's going to be your new breast.\n\nWow. That sounds invasive. How did you wrap your head around that?\n\nI was flabbergasted. I looked at him and asked, Isn't that muscle doing something? He was just waved his hand like, Oh, most women never miss it. And I thought to myself, Ha, that's hard to imagine because this is the largest muscle in the back. In that moment, I knew I would miss it. I'm a very active person, I was only 38 at the time, I was a yoga teacher.\n\nSo this idea that we don't need our body strength, that we don't need to be strong because what's more important than strength is presenting to the world as having breasts, is really disturbing to me.\n\nAnd it was assumed that I would much rather look quote-unquote normal in clothes, that that would be my priority over feeling strong and confident in my body. So the only people this rebuilt breast would be for would be strangers. And that's who I was going to sacrifice my strength for, so it quickly made no sense to me to go that route.\n\nAnd once you made that decision, did your doctors support you?\n\nI was lucky in that my surgeon accepted that choice. I did not get a lot of pushback from the surgeon. I think the hurdle for me and for a lot of women is that the choice to go flat was not presented to me. I had to come up with that idea on my own. When I went home from the conversation with the plastic surgeon, my mind was reeling, and I was thinking, like, How can I escape the options that he put in front of me? I'm a big advocate for surgeons putting flat on the menu of options that they offer to women from the get-go.\n\nYou've been outspoken about the fact that some women are not having their wish to go flat respected by their doctors. How does that happen?\n\nRecently, maybe a year or two ago, it came to my attention that women were asking their surgeons to make them flat, and during the surgery, the surgeon would change their minds. While the woman was under anesthesia, the surgeon would decide for him or herself, I'm going to leave a little extra skin in case this woman changes her mind. So breast cancer patients are waking up from surgery with excess skin left on their chest after having asked to be made flat. The skin sags and droops — for many women it is like having two empty pillowcases on your chest.\n\nThis is discussed all the time in online forums. I talked to eight women it happened to while reporting another story. That this happens on a regular basis is an abomination, it's a violation. And it just says so much about the culture of paternalism and protectionism that certainly exists in the medical system today, and especially among surgeons. Ultimately, they don't trust women to make good decisions about their bodies.\n\nWhen this happens, do women typically go back for additional surgery?\n\nIt's no small thing to have to go back for another surgery. And most insurance companies fight paying for a revision. The average breast reconstruction takes several surgeries, and they pay for that no problem. But if the surgeon messes up your mastectomy and leaves extra skin, and you go back and ask for revision, those women are told that's cosmetic surgery and it's not covered.\n\nSo are more women going flat these days?\n\nThere's no evidence that the trend is reversing per se. Actually, the number of women who get reconstruction has been going up pretty steadily for lots of reasons, including Obamacare, [which] allowed a lot more women to have insurance coverage. I always say I'm not anti-reconstruction; I'm pro-information. I just want people to have good information.\n\nBut what's interesting is that what's happening with flat visibility, especially in the media, is you see more of it. There's amazing stuff happening. People like Tig Notaro being flat and taking her shirt off during a comedy routine – that was a really big move.\n\nI'm not sure everyone appreciates this comparison, but because I'm queer, I compare it to coming out of the closet. More and more women are seeing flat visibility represented in the media. And I think what it's doing is it's allowing women to feel brave. They feel like, Oh wow, look at what she's doing. She's out there, she's flat, she's bold.\n\nWomen are coming into flat groups on Facebook where every Friday it's Flat and Fabulous Friday. People post their outfits for the day, showing how they're rocking their flat chests. And there's just so much support and excitement and enthusiasm for really cheering these women on as they move into the world and just embrace their bodies.\n\nRachel D.

Watch: Sen. McCain Calls For Compromise In Return To Senate Floor\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Brendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty Images Brendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty Images\n\nSen. John McCain, R-Ariz., returned to Washington, D.C., on Tuesday after a brain cancer diagnosis to help Republican leadership begin debate on health care. But after casting his vote in favor of debate, McCain took the floor and said he would not vote for the current health bill, the latest product of a controversial and contentious process in which Republicans have been at odds with one another as well as with Democrats.\n\nMcCain called for a return to regular order in the Senate, urging his colleagues to move toward compromise and an open legislative process.\n\nOur responsibilities are important, vitally important, to the continued success of our republic. And our arcane rules and customs are deliberately intended to require broad cooperation to function well at all, he said. The most revered members of this institution accepted the necessity of compromise in order to make incremental progress on solving America's problems and defend her from her adversaries.\n\nHere is a video and his full remarks, as provided by the senator's office:\n\nPBS NewsHour via YouTube\n\nMr. President:\n\nI've stood in this place many times and addressed as president many presiding officers. I have been so addressed when I have sat in that chair, as close as I will ever be to a presidency.\n\nIt is an honorific we're almost indifferent to, isn't it. In truth, presiding over the Senate can be a nuisance, a bit of a ceremonial bore, and it is usually relegated to the more junior members of the majority.\n\nBut as I stand here today – looking a little worse for wear I'm sure – I have a refreshed appreciation for the protocols and customs of this body, and for the other ninety-nine privileged souls who have been elected to this Senate.\n\nI have been a member of the United States Senate for thirty years. I had another long, if not as long, career before I arrived here, another profession that was profoundly rewarding, and in which I had experiences and friendships that I revere. But make no mistake, my service here is the most important job I have had in my life. And I am so grateful to the people of Arizona for the privilege – for the honor – of serving here and the opportunities it gives me to play a small role in the history of the country I love.\n\nI've known and admired men and women in the Senate who played much more than a small role in our history, true statesmen, giants of American politics. They came from both parties, and from various backgrounds. Their ambitions were frequently in conflict. They held different views on the issues of the day. And they often had very serious disagreements about how best to serve the national interest.\n\nBut they knew that however sharp and heartfelt their disputes, however keen their ambitions, they had an obligation to work collaboratively to ensure the Senate discharged its constitutional responsibilities effectively. Our responsibilities are important, vitally important, to the continued success of our Republic. And our arcane rules and customs are deliberately intended to require broad cooperation to function well at all. The most revered members of this institution accepted the necessity of compromise in order to make incremental progress on solving America's problems and to defend her from her adversaries.\n\nThat principled mindset, and the service of our predecessors who possessed it, come to mind when I hear the Senate referred to as the world's greatest deliberative body. I'm not sure we can claim that distinction with a straight face today.\n\nI'm sure it wasn't always deserved in previous eras either. But I'm sure there have been times when it was, and I was privileged to witness some of those occasions.\n\nOur deliberations today – not just our debates, but the exercise of all our responsibilities – authorizing government policies, appropriating the funds to implement them, exercising our advice and consent role – are often lively and interesting. They can be sincere and principled. But they are more partisan, more tribal more of the time than any other time I remember. Our deliberations can still be important and useful, but I think we'd all agree they haven't been overburdened by greatness lately. And right now they aren't producing much for the American people.\n\nBoth sides have let this happen. Let's leave the history of who shot first to the historians. I suspect they'll find we all conspired in our decline – either by deliberate actions or neglect. We've all played some role in it. Certainly I have. Sometimes, I've let my passion rule my reason. Sometimes, I made it harder to find common ground because of something harsh I said to a colleague. Sometimes, I wanted to win more for the sake of winning than to achieve a contested policy.\n\nIncremental progress, compromises that each side criticize but also accept, just plain muddling through to chip away at problems and keep our enemies from doing their worst isn't glamorous or exciting. It doesn't feel like a political triumph. But it's usually the most we can expect from our system of government, operating in a country as diverse and quarrelsome and free as ours.\n\nConsidering the injustice and cruelties inflicted by autocratic governments, and how corruptible human nature can be, the problem solving our system does make possible, the fitful progress it produces, and the liberty and justice it preserves, is a magnificent achievement.\n\nOur system doesn't depend on our nobility. It accounts for our imperfections, and gives an order to our individual strivings that has helped make ours the most powerful and prosperous society on earth. It is our responsibility to preserve that, even when it requires us to do something less satisfying than 'winning.' Even when we must give a little to get a little. Even when our efforts manage just three yards and a cloud of dust, while critics on both sides denounce us for timidity, for our failure to 'triumph.'\n\nI hope we can again rely on humility, on our need to cooperate, on our dependence on each other to learn how to trust each other again and by so doing better serve the people who elected us. Stop listening to the bombastic loudmouths on the radio and television and the Internet. To hell with them. They don't want anything done for the public good. Our incapacity is their livelihood.\n\nLet's trust each other. Let's return to regular order. We've been spinning our wheels on too many important issues because we keep trying to find a way to win without help from across the aisle. That's an approach that's been employed by both sides, mandating legislation from the top down, without any support from the other side, with all the parliamentary maneuvers that requires.\n\nWe're getting nothing done. All we've really done this year is confirm Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court. Our healthcare insurance system is a mess. We all know it, those who support Obamacare and those who oppose it. Something has to be done. We Republicans have looked for a way to end it and replace it with something else without paying a terrible political price. We haven't found it yet, and I'm not sure we will. All we've managed to do is make more popular a policy that wasn't very popular when we started trying to get rid of it.\n\nI voted for the motion to proceed to allow debate to continue and amendments to be offered. I will not vote for the bill as it is today. It's a shell of a bill right now. We all know that. I have changes urged by my state's governor that will have to be included to earn my support for final passage of any bill. I know many of you will have to see the bill changed substantially for you to support it.\n\nWe've tried to do this by coming up with a proposal behind closed doors in consultation with the administration, then springing it on skeptical members, trying to convince them it's better than nothing, asking us to swallow our doubts and force it past a unified opposition. I don't think that is going to work in the end. And it probably shouldn't.\n\nThe Obama administration and congressional Democrats shouldn't have forced through Congress without any opposition support a social and economic change as massive as Obamacare. And we shouldn't do the same with ours.\n\nWhy don't we try the old way of legislating in the Senate, the way our rules and customs encourage us to act. If this process ends in failure, which seem likely, then let's return to regular order.\n\nLet the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee under Chairman Alexander and Ranking Member Murray hold hearings, try to report a bill out of committee with contributions from both sides. Then bring it to the floor for amendment and debate, and see if we can pass something that will be imperfect, full of compromises, and not very pleasing to implacable partisans on either side, but that might provide workable solutions to problems Americans are struggling with today.\n\nWhat have we to lose by trying to work together to find those solutions? We're not getting much done apart. I don't think any of us feels very proud of our incapacity. Merely preventing your political opponents from doing what they want isn't the most inspiring work. There's greater satisfaction in respecting our differences, but not letting them prevent agreements that don't require abandonment of core principles, agreements made in good faith that help improve lives and protect the American people.\n\nThe Senate is capable of that. We know that. We've seen it before. I've seen it happen many times. And the times when I was involved even in a modest way with working out a bipartisan response to a national problem or threat are the proudest moments of my career, and by far the most satisfying.\n\nThis place is important. The work we do is important. Our strange rules and seemingly eccentric practices that slow our proceedings and insist on our cooperation are important. Our founders envisioned the Senate as the more deliberative, careful body that operates at a greater distance than the other body from the public passions of the hour.\n\nWe are an important check on the powers of the Executive. Our consent is necessary for the President to appoint jurists and powerful government officials and in many respects to conduct foreign policy. Whether or not we are of the same party, we are not the President's subordinates. We are his equal!\n\nAs his responsibilities are onerous, many and powerful, so are ours. And we play a vital role in shaping and directing the judiciary, the military, and the cabinet, in planning and supporting foreign and domestic policies. Our success in meeting all these awesome constitutional obligations depends on cooperation among ourselves.\n\nThe success of the Senate is important to the continued success of America. This country – this big, boisterous, brawling, intemperate, restless, striving, daring, beautiful, bountiful, brave, good and magnificent country – needs us to help it thrive. That responsibility is more important than any of our personal interests or political affiliations.\n\nWe are the servants of a great nation, 'a nation conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.' More people have lived free and prosperous lives here than in any other nation. We have acquired unprecedented wealth and power because of our governing principles, and because our government defended those principles.\n\nAmerica has made a greater contribution than any other nation to an international order that has liberated more people from tyranny and poverty than ever before in history. We have been the greatest example, the greatest supporter and the greatest defender of that order. We aren't afraid. We don't covet other people's land and wealth. We don't hide behind walls. We breach them. We are a blessing to humanity.\n\nWhat greater cause could we hope to serve than helping keep America the strong, aspiring, inspirational beacon of liberty and defender of the dignity of all human beings and their right to freedom and equal justice? That is the cause that binds us and is so much more powerful and worthy than the small differences that divide us.\n\nWhat a great honor and extraordinary opportunity it is to serve in this body.\n\nIt's a privilege to serve with all of you. I mean it. Many of you have reached out in the last few days with your concern and your prayers, and it means a lot to me. It really does. I've had so many people say such nice things about me recently that I think some of you must have me confused with someone else. I appreciate it though, every word, even if much of it isn't deserved.\n\nI'll be here for a few days, I hope managing the floor debate on the defense authorization bill, which, I'm proud to say is again a product of bipartisan cooperation and trust among the members of the Senate Armed Services Committee.\n\nAfter that, I'm going home for a while to treat my illness. I have every intention of returning here and giving many of you cause to regret all the nice things you said about me. And, I hope, to impress on you again that it is an honor to serve the American people in your company.\n\nThank you, fellow senators.\n\nMr. President, I yield the floor.\n\nEditor's note: The original transcript posted on this story has been replaced with remarks provided by Sen. McCain's office.
New Democratic Senate Leader Vows To Hold 'Donald Trump's Feet To The Fire'\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n\nDonald Trump is still two weeks from his presidential inauguration, but new Democratic Senate leader Chuck Schumer sounds ready to do battle with a Republican-controlled Senate, House and White House.\n\nWe're going to hold Donald Trump's feet to the fire, the New York Democrat told NPR's Audie Cornish on All Things Considered while sitting in front of the fireplace near his desk. Our job is going to be to hold Donald Trump and the Republican majority accountable.\n\nWe're going to hold Donald Trump's feet to the fire. Our job is going to be to hold Donald Trump and the Republican majority accountable.\n\nSchumer hasn't quite moved into his suite of Capitol offices. Boxes are heaped in corridors and naked hooks poke from the walls of Schumer's ornate chambers on the second floor. Just outside the windows is the inaugural podium being built and beyond it, the National Mall.\n\nInside, amid the clutter, the new Senate minority leader is wasting no time defending Democratic policies and programs from the incoming administration and its congressional allies, even if he has less leverage than he had hoped to have.\n\nSchumer hinted at the Democrats' relatively weak position, as Republicans move quickly to repeal Obamacare. He repeatedly said Democrats would not cooperate with any Affordable Care Act replacement if the GOP pushes ahead with repeal, but then allowed that there might be a thing or two in competing Republican plans he finds appealing.\n\nHe also brought negotiations into the open by putting public pressure on GOP senators from Maine and Alaska to vote against repeal.\n\nNow they want to eliminate the funding of Planned Parenthood, he said, referring to a plan by House Speaker Paul Ryan to include such provisions in legislation undoing Obamacare, so people like Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski are having some qualms about this.\n\nSchumer hinted at some of the legislative maneuvers Democrats may employ to stymie Obamacare repeal.\n\nWe'll have an amendment on the floor of the Senate, as we debate ACA, he explained, that quotes Donald Trump and says we're opposed to cutting health care — Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security for that matter.\n\nI was the first & only potential GOP candidate to state there will be no cuts to Social Security, Medicare & Medicaid. Huckabee copied me. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 7, 2015\n\nBefore his intelligence briefing today, the president-elect told the New York Times that the attention devoted to Russian attempts to influence the election is a political witch hunt.\n\nSchumer called that flip and glib.\n\nBefore you even get the briefing, you come to a conclusion — that's not the way to govern, he said. And I have said ... that we can't have a Twitter presidency. This is serious stuff, this governing, and to just be flip and glib and tweet ... you've got to do a lot more. And certainly any president — Democrat, Republican, liberal, conservative — should keep an open mind until they get the briefing.\n\nSchumer also responded to Trump's calling him a clown.\n\nThe Democrats, lead by head clown Chuck Schumer, know how bad ObamaCare is and what a mess they are in. Instead of working to fix it, they.. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 5, 2017\n\nI didn't tweet back a name — that's derogating the debate, Schumer said. I said I understand your anguish, Mr. President-elect, because you don't know what to replace the ACA with. But instead of calling names, roll up your sleeves and come up with a replacement. So I'm not going to descend to name-calling.
Democrat Nancy Pelosi Poised To Become House Speaker Once Again\n\nA small group of House Democrats insist they have the votes to derail Rep. Nancy Pelosi from being confirmed as House speaker. Pelosi is confident and her record as a deal-maker is a central reason.\n\nAUDIE CORNISH, HOST:\n\nNow that Democrats have retaken the House, Nancy Pelosi is poised to become speaker once again, though she faces some opposition from her own party. Her specter as a San Francisco liberal has been fuel for Republican campaign ads. Among Democrats, some say it's time for new blood. Today a group of 16 current and incoming House Democrats released a letter vowing to oppose her bid. But for now, no Democrat is running against Pelosi for speaker, and her legacy as an expert legislator and fundraiser remains. NPR's Scott Detrow joined me to talk through that legacy starting with her rise to speaker.\n\nSCOTT DETROW, BYLINE: She got into politics a little later in life, once her children were older. She worked her way up through the Democratic Party of California, chairing the party there before eventually running for Congress. She worked on several committees - the appropriations committee, the intelligence committee. But by and large, Nancy Pelosi's main path to power in the Democratic Party was being an excellent fundraiser and, once she made her way into Democratic leadership, being able to focus the party on specific messaging.\n\nCORNISH: And then the Dems take the House in 2006, and she officially becomes speaker, which was a big moment.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nUNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: The honorable Nancy Pelosi of the state of California is duly elected speaker of the House of Representatives.\n\nDETROW: When Nancy Pelosi was handed the gavel, she said, all the children in the chamber - because people's families were with them on the House floor - she invited them all up.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nNANCY PELOSI: I wanted to invite as many of them who wanted to come forward to come join me up here.\n\nDETROW: So it's this really iconic image of Nancy Pelosi standing in the front of the House, holding the gavel for the first time, surrounded by children.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nPELOSI: Let's hear it for the children. We're here for the children.\n\nDETROW: And I think a lot of people remember that moment where Pelosi took control.\n\nCORNISH: And her first major challenge is the financial crisis of 2008.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nUNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: The Dow tumbled more than 500 points after two pillars of the Street tumbled over the weekend.\n\nCORNISH: George W. Bush is still president. But you have all these lawmakers coming together to create a bailout package. What is the image of Pelosi at that time? What is her role in that story?\n\nDETROW: Yeah, this was this big piece of legislation, billions of dollars to financial institutions - incredibly unpopular idea. But the argument was this is absolutely necessary to hold up the global economy. There were all of these tense meetings at the White House and Capitol Hill where you had George W. Bush, his Treasury secretary, Nancy Pelosi, other congressional leaders all sitting around the table, figuring out what to do next. You may remember the first time that TARP came up for a vote on the House floor, it failed.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nUNIDENTIFIED PERSON #3: Democrats and Republicans trudged to the House floor, united in their contempt for the $700 billion bailout.\n\nDETROW: And there were split-screens everywhere of the vote going down and stock tickers plummeting at the same time.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nUNIDENTIFIED PERSON #4: If this holds, this will be the single largest point drop in the market's history in the year.\n\nDETROW: Pelosi got Democrats in line to vote for that bill the second time around because it was going to save the economy.\n\nCORNISH: Right. And she basically does it again, this time under a Democratic president, President Barack Obama in 2009.\n\nDETROW: That's right - a whole bunch of early financial bills that really weren't popular, the stimulus package. There was the auto bailout during this period as well. And a lot of voters said, why are we spending this money? But Pelosi was able to wrangle all the votes and also spend a ton of political capital to get these things passed that supporters believed was really propping everything up.\n\nCORNISH: And Nancy Pelosi also had a big hand in another major Obama administration effort, and that was the Affordable Care Act. Talk about how Nancy Pelosi played a role there, why she's remembered for it.\n\nDETROW: Right. Let's go back in time to 2009.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nBARACK OBAMA: Health care reform cannot wait. It must not wait, and it will not wait another year.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nDETROW: On one hand, Democrats in the House and Senate have enormous majorities, majorities that they have not had at any point since then. But on the other side, we just talked about all the political capital that Democrats have had to already spend on passing unpopular things like bailouts. The economy was still a mess. And on top of all that, health care is just incredibly complicated to pass. So as this process dragged on throughout 2009 into 2010, there were so many moments where it looked like it was just going to fall apart. And Pelosi repeatedly argued with the Obama White House, argued with other Democratic leaders that they needed to stick to it.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nPELOSI: We go through the gate. If the gate's closed, we'll go over the fence. The fence is too high, we'll pole vault in. If that doesn't work, we'll parachute in. But we're going to get health care reform passed.\n\nDETROW: And she was ultimately able to twist enough arms to keep enough Democrats in line to get this bill to pass the House by the narrowest of margins.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nPELOSI: The yeas are 220. The nays are 215. The bill is passed.\n\n(CHEERING)\n\nDETROW: President Obama ultimately signs it into law.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nOBAMA: And we have now just enshrined, as soon as I sign this bill, the core principle that everybody should have some basic security when it comes to their health care.\n\nDETROW: It was a huge moment at the time. And I think it's even larger now because you look at all of the different things that Obama was able to accomplish that have been scaled back or reversed by President Trump. Obamacare clearly at this point is here to stay.\n\nCORNISH: All this has essentially made her a political target. Can you talk about how that plays out in campaigns and elections, how she responds to it?\n\nDETROW: Sure. There's a couple different fronts that Pelosi has to fight on. First of all, there's the way that Republicans frame her. She is by and large their favorite face of the Democratic Party. She stars in ad after ad after ad.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF MONTAGE)\n\nUNIDENTIFIED PERSON #5: Amy McGrath is a Nancy Pelosi liberal.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED PERSON #6: In Washington, Feagan (ph) would vote with Pelosi for open borders and end...\n\nUNIDENTIFIED PERSON #7: Nancy Pelosi's trying to impose her values on Virginia and take us backward.\n\nDETROW: That's why so many Democratic candidates promised not to vote for her. It was a way to neuter those attacks. Here's the other challenge that Pelosi faces. She's been a leader for a long time. By and large, most of the House Democratic leaders have been the same group of people for more than a decade at this point. That creates a backlog and a lot of frustration for House Democrats.\n\nMarcia Fudge of Ohio is one of the Democrats who are trying to get a different speaker elected. She said there's just not room for Democrats to grow. And you've seen a lot of promising House Democrats viewed as future leaders like Chris Van Hollen of Maryland decide to just run for Senate or go back to their home states and run for attorney general or do something else because they just don't see any path forward within the House Democratic Party.\n\nCORNISH: And then of course this past election night was a big win for House Democrats.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nPELOSI: Thanks to you, tomorrow will be a new day in America.\n\nCORNISH: And people are talking about whether or not Nancy Pelosi will be speaker again.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nUNIDENTIFIED CROWD: (Chanting) Speaker, speaker, speaker.\n\nDETROW: I think it's fair to say that this is the toughest challenge that Pelosi has faced at this point. One reason is because of all of those first-time candidates who had promised not to vote for her in order to get elected. But here's the best thing she has going for her. Nobody has stepped forward to run against her. She has a lot of people organizing to block her from getting the votes she needs to be elected on the House floor, but there's no alternative. And it's pretty hard to take down anyone, let alone somebody who's been in power as long as Pelosi has, without a viable alternative.\n\nAnd I think the fact that no Democrat has stepped forward to challenge her shows just how much control she has over the House Democratic Caucus - who gets appointed to what, who gets helped out with fundraising, who is put in a position to get bills passed with their name on it to help them run for re-election.\n\nCORNISH: That's NPR's Scott Detrow.

What Older Arizona Voters Are Looking For Ahead Of The November Election\n\nLULU GARCIA-NAVARRO, HOST:\n\nAs America gets older, so does its electorate. Nearly 1 in 4 voters this cycle will be 65 or older. That's the highest level for at least half a century. President Trump won that group in 2016, but new polls show his support may have eroded. As part of our series where we talk to members of key voting blocs in key states, we go now to Arizona and the retirement communities of Sun City. Marsha McGovern is the president of the Sun City Democratic Club.\n\nWelcome to you.\n\nMARSHA MCGOVERN: Hello.\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: Frank Rizzo is the president of the Sun City Grand Republican Club.\n\nWelcome to you.\n\nFRANK RIZZO: Good morning.\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: And Susan Lydon lives in Sun City.\n\nWelcome to you.\n\nSUSAN LYDON: Thank you.\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: Marsha, I'm going to start with you. You're 77. You've been heading the Democratic Club for a while now. Are you seeing a shift in some voters, as has been suggested by the polls?\n\nMCGOVERN: Oh, my goodness. In 2016, our club had about 100 members. Now we have 300 active members.\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: And when they get involved, what do they say is motivating them?\n\nMCGOVERN: What really bothers us is the way he's handled the coronavirus. It's contributed to over 200,000 American lives being lost and tens of millions of jobs being lost. And it has caused harm to our children's future by abandoning and deregulating environmental programs.\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: Frank, you're 74 years old. We heard Marsha there saying that there's been enthusiasm on the Democratic side. And I'm curious to see if you've seen perhaps some people changing their views or opinions.\n\nRIZZO: Absolutely. It's going the other way. Our population has increased as far as Trump supporters by threefold at least. When they say he's responsible for 200,000 lives - so somebody else would've had no lives lost - that's ridiculous to think about. Our people aren't really concerned with that. We're concerned about things in government, such as the violence that's going on and it's not being rebuked, the health care issue, trying to get a single-payer system which would eliminate competition. The coronavirus is something that is there. When it arrives, it does take down its population, and then it recedes for a while.\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: Susan, I'm going to bring you in now. You're 69. Polls show that women in your age cohort are less likely to support Trump. You were Republican, but you are voting now Democratic. Why?\n\nLYDON: I could not get behind Trump from the very beginning. My biggest issues were his representation of his business acumen, where he had filed bankruptcy with his various companies about half a dozen times. My background was as a commercial loan officer in a bank, so there was no way I could support somebody with that kind of financial background. In addition, I had issues from the very beginning about the way he treated women and the way he talked about women. The way that the Republicans have got behind all of the issues that I have problems with Trump have led me to say the Republican Party is no longer for me.\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: Frank, when you look at the country as it stands right now, what do you think four more years will bring that you want to see happen in the United States?\n\nRIZZO: Well, all this stuff about him womanizing and things like this - you know, when he was a rich bachelor, that's one thing. But I voted for a president that could get us out of the hole we were in. So from my perspective, he's done everything right up to the point when the coronavirus attacked everybody. Now, I agree that the coronavirus is deadly, but it's more deadly to shut down our economy. We'll become a third-world nation.\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: Marsha, let me ask you this. An Arizona poll done by the AARP showed that 90% of older Arizonans said protecting Social Security and 88% said strengthening Medicare are important priorities. How do you rate the two candidates on issues of health care? And how important is that particular issue to you?\n\nMCGOVERN: Well, health care is one of my top issues after coronavirus because health care should not be tied to employment. We need to strengthen and improve the ACA, and we need to get to universal coverage through a public option which is managed by the Center for Medicare and Medicare Services (ph). We have to decrease the cost of prescription drugs, and we have to have transparency. We cannot have a free market health care system without transparency.\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: Frank, are you on Medicare? What are your thoughts on it? And then I'm going to bring in Susan afterwards to see what you think about this issue.\n\nRIZZO: Well, yes, I am on Medicare, and I have a supplemental. I have several chronic diseases - for instance, diabetes. My insulin is extremely expensive. But the president and Senator McSally have brought down the insulin by about 600% for me. And I have so many friends that have been on Obamacare, and several of them have had to give it up because it was too expensive. I mean, I've seen real life with Obamacare, and I just can't - I can't go along with it.\n\nLYDON: I had a completely different experience with Obamacare. I wound up retiring when I was 60. Six months later, I had to get a pacemaker. I now had a preexisting condition that I could not get reasonable medical insurance at all. The only thing available to me prior to Obamacare was a $50,000 limit on a medical policy. And at that, I was paying hundreds of dollars a month for it. Obamacare saved me from having to go back to work just to get insurance.\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: We do have two candidates who are in their 70s, and there's been a lot of discussion about their age. And I would like to hear your thoughts on that as a member of their same generation. I'm going to start with you, Susan, then Marsha, then Frank.\n\nLYDON: Both candidates are older than I would like to see. I would prefer to see younger. And that is part of my support of the Democratic ticket - is that Senator Harris way outshines Vice President Pence as a possible fallback for either of these candidates.\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: All right. Marsha.\n\nMCGOVERN: Well, I think age is a number, but you have to look at the individual. There are some 60-year-olds who are very old and could not handle the job. There are some 80-year-olds that are probably fit as a fiddle and could handle the job. And I think it's wonderful that the Democratic vice president is young, vibrant, articulate, sparkly, warm. She could quickly and efficiently step into the job.\n\nRIZZO: Kamala Harris, to me, is very much a fanatic. I'm sure if Joe Biden gets in, they're going to - right now, they're talking about the 25th Amendment. They will push that on Biden in order to get Kamala Harris in, and that would be the total destruction of the country. Just look at what she did in California.\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: Does Trump's age worry you?\n\nRIZZO: Well, both of their ages. But he's a pretty dynamic person. And what do they say? The - 70 is the new 50. And I believe that because you're only as old as you act.\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: So listening to you, you live in the same community or at least in the same general area - very different political views. And I'm wondering how heated it's been there with you in your communities. Are you having frank discussions with your neighbors who might have a different opinion, or are you basically sticking to people who might see things the same as you? Susan, then Marsha, then Frank.\n\nLYDON: Until the last five or six years, I always felt that I could listen to the other side, and they could listen to me. And we would have to agree to disagree. Now it's gotten so polarized that I'm afraid to say anything other than to the people that I know have the same opinion I do. That's not good for our democracy at all.\n\nMCGOVERN: A cute story, I think, is when I first met Susan. It was in a book club. And I knew that she was a Republican, or at least that's what I was told. And so I was very careful. I listened to what she had to say, and I scoped her out. And I think that's good. I think we should be careful and respectful of other people's views.\n\nBut when social distancing and wearing of a mask become a political statement, that's terrifying. It should not be that way. So this year, instead of hiding behind my Democratic affiliations, I boldly put out a Biden/Harris flag under my eaves of my condo. And wouldn't you know it that the secretary treasurer of our condo association, who I was convinced was a Republican and even a Trumper, came up to me and said, thank you for putting up the flag. I usually vote Republican, but I'm voting for Biden now. So I thought, you never know. Your boldness might enable others to be bold. And it might - and, you know, it might create a dialogue.\n\nRIZZO: Yeah, that's pretty interesting. Here in Sun City Grand, they've been stealing Trump signs all over the community. And when caught, they go crazy. So, you know, I've seen this division go for many, many years. One of the reasons I could never have voted for Hillary Clinton is because of Benghazi. I used to be a Democrat quite a while ago. Now, it - they've gotten diametrically opposed and way to the extreme on both sides. So do I want to extremely be a Democrat or extremely be a Republican? There's no question that I'll be on the Republican side for that.\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: Well, I appreciate all three of you expressing your opinions. We deeply appreciate your time. That was Frank Rizzo, Marsha McGovern and Susan Lydon.\n\nThank you all.\n\nRIZZO: Thank you.\n\nMCGOVERN: Thank you.\n\nLYDON: Thank you.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF MODESELEKTOR AND THOM YORKE SONG, SHIPWRECK)\n\nCopyright © 2020 NPR.

Marco Rubio Reverses Course, Will Run For Re-Election To Senate\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Alan Diaz/AP Alan Diaz/AP\n\nFlorida Sen. Marco Rubio has changed his mind and will indeed run for re-election to the U.S. Senate.\n\nIt's a big departure for the former presidential candidate, who had repeatedly maintained that there was no Plan B if his campaign for the presidency did not work out. Even after withdrawing from the White House contest in March, Rubio continued to insist he was not going to run again and even mocked such insinuations that he would reverse course.\n\nBut on Wednesday, Rubio did just that. In a statement, he admitted it was a puzzling turn of course.\n\nIn politics, admitting you've changed your mind is not something most people like to do. But here it goes, Rubio said. I have decided to seek reelection to the United States Senate. I understand my opponents will try to use this decision to score political points against me. Have at it. Because I have never claimed to be perfect, or to have all the answers.\n\nRubio continued that he he felt a sense of duty to run again given the current presidential race — even though he has reluctantly endorsed presumptive GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump, who mocked him mercilessly throughout the race:\n\nNo matter who is elected president, there is reason for worry. With Hillary Clinton, we would have four more years of the same failed economic policies that have left us with a stagnant economy. We would have four more years of the same failed foreign policy that has allowed radical Islam to spread, and terrorists to be released from Guantanamo. And even worse, if Clinton were president and her party took control of Congress, she would govern without Congressional oversight or limit. It would be a repeat of the early years of the current administration, when we got Obamacare, the failed stimulus and a record debt. The prospect of a Trump presidency is also worrisome to me. It is no secret that I have significant disagreements with Donald Trump. His positions on many key issues are still unknown. And some of his statements, especially about women and minorities, I find not just offensive but unacceptable. If he is elected, we will need Senators willing to encourage him in the right direction, and if necessary, stand up to him. I've proven a willingness to do both.\n\nRubio admitted that the Senate can be a frustrating place — something he reiterated during his presidential campaign, and he was frequently hit for often missing votes.\n\nBut the Senate is also a place from which you can perform great services for the people you have the honor of representing. And I am proud of the work we have done to help thousands of Floridians over the last six years, Rubio said. The Senate can also be a place from which great policy advances can be made. I am proud that we have done that too.\n\nRubio's decision helps national Republicans in a critical seat they need to maintain their slim Senate majority. A recent poll showed the incumbent leading his possible Democratic challengers, while other Republican candidates trailed.\n\nHe abandoned the people of Florida and showed himself to be nothing but an opportunistic career politician. Today's news only confirms that further.\n\nThe August GOP primary to replace Rubio was highly unsettled among several candidates, and some are stepping aside for Rubio. Rep. David Jolly had already withdrawn to run for a competitive House seat against former Gov. Charlie Crist. Lt. Gov. Carlos Lopez-Cantera, a close friend of Rubio's, also stepped aside shortly after Rubio's announcement, and Rep. Ron DeSantis said he would now run for re-election to the House instead.\n\nBut two other Republicans have indicated they have plans to withdraw. Carlos Beruff, a self-financing wealthy homebuilder who has drawn comparisons to Trump, said in a statement after Rubio's announcement that voters needed someone with his real world experience and said earlier this week he will put in $10 to $15 million of his own money to defeat Rubio.\n\n\n\nThis isn't Marco Rubio's seat; this is Florida's seat. The power brokers in Washington think they can control this race. They think they can tell the voters of Florida who their candidates are. But the voters of Florida will not obey them, Beruff said. Like Marco Rubio in 2010, I'm not going to back down from the Washington establishment. They are the problem, not the solution.\n\nDefense contractor Todd Wilcox, who was also prepared to reach deep into his own pockets to fund his campaign, told the Tampa Bay Times last week he'd also stay in the race.\n\nBoth Wilcox and Beruff pointed to Rubio's poor performance in the GOP presidential primary as evidence that he was vulnerable, and he will have to hustle to fundraiser before the August 30 contest. Rubio, however, remains the heavy favorite, and the two challengers could actually split any anti-Rubio vote.\n\nNational Republican Senatorial Committee Chairman Roger Wicker, R-Miss., however, announced that Rubio would have the full support of the NRSC.\n\nWhile Marco is already in a strong position to win, Democrats are currently locked in a bruising primary that will produce a weak nominee and cost millions of dollars, Wicker said in a statement.\n\nDemocrats, indeed, have a messy primary themselves. National Democrats support moderate Rep. Patrick Murphy, who they believe is the best general election nominee. But liberal firebrand Alan Grayson, currently under ethics investigation over involvement with an off-shore hedge fund, has a strong following as well, and his nomination would give Democrats a massive headache.\n\nFlorida Democrats pointed out that Rubio was crushed by Trump in the GOP primary earlier this year, and predicted that he would, indeed, be a private citizen in January of 2017 as he had previously wished.\n\nRubio lost 66 of 67 counties in March because he abandoned the people of Florida and showed himself to be nothing but an opportunistic career politician. Today's news only confirms that further, Florida Democratic Party Chairwoman Allison Tant said in a statement.
Religious Objectors V. Birth Control Back At Supreme Court\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Jacquelyn Martin/AP Jacquelyn Martin/AP\n\nThe birth-control wars return to the Supreme Court Wednesday, and it is likely that the five-justice conservative majority will make it more difficult for women to get birth control if they work for religiously affiliated institutions like hospitals, charities and universities.\n\nAt issue in the case is a Trump administration rule that significantly cuts back on access to birth control under the Affordable Care Act. Obamacare, the massive overhaul of the health care system, sought to equalize preventive health care coverage for women and men by requiring employers to include free birth control in their health care plans.\n\nListen to the arguments live beginning at 10 a.m. ET.\n\nHouses of worship like churches and synagogues were automatically exempted from the provision, but religiously affiliated nonprofits like universities, charities and hospitals were not. Such organizations employ millions of people, many of whom want access to birth control for themselves and their family members. But many of these institutions say they have a religious objection to providing birth control for employees.\n\nFor these nonprofits, the Obama administration enacted rules providing a work-around to accommodate employers' religious objections. The workaround was that an employer was to notify the government, or the insurance company, or the plan administrator, that, for religious reasons, it would not be providing birth-control coverage to its employees. Then, the insurance company could provide free birth-control options to individual employees separately from the employer's plan.\n\nBut some religiously affiliated groups still objected, saying the work-around was not good enough, and sued. They contended that signing an opt-out form amounted to authorizing the use of their plan for birth control. Among those objectors was the Little Sisters of the Poor, an order of Catholic nuns that runs homes for the elderly poor.\n\nThe Supreme Court punted in 2016\n\nThe Little Sisters sued, and their case first reached the Supreme Court in 2016. At the time, Sister Constance Viet explained why she refused to sign any opt-out form, saying that the religious burden is what that signifies and the fact that the government would ... be inserting services that we object into our plan. And it would still carry our name.\n\nBack then, when the Little Sisters' case got to the Supreme Court, the justices basically punted, telling the government and the sisters to work together to try to reach a compromise that would still provide seamless birth control coverage for employees who want it, without burdening the Sisters' religious beliefs. Although the Little Sisters did eventually get relief from the lower courts, the fight over the accommodations rules continued right up to the end of the Obama administration.\n\nBut when President Trump came into office, the administration issued new rules that would give broad exemptions to nonprofits and some for-profit companies that have objections to providing birth-control coverage for their employees. And the new rules expanded the category of employers who would be exempt from the birth-control mandate to include not just those with religious objections, but those with moral objections, too.\n\nNew rules\n\nThose new rules, currently blocked by lower courts, are what is at issue Wednesday in the Supreme Court.\n\nMany states are suing and none of them can find a single actual woman who claims she's been harmed, says Mark Reinezi, president of the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, which is defending the Trump rules against challenges brought by Pennsylvania and other states.\n\nAnd, he adds, there are many other ways to provide contraceptive coverage to people if they happen to work for religious objectors.\n\nRienzi says that employees who work for birth-control objectors can get coverage from their spouse's insurance plan, or by switching to a different insurance plan on an Obamacare exchange. And he says that birth control is also available under a program known as Title X, which gives money to state and local governments to provide health care for women.\n\nBut Brigitte Amiri, the deputy director the of ACLU's Reproductive Freedom project, says the idea that Title X could make up for the lost coverage is a joke. Amiri notes that the Title X program has been underfunded for years, and the Trump administration has issued new regulations that in her words decimated the program.\n\nAccording to Amiri, the Trump administration and Vice President [Mike] Pence have long wanted to ... take away coverage for contraception. They want to block access to birth control. They want to block access to abortion ... so this is all part and parcel of the overall attack on access to reproductive health care.\n\nPotential consequences\n\nShe maintains that if the expanded Trump rules are upheld for religious objectors, hundreds of thousands of women across the country will lose their contraceptive coverage. Ultimately, Amiri says, there just is no way to maintain birth-control coverage for employees who work for religiously affiliated institutions unless that employer, as she puts it, is willing to raise their hand to opt out.\n\nA break in birth-control coverage that big could have serious consequences, say say birth-control advocates. They note that the National Academy of Medicine, a health policy nonprofit, recommended the original rules because birth control is prescribed not just to avoid pregnancy but also to treat various female medical conditions. In fact, it is the most frequently taken drug for women ages 15-60. And it is expensive, $30 a month and more for pills, and as much as $1,000 for buying and having an IUD inserted.\n\nBirth-control advocates say that's the very reason that a broad requirement to cover birth control in insurance was included in Obamacare. They say the new Trump rule improperly undermines that mandate.\n\nBut selling that argument to the Supreme Court will be hard. When the court last considered this issue in 2016, its makeup was far less conservative than it is now. Since then, two Trump appointees have been added to the court. And both of those appointees — Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh — have already indicated strong support for the notion that religious rights may often trump other rights.
Only 26 Percent Of Americans Support Full Repeal Of Obamacare, Poll Finds\n\nAmericans continue to be divided along partisan lines over Obamacare, with an overwhelming percentage of Democrats favoring it and an equal share of Republicans having unfavorable views, according to a newly released Kaiser Family Foundation poll.\n\nBut when it comes to an actual gutting of Obamacare, there's doesn't appear to be a lot of support.\n\nOne-fourth, or 26 percent, of Americans favor a full repeal of the health care law, while 17 percent say scale it back, according to the Kaiser poll. On the other hand, 30 percent favor expanding the law and another 19 percent want lawmakers to move forward with the law as it is.\n\nThe poll was conducted one week after the 2016 presidential election. In its aftermath, President-elect Donald Trump and Republican lawmakers have signaled their intention to follow through on their campaign promise to repeal President Obama's landmark health care legislation. Republican lawmakers have voted to repeal Obamacare dozens of times.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Susan Walsh/AP Susan Walsh/AP\n\nBut the Kaiser survey indicates that there's been a decline in the percentage of Republicans who want to see the law repealed just since October. In that month, 69 percent of GOPers said they favored repealing the entire law. A month later, once it was clear that the GOP would be in control of the health care debate, just 52 percent of Republicans said the law should be repealed.\n\nSimilarly, in October, just 11 percent of Republicans said they wanted the law scaled back but not eliminated. In November, that percentage increased to 24 percent.\n\nThe poll also indicates that among those who want to see Obamacare repealed, only a third don't want a replacement. Two-thirds want to see it replaced by a Republican alternative. There are reports that the GOP may seek an immediate repeal of the law and wait years before settling on a replacement.\n\nOverall, the survey finds that some key provisions of Obamacare are very popular among Democrats and Republicans. For example, 85 percent favor keeping young adults on their parents' insurance plan until age 26. Sixty-nine percent like the prohibitions on insurance companies denying coverage based on pre-existing conditions.\n\nThe most unpopular feature of Obamacare? Only 35 percent favor the individual mandate requiring all people to sign up for health insurance or pay a fine.
Trump May Be Spoiling For A Shutdown Fight, But It Could Spell Disaster In 2018\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Pool/Getty Images Pool/Getty Images\n\nThe White House and Congress reached a deal last week to keep the government open — at least until this fall.\n\nBut in reality, the compromise may well have just kicked the can down the road until September, when both sides may be spoiling for a fight amid the specter of a government shutdown.\n\nThe spending bill didn't give President Trump or congressional Republicans and Democrats everything they wanted. The GOP got more defense spending, while some agencies whose funding the White House had wanted to cut, such as the National Institutes of Health, actually got a boost.\n\nBut the absence of some of the president's major priorities — namely his highly touted border wall — led Trump to take to Twitter to hint that in five months, he may not be in such a conciliatory mood. Our country needs a good 'shutdown' in September to fix mess! he tweeted.\n\nOn Sunday, White House Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney didn't knock down that threat on CBS's Face the Nation:\n\nWhat we just did this week was fine and passable but not ideal. The appropriations, the spending process, Congress using the power of the purse has been broken here in Washington for more than 10 years. And I think a good shutdown would be one that could help fix that. It's part of that overall drain-the-swamp mentality about Washington, D.C. This president is willing to think outside the box and do things differently around here in order to change Washington. And if that comes to a shutdown in September, so be it.\n\nA good shutdown?\n\nThat not-so-veiled threat from the president and his staff is likely to give many Republicans the beginnings of heartburn. The last time the government shuttered, in October 2013, polls showed that it was the GOP that shouldered the brunt of the public's blame after a 16-day fiscal standoff over funding for the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare.\n\nAn NBC/Wall Street Journal survey during the shutdown showed that voters blamed Republicans over then-President Barack Obama by a 22-point margin — a worse outcome for the GOP than during the 1995 and 1996 shutdowns.\n\nAfter the government reopened, an ABC News/Washington Post poll found that Americans blamed Republicans instead of Obama by 24 points. And the GOP's approval rating took a bruising hit, too. According to Gallup, the party's rating hit record lows in the wake of the shutdown, dropping to a 28 percent favorable rating.\n\nThe government shutdown in October 2013 gave the Republican Party a huge hit from which it took more than a year to recover, said veteran GOP pollster Whit Ayres. The drop in the Republican Party's favorable rating was dramatic. We were fortunate that we had a year to repair the damage.\n\nLooking back, it may seem as if there were few electoral consequences for Republicans as they went on to win victories in the 2014 midterms, including winning back the Senate.\n\nBut the shutdown also happened at the same time as the disastrous rollout of the HealthCare.gov website. While that got overshadowed temporarily amid the shutdown, the midterms eventually returned to being a referendum on Obama and his policies — an electoral savior for the GOP.\n\nIf a shutdown happens again, it's Republicans who are in sole control of both the White House and Congress. And now they have a president whose approval ratings are at historic lows after his first 100 days in office and who energizes the Democratic base in a way that could prove incredibly problematic for the GOP in 2018.\n\nA president's first midterm elections is usually a referendum on his tenure so far, and historically, a president's party has almost always lost seats — an average of 29, as NPR's Domenico Montanaro pointed out last month. Coupled with backlash the GOP is already feeling against its health care bill and the historical trends against the party, adding a shutdown on top of that could be catastrophic.\n\nMost of the wisdom of pollsters comes from looking at history of past actions, and all the history of the last government shutdown suggests that it was very bad news for Republicans, said Ayres. There's no reason to think that the result will be any different in the future, especially since we control the entire government.\n\nWhat's on the table?\n\nEven without the threat of a stalemate looming over the talks, the list of things Congress and the White House have to agree on is substantial.\n\nAs Politico noted, the Sept. 30 deadline is likely to coincide with a needed vote to raise the debt ceiling, in addition to reauthorizing the Federal Aviation Administration law, the children's health insurance program and federal flood insurance.\n\nThe White House will release its full budget later this month, which is sure to include more of the priorities Trump formally laid out in March in his initial fiscal year 2018 blueprint. In the recent spending bill, the president got an increase in defense spending — though only about half of what he wanted — but the domestic spending cuts he had sought didn't happen this time around.\n\nIn five months, it's unclear how much political capital the White House will have to try to engage in those fights and how the health care bill — if it passes the Senate — might factor into that.\n\nBut the president will be wanting a win on his spending priorities, looking to fulfill his campaign promises not just to build the border wall but also to drain the swamp. While a shutdown may be cheered by his base as a way to stick it to Washington, the implications could be far-reaching and imperil the rest of Trump's first term if it causes significant backlash in the 2018 midterms.

Trump Announces Amy Coney Barrett As His Supreme Court Nominee\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Olivier Douliery/AFP via Getty Images Olivier Douliery/AFP via Getty Images\n\nUpdated at 6:20 p.m. ET\n\nPresident Trump says he will nominate Judge Amy Coney Barrett to succeed the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg on the U.S. Supreme Court, spurring what's likely to be a bitter confirmation fight just weeks before the presidential election.\n\nIf confirmed by the Senate, the 48-year-old judge will solidify the court's conservative majority, shaping the trajectory of health care law, abortion rights and many corners of American life for generations to come.\n\nFrom a White House Rose Garden draped with flags, Trump called nominating a Supreme Court justice one of the most important duties of his office and praised Barrett as a one of our nation's most brilliant legal minds.\n\nCheers rippled through the crowd of about 200 people when Trump finally said Barrett's name.\n\nThis should be a straightforward and prompt confirmation, Trump said. Should be very easy. Good luck. It's going to be very quick. I'm sure it will be extremely noncontroversial. We said that the last time, didn't we?\n\n(Justice Brett Kavanaugh, Trump's previous Supreme Court nominee, was subjected to extra scrutiny by the public and Senate Democrats because of a sexual assault allegation.)\n\nBarrett began her speech acknowledging the shoes she is being asked to fill, calling Ginsburg a woman of enormous talent and consequence who not only cracked, but smashed glass ceilings and won the admiration of women around the world.\n\nThe judge said she has been inspired by Ginsburg's close relationship with Antonin Scalia, the late conservative justice for whom Barrett once clerked.\n\nHis judicial philosophy is mine, too, Barrett said as Scalia's wife and son looked on from the audience. A judge must apply the law as written. Judges are not policymakers and they must be resolute in setting aside any policy views they might hold.\n\nIn introducing his nominee, Trump linked the weight of a Supreme Court appointment with a message he touts on the campaign trail, calling law and order the foundation of the U.S. justice system.\n\nThe stakes for our country are incredibly high, Trump said. Rulings that the Supreme Court will issue in the coming years will decide the survival of our Second Amendment, our religious liberty, our public safety and so much more. To maintain security, liberty and prosperity, we must maintain our priceless heritage of a nation of laws and there is no one better to do that than Amy Coney Barrett.\n\nBarrett also introduced her husband and seven children, who were seated in the audience, joking that it makes sense that Trump is nominating her to join a bench of nine justices.\n\nAs it happens, I'm used to being in a group of nine: my family, Barrett said, telling the audience that in addition to federal judge, she wears other hats: carpool driver, birthday party planner and, recently, teacher, as her children attend school remotely because of the pandemic.\n\nBarrett also seemed to acknowledge the charged political moment she's stepping into, saying she has no illusions that the road ahead for me will be easy.\n\nThe president has nominated me to serve on the United States Supreme Court, and that institution belongs to all of us. If confirmed, I would not assume that role for the sake of those in my own circle and certainly not for my own sake. I would assume this role to serve you. I would discharge the judicial oath, which requires me to administer justice without respect to persons, do equal right to the poor and rich, and faithfully and impartially discharge my duties under the United States Constitution.\n\nTrump appointed Barrett to the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Chicago just three years ago. Before that, she taught law at the University of Notre Dame for 15 years and had clerked for Scalia, widely seen by conservatives as a legal legend.\n\nBarrett is admired by conservatives for her positions on abortion rights and the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. A devout Catholic, she is also a favorite of religious conservatives. At 48, Barrett would be the youngest justice on the Supreme Court if confirmed, allowing her to potentially shape American law and society for generations.\n\nWithin hours of Ginsburg's death last Friday, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., pledged to bring Trump's nominee for a vote on the Senate floor. The president has made clear he wants his nominee approved by Election Day, predicting that the results of the presidential election may end up in front of the Supreme Court.\n\nDemocrats, including presidential nominee Joe Biden, say whoever wins in November should pick the next justice, citing McConnell's successful effort in 2016 to block President Barack Obama's nominee for the Supreme Court, Merrick Garland, about eight months before the election. Now, Trump is setting up a Supreme Court fight just over a month before the 2020 election.\n\nWhile Republican Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska have said they do not support a vote on a nominee before the election, other Republican senators considered to be potential swing votes, including Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah, announced they would support moving forward with a Supreme Court confirmation.\n\nThat support likely gives Trump the votes he will need to get his nominee on the bench. Still, Capitol Hill is bracing for a high-stakes political battle in the weeks and even days leading up to the election, spilling onto the campaign trail both in the presidential contest and for several tight Senate races.\n\nA Senate Republican aide told NPR on Saturday that confirmation hearings are set to begin on Oct. 12 and last four days.\n\nThe Democrats have already been framing the nomination as a battle to preserve health care — with a major challenge to the Affordable Care Act on the court's schedule this fall — while Republicans see abortion as a salient issue to bolster support for Trump's filling the seat as soon as possible.\n\nTrump began promoting his forthcoming nomination the day after the court announced Ginsburg had died. During a rally in North Carolina last Saturday night, Trump promised to pick a woman for the seat, a nod to Ginsburg's lifelong efforts to promote the equality of women under the law.\n\nThis week, thousands of mourners lined up outside the Supreme Court where Ginsburg's casket lay in repose at the top of the court's marble steps. On Friday, Ginsburg lay in state inside the U.S. Capitol's Statuary Hall, the first woman and the first Jewish American to receive such an honor.\n\nGinsburg will be buried at Arlington Cemetery on Tuesday, following the Jewish holiday Yom Kippur.
Will Supreme Court Invalidate Obamacare A Decade After It Was Enacted?\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption J. Scott Applewhite/AP J. Scott Applewhite/AP\n\nObamacare is back before the Supreme Court on Tuesday, with opponents challenging it for a third time. The first attempts to derail the law failed in the high court by votes of 5-to-4 and 6-to-3. But the makeup of the court is very different now, with three justices appointed by President Trump – among them new Justice Amy Coney Barrett.\n\nBefore her nomination, Barrett consistently criticized the court's two previous decisions, a critique that Senate Democrats repeatedly bludgeoned her with at her confirmation hearings.\n\nBut the ACA has remained in place for a decade, and the legal landscape has changed so much over that time that many of those who originally took issue with the law in the Supreme Court think this challenge is a stretch. In fact, most of the groups that fought the ACA after it was enacted in 2010 are missing in action from Tuesday's case.\n\nThe most controversial part of the ACA when it passed was the requirement that people either buy health insurance or pay a penalty. In 2012, Chief Justice John Roberts and the court's other conservative justices ruled that the individual mandate exceeded Congress' power to regulate interstate commerce. But Roberts provided the fifth vote to uphold the penalty anyway on the grounds that it amounted to a tax and thus fell within the taxing power of Congress. Bottom line: The mandate survived.\n\nNow comes another challenge to the ACA, brought by Texas, other GOP-dominated states and most significant of all, the Trump administration. They assert that because the penalty has been zeroed out, it raises no revenue, is no longer a tax and thus is unconstitutional.\n\nChallengers want the law struck down\n\nWhat's more, the ACA challengers argue that the mandate is so interwoven with the rest of the law that Obamacare must be struck down in its entirety.\n\nBut even lawyer Paul Clement, who made that argument in 2012 in the Supreme Court on behalf of those challenging the law, sees the situation today as different because the mandate doesn't have any teeth.\n\nWith the Trump administration refusing to defend the law — something this administration has done far more often than those in the past — the House of Representatives has stepped in to defend it, along with 20 mainly Democratic states. Representing the House on Tuesday will be Donald Verrilli, who successfully defended the law when he was solicitor general in the Obama administration.\n\nThe argument against the ACA this time has kind of a funhouse mirror quality to it, he contends. What President Trump said, and what the congressional leadership said, and virtually everybody said when they enacted this amendment in 2017 ... is they were repealing the mandate by getting rid of the penalty.\n\nCongress is allowed to learn from experience, he says. You can't lock the 2017 Congress into the judgment that it made in 2010. In fact, Congress asked the Congressional Budget Office in 2017 for its expert opinion, and the CBO came back and told Congress that yes, it will continue to function effectively if you zero out the tax.\n\nBut the Trump administration will argue that the mandate is still on the books. Or as Chapman University law professor John Eastman puts it, Just because there's no longer a penalty doesn't mean that there's no mandate to buy insurance. Eastman is among a relatively small group of conservatives who have weighed in with briefs siding with those seeking to invalidate the ACA in this latest case.\n\nBut most of the groups that originally objected to the ACA in the earlier cases – including business groups – this time have not joined the challenge.\n\nACA's supporters\n\nBy contrast, just about all the actors in the health industry – from the American Medical Association, to hospitals across the country, to the insurance industry – have weighed in urging the Supreme Court to preserve the law.\n\nUltimately the question the court is likely to decide is whether the mandate language can be struck from the law by itself, or whether it is so intertwined with the rest of the law that the whole ACA must be struck down. In legal terms, it's whether the mandate language is severable or not.\n\nSeverability is a term that almost seems guaranteed to make people's eyes glaze over. But the chief justice probably explained it best last term when he said that one important part of the law creating the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau was unconstitutional, but the rest of the law could remain intact.\n\nWe think it clear that Congress would prefer that we use a scalpel rather than a bulldozer in curing the constitutional defect we identify today, Roberts wrote.\n\nShortly after that decision, when the court issued an opinion in a case involving robocall regulation, Justice Brett Kavanaugh made a similar point.\n\nConstitutional litigation is not a game of gotcha against Congress, where litigants can ride a discrete constitutional flaw in a statute to take down the whole, otherwise constitutional statute, Kavanaugh wrote.\n\nIn the ACA case, Verrilli, representing the House, will tell the justices that the easy and obvious answer is to sever the rest of the law and let it continue to operate just as Congress intended in 2017.\n\nIt is Congress' job to make policy, not the court's, and Congress has repeatedly refused to repeal the law, including in 2017 when it zeroed out the penalty, Verrilli contends.\n\nTo do otherwise, he says, would throw the health sector into chaos.\n\nIn fact, there would be enormous practical consequences were the court to throw out the whole ACA. Health care accounts for about one-fifth of the U.S. economy.\n\nPractical consequences\n\nTens of millions of [previously uninsured] people who gained coverage under the law's various pathways could lose that coverage overnight, says Renuka Tipirneni, a primary care physician and health policy researcher at the University of Michigan hospital.\n\nGone as well would be the ban on discrimination based on preexisting conditions – from cancer, to COVID-19, to asthma, diabetes and much more. Until the ACA was enacted, insurers refused to cover people with preexisting conditions, or charged them much more for insurance. The ACA made those practices illegal.\n\nAlso eliminated would be coverage for low-income adult Americans who became eligible for Medicaid when all but a dozen states took advantage of the ACA to expand federally subsidized coverage under the Medicaid program. Among those who have benefited are many who lost their health insurance when they lost their jobs in the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nIndeed, the scope of the ACA's protections for all Americans is so wide that most people now take them for granted, Tipirneni says. These include provisions that cut drug costs for older Americans to those that eliminated many co-pays and allowed young adults to stay on their parents' insurance until turning 26.\n\nWith all that on the chopping block Tuesday, it is no exaggeration to say that the future of the ACA is up to the Supreme Court.
Women Rush To Get Long-Acting Birth Control After Trump Wins\n\nJoy Ho/NPR\n\nWomen across the country are rushing to get IUDs. Or at least, they're tweeting about rushing to get long-term birth control, according to a surge of messages on social media.\n\nThey're concerned that the Trump administration might end Obamacare provisions that require insurers to cover intrauterine devices and other contraception and cut funding for abortion and reproductive health overall. So women are looking for long-term solutions like IUDs: ones that will outlast a presidency. But they may have a bit more time than they think.\n\nThey're not just talking about it on social media; they're looking for more information, too. Google Trends showed a massive peak in searches for IUD birth control and Planned Parenthood on Wednesday.\n\nThe online conversations have left a lot of women wondering how much longer their birth control will be available without copays, as is required under the Affordable Care Act. The short answer is that while memes say women should get their IUDs before Inauguration Day, things might not be quite so urgent. The wheels of government take time to turn, so nobody will lose coverage on Day 1 of the Trump administration.\n\nBut women are already acting.\n\nI booked an appointment with my gynecologist the instant North Carolina went red, Kate McPhillips, a young professional in Boston, posted to her Facebook page Wednesday morning. She is considering the switch to a copper IUD, the type that lasts for 10 to 12 years, just in case the unimaginable happens.\n\nDr. Anne Davis, consulting medical director for Physicians for Reproductive Health and an associate professor of clinical obstetrics and gynecology at Columbia University Medical Center in New York City, says that on Wednesday six women called in a panic to schedule IUD appointments. Normally, only about one woman calls to book an IUD insertion each day.\n\nAnd these women weren't just looking for an appointment somewhere in the future. They wanted one right now. They were very, very scared and distraught that they would lose access to birth control, Davis says.\n\nOthers who work in women's' health and reproduction are very concerned about the long-term changes a Trump presidency might bring. It's an understatement to say that we're nervous, says Dr. Eve Espey, chair of the department of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of New Mexico Health Sciences Center.\n\nThere are multiple ways Trump's administration and Congress could make access to birth control more difficult, beyond repealing the Affordable Care Act, which Trump has vowed to do. They include:\n\nDropping the ACA appeal: The Obama administration appealed a 2014 court decision that would block subsidies for insurance premiums under the ACA. If Trump dropped the appeal, reimbursements to insurers would stop. Most experts believe that plans purchased before then would still be honored, but insurers would very likely drop out of the health care exchanges for the following year.\n\nThe Obama administration appealed a 2014 court decision that would block subsidies for insurance premiums under the ACA.

Redefining contraceptives: By changing how birth control is defined, the ACA clause requiring coverage could be weakened or removed without necessarily overturning the ACA, according to Alina Salganicoff, director of women's health policy and vice president of the Kaiser Family Foundation.\n\nBy changing how birth control is defined, the ACA clause requiring coverage could be weakened or removed without necessarily overturning the ACA, according to Alina Salganicoff, director of women's health policy and vice president of the Kaiser Family Foundation.

Cut funding: Trump and Congress could cut federal funding to Planned Parenthood and programs like Title X, which subsidizes family planning health care for low-income men and women. House Republicans have tried multiple times to stop funding, but congressional Democrats and President Obama have stopped them.\n\nAlthough Trump could put these changes into motion on his first day in office, insurance plans already purchased for 2017 would probably still be honored. Secretary of Health and Human Services Sylvia Burwell tweeted that signups at HealthCare.gov for 2017 have spiked since the election.\n\nThere's been a rush on reproductive health centers, too.\n\nWe called over a dozen regional Planned Parenthood divisions across the country. They all report more women than usual calling to book appointments, and more women asking questions about IUDs.\n\nEven though women won't lose access to copay-free birth control immediately, Davis says women should take action soon. This isn't something to put off, and if you're on corporate insurance sometimes it takes a while for IUDs to be ordered. If you need a long-acting form of birth control, you need to take care of that now.\n\nOn the other hand, there's Espey. She agrees that choosing long-lasting contraceptives may become a priority for more women, but she is also concerned that women might be making these moves a little too quickly. When people are under stress, they're more likely to make decisions that they regret later.\n\nWomen shouldn't rush to make decisions about birth control, she says. They should speak with their doctors and learn the side effects. But she notes that long-lasting reversible birth control like IUDs and hormonal implants, while not 100 percent effective, are pretty much foolproof ways to prevent pregnancy.\n\nPlanned Parenthood of Metropolitan Washington D.C., has seen an increase in women looking for birth control since Tuesday. The uncertainty makes women nervous, says Laura Meyers, the president and CEO.\n\nWe asked representatives for Trump on Wednesday if birth control will stay copay-free during his presidency, but did not hear back. This could be because Trump's team has since rolled out a new website and media hotline, where we have followed up. We will update this page if they reply.
With His Back Against The Wall, Trump Again Turns To Grievance Politics\n\ntoggle caption Evan Vucci/AP\n\nNo single issue has been a greater animating force for the Republican base over the past decade than immigration — except maybe the Affordable Care\n\nAct (aka Obamacare).\n\nAnd with the failure of GOP health care efforts in Congress and sliding poll numbers this summer, the Trump White House seems to be making a concerted effort to elevate cultural wedge issues, from immigration and a ban on transgender people in the military to affirmative action and police conduct.\n\nTrump has been under siege since he took office, said Brian Jones, a Republican political consultant and veteran of several presidential campaigns, and the cumulative effect of his administration's missteps is an eroding approval rating, even among Republicans.\n\nSo Trump's team is rolling the dice, betting that if he can't get something done through the usual avenues in Washington, he can at least keep his supporters outside of it fired up with a dose of the cultural grievances that helped get him elected.\n\nWhen a president's back is up against the wall, what he has got left is his base. He can't afford to lose his most ardent supporters, so, often, presidents go back to the embers they stoked to fire up those supporters in the first place — be they cultural or economic.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Trump White House backed a hard-line immigration proposal that would significantly curtail legal immigration. The move came less than a week after the Senate health care bill went up in smoke — and on the heels of some other culture war moves from the president.\n\nTrump tweeted a call for a ban on transgender people in the military; the Justice Department put up a personnel posting to staff an effort to sue over racial discrimination against Asian-Americans in university admissions; and Trump suggested in a speech to police that they shouldn't be too nice to certain suspects.\n\nThat is all red meat for his base — issues that have historically played to white grievance.\n\nOut of the hot focus of the legislative and Russia investigation headlines, many of these issues have been there since the start of the Trump presidency. One of his first major efforts was the travel ban that targets people from six (originally seven) majority-Muslim countries. And the Justice Department is working to try to cut off funding to so-called sanctuary cities, as well as urging prosecutors to seek the toughest sentences possible for nonviolent drug offenders, reversing Obama-era policy.\n\nI assume they're doing it because these are policies that the president believes will 'make America great again,'  said Alex Conant, a former Republican National Committee spokesman and veteran political operative who worked for Sen. Marco Rubio's presidential campaign, in a reference to Trump's campaign slogan. Politically, it could help him maintain a floor as his poll numbers continue to slide.\n\nTrump received the worst numbers of his presidency this week. A Quinnipiac poll had the president at just a 33 percent approval rating with Republican support slipping.\n\nSpeak English\n\nSpeak English, the president and Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., one of the sponsors of the immigration legislation, said was one of their requirements for those who want to come to the United States. They also said these new — legal — immigrants will have to have skills that could help the economy and have to be able to financially support themselves.\n\nWhen confronted with the poem at the Statue of Liberty about welcoming the tired, huddled masses, White House policy adviser Stephen Miller told reporters, The poem that you're referring to — that was added later — is not actually a part of the original Statue of Liberty.\n\nThe poem that you're referring to — that was added later — is not actually a part of the original Statue of Liberty.\n\nThe poem — The New Colossus by Emma Lazarus — was added in 1903, 17 years after Lady Liberty was dedicated. It was written by Lazarus 20 years earlier as part of a fundraiser for the statue. Lazarus was the daughter of a wealthy sugar-refining family but was taken with the plight of the immigrants and refugees with whom she worked. Her poem depicts the Statue of Liberty as the Mother of Exiles. Lazarus' story and poem are featured by the National Park Service on its Statue of Liberty website.\n\nThe American immigration story for many, if not most, is one of people coming to the U.S. with little more than the clothes on their backs yearning to breathe free. Many are escaping poverty or war or simply seeking a better life, a chance to live a middle-class existence for themselves and their children.\n\nIt's the quintessential American Dream, that anyone can make it in the U.S.\n\nThe Trump administration argues that it is backing the legislation because it would be good for American jobs, especially for minorities already in the country, who cannot find work.\n\nAmong those hit the hardest in recent years have been immigrants and, very importantly, minority workers competing for jobs against brand-new arrivals, Trump said Wednesday in announcing his support for the bill. And it has not been fair to our people, to our citizens, to our workers.\n\nThat sentiment is real. Anecdotally, low-skilled laborers have traditionally been prone to skepticism toward new immigrants, who can be paid less. Businesses argue that Americans won't take the more dangerous, laborious work.\n\nNPR's Amita Kelly fact-checked the claim on Friday, finding mixed conclusions:\n\nEconomists disagree whether or how much an influx of immigrants depresses wages. Some have found that new immigrants depress wages for certain groups, such as teenagers or workers with a high school diploma or less. Others say the overall effect on the economy is tiny, and an influx of immigrant workers vitalizes the economy overall.\n\n(Kelly also dove into the specific research cited by Miller, who has been pushing this issue for years going back to when he was an aide to then-Sen. Jeff Sessions, the current attorney general.)\n\nIt has been a similar story for years. The Washington Post took a deep look at this in 2013 and wrote:\n\nAccording to some experts, the flood of Hispanic immigrant workers in the past 25 years — both legal and illegal — has had a much smaller effect on employment patterns than other trends, including factory flight overseas, weakened labor unions and a spate of recessions. They also say that low-skilled immigration has been both a boon and a burden to America. It has squeezed public services but generated tax revenue. It has depressed wages in some areas but has revitalized ailing communities. The group that suffers most from the influx of new foreign laborers, these experts report, are earlier immigrants.\n\nProving divisive\n\nIt's not just the immigration push that is proving divisive. So are the other recent controversial, culturally focused steps taken by the administration.\n\nThe Justice Department says its affirmative-action effort is about racial discrimination against Asian-Americans, according to a spokeswoman, who added that the department is committed to protecting all Americans from all forms of illegal race-based discrimination.\n\nMaybe now people will finally pay attention to something we Asian-Americans have been talking about for so long, Joe Zhou told the Los Angeles Times. Zhou sued Harvard in 2015 on behalf of his son, who did not get in despite being a valedictorian with a 4.44 grade-point average, near-perfect SATs and involvement in extracurricular activities.\n\nBut not all Asian-Americans feel that way. The advocacy group Asian Americans Advancing Justice condemned the Trump administration's move and said it supports affirmative-action policies.\n\nAffirmative action expands educational opportunities for all applicants in a society where cultural and racial biases in testing and access to quality education deny many students equal opportunity, the group wrote in a statement.\n\nInstead of attacking affirmative action programs, the Trump administration should use its platform to increase opportunities for all students.\n\nIt noted that affirmative-action policies particularly help low-income and working-class Asian-Americans and Pacific Islanders.\n\nCivil rights groups say affirmative-action opponents often focus on Asian-Americans for these kinds of cases as part of an effort to weaken affirmative-action policies more broadly.\n\nSince the new administration has been in office, it has been moving very deliberately to operationalize its nativist agenda with policies like this one, Advancing Justice continued. Instead of attacking affirmative action programs, the Trump administration should use its platform to increase opportunities for all students while continuing to address the persistent equity gaps for low-income students and students of color. We support affirmative action and refuse to allow Asian Americans to be used as a wedge between communities of color.\n\nCornell William Brooks, the former head of the NAACP, said on CNN Wednesday that the Justice Department was looking for ideological victims and racial bogeymen that don't exist.\n\nThat is part of why Trump's efforts convince racial and ethnic minorities that legal immigration hurts them doesn't appear to have made a dent.\n\nThese things are always a matter of priorities.\n\nTrump's attempts to win over minority communities have often fallen short. What the hell do you have to lose? he asked in comments aimed at black voters — at a campaign rally delivered to a largely white crowd in Michigan.\n\nTrump wound up winning just 8 percent of black voters in 2016, less than George W. Bush in 2000 and 2004 and barely more than Mitt Romney in 2012.\n\nIn reality, those appeals were also largely aimed at trying to keep the GOP voting bloc together, part of an effort to make Trump appear open-minded to white, suburban Republicans.\n\nThe impending ban on transgender people serving in the military, which Trump announced via Twitter, caught Pentagon leaders off guard. Some seemed none-too-pleased with it — and appear to be breaking ranks with their commander in chief.\n\nCoast Guard Commandant Adm. Paul Zukunft told a transgender service member, for example, that he will not break faith.\n\nJoint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Joseph Dunford issued a statement saying, There will be no modifications to the current policy until the President's direction has been received by the secretary of defense and the secretary has issued implementation guidance.\n\nTrying to stop the slide\n\nThe immigration legislation has little chance of passing in Congress. It doesn't have the support of 50 Republican senators, let alone the 60 total votes in the Senate needed to overcome a filibuster.\n\nSo why push this?\n\nNarratives of health care failure and Russia investigations have dominated headlines and cable news over the past couple of months. And Trump's numbers have suffered because of it.\n\nThat Quinnipiac poll is hardly the only one to show this. Every poll has shown a clear trend. Even Rasmussen, a polling outfit the statistical community frowns upon but that the president pays attention to, had Trump at 38 percent Wednesday. Drudge highlighted the poll on its site — in bolded and in red font — this way:\n\nThese are historically bad numbers for a president. No one has been this low at the same time since polling began. But, in fairness, Trump also had historically bad numbers for any major-party nominee — and still won the presidency.\n\nThat is important to remember, but it certainly didn't matter in the election and it's not everything now. The actions the White House is taking and the issues the administration is pushing signal worries among the president's political team.\n\nLooking at this through a political lens, Jones said. It appears these coordinated announcements are an effort to keep his core supporters engaged and on board the Trump train.\n\nThere are signs of bumpiness on the tracks. Trump won independents in 2016, but a late June NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll found his net approval among them had fallen 17 points since February.\n\nHis base, however, appeared intact. That may be changing. Traditionally, even in the worst of times, presidents retain very high support among their party. But Quinnipiac found a softening, a 10-point drop since June among Republicans saying they very strongly approve of the president. Barely a majority of Republicans said they strongly approved, 53 percent, down from 63 percent two months ago.\n\nThe trend is worrisome, Conant said.\n\nInsider looking out?\n\nTrump has begun distancing himself from congressional Republicans, referring to them as they and publicly shaming them for having promised action on health care for seven years.\n\nBut there is only so long a president can position himself as the outsider. President Obama certainly tried. He ran a re-election campaign partially on it.\n\nTrump is at least now partly responsible for the legislative push — and for making the argument for policies. That is something he has failed to do effectively. On health care, for example, he never got beyond boilerplate political talking points to engage the public with any depth on the nuts and bolts of policy.\n\nYes, health care is complicated.\n\nObama was steeped in policy, and on many issues, especially health care, he was his administration's best spokesman. But when there were failures, just like Trump, Obama blamed Congress, all of Congress.\n\nThat infuriated his own party.\n\nThe most important lesson I've learned, is that you can't change Washington from the inside, Obama said in September 2012, two months before winning re-election. You can only change it from the outside.\n\nFor Trump, the blameless posture is complicated by the deal-maker persona he has created for himself. He wrote a book about it. Trump has pledged to make the best deals.\n\nSo far, though, he has dealt only with Republicans, making no serious push to bring Democrats on board. At this point, he is only at the threatening stage with Democrats.\n\nMaybe that shouldn't be surprising, however, considering how Trump advocates making deals in The Art of the Deal. In one section, he imagines how he would have responded to a hostile takeover attempt that played out in a different company.\n\nI'm not saying I would also have won, but if I went down, it would have been kicking and screaming, he wrote. I would have closed the hotel and let it rot. That's just my makeup. I fight when I feel I'm getting screwed, even if it's costly and difficult and highly risky.\n\nThat could explain tweets like this, sent in the wee hours of July 28, the morning after the Senate's Obamacare repeal effort failed:\n\nAs I said from the beginning, let ObamaCare implode, then deal. Watch!\n\nTime to force the conversation\n\nThe White House seems to see this culture push as good politics.\n\nIn the briefing room with reporters, Miller, for example, called the immigration legislation enormously advantageous and said it was time to force the conversation on this issue.\n\nHe even explicitly mentioned battleground states.\n\nPublic support is so immense on this, Miller contended. If you just look at the polling data in many key battleground states across the country — that over time you're going to see massive public push for this kind of legislation.\n\nThat doesn't terribly sound unlike the unnamed White House aide who told Axios this about the president's announcement of a ban on transgender people in the military:\n\nThis forces Democrats in Rust Belt states like Ohio, Michigan, and Wisconsin, to take complete ownership of this issue. How will the blue-collar voters in these states respond when senators up for re-election in 2018 like Debbie Stabenow are forced to make their opposition to this a key plank of their campaigns?\n\nSome Republicans worry reviving the culture wars is the wrong place to focus to achieve the outcome this White House is looking for.\n\nBut, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders disputed there were any electoral calculations behind the ban. Asked on July 26 whether the decision had anything to do with trying to put pressure on Democrats in battleground seats, she said, Not that I'm aware. She said it was all about military readiness and unit cohesion.\n\nA different official also told The Washington Post that the decision was about military readiness and military resource decision, but added, It will be fun to watch some of them [Democrats] have to defend this, but that was never an impetus.\n\nSome Republicans worry reviving the culture wars is the wrong place to focus to achieve the outcome this White House is looking for.\n\nThe challenge is for every political action, there is an equal and opposite reaction, Jones said, and I think many Main Street Republicans, let alone independents, will bristle at proposals they consider to be exceptionally exclusionary particularly in the absence of addressing issues that traditionally animate the whole party, like tax reform.
Trump Can Kill Obamacare With Or Without Help From Congress\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Jeff Kowalsky/AFP/Getty Images Jeff Kowalsky/AFP/Getty Images\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump has promised over and over in recent months that he will repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, also called Obamacare, when he reaches the White House.\n\nObamacare is a disaster. You know it. We all know it, Trump said at a debate last month. We have to repeal it and replace it with something absolutely much less expensive.\n\nNow that Trump will move into the Oval Office in January, the question is whether he'll be able to completely repeal the six-year-old law that has had an impact on every aspect of the U.S. health care system.\n\nIt's a challenge for a Trump presidency, says Jack Hoadley, a research professor at Georgetown University's Health Policy Institute. To get a true repeal and replace through, he needs 60 votes in the Senate. That's the minimum number of votes needed to overcome a filibuster in the Senate.\n\nRepeal of the law is absolutely going to come up, and the only potential defense against that would be a Democratic filibuster — if Republicans even allow a filibuster, says Austin Frakt, a health economist who runs the blog The Incidental Economist.\n\nBut even if Trump can't repeal the Affordable Care Act in its entirety, there's a lot he can do through rule-making and smaller legislative changes to weaken the law and mold it more to his liking.\n\nThey are probably, practically speaking, talking about leaving the ACA, as is, in place, Hoadley says. Then he can change the ACA to have it showcase the kinds of plans he wants to see in place.\n\nDuring his campaign, Trump proposed a series of measures that he said will allow people to buy affordable health insurance policies outside of the Obamacare exchanges.\n\nThose measures include promoting tax-free health savings accounts that might help individuals save money to pay for health care costs and allowing people to deduct the cost of their premiums on their personal income tax returns. Trump has said he also wants to allow insurers to sell policies across state lines to boost competition.\n\nTrump could alter the Obamacare exchanges to promote high-deductible health plans and health savings accounts to get a result similar to what he's looking for.\n\nHe could change the details of how the marketplaces work, Hoadley says. It's all worked out through regulation. You could just suspend the regulations.\n\nAlternatively, Trump could embrace the health care plan promoted by House Speaker Paul Ryan, which starts with repealing the Affordable Care Act. It includes many of the same principles as Trump's plan, but has more details.\n\nOne of the biggest challenges Trump faces is that about about 20 million people today have health coverage because of the Affordable Care Act, according to the Department of Health and Human Services. The uninsured rate hit an all-time low of 8.9 percent this year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nAn analysis of Trump's plan by The Commonwealth Fund estimates it would increase the number of people who lack health insurance by as many as 25 million, and increase the federal budget by as much as $41 billion. That's because much of Trump's plan involves giving tax breaks to encourage people to buy insurance while taking away the requirement to buy insurance — a mandate embedded in Obamacare.\n\nEven if Trump fails to repeal the law, Frakt says, he could easily destroy it from within by refusing to fund it through the budget process.\n\nThe only thing stopping that is, it's a big deal to throw millions of people off insurance without offering something in return, Frakt says.\n\nIf Trump is right that his health savings accounts are a good enough replacement, then he'll be able to get rid of Obamacare through a vote or through neglect.
McConnell Warns Of 'Scary Prospect' If GOP Loses Senate Control In Midterms\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Alex Brandon/AP Alex Brandon/AP\n\nUpdated at 8:52 p.m. ET\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has a message for Republican voters who are celebrating the confirmation of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh: Get to the polls in November if you want more conservatives sitting on judicial benches.\n\nLose the Senate, and the project of confirming judges is over for the last two years of President Trump, McConnell said in an interview with NPR in his Capitol Hill office. That, I think, is a scary prospect to the people who like what we've been doing on the judge project and I hope will help us hold on to our majority.\n\nMcConnell said the raucous, sometimes aggressive fight over Kavanaugh's nomination came at a perfect time for Republicans. Polls showed GOP voter enthusiasm slumping over the summer as energy for Democrats spiked.\n\nAll that turned around when Republicans grew frustrated with the protracted battle over Kavanaugh. The Kentucky Republican said it awakened them to the Supreme Court cause — an issue that inspired many of the same voters to back Trump in 2016.\n\nAs of the last week or so the hottest issue in our races has [been the] Kavanaugh nomination, McConnell said, even outpacing tax reform, which the top Senate leader listed as a major legislative accomplishment. We knew the Democrats were fired up. They have been all year. No question about that.\n\nBut what we are now seeing is that the enthusiasm and energy on the Republican side comes close to matching the Democratic side, and given the states that we're competing in, that's really good news for us, he said.\n\nMcConnell also called activists opposing Kavanaugh a mob and criticized Democrats for encouraging their actions. He said Republicans were inundated with protesters in recent weeks and had their lives disrupted.\n\nWe were literally under assault ourselves, McConnell said. Trailing members for their homes; getting in their faces here in the Capitol. An effort clearly to try and intimidate us. And one of the reasons I was so proud of the result last Saturday on Judge Kavanaugh is that we stood up for two things. We stood up to the mob and we also stood up for the presumption of innocence in this country.\n\nHe also rejected any comparison between those protesters and the conservative Tea Party activists who protested the 2010 passage of the Affordable Care Act or the raucous crowds that chant lock her up and jeer at reporters at many of Trump's own campaign rallies.\n\nDemocrats say the Kavanaugh fight was equally energizing for their voters and for women in particular. At the same time, Republicans are losing support among women in addition to already low numbers among Hispanic and African-American voters.\n\nAll problems McConnell admits.\n\nWe've always had something of a gender gap, McConnell said. It's never been as wide as it is now.\n\nHe said he hopes electing qualified women to the Senate, like Marsha Blackburn in Tennessee and Martha McSally in Arizona, will help close that divide. He also pointed to Hispanic Republicans like Sens. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, and Marco Rubio, R-Fla., as evidence of diversity within the GOP ranks, but he noted that attracting black voters has been a bigger challenge.\n\nI think we can improve our position with women voters and with Hispanic voters for sure, he said. With African-Americans, we haven't been able to make much headway.\n\nHe did point to Sen. Tim Scott, the first African-American senator elected in South Carolina, as a noteworthy addition to the GOP conference.\n\nHe's arguably the most popular politician in South Carolina, McConnell said. So there is hope with African-American voters as well. But I'm more optimistic about closing the gender gap and by improving our position with Hispanics.\n\nSeveral key issues Republicans once touted as the central themes for the midterm elections have faded in recent weeks. McConnell says tax reform remains one of his top accomplishments, despite the fact that it is playing a smaller role in campaigns this year and has been eclipsed by the Supreme Court debate.\n\nThe GOP message on health care has also shifted. Gone are the days of candidates vowing to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. Now Republicans are actively embracing protections for people with pre-existing conditions — a central tenet of the law they all opposed.\n\nMcConnell said many Republicans are explicitly vowing to keep those protections, even as two GOP Senate candidates, Missouri Attorney General Josh Hawley and West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey, are suing to weaken consumer protection provisions in the health care law.\n\nEvery one of our candidates have been able to respond to it by saying that they are in favor of making sure that people with pre-existing conditions are covered, McConnell said. You can favor the lawsuit and still be in favor of maintaining coverage or adjusting conditions.\n\nMcConnell sidestepped whether Republicans would take another run at rolling back Obamacare next year after failing to get the votes for their scaled-down repeal legislation. He called that failed effort the single biggest disappointment this Congress and really the only major disappointment after moving bills through on so many different fronts.\n\nThe top Senate Republican distanced himself from the unusual public criticism that Trump leveled at the Federal Reserve Bank's economic policies. Trump said the Fed had gone crazy for raising interest rates.\n\nMcConnell instead said of his own posture on monetary policy, I generally avoid commenting on the market. It goes up and it goes down. Or giving the Fed advice.
Toxic Algae Seeps Into Florida Congressional Races\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Joe Raedle/Getty Images Joe Raedle/Getty Images\n\nOn Florida's St. Lucie River, east of Lake Okeechobee, locks and a dam hold water before it races downstream to the estuary on what is known as Florida's Treasure Coast.\n\nBut looking out over the river, Stephen Davis with the Everglades Foundation sees signs of trouble. There's a pretty substantial mat of the blue-green algae we see floating on the surface, the wetland ecologist says. As soon as these gates are open, the water will pass out into the estuary.\n\nPeter Girard with the environmental group Bullsugar.org says, You can smell it before you see it. And of course, heading into the holiday weekend, you had beach closings around the inlet up and down the Treasure Coast.\n\nFor months now, mats of algae from Lake Okeechobee have been flowing down the river, bringing toxins that can affect people and animals. In beach communities east of the lake, the algae have had a big impact on tourism and businesses.\n\nWith more toxic algae blooms on Florida's west coast and a red tide algae bloom causing massive fish kills in the Gulf of Mexico, water quality is increasingly having a big impact on key midterm races in Florida. While Democrats tend to be more outspoken on environmental issues, Republican candidates are also speaking up because they're feeling the heat.\n\nFor Brian Mast — a Republican congressman whose district is east of Lake Okeechobee — the algae bloom, water quality and the environment have become a signature issue. At a recent news conference on the waterfront in Stuart, Mast said, I've got a dock in out my backyard. My kids like to jump in the water. I can tell you that 2018, my family hasn't been out on this water for recreation, not once.\n\nTwo years ago, this district went solidly for Donald Trump, electing Mast and flipping the seat from Democratic to Republican. Since then, Mast has been a reliable member of the Republican caucus, voting to repeal Obamacare. But he's staked out independent positions on some issues, especially those involving Lake Okeechobee and water quality.\n\nThis week, backed by environmental groups, Mast announced legislation he has introduced in Congress. It would force the Army Corps of Engineers to minimize the potential for algae blooms by making the health and safety of coastal residents a priority when releasing water from Lake Okeechobee. Mast says he expects the bill will face significant opposition from the Corps, state water managers and farmers south of the lake.\n\nWe know that that's a challenge, he said, but it's a fight that we have to go out there and have on behalf of our community.\n\nMast's opponent, Democrat Lauren Baer, is calling his bill too little, too late. She says toxic algae in Lake Okeechobee has been a problem since the first-term congressman took office and it's taken him 19 months to come up with legislation.\n\nOn Florida's west coast, where there's a red tide algae bloom, Republican Congressman Vern Buchanan is in a similar situation, touting his record on the environment as he's challenged by Democrat David Shapiro.\n\nA dark money group that supports Democrats, Majority Forward, recently began running an ad targeting Florida Republican Gov. Rick Scott, who's running for the Senate against incumbent Democrat Bill Nelson. The ad shows disturbing pictures of dead manatees and beaches littered with dead fish. The narrator says, It's fair to blame to Rick Scott. He savaged environmental safeguards and slashed $700 million from water protection.\n\nMajority Forward YouTube\n\nScott has long been criticized for slashing money for land conservation and environmental regulation. But he's running a campaign ad targeting Nelson for some of the very things Scott is charged with. Washington politician Bill Nelson made a pledge 30 years ago to solve this problem, the ad says. But Nelson is a talker, not a doer. With Bill Nelson, we get more waiting, more talk and more algae.\n\nScott For Florida YouTube\n\nIn Florida — a state with an economy built on tourism — clean water, pristine beaches and environmental preservation have always been important. But the environment has typically not been an issue that's determined the outcome of a race. Girard of Bullsugar.org thinks this year may be different, especially in the Senate race.\n\nThe disaster you're seeing on the coasts absolutely will be a factor in that race, he says. Water quality and the governor's impact on it will be something that we expect people will be thinking about when they head to the polls.\n\nBoth Gov. Scott and Sen. Nelson have made multiple trips to the areas suffering from the algae blooms. This week, Scott announced that the federal government, at his request, is making disaster assistance available for businesses affected by the blooms on both coasts.
GOP '200 Day' Agenda Calls For Spending, Tax Cuts. But What About The Deficit?\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Matt Rourke/AP Matt Rourke/AP\n\nBuckle up. We're ready to go to work, Vice President Pence told Republican lawmakers at their annual retreat in Philadelphia on Thursday.\n\nWith a GOP administration in place for the first time in eight years, congressional leaders have mapped out an ambitious legislative agenda, with goals to have bills to repeal and replace Obamacare, overhaul the tax code and build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border, all before lawmakers break for the annual August recess.\n\nWe've been working with the administration on a daily basis to map out and plan a very bold and aggressive agenda to make good on our campaign promises and to fix these problems, House Speaker Paul Ryan told reporters gathered here for the party's annual three-day GOP policy retreat. Pence and President Trump joined the lawmakers here on Thursday.\n\nThe agenda will test the party's commitment to small government and a fiscal conservatism that in recent years has rejected any new spending without corresponding cuts in the federal budget.\n\nTrump's promises to expand health care coverage and spend more on the nation's ailing infrastructure systems — while cutting taxes for businesses and individuals — will be hard to reconcile with competing GOP commitments to balance the budget and reduce the nation's debt burden.\n\nNearly all congressional Republicans are self-described fiscal conservatives. But Trump has shown support for vast new federal spending — like that $1 trillion infrastructure proposal — and an indifference to deficit spending if it can spur U.S. economic growth. For instance, Republicans largely agree that tax cuts do not need to be paid for and consider them economic stimulus.\n\nRyan would not say Republican policies won't increase the deficit in the short term, but he reiterated a long-standing commitment to paying for new spending. We are fiscal conservatives. If we're going to be spending on things like say, infrastructure, we're going to find the fiscal space to pay for that in our spring budget, he said, referring to the annual budget resolution.\n\nRepublicans are already working to provide Trump with $12 billion to $15 billion in new spending to fund his call to finish a border wall with Mexico. Congress is expected to use an upcoming defense supplemental spending bill to include new border funds. The supplemental spending bill is considered emergency spending and does not require spending offsets. Ryan and McConnell declined to answer repeated questions about whether the wall would be offset in the federal budget. Trump has insisted Mexico will reimburse the U.S. for the costs, through undetermined new measures affecting trade and tax policy with Mexico.\n\nLeaders say they are on the same page as the Trump administration on an agenda that has expanded to the first 200 days in part to accommodate extra scheduling burdens in the Senate related to the confirmation process for Trump's Cabinet and an upcoming Supreme Court nominee.\n\nRyan and McConnell struck a more cautious tone to reporters on their timeline for moving legislation. We don't want to set arbitrary deadlines on things. We want to get things right, Ryan said.\n\nThe speaker understands the challenges of getting things through the Senate, McConnell added. That's been true for 240 years. But we're aware of those challenges and we think we can move forward.\n\nHowever, in a presentation to lawmakers on Wednesday leaders outlined a 2017 program that included a specific timeline, including:\n\nRepeal and replace legislation for Obamacare to President Trump by early April\n\nA defense and border supplemental funding bill by April\n\nAn infrastructure bill by early summer\n\nA tax overhaul and revamp of the IRS by August\n\nCongress also wants to pass laws affecting federal flood insurance, veterans health care and financial regulations by the end of the year. Lawmakers are also anticipating further executive actions from the Trump administration on immigration and health care. The ambitious agenda is being pushed by Trump, who has told lawmakers he wants quick action on his priorities.\n\nPresident Trump comes from a different world, House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., told reporters. Out in the business community, he likes things done fast, and he's going to continue to push them.\n\nOn Thursday, the president did. We have to deliver, he told lawmakers. This is our chance to make major and lasting change.
Middle-Class Americans Face Biggest Strain Under Rising Obamacare Costs\n\nLast month, officials announced health care costs under the Affordable Care Act are expected to rise 22 percent. Rachel Martin speaks with Lindsay Travnicek, an Arizona woman who may forgo coverage.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #1: I think most people hate to think of themselves as middle class.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #2: You have what you need but maybe not everything you want.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: We have a car, but we live in an apartment. That's middle class.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: If you add a boat, then you're not middle class anymore. That's what changes it right there.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MAN #3: The middle class are families who are earning six figures.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MAN #4: Thirty thousand, $35,000 probably.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MAN #5: That means me (laughter). And that means I'm in trouble (laughter).\n\nRACHEL MARTIN, HOST:\n\nIt's time now for our series Hanging On, where we look at some of the economic pressures of American life. Open enrollment for insurance under Obamacare began this past week. That's after the administration announced that the cost of health care under the Affordable Care Act is expected to rise an average of 22 percent in 2017. Most people won't actually pay that much more since federal subsidies will also go up. But those who don't qualify for those subsidies could see a huge increase in their monthly insurance premiums.\n\nLindsay Travnicek is one of those people. She's a self-employed dietitian, and she lives in Arizona. She joins us on the line now.\n\nLindsay, thanks for being with us.\n\nLINDSAY TRAVNICEK: Thank you.\n\nMARTIN: So tell me about the health insurance that you have now. What are your premiums, and what does it cover?\n\nTRAVNICEK: So this year, I was insured through United Health Care over the exchange. And my plan was $255 a month. And I had a $2,000 deductible. So this year - my most recent research on the healthcare.gov - the lowest priced plan that I can get is $430. And the deductible is $4,200 now. And so that is the same plan that I had last year. So the deductible, it went up, you know, $2,200. And the monthly premium went up, you know, a little - you know, $210 or so.\n\nMARTIN: So what does that mean to you? I mean, first of all - let me just ask - are you going to get a subsidy? We hear that subsidies are going to help people who are stretching to make this kind of payment.\n\nTRAVNICEK: Yeah, I do not qualify for a subsidy. And also - I should also say I am a very healthy person. I have no chronic diseases. I take, you know, very good care of myself. And I don't - you know, I feel that, you know - for me to pay for $430, which is a sizable chunk of disposable income, you know, for basically, sort of, just insuring that something doesn't go wrong, I mean, that is - I guess I'm at a point now where that is a risk that I am willing to take.\n\nI voted for Obama. And I voted for what I hoped would be a change in, you know, these insurance companies, you know, taking advantage of people and refusing to pay for care that people needed. And we are just getting - I feel like I'm getting the short end of the stick. You know, I've paid into the system a long time as a healthy person. And I just am choosing not to pay in any more.\n\nMARTIN: So you're not going to renew your health insurance for next year?\n\nTRAVNICEK: No, I'm not.\n\nMARTIN: Does that scare you a little bit to think about not having health care?\n\nTRAVNICEK: Oh, my God, it's terrifying. I come from a family of doctors and people in the medical field. And to us, you know, to go without health care is just - again, it is very risky. But I mean, this is just - I feel like, maybe I could just pay out of pocket and probably still come out ahead, even after paying the penalty for not having any coverage.\n\nMARTIN: The presidential election is Tuesday. Arizona, where you live, is in play in a way it hasn't been in the past. It's a battleground state. Is this something you and your friends and family are talking about as a deciding factor when it comes to who you're going to vote for?\n\nTRAVNICEK: I have been in many discussions with my family, like I said, who's in the health care field. And I'm really disappointed that neither candidate really touched on this topic in a more broad, deep way during the debates. They didn't come up with solutions, what they would do. It was, you know, it was just, sort of, general talk about, we understand it's not affordable. We need to change it. We need to fix it.\n\nAnd so, you know, I voted for Hillary. And I don't rescind that. But it is very - it's very disheartening to me that neither candidate really touched on this in a - you know, a very tangible way as to what their solution was going to be.\n\nMARTIN: Lindsay Travnicek on the line from Tempe, Ariz. We've been talking about the Affordable Care Act.\n\nLindsay, thank you so much.\n\nTRAVNICEK: You're very welcome. Thank you.\n\nCopyright © 2016 NPR. All rights reserved.

Democrats Have Made Big Gains In Number Of Governorships In The U.S.\n\nWhen Kentucky's new governor, Andy Beshear, is sworn-in to office on Tuesday, he will be the 24th Democratic governor in the country, a long way from the 16 in office just three years ago.\n\nARI SHAPIRO, HOST:\n\nWe have an update now on an important but often overlooked political scorecard. Tomorrow, when Democrat Andy Beshear is sworn into office as Kentucky's new governor, there will be nearly as many Democratic as Republican governors across the country; 24-26. Compare that to the beginning of President Trump's term three years ago, when Democrats held just 16 governors' offices. That was a historic low point for the party. Here to lay out what's behind these wide swings and why governorships matter is NPR's Jessica Taylor.\n\nHey, Jess.\n\nJESSICA TAYLOR, BYLINE: Hi, Ari.\n\nSHAPIRO: Let's go back and talk about how Democrats got into this deep hole in the first place. They lost a lot of ground during President Obama's time in office, right?\n\nTAYLOR: They did. Democrats actually ended up suffering the most losses under any president since Dwight Eisenhower. So, you know, this started as a backlash to Obamacare, for sure. But...\n\nSHAPIRO: The Tea Party movement.\n\nTAYLOR: Right. But there was also criticism that Democrats were just too complacent under Obama and not worried about building winning coalitions at the state level. So this started in 2010 - the Tea Party, the Republican wave. It was a really bad year for them to lose that much because that's the precursor to redistricting. So Republicans then were able to shore up those gains for many cycles going forward.\n\nSo for Democratic governors - they actually hit their lowest point during Obama's term as he was leaving. The 2016 elections left them outnumbered 2-1 - as you mentioned, just 16 Democratic governors compared to 33 for Republicans.\n\nSHAPIRO: How fast have Democrats been able to rebound now with Trump as president?\n\nTAYLOR: They have been able to really make some pretty substantial gains in the past three years. They made huge gains in 2018. Now, most of these governors are elected during a midterm year, and that put them from just 17 governors - then they went to 23 after the 2018 elections.\n\nSHAPIRO: Big jump.\n\nTAYLOR: Those'll be the ones who are in office when redistricting happens after the 2020 census. And all of this - governors and then, of course, Democrats flipped the House. We see now result of that happening with the impeachment hearings - was seen as a rebuke to Trump and his presidency.\n\nAnd then last month, Democrats solidified and added to those gains. In Kentucky, Andy Beshear defeated Republican incumbent Matt Bevin in a state that Trump carried by 30 points. Now, Bevin was uniquely unpopular and had made plenty of enemies, but Trump was not able to save him despite multiple trips to the state. And Democrats were able to capitalize there.\n\nAnd then two weeks later, you had Louisiana Democratic Governor John Bel Edwards, who had won in an upset in 2015, was seen as this sort of accidental governor. He held onto a seat in another state that Trump carried by double digits, again showing that Trump's campaigning has not been transferable down-ballot, particularly in governor's races.\n\nSHAPIRO: Are there any big lessons here in how Democrats can win in traditionally Republican states like Kentucky and Louisiana?\n\nTAYLOR: They campaigned, you know, on health care. It was a bad issue for them back in 2010, but now they really sort of see an upswing happening when it comes to preexisting conditions and the expansion of Medicaid. So there is traditionally a difference in how states vote at a federal level than at a state level.\n\nVoters tend to see governors as less partisan, and they're willing to vote for a Democrat sometimes, even if they may vote for a Republican at the presidential level or a Republican senator. So, you know, we - the reverse is true, too. Maryland, Massachusetts, Vermont are all heavily Democratic states at the presidential level, but all three have Republican governors.\n\nSHAPIRO: Now, you mentioned that 2010 was a tough year for Democrats to lose so many seats because it's a redistricting year. Redistricting happens every 10 years, which means 2020 is really important. How does it look for Democrats next year?\n\nTAYLOR: Well, they've made those gains that they needed last cycle in 2018. And then 2020 - you know, they could sort of take back the majority among governors, too, in states that are really important. Their best chances are pickups in New Hampshire and in Vermont, states that both went for Hillary Clinton in 2016. But they'll also be in defense in North Carolina that's already in a redistricting mess right there, too, that's really important. New maps coming in Montana. Donald Trump won both of those states, and Republicans want to win them back.\n\nSHAPIRO: That's NPR political reporter Jessica Taylor.\n\nThanks a lot.\n\nTAYLOR: Thanks, Ari.\n\nCopyright © 2019 NPR.

Republican Debate: 5 Things You Missed\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Joe Raedle/Getty Images Joe Raedle/Getty Images\n\nSaturday's GOP debate was the final one before Tuesday's New Hampshire primary. Here were five key moments:\n\n1. That awkward start\n\nOne key thing has to happen before the debate starts: the candidates have to take the stage.\n\nThat proved more complicated than usual on Saturday night, as the ABC News Republican debate began with Ben Carson refusing to walk out to his podium, even after the moderators called his name.\n\nCalled second, Carson stood and waited, allowing Ted Cruz to go out after him. Making matters weirder: Donald Trump then stopped to stand beside Carson, rather than walking out himself. Jeb Bush walked past them as he took the stage.\n\nAfter the moderators (again) called Carson, they also lastly called out Donald Trump — only to then to (seemingly) realize they still had to call out Kasich.\n\n2. Rubio targeted\n\nNew Jersey Gov. Chris Christie wasted no time in taking shots at Sen. Marco Rubio on Saturday night.\n\nWhen asked early on to list his accomplishments, Rubio listed policies he has supported, then turned to attacking President Obama: Let's dispel once and for all with this fiction that Barack Obama doesn't know what he's doing, he said. He knows exactly what he's doing, Rubio said, by trying to make the U.S. like the rest of the world with policies like Obamacare.\n\nMarco Rubio Uses Same Line 4 Times at Debate, Even After Christie Busts Him https://t.co/0u3kMTUE3x (VIDEO) pic.twitter.com/rDmuWzZqyw — Mediaite (@Mediaite) February 7, 2016\n\nThat line would pop up again and again — and Christie noticed.\n\nIn the heated exchange that followed, Christie said that being governor meant more accountability than being a senator, saying that he had to make tougher and more important decisions than Rubio has had to as a senator. He also attacked Rubio's pattern of missing votes in the Senate, a criticism that has dogged Rubio throughout this nomination contest.\n\nRubio attacked Christie on his response to a recent snowstorm that hit New Jersey, but then pivoted again to the line about how Obama knows exactly what he's doing. Christie hit back.\n\nThere it is. There it is. The memorized 25-second speech. There it is, everybody, he said. Rubio repeated some variation of the line several times during the night.\n\nTrump leads in recent New Hampshire polls by 10 to 20 points, but Rubio has become the candidate to beat for the so-called establishment candidates, like Christie, Jeb Bush, and John Kasich. Those three are fighting for survival in New Hampshire, while Rubio's numbers have surged there in the last few days.\n\n3. Trump kept a low profile\n\nEven though Trump skipped the last debate, some commentators nevertheless decided that he won. In bowing out, he garnered massive media attention, and he also avoided tough questions like those Cruz and Rubio fielded on their past immigration positions.\n\nThis debate, he showed up, and he had (what was for Trump) an unremarkable performance. He stuck to typical Trump talking points — on topics like China, job losses and America not winning anymore — and had few major tangles with his opponents. When he did argue with Jeb Bush on a question about eminent domain and subsequently commanded Bush to be quiet while he answered — the crowd booed Trump.\n\nBut then, Trump is far ahead in New Hampshire while the so-called establishment candidates battle it out. And while Saturday's performance may not have rocketed him further ahead, it also could help hold him in first place through Tuesday's primary vote.\n\n4. Ambiguity on waterboarding (except Trump)\n\nIn a line of questioning about ISIS and foreign policy, moderator David Muir turned the conversation to an issue many Americans first encountered more than a decade ago. Pointing out that Cruz has in the past said that torture is wrong, unambiguously, period, Muir asked, Senator Cruz, is waterboarding torture?\n\nCruz responded that under the definition of torture, it's not.\n\nBut he was ambiguous when Muir followed up by asking if he would bring the practice back as president: I would not bring it back in any sort of widespread use, he said.\n\nTrump, meanwhile, was more forceful. Referencing people chopping the heads off Christians, he said waterboarding (and then some) would be justified.\n\nI would bring back waterboarding, and I would bring back a hell of a lot worse than waterboarding, he said.\n\nBush, who as Muir pointed out has in the past has said he you won't rule waterboarding out, seemed to rule it out this time, saying he wouldn't bring the practice back. Instead, he said, what we need to do is to make sure that we expand our intelligence capabilities.\n\nMuir finally turned to Rubio. Noting that Rubio has said that he didn't want to want to telegraph to the enemy his tactics as commander-in-chief, Muir asked Rubio if waterboarding is torture. Rubio never directly answered the question, but instead repeated that he didn't want to give away to the U.S.'s enemies what he'd want to do.\n\nIt is true, we should not be discussing in a widespread way the exact tactics that we're going to use, because that allows terrorist to know to practice how to evade us, he said. He then pivoted to attacking President Obama's plan to close the detention center at Guantanamo Bay.\n\n5. Cruz was on defense\n\nCruz, fresh off a strong victory in Iowa, found himself on the defensive immediately in Saturday night's Republican debate in Manchester, N.H. First, he was asked to answer his comments that Donald Trump does not have the temperament to be president. Cruz demurred, saying that was for the voters to decide.\n\nThen, moderators asked him to answer for voicemails, emails, and text messages that his campaign sent out on the night of the Iowa caucuses, reporting that Ben Carson was suspending his campaign.\n\nCruz, whose campaign has confirmed that it sent the messages, explained that it was based on a CNN report that Carson was taking a break after Iowa, as Cruz said, adding that CNN said it was a highly unusual move.\n\nEarlier in the week, CNN said that Cruz's characterizations of the network's reports this past week were false. And Saturday night, CNN posted a story with the headline, Ted Cruz is wrong about CNN's reporting. The network explained that CNN reporter Chris Moody tweeted on the night of the caucuses that Carson was going home to Florida, but then shortly thereafter added that Carson was not suspending the campaign.\n\nCruz apologized on stage to Carson. For his part, Carson had said the incident was indicative of Cruz's DC values.\n\nWashington ethics basically says, 'If it's legal you do what you need to do in order to win,' Carson said at the debate. That's not my ethics. My ethics say you do what's right.
Will HealthCare.gov Get A California-Style Makeover?\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Allen J. Schaben/LA Times via Getty Images Allen J. Schaben/LA Times via Getty Images\n\nWhen 28-year-old Charis Hill discovered that the cost of medication to treat her degenerative arthritis had risen to $2,000 a month, she chose to be in pain instead.\n\nI felt like an invalid, said Hill, who lives in Sacramento and at the time had only catastrophic health coverage. She said the month without the medicine made it hard to get out of bed.\n\nPaying for drugs isn't a problem for Hill now. She has a more robust Covered California health plan, and she gets assistance from a drug company.\n\nAs of the first of this year, she won't have to worry about sticker shock if she switches medications either. All Covered California plans now have a cap on how much patients pay for drugs: $250 a month in silver, gold and platinum plans; $500 a month in bronze plans, the least expensive ones.\n\nI could try a better treatment, said Hill, a patient advocate, who says she is exploring that because her symptoms are becoming more severe. The $250 is something I know that I can always fall back on.\n\nThe copay cap on drugs is just one way Covered California chose to shape the health insurance marketplace this year. The California exchange uses more of its purchasing power to get what it wants than the vast majority of exchanges in other states. That means it decides which insurers can join the exchange, what plans and benefits are available and at what price.\n\nThe federal government — in proposed rules for 2017 — has signaled it too wants to have more of a hand in crafting plans. Though there are no hints HealthCare.gov will go as far as a monthly drug copay cap, it would be forging ahead on a path California already blazed — swapping variety for simplicity in plan design.\n\nNot letting [health] plans define what's right for consumers, but defining it on behalf of consumers ... is a better model for the market, says Peter Lee, executive director of Covered California. We want to make sure every consumer has good choice but not infinite choice.\n\nMost other states, including those in the federal exchange, haven't subscribed to that idea so far. They have a clearinghouse model, in which all health insurers and plan designs are accepted as long they comply with the Affordable Care Act. That can mean the same insurer offers multiple plans with slightly different premiums, deductibles and copays. Even within one metal tier, say silver, the same insurer might offer half a dozen slightly different plans. (Obamacare plans come in four tiers, from bronze, with the most limited benefits, to platinum, with the most.)\n\nNow, the federal government proposes to create standard cost-sharing designs in various metal tiers and make them easily accessible on HealthCare.gov. And it's considering how to improve value by being more selective about plans.\n\nA simplified marketplace, the feds say, will make it easier to choose high-quality health insurance.\n\nMany consumers ... find the large variety of cost-sharing structures available on the Exchanges difficult to navigate, the proposed rules say. We believe that standardized options will provide these consumers the opportunity to make simpler comparisons.\n\nThe proposal signals a big change.\n\nUp until now the federal marketplace has really taken a hands-off approach in shaping the marketplace, said Sabrina Corlette, research professor at Georgetown University's Center on Health Insurance Reforms. The new proposed rule says 'You know what? We actually are going to become more of an active purchaser.'\n\nCalifornia's Approach\n\nCovered California holds insurers to a higher bar than what's required under the Affordable Care Act. It negotiates premium prices down and requires quality goals to be met. Health plans must participate in health-disparity workgroups, collect information about enrollees' health status and monitor rates of preventive health services use. In the first two years, California's exchange rejected multiple health insurance carriers.\n\nCovered California says it's the only exchange in the country that requires all plans to be standardized (not just some, which the federal government is proposing). All gold tier plans, for instance, have the same costs for lab tests, doctors' visits and deductibles.\n\nThere was always a suspicion like, 'Oh, is that plan $80 more a month because it covers more?' said Anthony Wright, of the advocacy group, Health Access. And it was almost impossible to know. Whereas now people know 'Okay, these are basically the same plans.'\n\nPrice negotiations with insurers have paid off, according to Covered California. During 2016 plan year negotiations, insurers reduced premiums by 1 percent to 9 percent, said Lee. The exchange says this will result in $200 million in savings for premium payers and taxpayers this year.\n\nCovered California average premium increases have been on par with the increases in other states, according to the private health care consulting firm, Avalere Health. It says this year's 4 percent overall average increase was particularly low in comparison.\n\nBut national researchers say the downward pressure on premiums may be more indicative of competition than the exchange's negotiating power.\n\nAn Industry Partner?\n\nHealth insurers in California acknowledge there's more red tape if they sell in the subsidized marketplace there, but surprisingly, they don't complain.\n\nIn fact, a California insurance trade group says it sees the exchange as a partner, and active purchasing as valuable for establishing ground rules.\n\nSo far in California, it has worked, said Charles Bacchi, president and CEO of the California Association of Health Plans.\n\nThe rules allowed new plans to get into the individual market, he says, and provided more security in knowing what the playing field was.\n\nAt the same time, Bacchi said, health plans don't always agree with the exchange's decisions.\n\nThere is give and take, he said.\n\nBlue Shield of California, which in 2015 had 25 percent of the exchange's enrollment, says it's very happy with its relationship with Covered California.\n\nApplying to sell through Covered California creates different work than was required before, said Ken Wood, Senior Vice President of Consumer Markets at Blue Shield of California, adding that he applauds its approach. But the business is worth it, he said. Covered California gives insurers access to more than a million consumers, whose monthly premiums are largely subsidized by government.\n\nAnd the standard benefits is an enormous simplification for consumers, he said.\n\nBut one of two health insurance regulators in California, the state Department of Insurance, said Covered California's strict guidelines may not benefit consumers.\n\nIt has created a situation in which the exchange has fewer carriers than would otherwise be the case, said Janice Rocco, deputy commissioner of the California Department of Insurance.\n\nMore insurers in the marketplace for the first two years would have had an impact on price in the long term, said Rocco.\n\nClosely Watching California\n\nFederal administrators may be trying to adopt active purchasing rules before the new presidential administration takes office, said Corlette, and California's example may make it more politically feasible.\n\nThere's no question that the feds are closely watching the California experience, said Corlette, commenting on Covered California's ability to keep insurers in the marketplace and hold down premiums.\n\nThe federal rules also name other active purchasing exchanges as models however, including New York, Massachusetts and other state-based exchanges.\n\nHealth insurers on a national level are strongly opposed to an active purchaser model for states served by HealthCare.gov, including standardized benefits.\n\nIt could discourage many from enrolling if they can't find a policy that works best for them, said Clare Krusing from America's Health Insurance Plans.\n\nWhere there is competition and choice is where consumers benefit and where health plans benefit, said Krusing.\n\nResearchers raise other logistical and market concerns. Caroline Pearson, senior vice president of Avalere Health, said the risk of losing insurers under active purchasing is significant.\n\nRight now the federal government needs to focus on increasing enrollment and maintaining plan participation, said Pearson.\n\nStreamlining benefits like medical service copays could get tricky when spanning across more than 30 states with different economies, said Corlette.\n\nWhat Consumers Say\n\nNot all of Covered California's actions have been met with applause. Consumer advocates say they're still concerned about the high deductible in Covered California's Bronze plans, an amount the exchange chose to raise for 2016 plans. But at the same time, advocates appreciate that policy decisions aren't being made in the back room of an insurance company.\n\nCovered California has put itself apart from other states in that it is willing to be aggressive and do what's right, said arthritis patient and advocate Charis Hill.\n\nShe said she's glad Covered California reminds insurance companies that they exist to serve patients: If they're not doing their job, then somebody's going to step in.\n\nA version of this story first appeared on Kaiser Health News. Pauline Bartolone is a reporter for CALmatters, a nonprofit, nonpartisan media venture explaining California's policies and politics.
Trump Faces Most Consequential Day Of His Presidency So Far\n\ntoggle caption Andrew Harnik/AP\n\nThroughout the campaign, President Trump billed himself as a master negotiator who would make the best deals for the American people.\n\nThat reputation and the reach of the president's bully pulpit face a tough test Friday after he gave House Republicans an ultimatum to vote to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act — or leave Obamacare in place.\n\nA vote is now expected sometime Friday afternoon, though the GOP plan known as the American Health Care Act still remains in limbo as members on both the right and the center of the Republican caucus find parts of it difficult to stomach.\n\nAfter a caucus meeting late Thursday, however, there were signs the stalemate was beginning to thaw. Some members suggested that the White House's ultimatum might have pushed some legislators to realize that this is perhaps their make-or-break moment to fulfill a campaign promise they've long been running on.\n\nIn politics there is always another day, but there are certain critical moments where things come to a head, and I think tomorrow is one of those moments, one of those test moments for this conference, Rep. Tom Cole, R-Okla., said after House Republicans met Thursday night. I hope we're up to it.\n\nHouse Debate Of GOP Health Bill Is Underway PBS NewsHour via YouTube\n\nIt's one thing to be in the fight and try to score a touchdown, but sometimes on the fourth down, you kick the field goal, said Rep. Joe Barton, R-Texas. It's a good bill and we should vote for it.\n\nThe looming showdown follows a tumultuous day that saw a long-promised vote on the Republican alternative bill — originally slated for the seventh anniversary of Obamacare's signing — hurriedly postponed after it became clear there weren't enough votes to pass it.\n\nGOP leaders and the Trump White House have been wooing the ideological opposite ends of the House Republican caucus to try to salvage a deal. But the attempts to meet the demands of the conservative House Freedom Caucus — who are under pressure from conservative interest groups not to bend — and the most moderate members of the Tuesday Group — who could face electoral backlash in 2018 in their swing districts — were often at odds.\n\nFreedom Caucus members were signaling late Thursday night that some of their demands were being met. An amendment released after the GOP meeting would repeal essential health benefits and let states set their own standards for that part of health insurance coverage for individuals purchasing coverage with a tax credit. It would also provide additional money for a fund for mental health and substance abuse disorders and maternity care.\n\nBut some of those concessions — namely the repeal of essential health benefits in Obamacare — could also be nonstarters with more centrist Republicans.\n\nI do not think that it lowers premiums and I do not think that it covers enough people, Rep. Leonard Lance, R-N.J., told NPR's Kelly McEvers on All Things Considered Thursday before the conference meeting. Lance represents one of 23 GOP-held districts that Trump did not carry last November and is expected to be a top Democratic target in 2018.\n\nTrump has lobbied members on the bill but has seemed reluctant to put his full political weight behind the issue and at times appeared daunted by the task before him. Nobody knew that health care could be so complicated, the president bemoaned last month, an incredulous statement to anyone who knows how intricate and nuanced health care policy really is.\n\nHe has hit the campaign trail with full-fledged campaign rallies to try to generate support for the bill, but at his appearance this week in Louisville, Ky., Trump barely even touched on the subject.\n\nAnd, perhaps most telling, for a man who loves putting his name on everything from skyscrapers to steaks, he has eschewed the moniker Trumpcare for the GOP's effort to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act.\n\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan also has a lot of political capital riding on the outcome of Friday's vote. He has tried to work with a president he withdrew support from during the campaign, but if the vote fails it could destroy the already fragile relationship between the two and ignite a blame game between the White House and GOP congressional leaders. There were already signs that was beginning to happen Thursday night, with the New York Times reporting that Trump has told his aides he regrets going along with Ryan's push to overhaul health care before tackling tax cuts and other legislative issues.\n\nThe frustration and exhaustion of the political brinkmanship pushed almost entirely by the White House was evident on Ryan's face as he emerged from the Republican conference meeting Thursday evening. He didn't take any questions from reporters and simply spouted off a terse statement: For 7 1/2 years we have been promising the American people that we will repeal and replace this broken law because it's collapsing and it's failing families. And tomorrow we're proceeding.\n\nUltimately, the House vote could be an exercise in legislative futility. If the bill does pass, it will be changed in the Senate, where it also faces an uphill battle. And this is just Part 1 of the three-part plan by Republicans to overhaul and replace Obamacare.\n\nBut if the first bill dies in the House, the broader message could be devastating for both Trump and House Republicans. The failure would signal that they haven't yet found a way to govern in Washington despite finally holding both the White House and control of Congress. The setback would spell doom for many of Trump's other priorities, including tax reform, and exacerbate what's already been a bad week for the White House, which began with FBI Director James Comey confirming to Congress that the agency is investigating possible ties between the Trump campaign and the Russian government.\n\nIn many ways, Republicans have backed themselves into a no-win situation. If they rush to pass an unpopular bill riddled with problems, they're giving Democrats plenty of ammunition to use in the midterm elections, and GOP members on defense at town halls over health care could be further put on their heels. But if the bill fails, the discord and disarray in the GOP overshadowed by Trump's unlikely win last November will only be magnified, and this could be just the beginning of headaches for Republicans at both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue.\n\nNPR's Barbara Sprunt contributed to this report.
Trump Calls For Major Rewite Of The Tax Code During Stop In Missouri\n\nRachel Martin talks to Stephen Moore of the Heritage Foundation about President Trump's push to overhaul the nation's tax system. The plan was largely short on specifics.\n\nRACHEL MARTIN, HOST:\n\nPresident Donald Trump is making his pitch to overhaul the nation's tax system. He laid out his vision yesterday in Springfield, Mo. And with Congress back in session next week, he included a message for them.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: So this is our once in a generation opportunity to deliver real tax reform for everyday hardworking Americans. And I am fully committed to working with Congress to get this job done. And I don't want to be disappointed by Congress. Do you understand me?\n\nMARTIN: The president's plan included cuts to the corporate tax rate and individual taxes. But it was fairly short on specifics. We're going to get specifics, I bet, from Stephen Moore. He's an economist with the Heritage Foundation. He's on the line now. Hey, Stephen.\n\nSTEPHEN MOORE: Good morning, Rachel.\n\nMARTIN: So the president - this isn't the first time he's talked about taxes. I mean, he has discussed this in public settings for months - the fact that he wants tax reform. And in particular, he wants to cut the corporate tax rate down to 15 percent. Did you hear anything new in this address yesterday?\n\nMOORE: Well, I think that what was new was this kind of call to action. And, look, the president suffered a stinging defeat a month ago on the Obamacare repeal, which was a high priority. I would make the case this is probably a second highest priority is getting this tax cut done.\n\nAnd and one of the mistakes I think Donald Trump made on healthcare reform was he kind of let Congress do its thing and kind of sat back. And I think what this signaled yesterday was - is that he's going to pay a much more active role in getting this passed. And he's going to try to, you know, call his troops into action across the country to, you know, to lobby for this.\n\nAnd he was in Missouri yesterday where Democratic Senator Claire McCaskill is up for re-election. She's a moderate Democrat. One of the points he made in this speech was, you know, tell your senator to vote for this tax cut. So he'll be more actively involved.\n\nMARTIN: But at the same time, he, in that same speech, said we shouldn't make this about partisan politics. As you note, he was in Claire McCaskill's backyard.\n\nMOORE: Right (laughter), right. So the question you would ask me is about the specifics of the plan. And the truth is that right now as we speak, the Senate leaders, the House leaders and the treasury secretary are still hammering out the details of this.\n\nNow, as you know Rachel, I worked with Donald Trump on this tax proposal back a year ago during the campaign. It looks like what they're going to come up with is very similar to what you just described - a reduction in the corporate tax rate, which I think is really important for the economy. We have the highest statutory corporate rate of any country in the world.\n\nMARTIN: How do you pay for it, Stephen? I mean, that's a big question. How do you pay for it?\n\nMOORE: Right (laughter). Well, hopefully, by - number - two ways - by closing loopholes in the system. We have a high tax rate system in the United States. But we have a lot of loopholes. So some industries pay very little tax. And others play - pay very high tax. That's not fair.\n\nPeople want a system - by the way, I should say that, you know, in a lot of the polling and focus grouping that's been done on taxes, what Americans really care about is fairness and growth. They want a tax system that encourages more job growth. But they also want something where everybody essentially pays their fair share. And the business tax system doesn't do that.\n\nAs I said, you know, some industries, like retail, pay a very, very high tax rate. And other industries that have loopholes and carve outs pay very little - so getting rid of the loopholes. And the other way is to try to put Americans, you know, back to work so that they - when more people are working, you get more tax revenues.\n\nAnd it's not insignificant that yesterday, you know, it was reported the economy grew by 3 percent. If you can get the economy to stay at 3 to 3.5 percent, you'll get a lot more revenue.\n\nMARTIN: Which would be a really big deal. That would be significant.

Here's Why Democrats Are Confident They'll Win The House\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Mark Wilson/Getty Images Mark Wilson/Getty Images\n\nDemocrats appear confident they'll take back the House majority next Tuesday — a fact top Republican strategists all but concede privately less than a week before Election Day.\n\nUp until today I would have said if the election was held today we would win. Now I'm saying we will win, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said Tuesday night on CBS's The Late Show with Stephen Colbert.\n\nAlthough nearly all of the competitive races remain close, conversations with several Democratic and GOP strategists, as well as public opinion polls, campaign finance reports and historic trends, all point to a strong Democratic showing in the House.\n\nDemocrats are running particularly well in suburban districts, where independents and many suburban women want to send a message of dissatisfaction to President Trump. This is having an outsize impact because many of these districts were drawn to favor the GOP and now comprise the bulk of the competitive races.\n\nRepublicans did see a slight increase in enthusiasm in the wake of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh's testy confirmation hearing a month ago, but it has largely evaporated in the final weeks of the race, both Democrats and Republicans say. The exception is in more rural districts and traditionally red areas.\n\nThose rural areas define the Senate battleground states, which means it's possible Democrats could have a very good night in the House and lose seats in the Senate.\n\nIf you look around and much of your district or state has got a lot of barns, you're probably in pretty good shape, but if you see a lot of cul-de-sacs, you've got a big challenge, said one top GOP pollster.\n\nHere's what to watch for on election night when it comes to the battle for the House:\n\nThe (many) open seats\n\nMany of the likeliest Democratic pickups will come from Republican seats vacated by either retirements or members running for higher office. There are about 40 open GOP seats — a record — and many are in highly vulnerable areas that were already swing districts or slightly tilted to the GOP.\n\nThe fact that so many members chose not to run again reflected an expectation in many cases that this would be a tough year for Republicans, since midterms typically are for the party in control of the White House. Dating back to World War II, a president's party has lost an average of 29 seats in his first midterm election, and 44 seats if his approval rating is below 50 percent, like Trump.\n\nRepublicans already struggled to hold on to open seats during special elections this year in favorable GOP territory. While they still won eight of the nine special congressional elections in districts held by Republicans, the massive shift toward Democrats in places Trump had carried by upwards of 20 points was notable — and early, concrete evidence of a growing Democratic enthusiasm gap.\n\nRepublican strategists concede — and public and private polls confirm — that the seats of retiring Reps. Darrell Issa in California's 49th District, Ileana Ros-Lehtinen in Florida's 27th District, Frank LoBiondo in New Jersey's 2nd District and Rodney Frelinghuysen in New Jersey's 11th District are probably gone, as is Arizona's 2nd District, the seat of Rep. Martha McSally, who is running for Senate.\n\nA combination of court-ordered redistricting and retirements will likely give Democrats at least a net of two seats in Pennsylvania.\n\nAll of that would get Democrats nearly a third of the seats they need.\n\nThe GOP has a few pickup opportunities of their own, largely in very Trump-friendly areas like rural Minnesota where they could flip two open Democratic seats. But they have far fewer offensive chances than Democrats have in a map with roughly 80 or more competitive seats.\n\nSuburban stall\n\nThe Republicans' weakest areas on the congressional map come in well-educated, diversifying and affluent suburbs. Many of these, in places just outside major cities such as Dallas, Houston, Denver, Kansas City, Minnesota's Twin Cities, Chicago and Washington, D.C., had swung hard from voting for Mitt Romney in 2012 to either against or narrowly for Trump four years later.\n\nWhile the Kavanaugh fight may have energized the base in some states, in the suburbs it may have had the opposite effect, especially with college-educated white women who were already severely frustrated with Trump. Immigration remains a fault line in these areas, too, and Trump's doubling down on the issue in the final stretch isn't helping the GOP in those congressional races.\n\nUltimately, this is where the House will be won or lost, and there are at least a handful of GOP incumbents in these areas that most Republicans and Democrats agree are sure to lose, including some members that have withstood strong headwinds before.\n\nAtop that list is Rep. Mike Coffman in Colorado's 6th District, who has beaten the odds before, but now is likely to lose his suburban Denver district that voted for Hillary Clinton by 9 points. Trump's approval rating there is in the 30s, showing just how much of a drag the president may be in the suburbs.\n\nMinnesota Rep. Erik Paulsen has never really faced a tough challenge in the 3rd District, which includes suburbs of the Twin Cities. But Clinton won this district by almost 10 points in 2016, and Republicans say the tide may simply be too high there. The same is true for neighboring Minnesota Rep. Jason Lewis in the 2nd District. Though he's only in his first term, he has a history of controversial comments and is the underdog in a rematch with 2016 Democratic opponent Angie Craig, who would be the first openly lesbian mom to serve in Congress if she wins.\n\nOther probable GOP losses include Reps. Peter Roskam in Illinois' 6th District, Barbara Comstock in Virginia's 10th District, Kevin Yoder in Kansas' 3rd District, Rod Blum in Iowa's 1st District, and Keith Rothfus in Pennsylvania's 17th District, who's in a matchup with Democratic Rep. Conor Lamb due to redistricting.\n\nWave watching\n\nWhich way other toss-up seats go is what will determine whether a blue wave delivers a big Democratic majority in 2019. Republicans aren't feeling good about many of those contests in the closing days — which could mean the difference between something like a 28- or 30-seat majority, or as many as 40 to 45 seats.\n\nThe close races tend break the same way, said another Republican strategist. Even seats that we felt much better about a week ago are on the edge again.\n\nAmong those seats trending away from the GOP include Pete Sessions in Texas' 32nd District, Carlos Curbelo in Florida's 26th District, Randy Hultgren in Illinois' 14th District, John Faso in New York's 19th District, Claudia Tenney in New York's 22nd District, Bruce Poliquin in Maine's 2nd District, Jeff Denham in California's 10th District, Mimi Walters in California's 45th District, Leonard Lance in New Jersey's 7th District and Tom MacArthur in New Jersey's 3rd District.\n\nThere are some Republicans in districts Clinton won who look like they will survive any wave forming — among them are Will Hurd in Texas and David Valadao in California.\n\nIn some districts that Trump won comfortably, even by double digits, Republicans could lose. That includes open seats in North Carolina's 2nd District and Florida's 15th District, along with Reps. Andy Barr in Kentucky's 6th District, Brian Mast in Florida's 18th District, and Rob Woodall in Georgia's 7th District, who Republicans complain hasn't been taking his race seriously enough.\n\nClosing arguments\n\nDemocratic candidates have had a fairly consistent message throughout the cycle — hammering Republicans over their vote to repeal the Affordable Care Act and support for the tax bill they say favors the wealthy over middle class Americans.\n\nOn health care, it's a big shift given that passing Obamacare is largely what cost Democrats the House in the 2010 midterms. Now, there's been a more favorable turn in public opinion on the law since Obama left office and Republicans tried to repeal it.\n\nAfter the GOP's plan to replace the law with a version that would have weakened protections for people with pre-existing conditions failed last year, it has become a winning issue for Democrats. So much so that Republicans have been running ads in the final stretch arguing they would fight for pre-existing conditions, even though most voted for the GOP bill which wouldn't fully do that.\n\nThe Republicans' fate in the House was sealed on May 4, 2017, when they stood in the White House Rose Garden and threw a keg party to celebrate rolling back protections for pre-existing conditions, said one veteran Democratic congressional strategist.\n\nUltimately, Republicans have struggled to land on a cohesive argument to voters, and the tax bill hasn't been the silver bullet they hoped it would be, especially with independent voters.\n\nFurther complicating their efforts are President Trump's unpredictable tweets and his pivot to scare tactics over immigration and a push to end birthright citizenship, which top GOP strategists were aghast over this week. That base-focused message could help in deep red states needed to hold the Senate, but it could be a disaster in marginal seats with heavy Hispanic populations.\n\nThe headwinds were already massive, and I think this birthright stuff is going to hurt badly in some of these districts in Florida, Arizona, California and Texas, bemoaned one longtime House GOP strategist.\n\nStill, how successful Democrats can be will depend on turnout, which in the past has favored Republicans with older, whiter voters being the most reliable to come out in midterm years.\n\nDemocrats say they're confident that Hispanics and young voters will show up. But if they don't, Republicans could stave off big losses.
What If The Polls Are Wrong Again? 4 Scenarios For What Might Happen In The Elections\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Scott Olson/Getty Images Scott Olson/Getty Images\n\nThere's a lot that can happen Tuesday, the culmination of a long midterm election campaign that will provide the first nationwide measure of the U.S. electorate since Donald Trump was elected president.\n\nOne narrative has become dominant: that Democrats are likely to gain control of the House and Republicans hold the Senate, if not expand their majority there. That narrative is based largely on national polls, and caution should be urged. Pollsters have made a lot of adjustments to hopefully correct what they got wrong in 2016, but they can't tell you precisely who is going to show up to vote.\n\nWhat's more, there have been far fewer statewide and district-specific surveys than in past midterm elections. And, as it is, there are data both parties can take solace in that buoy their respective cases. So everyone should be prepared for surprises — because there always are some. That's the beauty of campaigns and voting.\n\nHere are four scenarios for how election night might play out and what each could mean.\n\n1. Democrats win the House, and Republicans hold the Senate\n\nThis is the most likely outcome, based not just on the polls but also on conversations with strategists in both parties. But they urge caution, because the races in the many districts across the country that are up for grabs are still very close.\n\nHow it would happen: Forget the polls; Democrats are favored to take back the House for more reasons than that. There have been a record number of retirements, reducing the built-in advantage incumbents tend to have; record numbers of candidates, especially Democratic women, have run for public office; Democrats won the off-year elections in Virginia and New Jersey; they won or fared better than expected in special elections across the country; there was high primary turnout for Democrats in many states; and there is very high early voting turnout.\n\nAnd just look at how wide the playing field is — Democrats need to pick up 23 seats to take back the House, and they are targeting some 80 Republican-held seats. Republicans are competing in just eight held by Democrats. That right there is and has been a huge flashing red light for the GOP. So many of those races are running through the suburbs, where independents and wealthy, college-educated women live, both of which have consistently in polling said they disapproved of the job the president is doing and prefer to vote for a Democrat in their district.\n\nOne other overlooked number from the last NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll: Just 54 percent of Republican women who are registered voters said they were very enthusiastic about voting in this election. Compare that with 78 percent of Republican men who are registered voters. And where do a lot of those women live? The suburbs. If GOP women, an important group that Republicans need to bolster them, stay home, that's one way Democrats clean up in the House.\n\nIn the Senate, on the other hand, Republicans have a very favorable landscape and are competing in conservative states held by Democrats. The fundamentals favor the GOP in these states, and if Republicans win where they should win, they will hold the Senate.\n\nWhat it would mean: This would be a huge win for Democrats, as they'd be able to gum up Trump's agenda and begin to investigate his administration, something the GOP has not done very much of. In the Senate, Republicans could still approve federal judges and Trump Supreme Court nominees, but if they want to get any big legislation done they're going to have to negotiate with Democrats in the House, and possibly a Speaker Nancy Pelosi.\n\nDemocrats feel they need to limit the losses in the Senate. If they can hold Republicans to net even, keeping the Senate at 51-49, or maybe lose a net of one seat, then they will be very happy. They have a much more favorable Senate landscape in 2020 and believe they will be able to take back the Senate then.\n\n2. Republicans hold the House and Senate\n\nThis would be a huge win for the GOP.\n\nHow it would happen: A record turnout is expected Tuesday — perhaps higher than any time in the past 50 years for a midterm — but, as in 2016, Trump voters would have to dominate. Rural voters would have to turn out at higher-than-expected rates, causing the polls to be wrong (again). Meanwhile, young voters and Latinos would have to stay home. (It is supposed to rain on the East Coast Tuesday, which could depress low-propensity-voter turnout.)\n\nAll of those close House races would have to tip Republicans' way, something that's very possible given the conservative lean of those districts and the distrust of the media, purposefully stoked by the president. And who pays for polls for the most part? Big media organizations.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Alex Wong/Getty Images Alex Wong/Getty Images\n\nWhat it would mean: President Trump and Republicans would step on the gas, validated by an election cycle dominated by negative news coverage and polling that said the GOP had its back against the wall. The Affordable Care Act (aka Obamacare) would very likely be repealed once and for all. And Trump could set his sights on ousting Attorney General Jeff Sessions and other key figures at the Justice Department, possibly ending the department's investigation of Russia's attack on the 2016 election.\n\nWhat's more, Trump's strategy of demonizing immigrants would have worked — again. That was rewarded, and what message would that send? He is only going to do more of it between Wednesday and November 2020 when he stands for re-election.\n\nIt would also be yet another reckoning for pollsters and media organizations that pay for the surveys. The polls currently show Democrats with a razor-thin, but consistent advantage heading into Election Day. But if the polls are wrong, it should induce more than a shoulder shrug from outlets that conduct them and the news media organizations that report on them.\n\n3. Democrats win both the House and Senate\n\nThis is not seen as the likeliest of scenarios, but it's not out of the realm of possibility either. It would very likely mean a massive wave and a massive shift against Trump and Republicans tied to him nationally.\n\nA lot would have to happen, especially in the Senate, for this to happen.\n\nHow it would happen: The path for Democrats in the House is through the suburbs, as in Scenario 1. That doesn't change. But for Democrats to pull this off in the Senate, not only would voters have to side with Democratic incumbents in conservative states, but Democratic challengers would have to win in places like Nevada and Arizona, and possibly Tennessee and Texas.\n\nWhat it would mean: It would be a repudiation of Trump and the Republicans tied to him nationwide. It would have to trigger a degree of soul-searching — in at least some Republican corners.\n\nTrump would be faced with the choice of moderating and working with Democrats or being a lame-duck president starting in January 2019 when a new Democratic Congress is sworn in — as talk ramps up about Democratic 2020 challengers.\n\n4. Overtime\n\nIt's very possible control of both the House and Senate will not be clear on election night.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Joe Sohm/Visions of America/UIG via Getty Images Joe Sohm/Visions of America/UIG via Getty Images\n\nHow it would happen: There are a half-dozen congressional races in California, for example, that are very close heading into Election Day. It's possible those races are so close they will not be called on election night. They might not be called for days and possibly weeks later, especially because the vote there is counted slowly.\n\nAdditionally, early and absentee ballots can get counted slowly and there is growing concern that many voters' absentee and mailed ballots could be rejected. In 2016, to the surprise of many, 319,000 absentee ballots were rejected for one reason or another.\n\nIn the Senate, depending on how results from other races shake out, there is the possibility that control is not known on election night or for weeks after. Specifically, it could all come down to Mississippi. There, no candidate is polling above 50 percent heading into Election Day, and if no one gets at least 50 percent, the race heads to a runoff three weeks later.\n\nWhat it would mean: Imagine a scenario in which Democrats lead 50-49 on Election Day in the Senate, and the eyes of the country — and the deep pockets of out-of-state money — descend on Mississippi. The consequences would be enormous, the rancor pitched and the tension thick.
Setting The Record Straight In Another Week Of Trump And Coronavirus\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Jim Watson/AFP via Getty Images Jim Watson/AFP via Getty Images\n\nEaster is next Sunday, April 12. But the country isn't close to being opened up by then, as President Trump said he'd like to see during a March 24 news conference, a suggestion that was panned by experts.\n\nInstead, the country has gone the opposite direction. Dr. Anthony Fauci of the National Institutes of Health and coronavirus task force coordinator Dr. Deborah Birx are warning that 100,000 Americans or more could die from COVID-19.\n\nHearing those numbers, Trump endorsed strict stay-at-home measures remain in place for at least another month. It was yet another stunning reversal from Trump, whose messaging at the helm of the government's response to the novel coronavirus pandemic has been like whiplash.\n\nMixed in with that inconsistency have been a host of claims and suggestions that have been exaggerated, misleading or lacking in full context.\n\nHere are five fact checks and stories that set the record straight this week:\n\n1. Should We All Be Wearing Masks In Public? Health Experts Revisit The Question\n\nThis has become the question a lot of Americans are asking. The government has changed its tune in its recommendations on this, saying first that it wasn't necessary, but now suggests that wearing face coverings might be advisable to slow the spread.\n\nI can tell you that the data and this issue of whether it's going to contribute [to prevention] is being aggressively reviewed as we speak, Robert Redfield, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, told NPR on Monday.\n\nTrump this week encouraged people to wear scarves. So what's the deal? On the one hand, wearing a mask in public may help tamp down the risk presented by people who may be infected but aren't yet showing symptoms, as NPR's Huo Jingnan, Allison Aubrey and Carmel Wroth reported.\n\nBut on the other: There's no definitive evidence from published research that wearing masks in public will protect the person wearing the mask from contracting diseases.\n\nWhat's more, while one expert said homemade masks, shawls and scarves might well be a good idea, the protection is likely minimal and they won't matter much, if at all, if they're made incorrectly or handled wrong.\n\nImportantly, N95 medical masks should go to front-line health care workers, and the supply of them overall is extremely limited.\n\n2. Ventilators Are No Panacea For Critically Ill COVID-19 Patients\n\nGovernors across the country are fighting for resources from the federal government, especially for ventilators.\n\nWe do not have enough ventilators. Period, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Friday. I am signing an executive order allowing the state to take ventilators and redistribute to hospitals in need.\n\nBut, for as important as ventilators are, NPR's Jon Hamilton reported this week: Most coronavirus patients who end up on ventilators go on to die, according to several small studies from the U.S., China and Europe. And many of the patients who continue to live can't be taken off the mechanical breathing machines.\n\nMore:\n\nThe largest study so far to look at mortality among coronavirus patients on ventilators was done by the Intensive Care National Audit & Research Centre in London. It found that among 98 ventilated patients in the U.K., just 33 were discharged alive. The numbers from a study of Wuhan, China, are even grimmer. Only 3 of 22 ventilated patients survived. And a study of 18 ventilated patients in Washington state found that nine were still alive when the study ended, but only six had recovered enough to breathe on their own.\n\nThe fact is, as Hamilton reports: Patients need a ventilator when their lungs can no longer deliver enough oxygen to keep the body going. And it's an extreme measure. That said: Ventilators have been seen as critical to treating coronavirus patients because the devices are very successful when used to treat common forms of pneumonia.\n\n3. FACT CHECK: Trump Claims U.S. Testing For Coronavirus Most Per Capita — It's Not\n\nThe United States has ramped up testing, but it still lags other countries, per capita. That didn't stop President Trump from boasting of the nation's testing.\n\nWe're now conducting well over 100,000 coronavirus tests per day, Trump said. It's over 100,000 tests a day. And these are accurate tests, and they're moving rapidly, which is more than any other country in the world, both in terms of the raw number and also on a per-capita basis, the most.\n\nIt may be true that the United States is now testing more per day than other countries per capita, although probably not as much as Germany. But it is less relevant than the fact that America got a late start to testing, which left the country vulnerable, and that the United States overall still lags other countries, per capita.\n\nThe U.S. had tested about 1 in 273 Americans, as of Thursday, lower than South Korea (1 in 119), Italy (1 in 104) and Germany (1 in 90).\n\n4. FACT CHECK: Trump On Not Expanding Insurance, Democrats And Health Care\n\nIf there's one topic that Democrats have debated in their primaries since 2007 — and certainly heavily in 2019 and 2020 — it's health care.\n\nSpecifically, Democrats have burrowed in on how to make health insurance affordable for those who don't qualify for Medicaid and don't have an employer-based insurance plan.\n\nIt was almost entirely what the Affordable Care Act was trying to address.\n\nYet, when asked what the federal government planned to do about that gap as some of those people try to get coronavirus treatment, President Trump did not say he would reopen Obamacare exchanges.\n\nInstead, he said this: They're talking about it in the 2020 election too and nobody's gotten to it. Nobody's talked about it at all. I think we're going to get to it. I don't think the other group will get to it. They haven't even spoken about it.\n\n5. FACT CHECK: Premature — Trump Continues To Claim Drug Can Treat Coronavirus\n\nEveryone wants a cure, a treatment to the novel coronavirus. But there is no treatment that's proven to work yet and a vaccine is still a year to a year and a half off.\n\nThat hasn't stopped President Trump from touting the possibilities of hydroxychloroquine, a drug used to treat lupus and to prevent malaria that, NPR's Dan Charles reports, medical experts have warned against buying for the purpose of treating COVID-19, because it might exhaust supplies for people who actually need it.\n\nIt's looking like it's having some good results, Trump said Friday. I hope that, that would be a phenomenal thing.\n\nCharles reports that lab studies showed hydroxychloroquine blocked the coronavirus from entering cells, but there's no solid evidence ... that the drug actually is an effective COVID-19 treatment.\n\nAnd: Clinical trials of hydroxychloroquine have just recently started, and the scientists in charge of them have not reported any results as yet. That could take weeks.
'I Am Not Hostile To The ACA': Barrett Pushes Back On Democrats' Claims\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Greg Nash/Pool/Getty Images Greg Nash/Pool/Getty Images\n\nUpdated at 3:23 p.m. ET\n\nJudge Amy Coney Barrett's confirmation to the Supreme Court would, Democrats fear, imperil the Affordable Care Act, which has twice narrowly survived in the high court.\n\nThe ACA, which is also known as Obamacare, is scheduled to be argued once again before the Supreme Court a week after the Nov. 3 election. On Tuesday, during the second day of hearings at the Senate Judiciary Committee, Democrats repeatedly pressed Barrett on whether she'd made assurances to anyone about how she would rule on the ACA.\n\nAbsolutely not, she replied. I was never asked, and if I had been that would have been a short conversation.\n\nThe original challenge to the ACA centered on whether the individual mandate, which required most Americans to buy health insurance or pay a penalty, was constitutional. Chief Justice John Roberts, writing for the majority in 2012, ruled the penalty, which is collected by the IRS, constitutes a tax and therefore fell within Congress' purview.\n\nConservatives criticized that ruling, and in 2017 Barrett, at the time a law professor, wrote that Roberts pushed the Affordable Care Act beyond its plausible meaning to save the statute.\n\nOn Tuesday, Democrats brought up Barrett's critique of Roberts' majority opinion, implying that she opposed the ACA.\n\nI am not hostile to the ACA, Barrett replied, noting that the current case before the court deals with an entirely different matter altogether: severability, which examines whether a law can stand if part of it is struck down.\n\nThe issue in the case is this doctrine of severability, and that's not something that I have ever talked about with respect to the Affordable Care Act, she said. Honestly, I haven't written anything about severability that I know of at all.\n\nIndeed, the current case stems from Congress' decision to zero out the penalty for not having insurance and whether the Affordable Care Act has effectively been voided as a result.\n\nTexas argued that the Supreme Court saved the ACA by interpreting the penalty as a tax. Congress' elimination of the tax penalty, the state's lawyers argue, was tantamount to repealing the law — something Congress explicitly did not do. Texas, which is arguing that the court should invalidate the ACA, says the mandate could not be severed from the rest of the law.\n\nPaul Clement, the lawyer who argued on behalf of those challenging the law in the Supreme Court the first time, told NPR's Nina Totenberg that he thinks Texas' argument is a stretch: It's just hard for me to say that the mandate is central when it doesn't have any teeth, he said.\n\nIn his question period Tuesday, Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., argued that the two cases — the one from 2012 and the one headed for the court next month — are very similar and that Barrett's earlier commentary remains relevant.\n\nThe central issue before the court — believe it or not, somehow — will be the constitutionality of the mandate that's in some ways been the linchpin of its being upheld previously, he said.\n\nDemocrats set out to make health care central to Barrett's confirmation hearings. Sen. Mazie Hirono of Hawaii charged on NPR's Morning Edition that the ACA case is why Republicans are rushing the nomination through — so that Barrett would be on the court and rule against the health law.\n\nPeople are going to be without health care in the middle of a pandemic, no less, Hirono said.\n\nRepublican Sen. Ben Sasse of Nebraska accused Democrats on the panel of misrepresenting Barrett's comments on the previous Obamacare ruling and told NPR that focusing on the policy outcome of Barrett's legal argument ends up making judges and justices into policy advocates and into politicians.
Why Progressives Think Joe Biden Is Not 'Electable'\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Natalie Piserchio for NPR Natalie Piserchio for NPR\n\nJustin Krebs, a campaign director with MoveOn, isn't interested in hearing pundits debate which 2020 Democratic candidate is the most electable.\n\nBecause exactly four years ago right now there was a messy, crowded primary, with too many candidates, people who were totally unelectable, and Donald Trump was one of them and ended up winning, he pointed out.\n\nAnd in the same vein, many Democrats thought Barack Obama was unelectable until he started winning primaries in 2008.\n\nProgressives say this word electability is being used as a fear tactic to intimidate voters into choosing a moderate, centrist nominee, specifically, former Vice President Joe Biden. But many of the activists who gathered over the weekend at the Netroots Nation conference insisted that's a foolish strategy. Biden, who has consistently led in early polling, is potentially the worst option for the party, they say, warning that Democrats could repeat the mistakes of 2016.\n\nTheir main criticism of Biden is two-fold: He's too moderate on economic policy and has a complicated record on criminal justice and race.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Natalie Piserchio for NPR Natalie Piserchio for NPR\n\nThere isn't unanimous agreement among progressive activists about who they want as a nominee. Some remain deeply loyal to Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders for his role in pushing the party leftward. Others say they like the policy plans that Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren has been rolling out. And yet others say they like what California Sen. Kamala Harris represents — a black woman who could take on President Trump.\n\nBut where activists agree is on Biden — they would prefer almost any other 2020 Democrat over him.\n\nWhile they are purists in many ways, if Biden were to become the nominee, activists at Netroots said, they would vote for him, perhaps begrudgingly. Their fear is that others will not.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Natalie Piserchio for NPR Natalie Piserchio for NPR\n\nWe need to be able to build a coalition of voters that are excited, that are gonna turn out at historic levels, and we can't rely on it just being based on Trump being on the ballot; that won't be enough, said Maria Urbina, national political director for Indivisible. She didn't single Biden out by name, but she said whoever the nominee is, he or she has to energize the Democratic base, specifically young voters and minorities.\n\nActivists also point out that Republicans under a Trump administration have not toned down their rhetoric; why, they ask, should Democrats moderate their message?\n\nMany say that Hillary Clinton tried that strategy in 2016, and it clearly failed. They still ponder — maybe, if Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders had been the nominee, the Democrats could have won the White House.\n\nAllegra Dengler, a Democratic activist from Westchester County, N.Y., one of nearly 4,000 activists who attended Netroots Nation, says people including her own son didn't like Clinton. They were looking for a change-maker.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Jacqueline Larma/AP Jacqueline Larma/AP\n\nHer son voted for Trump in the 2016 election, but she says he would have voted for Sanders, if he had been the Democratic nominee.\n\nBiden doesn't seem like a change-maker to her, either.\n\nWe need to go to the future, she says. Why is he so popular? I have no idea. He's like a corporate Democrat from Delaware, which is like the corporate headquarters of everything.\n\nActivists say the party needs an inspirational candidate, and moderation doesn't inspire people.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Natalie Piserchio for NPR Natalie Piserchio for NPR\n\nIf you can afford for the world not to change, you take the slow approach, said Yvette Simpson, the CEO of Democracy for America. If you're a privileged few that can wait for 'Medicarefor All,' then maybe you can be a moderate, but we don't have time for that.\n\nSeveral major presidential candidates have adopted progressive ideas that were previously on the fringe of the Democratic Party, such as Medicare for All.\n\nBut one candidate who has not is Joe Biden. On Monday, he unveiled a health care plan that would build on the Affordable Care Act by expanding Medicaid and creating a more robust public option. It was a clear contrast to the more progressive alternative.\n\nI understand the appeal of Medicare for All, but folks supporting it should be clear that it means getting rid of Obamacare, and I'm not for that, Biden said in a video.\n\nHe warned that overhauling the system would be too risky.\n\nThe fight over health care is a proxy for the broader ideological battle in the Democratic Party with Sanders on one end and Biden on the other.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Charlie Neibergall/AP Charlie Neibergall/AP\n\nSanders has long championed a Medicare for All system. And he plans to deliver a speech on Wednesday to confront the opponents of Medicare for All.\n\nSanders' supporters feel that Biden's approach is too incremental and antiquated. The goal, progressives say, is not merely to maintain the ACA, but to establish universal health care.\n\nBut that's not the goal of most voters, who are more concerned about the cost of health care than the system itself, says Lanae Erickson, senior vice president of social policy and politics at the centrist think tank Third Way.\n\nIt gives a huge window for Donald Trump and Republicans to label Democrats as socialists and have that label stick, said Erickson, who's skeptical of how progressives are framing the debate.\n\nDemocrats, she says, have a clear road map to the White House in 2020 — they need to follow what they did in the 2018 midterms.\n\nThe margin for taking back the House came from people who switched their votes, not people who stayed home, so if we are going to win again and beat Donald Trump, we absolutely need to win some folks who are coming over from the other side, Erickson said.
News Brief: Trump Taxes, Amy Coney Barrett, TikTok Ban Blocked\n\nTrump dismisses published report that he paid little in federal income taxes. GOP aims to get Supreme Court nominee confirmed by election. And, U.S. judge halts Trump's TikTok ban before it started.\n\nRACHEL MARTIN, HOST:\n\nPresident Trump's whole sales pitch to voters has been about money. He has falsely claimed that he's a self-made billionaire, and that record of financial success makes him well-suited to be president. He was able to spin that story in large part because the public couldn't see his tax returns - until now.\n\nDAVID GREENE, HOST:\n\nThat's right. The New York Times says it has obtained about two decades worth of Trump's financial records. And it shows that in both 2016 and 2017, President Trump paid just $750 in federal income tax in each of those years. And he didn't pay anything in 10 of the last 15 years because he was losing much more money than he was making. The president was asked about The New York Times exclusive reporting yesterday. He tried to claim that it was made up.\n\nMARTIN: We've got NPR White House correspondent Franco Ordoñez with us. Franco, good morning. First, we should just say NPR has not been able to independently confirm this ourselves, but you have been digging into the Times report. What more does it say?\n\nFRANCO ORDOÑEZ, BYLINE: Well, you know, it shows how he racked up and leveraged substantial losses in order to avoid paying taxes and, as David noted, including no taxes for many years. Trump was asked about the bombshell report yesterday. He claimed it was all fake news.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, first of all, I've paid a lot. And I've paid a lot of state income taxes, too. The New York state charges a lot, and I've paid a lot of money in state. It'll all be revealed. It's going to come out.\n\nORDOÑEZ: It's not entirely new, though. You know, the president has previously bragged about not paying taxes. Some will remember Hillary Clinton accusing him of not paying federal income taxes in a 2016 debate. At that time, he said it made him smart. Now, a lawyer for the Trump Organization, Alan Garten, did give a statement to The Times. It said the facts appear to be inaccurate and that Trump did pay personal taxes. But he kind of sidestepped directly saying what the president had paid and kind of conflated income taxes and other federal taxes. That's according to the report.\n\nMARTIN: So last night, the president said he wants to release his taxes. I mean, he notably hasn't. This has been the norm in modern American history - that presidential candidates and presidents release their tax returns. This president has refused to do so. Now he says he wants to. Why doesn't he just do it?\n\nORDOÑEZ: Yeah. He cites an ongoing audit as an excuse for not releasing his tax returns. It is interesting. The report notes that he's been in this long fight with the IRS over the legitimacy of a $73 million tax refund. Now, that could have some financial consequences, costing him over $100 million. But as you note, there is no prohibition on releasing the returns, as presidents and presidential candidates have done for decades - before Trump, obviously. And this reporting raises a lot of questions - maybe why. It paints the president as a slick businessman who took advantage of all kinds of write-offs to avoid paying taxes, while at the same time, living a lavish lifestyle, even writing off 70,000 dollars' worth of haircuts. He wrote off consulting fees that The Times says appear to be those paid to his daughter, despite her role as a top employee in his business.\n\nMARTIN: I mean, the Times report also suggests that Donald Trump knew that he was in financial distress and that running for president was a way to kind of burnish his brand because he had all these debts coming due, right?\n\nORDOÑEZ: Right. And you know it may not just be political for Trump. The Times is suggesting that he could face hundreds of millions of dollars in personal debt coming due in the next few years and potentially legal consequences. But the president has faced explosive stories before that haven't necessarily stuck. And I was in touch with a senior administration official last night who felt this, too, would pass. The official argued that the amount of people who may be swayed to change their votes is likely very small. But that official did note that it will likely be a point during the debate tomorrow, and it could be useful for Joe Biden if used effectively.\n\nMARTIN: All right. NPR's Franco Ordoñez. Thank you so much, Franco. We'll be covering the repercussions of this. We appreciate you.\n\nORDOÑEZ: Thank you.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)\n\nMARTIN: All right. There are only 36 days until the election. And between now and then, Senate Republicans and President Trump are going to push hard to appoint a new Supreme Court justice.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nTRUMP: She's one of our nation's most brilliant legal minds. And I think she'll do very well. We're moving along very quickly.\n\nGREENE: That is the president there praising his choice for the job, Judge Amy Coney Barrett. Now, despite cries of hypocrisy from Democrats who are still mourning the justice who never was, Merrick Garland, the GOP-controlled Senate looks ready to push through Barrett's confirmation process quickly. And she could be approved before November 3.\n\nMARTIN: We've got NPR congressional reporter Claudia Grisales with us this morning. Good morning, Claudia.\n\nCLAUDIA GRISALES, BYLINE: Good morning, Rachel.\n\nMARTIN: All right. So the president and some Republicans - a lot of them - want to get Barrett confirmed before the election. What can you tell us about the timeline?\n\nGRISALES: South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham laid out the timeline just yesterday on Fox News. He's chairman of the Judiciary Committee. He said they'll start the hearing on October 12 and then have two days of questioning and then report out this nomination out of committee on October 22. So that's about 10 days later. Graham said Barrett would get a, quote, full, fair hearing in that time. And then it'd be up to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to schedule a vote on the floor of the full Senate perhaps 10 or so days before the election. And it appears McConnell has all the Republican votes he needs to confirm, even if all Democrats oppose this move. But that time frame doesn't leave a lot of time for the panel to finish the FBI background check and review answers to the committee's lengthy questionnaire that nominees submit ahead of the hearings.\n\nMARTIN: So do Democrats have any leverage even just to slow the process down?\n\nGRISALES: So they don't have much leverage here. Dick Durbin, who's the Senate minority whip and a member of the Judiciary Committee, was asked about this on Sunday. And he conceded there aren't a lot of options here. He was on ABC's This Week. Let's take a listen.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, THIS WEEK)\n\nDICK DURBIN: We can slow it down perhaps a matter of hours, maybe days at the most. But it can't stop the outcome.\n\nGRISALES: Instead, we can expect Democrats to focus on the timeline. Some polling has found that voters are on their side and preferring to have whoever wins the presidential election to appoint the new justice. And Democrats can focus on the issues - that coronavirus relief is getting sidelined and that Barrett may be a vote to strike down the Affordable Care Act, which is set to be considered by the court just a week after Election Day.\n\nMARTIN: So Joe Biden has been trying to use this as a moment to talk about health care and the fragility of health care. What's he been saying?\n\nGRISALES: So Biden gave remarks yesterday in Delaware. He warned that the court could overturn the Affordable Care Act. Indeed, President Trump tweeted that, quote, Obamacare will be replaced with a much better and far cheaper alternative if it is terminated in the Supreme Court. But, of course, a replacement plan could've been voted on any time to replace Obamacare if Trump would put one forward. But Biden also tried appealing to his former Republican colleagues in the Senate, urging them to wait on this nomination. Let's take a listen.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nJOE BIDEN: Just because you have the power to do something doesn't absolve you of your responsibility to do right by the American people. Uphold your constitutional duty. Summon your conscience.\n\nGRISALES: So in making his case, Biden was referencing the late Ruth Bader Ginsburg herself, who said it was her most fervent wish that the nomination not be filled until after the election.\n\nMARTIN: NPR's Claudia Grisales, thank you.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)\n\nMARTIN: OK, it was supposed to be gone. TikTok, the popular video-sharing app - it was supposed to have just - disappear from U.S. app stores today.\n\nGREENE: Well, it turns out, if you were interested in downloading TikTok, you don't have to worry. You can still do it, at least for the moment. Last night, a federal judge in Washington sided with the company by blocking President Trump's order banning new downloads of the app. The Trump administration, we should remember, calls the app a national security threat, and they're fighting in court to block TikTok's Chinese parent company, ByteDance, from operating the app in the United States either by banning it outright or forcing a sale to a domestic buyer.\n\nMARTIN: All right. We have got NPR tech reporter Bobby Allyn to talk about TikTok's fate here. Hi, Bobby.\n\nBOBBY ALLYN, BYLINE: Hey, Rachel.\n\nMARTIN: What did the court decide?\n\nALLYN: So the judge here is putting the brakes on a ban that would have, like you said, prevented any new downloads of TikTok. And this was supposed to start midnight Sunday. The judge didn't explain his rationale for the ruling, but TikTok's lawyers argued in a hearing over the weekend that shutting it down is like closing the modern-day version of a town square and that that's kind of like silencing speech. And you know, since the pandemic, TikTok has been the fastest-growing app in the world.\n\nSo you know, the hundred million TikTok users in the U.S. afraid their app was about to be cut off indeed can, you know, breathe a sigh of relief. You know, they can keep posting their lip-syncing and other ridiculous videos, at least for now.\n\nMARTIN: I mean, I'm trying right now. Let's see if I can get this downloaded before the end of our conversation.\n\nALLYN: (Laughter) Exactly.\n\nMARTIN: So this isn't the final word for TikTok at all.\n\nALLYN: No. Yeah, far from it. This breather for TikTok does buy it time until there is, you know, an extensive hearing on Trump's ban, which the White House is not backing down from. So, you know, as this winds its way through the courts, there is one very important date, Rachel, and that is November 12. That is when TikTok has to find a American buyer or disappear for real in the U.S.\n\nMARTIN: Mmm hmm.\n\nALLYN: TikTok was hoping the judge over the weekend would have pushed back that date too, but the judge said, nope, we're keeping it.\n\nMARTIN: Right. So what's up with that deal?\n\nALLYN: Yeah. So parties were racing towards an agreement. You know, we've been hearing about it. And things went south very fast. Trump gave the green light for software company Oracle to take a big stake in TikTok and to control its U.S. data. Walmart was also a major investor, but then TikTok parent company ByteDance said, actually, not so fast; we don't want to lose control of the biggest app to ever come out of China. So talks have stalled.\n\nBut, you know, I talked to the parties involved, and they say they have not given up. And for TikTok, Rachel, you know, the stakes are just really, really, really high. The app - you know, if it ends up getting banned even temporarily, the company says, like, 90% of its users could quit and then hop over to competitors like Instagram or, you know, one of the many other video apps that have sensed real opportunity here.\n\nMARTIN: I mean, the whole national security threat - this is the thing that President Trump keeps bringing up. Is the data of Americans really safe on TikTok? I mean, if you're the average consumer listening to this, you maybe have concerns about that.\n\nALLYN: That's the question I get the most; you know, should I be worried about TikTok? That's the crux of the debate (ph). And, you know, the Trump administration says having a Chinese parent company like TikTok does is a national security threat and that China's authoritarian regime, you know, has unfettered access to private business. And there is consensus that that's a legitimate concern.\n\nThat said, the particular threat from TikTok - that's a lot shakier. The White House has never offered ironclad evidence that China can definitely get its hands on Americans' data. And TikTok says it just operates completely independent of China. But those assurances are not cooling the heat from the White House.\n\nMARTIN: Well, I'm all set up here. I mean...\n\nALLYN: (Laughter).\n\nMARTIN: TikTok is still open for business for now. I mean, who knows? All kinds of cool videos, all kinds of cool content coming from my TikTok account.\n\nALLYN: Yeah.\n\nMARTIN: OK, Bobby Allyn, thank you so much. We so appreciate you keeping us up to speed on all this.\n\nALLYN: You got it, Rachel. OK, see you.\n\nCopyright © 2020 NPR. All rights reserved.

Week In Politics: The Future Of The GOP And The 2nd Round Of Democratic Debates\n\nNPR's Audie Cornish is joined by David Brooks of The New York Times, and E.J. Dionne of The Washington Post to discuss the future of the GOP and the second round of Democratic debates.\n\nAUDIE CORNISH, HOST:\n\nWe're going to continue the discussion in our Week in Politics segment. E.J. Dionne of The Washington Post and Georgetown's McCourt School is here.\n\nHey there, E.J.\n\nEJ DIONNE: Good to be with you.\n\nCORNISH: And David Brooks of The New York Times is here with us in studio. Hi there, David.\n\nDAVID BROOKS: Hello.\n\nCORNISH: All right, so we just heard someone trying to grapple with the reality of the departures in the Republican Party. David, I want to start with you. What does it mean for the constituency of someone like a Will Hurd, right? Not only was he a minority lawmaker, he was a former intelligence officer. Did he ever have one at all? Or - right? - or is this a party in which the people who might support someone like this, they're just - there's nowhere for them to go?\n\nBROOKS: Yeah, well, in the Congress, there a lot of people like him that are keeping their head down. Some of them - and I've had conversations with many, many of them - and many people...\n\nCORNISH: But where are their voters, right? I mean, if everyone's...\n\nBROOKS: Right.\n\nCORNISH: ...Retiring, it's because they think they can't survive a primary.\n\nBROOKS: That's right. In the - in this partisan moment, they think they can't survive. And Trump is pushing racial buttons now on an almost hourly basis. And for somebody like Will Hurd, that's - it's hard to be a person of conscience and be part of that party.\n\nAnd so right now, the voters are still with Trump, mostly because he's part of the team. But I have to think there are a lot of those voters who once it's not a team element and wants the Trump era ends, they'll be eager to say good bye to all this.\n\nCORNISH: E.J., there's so much conversation about how Democrats appeal to this person who might be dissatisfied with the president. Where's your head on this?\n\nDIONNE: Well, I think it's very important just to face up to the fact that the Republicans have become very nearly an all-white party. And Will Hurd's a real loss because he was a very well respected and liked Republican who really did cross these lines. But he looked at what's happened to the party even before Trump and said, you know, this doesn't work anymore. I mean, Republicans have been using...\n\nCORNISH: But all that's been known, right? I mean, what does it mean going forward? Do Democrats look at that and say, hey, there's a constituency out there we can get? Or do they say look; we've got to be more progressive, more left, those guys got to figure out their stuff on their own?\n\nDIONNE: Well, no. I think the Democrats have been picking up people of color of all kinds in their party as they've left the Republican Party. And people of color are going to be very, very important in the coming Democratic primaries.\n\nOr - this isn't happening in the Republican Party. I think the break point was when President George W. Bush tried, to his credit, and failed to get immigration reform in the middle of his second term. He thought the Republicans needed people of color, particularly Latinos. He did pretty - he did quite well among them.\n\nWhen Republicans walked away from immigration reform, that was the beginning of what Donald Trump kind of completed by winning the Republican nomination in 2016.\n\nCORNISH: I want to jump to another highlight of this week, and that came in the Democratic primary debates.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nCORY BOOKER: Mr. Vice President, there's a saying in my community. You're dipping into the Kool-Aid, and you don't even know the flavor. You need to...\n\nCORNISH: All right, we're going to get into the flavor now. That was New Jersey Senator Cory Booker basically throwing some massive shade at the Vice President Joe Biden, who was fending off slings and arrows from all directions.\n\nE.J., I want to hear shortly from you kind of what your impressions were in terms of a standout moment in those two days.\n\nDIONNE: Well, I think if you look at the debates together, the people who really advanced the most were Cory Booker, who had a very good debate because he not only went after Biden effectively, but he also sounded notes of unity. And Kamala Harris got really beaten up in this debate. And so I think he's going to - he has a real shot at occupying the top tier. Elizabeth Warren had a good first debate. And while there's division on this, I think it was very important for Joe Biden that he got through this in much better shape than he did in the first debate.\n\nOn the whole, I don't think these debates were very helpful to Democrats. Yes, Democrats have to work out where they stand for. But I think some broader arguments they need - that need to be made about the dangers posed by Trump, the need to protect health care advances and all sorts of other things kind of got lost because these were such - it was so important for these candidates to take each other on. And the questions kind of goaded that on. So...\n\nCORNISH: I want to let David have...\n\nDIONNE: ...It wasn't ideal for the Democrats.\n\nCORNISH: ...A chance here. David, here is your favorite candidate of the night.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nMARIANNE WILLIAMSON: If you think any of this wonkiness is going to deal with this dark psychic force of the collectivized hatred that this president is bringing up in this country, then I'm afraid that the Democrats are going to see some very dark days.\n\nCORNISH: Spiritual leader and author Marianne Williamson, you - she was the most Googled candidate the morning after. It sounds like you were one of them.\n\nBROOKS: I was. And I don't - she does not have my vote, but she has my admiration for that comment. The Democrats have to figure out what this election about. To me, this election is about who we are as a country, what kind of values we want to raise our children in. Donald Trump is not a policy revolutionary. He's a cultural revolutionary. And he's changing the culture of our values - how we define masculinity, whether we care about honesty, whether we care about racism.\n\nAnd so Democrats have to fight this on a cultural level, too, upholding certain values and saying we stand for these values, Donald Trump is the opposite. And for all the debates about whether we should have private health care insurance or not, you can't have a wonkish response to what is essentially a cultural onslaught. The Democrats need a way to talk about values.\n\nCORNISH: E.J., can you respond to this? Because even Williamson said the next day that, you know, said she wasn't sure how she didn't until she saw the memes. I mean, she knows she's not necessarily been taking fully seriously.\n\nDIONNE: Well, I half agree with David in the following sense, that I think they needed to be much clearer about why it was urgent to defeat Trump. And some of the reasons David listed are among those reasons. On the other hand, it is very important to move forward on the very issues Democrats talked about. On health care, the problem is, I think, that the debate was incomprehensible to a lot of people on all these very particular details on Medicare for All versus, say, the public option.\n\nAnd I think the most devastating comment came from David Axelrod, former - President Obama's senior adviser. The words preexisting conditions, which helped Democrats win the House when Democrats said Republicans want to take these protections away that were contained in Obamacare, those words were never spoken. So they need a much more broader and more comprehensible debate on the policy.\n\nCORNISH: That's E.J. Dionne of The Washington Post and Georgetown's McCourt School.\n\nThank you.\n\nDIONNE: Very good to be with you.\n\nCORNISH: And David Brooks of The New York Times, author of The Second Mountain.\n\nDavid, thank you.\n\nBROOKS: Thank you.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF PETIT BISCUIT'S YOU)\n\nCopyright © 2019 NPR.

FACT CHECK: Money-To-Hospitals Plan To Treat Coronavirus Patients Could Face Problems\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Angela Weiss/AFP via Getty Images Angela Weiss/AFP via Getty Images\n\nVice President Mike Pence said the White House may ask hospitals to use some of their federal aid to cover the medical costs of COVID-19 treatment for people who have lost their health insurance in recent weeks, along with their jobs.\n\nSome medical experts have called on the administration to allow newly uninsured people to sign up for health insurance under Obamacare. But at a White House briefing on Thursday, President Trump rejected that idea, saying that we're doing better than that with what he called a cash payment.\n\nPence explained that the White House Coronavirus Task Force is drafting a proposal to use some of the $100 billion that we're making available to hospitals to compensate the hospitals directly for any coronavirus treatment that they provide to uninsured Americans.\n\nWe've been working every day to make sure that Americans don't have to worry about the cost of treatment, Pence said.\n\nThe idea looks simple at first glance – something akin to single payer health coverage for COVID treatment in hospitals, with hospitals providing free treatment using money provided by the federal government.\n\nIn practice, though, there could be lots of complications, including whether the pot of money that hospitals are getting actually will be enough. The plan also does not appear to cover the expense of health care that people may need outside hospitals, including testing.\n\nAccording to Pence, President Trump will consider the proposal and make a final decision on Friday.
Trump Promises To Repeal Obamacare, Meets With Architect Of The Law\n\nSteve Inskeep talks to Zeke Emanuel, one of the architects of Obamacare, about the future of the Affordable Care Act under Donald Trump's administration. Emanuel met this week with Trump.\n\nSTEVE INSKEEP, HOST:\n\nHere's the dilemma facing Republicans, who will soon control both Congress and the White House. They have unanimously said for years they want to repeal Obamacare. Yet, because the law provides benefits to many millions of people, Republicans also acknowledge they must replace it with something that does many of the same things. They haven't agreed on what that should be.\n\nIt's in this atmosphere that Zeke Emanuel visited President-elect Trump this week. Emanuel was one of the architects of the Affordable Care Act, and he's in our studios. Good morning.\n\nEZEKIEL EMANUEL: Nice to be here.\n\nINSKEEP: So how'd the meeting go with President-elect Trump?\n\nEMANUEL: It went very well.\n\nINSKEEP: What's he like to talk to about health care?\n\nEMANUEL: I found him engaged, curious, and he asked a lot of thoughtful questions and had a lot of opinions, as you might expect.\n\nINSKEEP: Did you have a sense that he knows what he wants to do and what he wishes Congress to do?\n\nEMANUEL: Well, I'm not going to reveal what we talked about. That's for the president-elect's team to decide what they want to reveal. But I'll say he was definitely engaged and definitely asked a lot of thoughtful questions.\n\nINSKEEP: Well, let's talk about this situation. Here is President Obama's signature achievement - or one of them, anyway - which Republicans have vowed to repeal for years. But the president-elect has let it be known in public statements and elsewhere that he wants to keep some of the popular provisions, for example, making it so that you can't lose your health coverage because of a pre-existing condition or making it possible to keep your health insurance if you're a young adult and you're still on your parents' insurance. Republicans in Congress have put out their plans.\n\nWhat is your sense of what's going to happen here? Do you believe this law's going to - going to survive in some form, just under a different name?\n\nEMANUEL: Well, I think we're going to have to provide coverage for all Americans. I believe, on the campaign trail, President-elect Trump was committed to providing health coverage to all Americans. I think he has - he's said that publicly. And I think threading that needle is why health care is complicated.\n\nIt's just as complicated for Democrats as Republicans, getting a way that's fiscally responsible to cover all Americans and a structure that is as simple as possible, but it's never going to be very simple. I mean, I think most people have to remember - it's a $3 trillion industry in America, 18 percent of GDP. That makes any change a very complicated arrangement.\n\nINSKEEP: Is that part of the - not just the practical problem, but the political problem here? Whatever you did in 2009, people barely understood it. People barely understand it now. And whatever changes are made, people are barely going to understand them.\n\nEMANUEL: That is only partially the problem. Remember, as you pointed out, there are many, many popular provisions in the bill. People like the fact that they don't have to pay deductibles or co-pays for preventative services - that was part of the legislation - that there are essential benefits which everyone can get, including mental health benefits and other benefits for drugs. So there are lots of popular provisions of the bill. The only unpopular provision, by polling, is really the individual mandate. But lots and lots of individual provisions get, like, 75 or 80 percent of the public supporting it. And I think that's an important point.\n\nINSKEEP: OK, let's cut to the chase here. That is the thing that Republicans hate most, the mandate, forcing people to buy insurance or else pay a tax penalty. It's been said, though, that it's connected to this other thing, making sure you don't lose your insurance for pre-existing conditions. It's been said you can't do one without the other.\n\nHowever, Republicans say, yeah, we've got ways to do that, there's some way to do that. Do you believe that this law can survive while getting rid of the mandate that many people hate?\n\nEMANUEL: There are only four ways - you have to get everyone in the system if you're actually going to get the pre-existing condition exclusion in there.\n\nINSKEEP: Everybody's got to be involved, you're saying.\n\nEMANUEL: Everyone's got to be involved. There are only four ways of doing that - an individual mandate with some kind of penalty, continuous coverage with serious penalties, some way of you have to pay more if you delay getting the bill, or we actually pre-re-enroll you - automatic enrollment and you can opt out. The problem with the continuous coverage provision and the provision for a penalty if you delay is that they don't work very well. So a mandate and automatic enrollment are ways that really work.\n\nINSKEEP: Are you arguing, in just about five seconds, the bottom line here is that people are going to have to pay something? They're going to have to be committed to something, whether they like it or not?\n\nEMANUEL: It's either through taxes or premiums or some way. People have to be involved in the system and engage if we want to actually cover everyone and make sure people who have cancer or other diseases get coverage.\n\nINSKEEP: Zeke Emanuel, thanks for coming by.\n\nEMANUEL: My pleasure. It was a pleasure to be with you.\n\nINSKEEP: He's at the University of Pennsylvania\n\nCopyright © 2016 NPR. All rights reserved.

TRANSCRIPT: Donald Trump's Speech Responding To Assault Accusations\n\nPBS NewsHour via YouTube\n\nWow. What a group. What a group. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you, folks. Thank you, folks. It's great to be right here in Florida, which we love.\n\nIn 26 days, we are going to win this great, great state and we are going to win the White House.\n\nOur movement is about replacing a failed and corrupt — now, when I say corrupt, I'm talking about totally corrupt — political establishment, with a new government controlled by you, the American people.\n\n\n\nThere is nothing the political establishment will not do — no lie that they won't tell, to hold their prestige and power at your expense. And that's what's been happening.\n\n\n\nThe Washington establishment and the financial and media corporations that fund it exist for only one reason: to protect and enrich itself.\n\n\n\nThe establishment has trillions of dollars at stake in this election. As an example, just one single trade deal they'd like to pass involves trillions of dollars, controlled by many countries, corporations and lobbyists.\n\n\n\nFor those who control the levers of power in Washington, and for the global special interests, they partner with these people that don't have your good in mind. Our campaign represents a true existential threat like they haven't seen before.\n\n\n\nThis is not simply another four-year election. This is a crossroads in the history of our civilization that will determine whether or not we the people reclaim control over our government.\n\n\n\nThe political establishment that is trying to stop us is the same group responsible for our disastrous trade deals, massive illegal immigration and economic and foreign policies that have bled our country dry.\n\n\n\nThe political establishment has brought about the destruction of our factories, and our jobs, as they flee to Mexico, China and other countries all around the world. Our just-announced job numbers are anemic. Our gross domestic product, or GDP, is barely above 1 percent. And going down. Workers in the United States are making less than they were almost 20 years ago, and yet they are working harder.\n\n\n\nBut so am I working harder, that I can tell you.\n\n\n\nIt's a global power structure that is responsible for the economic decisions that have robbed our working class, stripped our country of its wealth and put that money into the pockets of a handful of large corporations and political entities.\n\n\n\nJust look at what this corrupt establishment has done to our cities like Detroit; Flint, Michigan; and rural towns in Pennsylvania, Ohio, North Carolina and all across our country. Take a look at what's going on. They stripped away these town bare. And raided the wealth for themselves and taken our jobs away out of our country never to return unless I'm elected president.\n\n\n\nThe Clinton machine is at the center of this power structure. We've seen this first hand in the WikiLeaks documents, in which Hillary Clinton meets in secret with international banks to plot the destruction of U.S. sovereignty in order to enrich these global financial powers, her special interest friends and her donors.\n\n\n\nSo true.\n\n\n\nHonestly, she should be locked up. Should be locked up.\n\n\n\nAnd likewise the e-mails show that the Clinton machine is so closely and irrevocably tied to the media organizations that she, that she — listen to this — is given the questions and answers in advance of her debate performance with Bernie Sanders.\n\n\n\nHillary Clinton is also given approval and veto power over quotes written about her in the New York Times.\n\n\n\nThey definitely do not do that to me, that I can tell you.\n\n\n\nAnd the e-mails show the reporters collaborate and conspire directly with the Clinton campaign on helping her win the election all over.\n\n\n\nWith their control over our government at stake, with trillions of dollars on the line, the Clinton machine is determined to achieve the destruction of our campaign, not gonna to happen.\n\n\n\nWhich has now become a great, great movement, the likes of which our country has never seen before, never ever.\n\n\n\nThey've never seen a movement like this in our country before. Yesterday in Florida, massive crowds, people lined up outside of big arenas, not able to get in. Never happened before. It's one of the phenomenas — it's one of the great political phenomenas. The most powerful weapon deployed by the Clintons is the corporate media, the press.\n\n\n\nLet's be clear on one thing, the corporate media in our country is no longer involved in journalism. They're a political special interest no different than any lobbyist or other financial entity with a total political agenda, and the agenda is not for you, it's for themselves.\n\nAnd their agenda is to elect crooked Hillary Clinton at any cost, at any price, no matter how many lives they destroy.\n\n\n\nFor them it's a war, and for them nothing at all is out of bounds. This is a struggle for the survival of our nation, believe me. And this will be our last chance to save it on Nov. 8, remember that.\n\nThis election will determine whether we are a free nation or whether we have only the illusion of democracy, but are in fact controlled by a small handful of global special interests rigging the system, and our system is rigged. This is reality, you know it, they know it, I know it, and pretty much the whole world knows it. The establishment and their media enablers will control over this nation through means that are very well known. Anyone who challenges their control is deemed a sexist, a racist, a xenophobe, and morally deformed.\n\nThey will attack you, they will slander you, they will seek to destroy your career and your family, they will seek to destroy everything about you, including your reputation. They will lie, lie, lie, and then again they will do worse than that, they will do whatever is necessary. The Clintons are criminals, remember that. They're criminals.\n\n\n\nThis is well documented, and the establishment that protects them has engaged in a massive cover-up of widespread criminal activity at the State Department and the Clinton Foundation in order to keep the Clintons in power.\n\n\n\nNever in history have we seen such a cover-up as this, one that includes the total destruction of 33,000 e-mails, 13 iPhones – some by hammer – laptops, missing boxes of evidence, and many, many other things.\n\n\n\nPeople who are capable of such crimes against our nation are capable of anything. And so now we address the slander and libels that was just last night thrown at me by the Clinton machine and the New York Times and other media outlets, as part of a concerted, coordinated and vicious attack.\n\n\n\nIt's not coincidence that these attacks come at the exact same moment, and all together at the same time as WikiLeaks releases documents exposing the massive international corruption of the Clinton machine, including 2,000 more e-mails just this morning.\n\n\n\nThese vicious claims about me of inappropriate conduct with women are totally and absolutely false.\n\n\n\nAnd the Clintons know it, and they know it very well. These claims are all fabricated. They're pure fiction and they're outright lies. These events never, ever happened and the people said them meekly fully understand. You take a look at these people, you study these people, and you'll understand also.\n\n\n\nThe claims are preposterous, ludicrous, and defy truth, common sense and logic. We already have substantial evidence to dispute these lies, and it will be made public in an appropriate way and at an appropriate time very soon.\n\n\n\nThese lies come from outlets whose past stories and past claims have already been discredited. The media outlets did not even attempt to confirm the most basic facts because even a simple investigation would have shown that these were nothing more than false smears.\n\n\n\nSix months ago, the failing New York Times wrote a massive story attacking me, and the central witness they used said the story was false; that she was quoted inaccurately. She said that I was a great guy. She had great courage, I'll be honest with you. She was an amazing person. And never made those remarks — that I was a great guy, and never made the remarks.\n\n\n\nAnd when I read the story, I was sort of surprised — how could she say that? And she didn't say it.\n\n\n\nWe demanded a retraction but, they refused to print it, just like they refused to pin the comments from another source who praised me in her book, or the words of another wonderful woman who said really nice things about me. They put other statements that she didn't say, they misrepresented. The story was a fraud and a big embarrassment to The New York Times and it was a big front page story. Front page, center, color picture, a disgrace. They were very embarrassed; it will be part of the lawsuit we are preparing against them.\n\nNow, today the same two discredited writers, who should've been fired from The New York Times for what they did, tell another totally fabricated and false story, that supposedly took place on an airplane more than 30 years ago. Another ridiculous tale, no witnesses, no nothing.\n\n\n\nThen, there was a writer from People Magazine, who wrote a story on Melania and myself on our first anniversary. The story was beautiful. It was beautiful. It was lovely. But last night we hear that after 12 years — this took place 12 years ago, this story — a new claim that I made inappropriate advances during the interview to this writer.\n\nAnd I asked very simple question, why wasn't it part of the story that appeared 20 or 12 years ago? Why wasn't it a part of the story? Why didn't they make it part of the story? I was one of the biggest stars on television with The Apprentice and I would've been one of the biggest stories of the year. Think of it, she's doing this story on Melania, who was pregnant at the time. And Donald Trump, our one year anniversary, and she said I made inappropriate advances, and by the way, the area was a public area, people all over the place.\n\n\n\nTake a look, you take a look. Look at her, look at her words. You tell me, what you think. I don't think so. I don't think so.\n\n\n\nBut, it is amazing, doing a story — a love story — on how great we are together — and by the way, we're stronger today than we ever were before, which is good, but it's a love story. It's a love story on our one year. And if I did that, she would've added that it would've been the headline. And who would've done that if you're doing this and you're one of the top shows on television.\n\n\n\nThese people are horrible people. They're horrible, horrible liars. And interestingly, it happens to appear 26 days before our very important election, isn't that amazing?\n\nThis invented account has already been debunked by eyewitnesses who were there. They were there. The very witness identified by the author has said the story is totally false.\n\n\n\nBy the way, this is a room that everybody can see in. It's got glass walls. It's at Mar-A-Lago. It's got glass walls. Can you believe this? Why wasn't it in the story, biggest story of the year?\n\n\n\nThis weekend, The New York Times published a full-page hit piece with another claim from an individual who has been totally discredited based on the many, many, many e-mails and letters she has sent to our office over the years, looking for work, Donald is great, wanting go to my rallies. But The New York Times — and this was full op-ed piece — refused to use the evidence that we presented, refused to use it. If they used it, if they would have looked, they would have said, there's no story here.\n\n\n\nOthers in the media, which almost surprises me because they're dishonest also, were presented with the story by this woman numerous times, and they got very excited. But, after seeing the evidence that we immediately give them, all of them refused to write the story. There was no story.\n\n\n\nThe Times, though, didn't want to see it. They just wrote the story. And this was a full page opposite the editorials. This is part of a concerted effort, led by The New York Times and others. Now The New York Times is fighting desperately for its relevance and its financial survival. And it probably won't even be around in a few years, based on its financial outlook, which wouldn't be a bad thing, if you want to know the truth.\n\n\n\nBut, as it winds down its years and is becoming more and more problematic, it's gotten more and more vicious, more and more vile. And even the other mainstream media is talking about the single greatest pile-on in history, and all between now and Nov. 8. And you have to see the stories they've written, it's one after another, after another, and facts mean nothing, third-rate journalism. The great editors of the past from The New York Times and others, ladies and gentlemen, are spinning in their grave.\n\n\n\nI will not allow the Clinton machine to turn our campaign into a discussion of their slanders and lies, but, will remain focused on the issues facing the American people.\n\nThank you, thank you. But, let me state this as clearly as I can, these attacks are orchestrated by the Clintons and their media allies. The only thing Hillary Clinton has going for herself is the press, without the press, she is absolutely zero.\n\n\n\nAnd you saw that the other night in the debate, where some people said she made virtually a fool of herself. This is not presidential material, believe me. What they say is false and slanderous in virtually every respect. We are now less than a month from the most election of our lifetime. Indeed one of the most important elections in the history of our country. And the polls are showing us in a dead heat. Don't believe what you say.\n\n\n\nThe new, highly respected Rasmussen poll just came out this morning. Just released. Shows up nationally 2 points ahead, Trump. Beautiful.\n\n\n\nJust came out. So now the Clinton machine has put forward a small handful of people out of tens of thousands of people over the years that I've met, that I've worked with, that I've employed, in order to make wild and false allegations that fail to meet even the most basic test of common sense. Not even common sense.\n\n\n\nAgain, this is nothing more than an attempt to destroy our movement and for the Clintons to keep their corrupt control over our government. When I declared my candidacy, I knew what bad shape our country was in. And believe me, all you have to do is look at world events. All you have to do is look at the $1.7 billion that we sent to Iran in cash – in cash.\n\n\n\nAll you have to do is see the way ISIS was created in the vacuum left by Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama out of Iraq. All you have to do, all you have to do, is look at the 800 people that were very, very not good for our nation. They were going to be deported. Lo and behold, instead of being deported, they were made citizens of the United States just recently.\n\nAnd lo and behold, sadly, the 800 people is wrong. It turned out to be close to 1,800 people. Our president is incompetent. All he wants to do is campaign, and the last thing he wants to happen is to have Donald Trump terminate Obamacare and do all of the other things that are destroying ...\n\n\n\nHe's led a very divided nation and it's only gotten worse. And the last thing our country needs is four more years of Barack Obama, believe me. I've seen firsthand the corruption and the sickness that has taken over our politics. You've seen it and I've seen it and we're all watching together.\n\n\n\nThey knew they would throw every lie they could at me and my family and my loved ones. They knew they would stop at nothing to try to stop me. But I never knew as bad as it would be. I never knew it would be this vile, that it would be this bad, that it would be this vicious.\n\n\n\nNevertheless, I take all of these slings and arrows gladly for you.\n\n\n\nI take them for our movement so that we can have our country back.\n\n\n\nOur great civilization, here in America and across the civilized world has come upon a moment of reckoning. We've seen it in the United Kingdom, where they voted to liberate themselves from global government and global trade deal, and global immigration deals that have destroyed their sovereignty and have destroyed many of those nations. But, the central base of world political power is right here in America, and it is our corrupt political establishment that is the greatest power behind the efforts at radical globalization and the disenfranchisement of working people. Their financial resources are virtually unlimited, their political resources are unlimited, their media resources are unmatched, and most importantly, the depths of their immorality is absolutely unlimited.\n\n\n\nThey will allow radical Islamic terrorists to enter our country by the thousands.\n\n\n\nThey will allow the great Trojan horse — and I don't want people looking back in a hundred years and 200 years and have that story be told about us because we were led by inept, incompetent and corrupt people like Barack Obama and like Hillary Clinton. We don't want to be part of that history.\n\nAnd by the way, President Obama should stop campaigning and start working on creating jobs, start working on getting our GDP up, start working on strengthening our borders.\n\n\n\nThe corrupt political establishment is a machine, it has no soul. I knew these false attacks would come. I knew this day would arrive; it's only a question of when. And I knew the American people would rise above it and vote for the future they deserve.\n\nThe only thing that can stop this corrupt machine is you. The only force strong enough to save our country is us. The only people brave enough to vote out this corrupt establishment is you, the American people.\n\n\n\nWe are going to have a policy: America first.\n\n\n\nThey control incredibly, the Department of Justice.\n\n\n\nAnd they even secretly meet with the Attorney General of the United States. In the back of her airplane, while on the runway — remember he was there — he was going to play golf. Oh, oh gee, there's the Attorney General. Let me go say hello — plane's on the runway. Let me go say hello to the Attorney General. He never got to play golf, I understand. And it was Arizona, a place I love, but the weather was about a hundred and some odd degrees — he's not gonna play. He was never there to play golf, folks, don't be foolish.\n\n\n\nThey met for 39 minutes and most likely it was to discuss her reappointment, in a Clinton administration, as the Attorney General, just prior to making a decision over whether or not to prosecute Hillary Clinton, okay? That's what happened. That's called real life and that's pretty sad.\n\n\n\nThey met for 39 minutes. Remember he said, we talked golf and we talked about our grandchildren. Three minutes for the grandchildren, two minutes for the golf, then they sat there and they twiddled their thumbs. Now I believe they talked about her remaining in her position under a crooked Hillary Clinton administration. That's what I believe. That's what I believe folks. That's what I believe and I think that's what most people in this room believe.\n\n\n\nLikewise, they've essentially corrupted the Director of the FBI to the point at which stories are already saying that the great — and they are truly great — men and women who work for the FBI are embarrassed and ashamed of what he's done to one of our truly great institutions, the FBI itself.\n\nHillary Clinton is guilty of all the things that Director Comey stated at his press conference and Congressional hearings and far more. He stated many things, but it's far more and he knows that. And yet, after reading all of these items, where she's so guilty, he let her off the hook. While other lives, including General Petraeus and many others, have been destroyed for doing far, far less. This is a conspiracy against you, the American people, and we cannot let this happen or continue.\n\n\n\nThis is our moment of reckoning as a society and as a civilization itself. I didn't need to do this, folks, believe me — believe me. I built a great company and I had a wonderful life. I could have enjoyed the fruits and benefits of years of successful business deals and businesses for myself and my family. Instead of going through this absolute horror show of lies, deceptions, malicious attacks — who would have thought? I'm doing it because this country has given me so much, and I feel so strongly that it's my turn to give back to the country that I love.\n\n\n\nMany of my friends and many political experts warned me that this campaign would be a journey to hell – said that. But they're wrong. It will be a journey to heaven, because we will help so many people that are so desperately in need of help.\n\n\n\nIn my former life, I was an insider as much as anybody else. And I knew what it's like, and I still know what it's like to be an insider. It's not bad. It's not bad. Now I'm being punished for leaving the special club and revealing to you the terrible things that are going on having to do with our country. Because I used to be part of the club, I'm the only one that can fix it.\n\nI'm doing this for the people and for the movement, and we will take back this country for you and we will make America great again.\n\n\n\nThe corrupt establishment knows that we are a great threat to their criminal enterprise. They know that if we win, their power is gone, and it's returned to you, the people, will be. The dark clouds hanging over our government can be lifted and replaced with a bright future. But it all depends on whether we let the corrupt media decide our future or whether we let the American people decide our future.\n\n\n\nIf this Clinton campaign of destruction is allowed to work, then no other highly success — and this is so true, I mean I've seen this so many times, and I've heard this all of my life, I've heard it all of my life. If we let this happen, then no other highly-successful person, which is what our country needs — it needs a certain thinking. When you look at our trade deals that are so bad, when you look, as an example, on trade, we're going to lose almost $800 billion this year, trade deficit, almost $800 billion. Our debt has doubled in seven and a half years to almost $20 trillion, under Obama.\n\nNo other successful person, after watching this, and no other very successful person will ever again, ever — and who can blame them? Even me, I'd say, you're right — will ever again run for office. I've heard it for years, if you're very successful, you can't run for high office, especially for President. I said, I don't care, I don't care. I've done so many deals, I've done so well. It's a certain mindset that we need in our country, at least for a period of time. We have to straighten our country out.\n\n\n\nI will not lie to you. These false attacks are absolutely hurtful. To be lied about, to be slandered, to be smeared so publicly, and before your family that you love, is very painful. What is going on is egregious beyond any words. People that know the story, people that see the story, people that know the facts, they can't even believe it. It's reprehensible beyond description, it's totally corrupt.\n\n\n\nBut, I also know that it's not about me. It's about all of you and it's about our country. I know that. I fully understand that. That's why I got involved. It's about all of us together as a country. It's a movement the likes of which we have never in history in this country seen before, never in history. Even the pundits, even the media — that truly dislikes Donald Trump for their own reasons — will admit this is a movement the likes of which people have never seen before.\n\nAnd it's a movement about the veterans who need medical care, the mothers who've lost their beloved children to terrorism and to crime. It's about the inner cities and the border towns who desperately need our help. It's about the millions of jobless people in America. It's about the American workers who can't get jobs because our jobs have left for Mexico and so many other countries.\n\n\n\nThis election is about the people being crushed by Obamacare. And it's about defeating ISIS and appointing a Supreme Court and a Supreme Court Justice --- it could be four or five — who will defend and protect our Constitution.\n\n\n\nThis election is also about, so importantly to me, African-American and Hispanic-American people whose communities have been plunged into crime, poverty and failing schools by the policies of crooked Hillary Clinton. Believe me, she's crooked.\n\n\n\nThey've robbed these citizens of their future and, if we win, I will give them their hope, their jobs, their education. I will give them their security back. The inner cities, education is almost worthless, it's horrible. We're going to have Common Core ended. We're going to bring education local.\n\n\n\nBut, you look at the inner cities and you see bad education, no jobs, no safety. You walk to the grocery store with your child and you get shot. You walk outside to look and see what's happening and you get shot. In Chicago, 3,000 people have been shot since Jan. 1. We're not going to let that happen. Our inner cities are almost at an all-time low, run by the Democrats for sometimes more than a hundred years, chain unbroken.\n\n\n\nSo they have no jobs. They have horrible education. They have no safety or security and I say to the African-American community, what the hell do you have to lose? I will fix it. I will fix it. I will make it good. I'll bring back our jobs. We'll have good education. We'll have great safety in the inner city.\n\n\n\nAnd we will help the Hispanic-American people, who have been treated so badly and so unfairly in our nation, we will help them.\n\n\n\nI will deliver like you've never seen before. I deliver. Whether people like Donald Trump or not, they all say he delivers.\n\n\n\nVote for Donald Trump. You're going to see something and you'll be so happy. You'll be so thrilled. This election is about every man, woman and child in our country who deserves to live in safety, prosperity and peace, so true. We will rise above the lies, the smears, the ludicrous slanders from ludicrous and very, very dishonest reporters.\n\n\n\nWe will vote for the country we want. We will vote for the future we want. We will vote for the politics we want and we will vote to put this corrupt government cartel out of business and out of business immediately.\n\n\n\nWe will vote for the special interests and say lots of luck, but you're being voted out of power. They've betrayed our workers, they've betrayed our borders and, most of all, they've betrayed our freedoms. We will save our sovereign rights as a nation. We will end the politics of profit. We will end the rule of special interests. We will end the raiding of our jobs by other countries. We will end the total disenfranchisement of the American voter and the American worker. Our Independence Day is at hand, and it arrives finally on Nov. 8.\n\nJoin me in taking back our country and creating a bright, glorious, and prosperous new future for our people. We will make America great again, and it will happen quickly.\n\n\n\nGod bless you. God bless you. Thank you. Thank you.
How President Trump Is Responding To 2020 Election Results\n\nSTEVE INSKEEP, HOST:\n\nThis evening, President-elect Biden is expected to address the nation in a primetime address. It will be his first speech since winning the presidency, which happened earlier today - after the (unintelligible) was confirmed, we really should say, earlier today, after the Associated Press called the states of Pennsylvania and Nevada for him.\n\nMICHEL MARTIN, HOST:\n\nThe AP has President-elect Biden at 290 electoral votes to Trump's 214. Still, President Trump has not conceded the election. To hear more about how the president is responding, we're joined now by Franco Ordoñez, NPR White House correspondent, who's been covering the Trump campaign. He's traveled with President Trump across the Midwest and Florida and has been at the White House for much of this presidency.\n\nFranco, thank you so much for staying with us.\n\nFRANCO ORDOÑEZ, BYLINE: Thank you.\n\nMARTIN: So you've met a lot of Trump supporters in your travels. What message are they getting from the president today?\n\nORDOÑEZ: Well, they're - I mean, they're definitely hearing from him, and they're definitely hearing from him in very Trumpian fashion. I mean, just an hour ago, the president published a very long, fiery tweet claiming more fraud. All of it was in caps. He noted that he had received more than 70 million legal votes, which was the most for a sitting president. That is true. Of course, Biden got more than 74 million votes.\n\nTrump is also pledging to take more legal action despite, you know, several cases that he's already launched or his campaign has already launched have been thrown out by the courts. His rapid response team is asking for donations and calling for more examples of voter fraud. But the reality is, as we've reported, he has yet to show any actual evidence of systematic wrongdoing.\n\nMARTIN: And as we have all said, that - the president makes his views clear. He doesn't need or - he doesn't need an intermediary, nor does he use one. So he makes it very clear what he feels and how he feels at any particular moment. But behind the scenes, is there any evidence that a different message is being delivered or taking hold?\n\nORDOÑEZ: Yeah. He was at his golf course today where he issued some of these fiery statements. But it's interesting because the public comments - there's a contrast between those and the private conversations that are happening behind the scenes. I've been talking with a former campaign aide who tells me that the president is being advised that his legal options are limited. But it's been hard for him.\n\nYou know, no politician likes to lose. And the president, you know, really doesn't like to lose. He said that on Tuesday when he was at his headquarters, his reelection headquarters. The president really believed that he couldn't lose. And frankly, many people in Trump world also didn't think that he could lose. The president had overcome so many challenges, you know, over the last four years.\n\nAnd, you know, he does want to continue to fight for the people who voted for him, I'm told. But it is also dawning on him that if - even if he were to win some of these legal challenges that he's still likely not to get the 270 electoral votes that he needs to win reelection.\n\nMARTIN: So let's look ahead to the transition now. Before we turn to Mara Liasson, our colleague, is there any sign of how that will go? I have to note that this is news that may not have gotten quite a lot of attention in recent days because of all the drama surrounding the election, but three officials who led agencies were fired or replaced in just the past two days. And the chief of staff, Mark Meadows, who ostensibly runs things at the White House, has been diagnosed with coronavirus. We just learned that.\n\nSo do we have any sense of what a transition could look like? Is there a sense that the Trump administration will cooperate? Has any planning been going on?\n\nORDOÑEZ: Well, from the Trump side, you know, they have been saying that they do not - they were not thinking about a transition, that they planned to be reelected. President Trump also himself said repeatedly that he, you know, raised questions about whether he would hand over power easily. He argued that, you know, it wasn't handed over to him very well.\n\nAnd, you know, he also argued many times that considering, you know, mail-in voting, which he considered fraudulent, that it would not be a legal transfer - pardon me, a legal election. So he had been setting this up for so long. But as you noted, we're already seeing these very challenging signs of people leaving under questionable circumstances, the chief of staff getting the coronavirus. It's really - it's a - you know, we'll see.\n\nMARTIN: That's NPR White House correspondent Frank Ordonez.\n\nWe want to go now to Mara Liasson, NPR national political correspondent. Mara, why don't you pick up the thread there? And I know this is a situation where I might have to ask you to speculate a bit, but what is next for President Trump, assuming that he does leave office, as all signs indicate he now should?\n\nMARA LIASSON, BYLINE: Yeah. I think that it's going to be a very subtle kind of pressure campaign, in a way. You already hear his supporters on Fox News talking about his incredible legacy and that he would keep his legacy more burnished if he did step down in a dignified manner. You're not really hearing Republicans say out loud, please don't let the screen door hit you on the way out. But there aren't a lot of prominent Republican voices saying the election was stolen. You're the real winner. Dig your heels in. Don't leave. You're not hearing that.\n\nSo I think that over time, Trump is going to have to try to figure out a way to leave office but with his brand as someone who never loses and always wins intact. If he's going to continue to be the most important person in the Republican Party - and I think he will remain that for as long as he has a Twitter account - I think that he has to figure out a rationale. You know, I don't know if he says it was stolen from me, I'm the real president in exile, or I accomplished so much in four years - as much as any president could accomplish in 12.\n\nI don't know what he says, but he has to keep his brand intact because that's how he makes a living. He's monetized the brand. And the brand is his personality as a winner, somebody who's extremely successful.\n\nMARTIN: And...\n\nLIASSON: So that's going to take some time.\n\nMARTIN: And before we turn to Scott Detrow, I want to ask you, Mara Liasson, about the president-elect, Joe Biden. And what are what are his big challenges? We know he sent messaging around...\n\nLIASSON: Well...\n\nMARTIN: ...Wanting to lower the temperature and so forth. But beyond that, tell us more.\n\nLIASSON: Yeah, I think that his challenges are so big they're mind-boggling. I mean, he and Barack Obama came into office in 2008 in the midst of a financial crisis. Now he's coming into office in the midst of a pandemic, a recession, a huge debate about racial justice.\n\nBut as he said yesterday - he said, quote, they have given us a mandate for action on COVID and the economy and climate change and systemic racism. And they made it clear - they, the voters, made it clear they want the country to come together, not pull apart. So that is what he wants to communicate every day after January 20...\n\nMARTIN: And...\n\nLIASSON: ...And maybe even before.\n\nMARTIN: But - and how are - say, let's assume just for the sake of argument - I know it's not decided yet - that the Senate - that the Republicans retain control of the Senate. How are they likely to interpret that mandate?\n\nLIASSON: How are the Republicans?\n\nMARTIN: Republicans...\n\nLIASSON: Well, that's...\n\nMARTIN: Exactly.\n\nLIASSON: That's the big question. What does Mitch McConnell see in his political interest? Is it compromising with Joe Biden on certain things, or is it obstructing him at every step of the way, which he has the power to do? And we've seen him do it very effectively in the past.\n\nWe don't know the answer to that question. But Joe Biden is going to have to figure out how to take popular Democratic policies, whether it's a $15 an hour minimum wage, public option to Obamacare, something big on climate change, some kind of a big relief bill for people who are still suffering from the pandemic - how to sell those policies even if Republicans in the Senate don't want any part of them.\n\nMARTIN: That was NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson.\n\nLet's go to Scott Detrow now, NPR correspondent Scott Detrow, who has been following the Biden campaign. Scott Detrow, what do we expect to hear from President-elect Biden tonight?\n\nSCOTT DETROW, BYLINE: You know, I think, as Mara was saying, you're going to hear him start to set his agenda out, talk again about the idea that he feels like he has a mandate. And even though he certainly had a very decisive win in the presidential race, Republicans gained seats in the House, and Democrats really did not meet expectations in the Senate. So I think it's important for Biden to make that case early and often.\n\nI think we're going to expect to hear a lot of a constant theme from the Biden campaign - the idea of unifying the nation. One thing he said last night in that I-think-I've-quite-won-but-I-won't-quite-say-it-yet appearance - he said, the purpose of our politics, the work of this nation, is not to fan the flames of conflict but to solve problems. And lastly, I think we'll expect him to continue to talk about that No. 1 priority, getting this coronavirus pandemic under control. We have blown past previous daily records over the last week as we've counted these votes.\n\nOne thing in Biden's favor - a lot of the things he wants to do can be done in the executive branch. A lot of it is centralizing decision-making, not leaving it up to states, trying to push for more mask usage, getting more plans in place for this eventual vaccine. Those - that's work that Biden and his transition team can start right away.\n\nMARTIN: And just briefly, if you can, Scott, you know, this man has such a compelling personal story, which I think is well known at this point. I mean, having been sworn into his Senate seat from the hospital room where his boys were recovering after his wife and baby daughter were killed in a car crash - I mean, this is his third run over 30 years - a lot of, you know, losing his son Beau, who was a political star, a rising political star in his own right.\n\nI mean, what is likely to be his North Star in setting his course in the next couple of months and years as he addresses all these issues that Mara just outlined for us?\n\nDETROW: I think empathy, I think understanding a lot of Americans are in pain, whether it's financial pain or physical pain or losing loved ones to due to a pandemic. On Tuesday, he started the day visiting the grave of his son Beau. He later went to his childhood home, the home that he often talks about, his dad coming up the stairs to tell him he had lost his job and had to move.\n\nThere were a lot of sentimental journeys for Biden on Tuesday, but a lot of them came back to moments of real struggle that he overcame and something he always comes back to saying, I understand how that feels, and I understand how you feel right now. I think that will be a theme tonight, on January 20 and throughout the Biden administration.\n\nMARTIN: That was NPR correspondent Scott Detrow. We also heard from NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson and NPR White House correspondent Franco Ordoñez.\n\nThank you all so much for staying with us. And we know you'll stay with us throughout the evening. Thank you so much.\n\nDETROW: Thank you.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF EMANCIPATOR'S GOODNESS)\n\nCopyright © 2020 NPR. All rights reserved.

Sen. Hatch Apologizes For Calling Obamacare Supporters The 'Stupidest' People\n\nYouTube\n\nRepublican Sen. Orrin Hatch apologized Friday for saying those who support the Affordable Care Act are some of the stupidest, dumb-ass people he has ever met.\n\nHatch made the comments on Thursday at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative-leaning think tank in Washington, D.C.\n\nHe was praising the fact that the Republican tax legislation, signed into law in December, canceled out the provision of the ACA, or Obamacare, that penalized people who don't purchase health insurance.\n\n[Obamacare] was the stupidest, dumb-ass bill that I've ever seen, Hatch said. Now some of you may have loved it; if you do, you are one of the stupidest dumb-ass people I've ever met.\n\nIn a statement on Friday, Hatch called the comments, which he appeared to be reading as part of prepared remarks, a poorly worded joke that was not reflective of my actual feelings towards my friends on the other side.\n\nWhile I occasionally slip up, I believe that my legislative record reflects my commitment to bipartisanship and civility much more than my flippant, off-the-cuff comment, his statement said.\n\nThe majority of American adults, 54 percent, have a favorable view of the ACA, according to the most recent polling from the Kaiser Health Tracking Poll.\n\nThat represents a shift, however.\n\nFrom the moment it was enacted in 2010, the law had been mostly unpopular. It only began to gain consistent popularity in December 2016, as the possibility it would be repealed intensified when Republicans took control of the White House and both houses of Congress.\n\nI've been all over the world, a number of times, by the way, and frankly there's no other country that even comes close to ours, Hatch said Thursday. Well, there might be one or two that do pretty well, but they're really not in a league with us. As dumb as we are, and as stupid as some of our policies have been over the years, I can tell you that no other country can compete with the United States if we allow our true entrepreneurial spirit to go forward.
FACT CHECK: Donald Trump Unveils His Economic Plan In Major Detroit Speech\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Evan Vucci/AP Evan Vucci/AP\n\nEditor's note: NPR will also be fact-checking Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton's planned economic speech this Thursday.\n\nDonald Trump is coming off a week of disastrous headlines and cratering poll numbers. His major economic speech on Monday at the Detroit Economic Club, a vision described by his campaign as Winning the Global Competition, was a chance to turn the page.\n\nListen to Trump's Economic Speech 52:36\n\nDuring an address of just over an hour — which was interrupted multiple times by protesters — the GOP presidential nominee unveiled a new iteration of his proposal to reshape America's tax system. It has just three tax brackets (one fewer than the tax plan he released in September, which was removed from his website in the past 24 hours), would limit taxes on all forms of business income to 15 percent, would end the estate tax and would exclude childcare expenses from taxation.\n\nOther highlights include a proposed moratorium on all new federal regulations and would remove bureaucrats who only know how to kill jobs [and] replace them with experts who know how to create jobs, according to a preview released by his campaign. It's unclear exactly what that means or how it would work, but there are currently about 2.7 million civilian federal employees.\n\nAs for trade, which has been a centerpiece of his economic agenda, Trump reiterated calls for the U.S. to pull out of the Trans Pacific Partnership trade deal and for NAFTA to be renegotiated. He said would appoint trade negotiators whose goal will be to win for America, and he would apply tariffs on countries that cheat. Economists have raised concerns in the past that such tariffs could lead to a trade war that would ultimately hurt American interests.\n\nSpeaking at a rally later Monday afternoon in Florida, Hillary Clinton didn't pass up the opportunity to criticize Trump's economic speech. The Democratic presidential nominee pointed to a recent analysis, written by a former adviser of 2008 GOP presidential nominee John McCain, which showed her economic plan would create upwards of 10 million jobs, while Trump's could cost the country more than 3 million. She also accused Trump of scrambling to do damage control by listing a new group of economic advisers.\n\nHe's got, I don't know, a dozen or so economic advisers he just named: Hedge fund guys, billionaire guys, six guys named Steve, apparently. And so they wrote him a speech and he delivered it in Detroit. Now, they tried to make his old tired ideas sound new. But here's what we all know, because we heard it again. His tax plans will give super big tax breaks to large corporations and the really wealthy, just like him and the guys who wrote the speech, right, said Clinton. He wants to basically just repackage trickle-down economics.\n\nBelow is Trump's speech in its entirety, with annotations and fact-checks from NPR's team of political and economic reporters.\n\nDonald Trump, Detroit Economic Club\n\nThank you everybody, thank you very much. Thank you. Such a crowd - beautiful. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. Please.\n\nThank you for the invitation to speak to you today. It's wonderful to be in Detroit. I've been here many times. We now begin a great national conversation about economic renewal for America. It's a conversation about how to make America great again - for everyone, especially and I say especially, for those who have the very least.\n\nThe city of Detroit is where our story begins. Detroit was once the economic envy of the world. The people of Detroit helped to power America to its position of global dominance in the 20th century.\n\nWhen we were governed by the America First policy, Detroit was absolutely booming. Engineers, builders, laborers, shippers and countless others went to work each day, provided for their families and lived out, totally, lived out the American Dream. But for many living in this city, that dream has long ago vanished.\n\nWhen we abandoned the policy of America First, we started rebuilding other countries instead of our own. The skyscrapers went up in Beijing and many other cities in the world while the factories and neighborhoods crumbled right here in Detroit. Our roads and bridges fell into disrepair. Yet we found the money to resettle millions of refugees at taxpayer expense. Today, Detroit has per capita income of under $15K - about half of the national average.\n\n40% of the city's residents live in poverty, over two and a half times the national average.\n\n[This is true. The most recent figures show Detroit's poverty rate is 39.3 percent, which is more than the double the national average of 15.5 percent. -Will Huntsberry]\n\nThe unemployment rate is more than twice the national average.\n\n[This is technically true. Detroit city proper has an unemployment rate of 11.6 percent, which is twice the national average of 4.9 percent. However, the Bureau of Labor Statistics often figures these numbers by metro area. The Detroit metro area has an unemployment rate of 5.8 percent. -Will Huntsberry]\n\nHalf of all Detroit residents do not work.\n\n[It is true, according to the most recent data, that less than half of Detroiters have a job, but this figure includes small children and retirees. The 'employment-population ratio,' as calculated by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, showed that 43.9 percent of Detroiters had a job in 2014, while 59 percent of people in the United States had a job the same year. A more often cited statistic, which removes people younger than 16 from the calculus, is the 'participation rate.' It was 53.4 percent in Detroit and 62.9 percent for the United States. -Will Huntsberry]\n\nDetroit tops the list of the most dangerous cities in terms of violent crime.\n\n[Recent FBI data do show that among major cities, Detroit has the highest violent crime rate. However, the FBI also cautions against comparing cities' rates, as many factors, like population density, can affect a city's rate. — Danielle Kurtzleben]\n\nThese are silenced victims whose stories are never told by Hillary Clinton. But victims whose suffering is no less real or permanent. In short, the city of Detroit is the living, breathing example of my opponent's failed economic agenda. Every policy that has failed this city and so many others is a policy supported by Hillary Clinton.\n\n[Detroit's decline began more than 50 years ago, decades before NAFTA and other trade deals. Hillary Clinton wasn't in elected office or even first lady then. -Tamara Keith]\n\nShe supports the high taxes and radical regulation that forced jobs out of your community and the crime policies have made you far far less safe. And the immigration policies that have strained local budgets and the trade deals like NAFTA, signed by her husband, that have shipped your jobs to Mexico and other countries and she supports the education policies that deny your students choice, freedom and opportunity. She is the candidate of the past. Ours is the campaign of the future.\n\nThis is a city controlled by Democratic politicians at every level, and unless we change policies, we will not change results. One hundred percent.\n\n[Mayor Mike Duggan is a Democrat, and they city's mayors have been Democratic since 1962. But Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder is a Republican. — Jessica Taylor]\n\nToday, I will outline my economic vision. In the coming weeks, we will be offering more detail on all of these policies, and the ones we have already rolled out (protesters interrupt) ...thank you everybody. This is what happens when you go from thirty five people to close to two thousand people, I guess. — in the coming weeks, we will be offering more detail on all of these policies and the ones we have already rolled out can be viewed on my campaign website.\n\nOur opposition, on the other hand, has long ago run out of ideas. All Hillary Clinton has to offer is more of the same: more taxes, more regulations, more bureaucrats, more restrictions on American energy and on American production. More of that.\n\nIf you were a foreign power looking to weaken America, you couldn't do better than Hillary Clinton's economic agenda. Nothing would make our foreign adversaries happier than for our country to tax and regulate our companies and our jobs right out of existence. The one common feature of every Hillary Clinton idea is that it punishes you for working and doing business in the United States. Every policy she has tilts the playing field towards other countries at our expense. And that's why she tries to distract us with tired political rhetoric that seeks to label us, divide us, and pull us apart.\n\nMy campaign is about reaching out to everyone as Americans, and returning to a government that puts the American people first. Here is what an America First economic plan looks like.\n\nFirst, let's talk tax reform. Taxes are one of the biggest differences in this race. Hillary Clinton – who has spent her career voting for tax increases – plans another massive job-killing $1.3 trillion-dollar tax increase. Big increase - one of the biggest ever. Her plan would tax many small businesses by almost fifty percent.\n\nRecently, at a campaign event, Hillary Clinton short-circuited - you know this, you've heard this one - Hillary Clinton short-circuited again – to use a now famous term – when she accidentally told the truth and said she wanted to raise taxes on the middle class.\n\n[Politifact has rated this claim pants on fire, but Trump continues to say it at events, including in this highly scripted speech. Clinton has campaigned extensively on not raising taxes on the middle class. His campaign has circulated a misleading video with a caption saying she said she wants to raise taxes on the middle class, but you can hear she says we aren't going to raise taxes on the middle class - Tamara Keith]\n\nI am proposing an across-the-board income tax reduction, especially for middle-income Americans. This will lead to millions of new and really good-paying jobs. The rich will pay their fair share, but no one will pay so much that it destroys jobs, or undermines our ability as a nation to compete.\n\nAs part of this reform, we will eliminate the Carried Interest Deduction, a well-known deduction, and other special interest loopholes that have been so good for Wall Street investors, and people like me, but unfair to American workers. Tax simplification will be a major feature of the plan. Our current tax code is so burdensome and complex that we waste 9 billion hours a year in tax code compliance. My plan will reduce the current number of brackets from 7 to 3, and dramatically streamline the process.\n\n[Many politicians argue that streamlining the U.S. tax code is a good idea. However, cutting the number of brackets doesn't do a whole lot to simplify things. — Danielle Kurtzleben]\n\nWe will work with House Republicans on this plan, using the same brackets they have proposed: 12, 25 and 33 percent.\n\n[Last September Donald Trump released a tax plan with four tax brackets: 0, 10, 20 and 25 percent. It was pulled down from his website in the last 24 hours but can still be found through the internet archive. The new proposal eliminates the 0 percent bracket, thus making this line from Trump's original tax plan null: If you are single and earn less than $25,000, or married and jointly earn less than $50,000, you will not owe any income tax. That removes nearly 75 million households – over 50% – from the income tax rolls. They get a new one page form to send the IRS saying, I win, those who would otherwise owe income taxes will save an average of nearly $1,000 each. -Tamara Keith] [UPDATE: In an interview with Fox News Wednesday morning, Trump said the zero bracket is in there big league.]\n\nFor many American workers, their tax rate will be zero. While we will develop our own set of assumptions and policies, agreeing in some areas but not in all or in others, we will be focused on the same shared goals and guided by the same shared principles: jobs, growth and opportunity. These reforms will offer the biggest tax revolution since the Reagan Tax Reform, which unleashed years of continued economic growth and job creation. We will Make America Grow Again.\n\nIn the days ahead, we will provide more details on this plan and how it will help you and most importantly your family. It will present a night-and-day contrast to the job-killing, tax-raising, poverty-inducing Obama-Clinton agenda.\n\nSo important - the State of New York has already lived through Hillary Clinton's failed leadership. The Washington Post just published today a devastating article on Hillary Clinton's broken promises.\n\n[Here is that article. — Danielle Kurtzleben]\n\nShe pledged 200,000 jobs for upstate New York as Senator. But what happened? What happened? The Washington Post writes, and I quote: upstate job growth stagnated overall during her tenure, with manufacturing jobs plunging record-setting levels, plunging nearly 25 percent...the former first lady was totally unable to pass big ticket legislation... Many promised jobs they were all promised, I remember it so well...Vote for Hillary - she'll bring back your jobs, many promised jobs never materialized and others migrated to other states as she turned to her first presidential run which also was a disaster.\n\nData shows that upstate actually lost jobs a lot them during Clinton's first term. In other words, she was all talk, no action, upstate New York is a disaster. What's happened to upstate New York. And NAFTA, which her husband signed, is a very, very big reason.\n\n[Bill Clinton did sign NAFTA, but it's misleading to attribute that policy entirely to him. In fact, it was negotiated under George H.W. Bush, who signed it in 1992, as the Washington Post's Fact Checker has pointed out. After Congress passed it, Clinton then signed it into law in 1993. — Danielle Kurtzleben]\n\nCompare that to my record. In a recent New York Post article by Steve Cuozzo, How Donald Trump Helped Save New York City, the paper writes that I – and this is a direct quote in other words, it's not from me (crowd interruption) thank you...it's all very well planned out – and this is a direct quote that basically Donald Trump waded into a landscape of empty Fifth Avenue storefronts, the dust-bowl mugging ground that was Central Park so dangerous and a Wall Street area seemingly on its last legs as companies moved out...then almost by sheer force of will — [he] rode to the rescue. Expressing rare faith in the future, he was instrumental in kickstarting the regeneration of neighborhoods and landmarks almost given up on for dead.\n\nTrue. Have to say. I didn't say it. They said it. It's true. This is what I want to do.... We all remember New York City was a disaster. We made it great. We made it great. This is want I want to do for our country – I want to jumpstart America. And it can be done. And it won't even be that hard.\n\nNow let's look at what the Obama-Clinton policies have done nationally. Their policies produced 1.2% growth, the weakest so-called recovery since the Great Depression, it's been written about all over, it's a disaster and a doubling of the national debt during the Obama years. There are now 94.3 million Americans outside of the labor force. It was 80.5 million when President Obama took office, an increase of 14 million people.\n\n[His numbers are right (the number of people outside the labor force has grown by 13.8 million, according to the Labor Department). However, this statistic alone is misleading. The number of people in the labor force (that is, either working or looking for a job) has also grown by more than 5 million altogether since January 2009. It's true that the labor force participation rate — the share of Americans in the labor force — is low in recent years. However, as of 2014, the Congressional Budget Office attributed half of the recent decline to simple demographics, as an aging population retires. — Danielle Kurtzleben]\n\nThe Obama-Clinton agenda of tax, spend and regulate has created a silent nation of jobless Americans. Home ownership is at its lowest rate in 51 years.\n\n[Homeownership recently hit a 51-year low, as the Associated Press recently reported. However, the homeownership rate can be deceiving, as Trulia Chief Economist Jed Kolko wrote in 2014 at the New York Times. For some young adults who live with their parents, renting their own apartments could be a sign of economic progress. But as they go out and create their own households in those rented apartments, that could push down the homeownership rate (measured as a share of all households), even while their situations are improving. — Danielle Kurtzleben]\n\n(More protesters interrupt) Thank you...I will say the Bernie Sanders people had far more energy and spirit, I will say.\n\nNearly 12 million have been added to the food stamp and, these people are growing and growing so rapidly, since President Obama took office.\n\n[According to annual totals, more than 12 million more people were receiving SNAP benefits in 2015 than in 2009. However, Trump is wrong that the total is growing and growing so rapidly. The total number of recipients has fallen every month since December 2015, according to the USDA. And by the annual numbers, participation has been falling since 2013. — Danielle Kurtzleben]\n\nAnother nearly 7 million people, great Americans, are right now living in poverty.\n\n[The number of Americans in poverty grew by 6.8 million from 2008, the year before Obama took office, through 2014, the latest year of data available. The poverty rate (a better measure here, though it's still very flawed) is up by 1.6 percentage points, to 14.8 percent, though it is down from a high of 15.1 in 2010. Numbers aside, though, it's hard to blame President Obama for all these increases — for example, poverty was already rising when he took office. — Danielle Kurtzleben]\n\nWe have the lowest labor force participation rates in four decades.\n\n[His numbers are generally right here: the labor force participation rate — the share of people working or looking for work — right now is at 62.8 percent. That rate hit a recent low of 62.4 percent in September 2015, but it has been hanging in the 62 to 63 percent range for around two years now. The last time it was in that range was the late 1970s. However, this statistic is very easy to misunderstand. As we explained above, though some of the recent decline was due to weakness in the economy, some of this decline has been due to demographics (i.e., Baby Boomers retiring), so the decline in the rate isn't entirely a bad thing. — Danielle Kurtzleben]\n\n58 percent of the African-American youth are either outside the labor force or not employed.\n\n[Trump pointed to this table from the Labor Department, and the data do show that 58.5 percent of African-Americans age 16 to 24 aren't in the labor force or are unemployed. It's true that the unemployment rate is higher among black youth than among whites and Asian-Americans. Still, this figure seems high because many 16-to-24-year-old Americans (of any race) aren't in the labor force (for example, because they're in school). Around 49 percent of African American youth aren't in the labor force, by these data, compared to around 45 percent of all 16-to-24-year-olds. — Danielle Kurtzleben]\n\nOne in five American households do not have a single member in the labor force. Not a single member of a household. These are the real unemployment numbers – the five percent figure is one of the biggest hoaxes in American modern politics.\n\n[Earlier in the speech, Trump used Labor Department measures of unemployment for Detroit, but here he is calling the unemployment rate a hoax, which is a contradiction. His son, Donald Jr., has also said the numbers are manipulated for political gain. PolitiFact gave that claim a pants on fire rating. — Danielle Kurtzleben] [Aside from that, it's true that the current unemployment figure — 4.9 percent — is an incomplete way of measuring joblessness. In fact, that figure is just one of six different unemployment rates that the Labor Department computes each month to show different aspects of joblessness. However, that doesn't make the headline unemployment rate a hoax. As for the 1 in 5 figure, Trump is working off of a BLS report that found that 19.7 percent of families had no employed family members in 2015. That's different from in the labor force, and it's also an incomplete measure — the Labor Department's definition of family would include retired couples, for example. — Danielle Kurtzleben]\n\nMeanwhile, American households are earning more than $4,000 think of that, $4,000 less today than they were sixteen years ago. The average worker today pays 31.5 percent of their wages to income and payroll taxes. On top of that, state and local taxes consume another 10 percent. Very grim picture.\n\nThe United States also has the highest business tax rate among the major industrialized nations of the world, at 35 percent. It's almost 40 percent when you add in taxes at the state level and in many cases and in many states, it's much higher than that. In other words, we punish companies for making products in America – but let them ship products into the United States tax-free if they move overseas. This, ladies and gentlemen, is backwards, it's backwards. All of our policies should be geared towards keeping jobs and wealth inside of the United States.\n\nUnder my plan, no American company will pay more than 15% of their business income in taxes. In other words, we're reducing your taxes from 35% to 15%.\n\n[While the federal corporate tax rate is 35%, the Congressional Research Service found in 2014 that the average effective corporate tax rate was around 27% and the Government Accountability Office calculated in 2010 that profitable businesses were paying federal income taxes amounting to about 13% of their total global income. --Arnie Seipel] [Independent budget analysts have raised concerns that the 15% business rate would cause many people to quit their jobs and become independent contractors to pay lower taxes. This could cut into revenues severely. -Tamara Keith]\n\nThank you. Small businesses will benefit the most from this plan. Hillary Clinton's plan will require small business to pay as much as three times more in taxes than what I am proposing, and her onerous regulations will put them totally out of business and you won't be able to start — you can not ever start a small business under the tremendous regulatory burden that you have in today in our country. We're going to end it. I am going to cut regulations massively massively.\n\nOur lower business tax will also end job-killing corporate inversions, and cause trillions in new dollars and wealth to come pouring into our country – and by the way into cities like right here in Detroit. To help unleash this new job creation, we will allow businesses to immediately expense new business investments. No one will gain more from these proposals than low-and-middle income Americans.\n\nMy plan will also help reduce the cost of childcare by allowing parents to fully deduct the average cost of childcare spending from their taxes.\n\n[Tax and childcare experts say this proposal would favor upper middle class and wealthy Americans who spend more money on childcare than lower income familes. Lower income families are less likely to owe taxes and often do not file itemized taxes, so wouldn't be able to take advantage of a childcare deduction. Trump's campaign responded to criticism that his proposal would favor the wealthy with the following statement about his plan: Mr. Trump's plan would better help struggling families. Current policy does little to help afford costs that can exceed $1000 per month. The deduction will do more than credit for most working and middle class families. We provide credit to stay-at-home caregivers, which no current federal policy provides. To provide benefits to lower-income taxpayers who may not benefit from the deduction, the plan also allows parents to exclude childcare expenses from half of their payroll taxes—increasing their paycheck income each week.  – Trump campaign The campaign says to expect a fully detailed plan in the coming weeks. --Tamara Keith]\n\nWe are also going to bring back trillions of dollars from American businesses that are now parked overseas they can't bring their money back into our country. Our plan will bring that cash home, applying only a 10 percent tax. This money will be re-invested in states like Michigan, states like Michigan which are having serious problems. Finally, no family will have to pay the death tax. American workers have paid taxes their whole lives, and they should not be taxed again at death – it's just plain wrong. And most people agree with that. We will repeal it.\n\n[The death tax, or estate tax, applies this year to estates with combined assets exceeding $5.45 million. — Peter Overby ] [That applies to very few people — around 1 in 500 estates were subject to the tax last year, according to the Tax Policy Center. — Danielle Kurtzleben]\n\nNext comes regulatory reform. As with taxes, I will have one overriding goal when it comes to regulation: I want t jobs and I want wealth to stay in America. Motor vehicle manufacturing is one of the most heavily regulated industries in the country and even in the world. The U.S. economy today is twenty-five percent smaller than it would have been without the surge of regulations since 1980. It is estimated that current over-regulation is costing our economy as much as $2 trillion dollars a year – that's money taken straight out of cities like Detroit. So many of our cities are suffering so gravely, right out of Detroit and others. The federal register is now over 80,000 pages long.\n\nAs the Wall Street Journal noted, President Obama has issued close to four hundred new major regulations since taking office, each with a cost to the American economy of $100 million or more. In 2015 alone, the Obama Administration unilaterally issued more than 2,000 new regulations – each a hidden tax on American consumers, and a massive lead weight on the American economy. It is time to remove the anchor dragging us down, and that's what it's doing - it's dragging us down. Upon taking office, I will issue a temporary moratorium on new agency regulations.\n\nMy running mate, Mike Pence, and by the way, a great guy, signed a similar order when he became and when he worked so hard in Indiana as its governor. This will give our American companies the certainty they need to reinvest in our community, get cash off of the sidelines, start hiring new jobs, and expanding their businesses. So important. That's what it's about. I will also immediately cancel all illegal and overreaching executive orders.\n\nNext, I will ask each and every federal agency to prepare a list of all of the regulations they impose on Americans which are not necessary, do not improve public safety, and which needlessly kill many many jobs. Those regulations will be eliminated quickly. We are in a competition with the world, and I want America to win. We don't win anymore. But when I am president, we will start winning again, big league.\n\nOne of the most important reforms of all is trade reform. As Bernie Sanders has said, Hillary Clinton has bad judgment. We've seen this bad judgment overseas, in Libya, Iraq, and Syria. We've seen it in Iran. We've seen it from President Obama, when he gives $150 billion to Iran, the number one terror state, and even gives them $400 million in money-laundered cash as a ransom payment.\n\n[Trump is referring to the $400 million dollars flown to the Iranian government by the Obama administration in January, at the same time American prisoners were released from Iran. The money was part of a settlement of a decades-old legal dispute, involving military sales before the Shah was overthrown in 1979. The State Department said it is completely false to say it was a ransom payment, though it coincided with the release of American prisoners. The payment was made in foreign currencies because it's illegal to conduct a transaction with Iran in U.S. dollars under current law. --Arnie Seipel]\n\nBut we've also seen the terrible Obama-Clinton judgment right here for everybody to see in Detroit. Hillary Clinton has supported the trade deals stripping this city, and this country, of its jobs and its wealth. She supported Bill Clinton's NAFTA, she supported China's entrance into the World Trade Organization, she supported job-killing trade deal and that was a really bad one with South Korea, and she supports the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Not now, but very soon if she wins and we can't let her win. Cause that will be a disaster for Detroit and everybody else.\n\nLet's talk about South Korea for a moment, because it so perfectly illustrates the broken promises that have hurt so many American workers. President Obama, and the usual so-called experts who've been wrong about every trade deal for decades, predicted that the trade deal with South Korea would increase our exports to South Korea by more than $10 billion – resulting in some 70,000 jobs. Like Hillary Clinton's broken promises to New York, these pledges all turned out to be false. Instead of creating 70,000 jobs, it has killed nearly 100,000 jobs, according to the Economic Policy Institute. Our exports to South Korea haven't increased at all, but their imports to us have surged more than $15 billion – more than doubling our trade deficit with that country. What else is new? It's happening with everyone.\n\nThe next betrayal will be the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Hillary Clinton's closest friend, Terry McAuliffe, confirmed what I have been saying, and this is from the beginning: if sent to the Oval Office, Hillary Clinton will enact the TPP. As sure as you're sitting there. Her donors will make sure of it. A vote for Hillary Clinton is a vote for TPP – and it's also a vote for NAFTA.\n\n[Clinton and Trump alike are in favor of renegotiating NAFTA, as the Washington Post's Fact Checker reports. — Danielle Kurtzleben]\n\nOur annual trade deficit in goods with Mexico has risen from close to zero, think of that, in 1993 to almost $60 billion today. Our total trade deficit in goods hit nearly $800 billion last year. Total trade deficit. Almost $800 billion. This is a strike at the heart of Michigan, and our nation as a whole. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, before NAFTA went into effect, there were 285,000 auto workers in Michigan. Today, that number is only 160,000. Detroit is still waiting for Hillary Clinton's apology. She has been a disaster. Obama has been a disaster. I expect Detroit will get that apology right around the same time Hillary Clinton turns over the 33,000 emails she deleted.\n\nHillary Clinton's Trans-Pacific Partnership will be an even bigger disaster for the auto industry, believe me, even bigger and even worse than NAFTA. In fact, Ford Motor Company has announced its opposition to the deal. According to the Economic Policy Institute, the U.S. trade deficit with the proposed TPP member, all of the member countries has cost over 1 million manufacturing jobs in the year 2015.\n\nBy far the biggest losses occurred in motor vehicles and parts, which lost nearly 740,000 manufacturing jobs. What are we doing? Michigan ranks first for jobs lost as a share of state workforce due to the trade deficit with TPP members. Just imagine how many more automobile jobs will be lost if the TPP is actually approved. It will be catastrophic. That is why I have announced we will withdraw from the deal before that can ever ever ever happen.\n\nHillary Clinton will never withdraw from TPP. She is bought, controlled and paid-for by her donors and special interests. One hundred percent. Because my only interest is the American people, I have previously laid out a detailed 7-point plan for trade reform, available on my website. It includes strong protections against currency manipulation, big problem, tariffs against any countries that cheat by unfairly subsidizing their goods, and it includes a total renegotiation of NAFTA, which is a disaster for our country. A total renegotiation. If we don't get a better deal, we will walk away.\n\nAt the center of my plan is trade enforcement with China. This alone could return millions of jobs into our country. They break the rules in every way imaginable. China engages in illegal export subsidies, prohibited currency manipulation, and rampant theft of intellectual property. They also have no real environmental or labor protections, further undercutting American workers. Just enforcing intellectual property rules alone could save millions of American jobs. According to the U.S. International Trade Commission, improved protection of America's intellectual property in China would produce more than 2 million more jobs right here in the United States. Add to that the saved jobs from cracking down on currency cheating and product dumping, and we will bring trillions of dollars in new wealth and wages back to the United States.\n\nTrade has big benefits, and I am in favor of trade. But I want great trade deals for our country that create more jobs and higher wages for American workers. Isolation is not an option, only great and well-crafted trade deals are.\n\nAlso critical to our economic renewal will be energy reform. The Obama-Clinton Administration has blocked and destroyed millions of jobs through their anti-energy regulations, while raising the price of electricity for both families and businesses. As a result of recent Obama EPA actions coal-fired power plants across Michigan have either shut down entirely or undergone expensive conversions. The Obama-Clinton war on coal has cost Michigan over 50,000 jobs.\n\n[According to a study in Energy Policy, the coal industry lost about 50,000 jobs nationally between 2008 and 2012. Another study by the Energy Information Administration suggests that the rise of cheap natural gas has impacted the coal industry — Jonquilyn Hill]\n\nHillary Clinton says her plan will put a lot of coal companies and coal miners out of business. We will put our coal miners and steel workers back to work. Clinton not only embraces President Obama's job-killing energy restrictions but wants to expand them, including going after oil and natural gas production that employs some 10 million Americans. According to the Heritage Foundation, by 2030, the Obama-Clinton energy restrictions will eliminate another half a million manufacturing jobs, reduce economic output by $2.5 trillion dollars, and reduce incomes by $7,000 dollars per person.\n\nA Trump Administration will end this war on the American worker, and unleash an energy revolution that will bring vast new wealth to our country. According to the Institute for Energy Research, lifting the restrictions on all sources of American energy will: Increase GDP by more than $100 billion dollars annually, add over 500,000 new jobs annually, and increase annual wages by more than $30 billion dollars over the next 7 years; Increase federal, state, and local tax revenues by almost $6 trillion dollars over 4 decades; Increase total economic activity by more than $20 trillion dollars over the next 40 years. The reforms I have outlined today are only the beginning When we reform our tax, trade, energy and regulatory policies, we will open a new chapter in American Prosperity. We can use this new wealth to rebuild our military and our infrastructure.\n\nAs part of this new future, we will also be rolling out proposals to increase choice and reduce cost in childcare, offering much-needed relief to American families. I will unveil my plan on this in the coming weeks that I have been working on with my daughter Ivanka and an incredible team of experts. Likewise, our education reforms will help parents send their kids to a school of their choice. We will also give our police and law enforcement the funds and support they need to restore law and order to this country. Without security, there can be no prosperity. We must have law and order. In the coming days, we will be rolling out plans on all of these items. One of my first acts as President will be to repeal and replace disastrous Obamacare, saving another 2 million American jobs.\n\n[In a footnote to the speech, Trump pointed to a December 2015 CBO working paper, which estimated that in 2025, the labor force would be smaller by 2 million full-time-equivalent workers than it would be without Obamacare — meaning people would work fewer hours, enough to equal 2 million FTE workers. However, that's not necessarily bad for those people: a combination of factors would reduce the amount of work done in the U.S. economy: Some people would choose to work fewer hours; others would leave the labor force entirely or remain unemployed for longer than they otherwise would, the CBO reported. In other words, some people might work less because health insurance is no longer a big incentive to working. — Danielle Kurtzleben]\n\nWe will also rebuild our military, and get our allies to pay their fair share for the protection we provide – saving us countless more billions to invest in our own country. We also have a plan, on our website, for a complete reform of the Veterans Health Administration. This is something so desperately needed to make sure our vets are fully supported and get the care they deserve.\n\nDetroit – the Motor City – will come roaring back. We will offer a new future, not the same old failed policies of the past. Our party has chosen to make new history by selecting a nominee from outside the rigged and corrupt system. The other party has reached backwards into the past to choose a nominee from yesterday – who offers only the rhetoric of yesterday, and the policies of yesterday.\n\nThere will be no change under Hillary Clinton – only four more years of Obama. But we are going to look boldly into the future. We will build the next generation of roads, bridges, railways, tunnels, sea ports and airports that our country deserves. American cars will travel the roads, American planes will connect our cities, and American ships will patrol the seas. American steel will send new skyscrapers soaring. We will put new American metal into the spine of this nation. It will be American hands that rebuild this country, and it will be American energy - mined from American sources - that powers this country. It will be American workers who are hired to do the job.\n\n[This is a frequent campaign promise from Trump, but his own hiring practices haven't always reflected this view. A recent Buzzfeed article detailed Trump's effort to bring in foreign guest workers for his Mar-a-Lago resort. When asked about this, Trump has said it is hard to get enough American workers for these seasonal jobs. -Tamara Keith]\n\nAmericanism, not globalism, will be our new credo. Our country will reach amazing new heights. All we have to do is stop relying on the tired voices of the past. We can't fix a rigged system by relying on the people who rigged it in the first place. We can't solve our problems by relying on the politicians who created them. Only by changing to new leadership, and new solutions, will we get new results. We need to stop believing in politicians, and start believing in America.\n\nBefore everything great that has ever happened, the doubters have always said it couldn't be done. America is ready to prove the doubters wrong. They want you to think small. I am asking you to think big. We are ready to dream great things for our country once again. We are ready to show the world that America is Back – Bigger, and Better and Stronger Than Ever Before. Thank you, and God Bless You.
Looking Ahead: Confirmation Process Of Trump Supreme Court Nominee\n\nMICHEL MARTIN, HOST:\n\nEarlier this evening, President Trump ended the speculation when he announced his nominee to the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Today it is my honor to nominate one of our nation's most brilliant and gifted legal minds to the Supreme Court. She is a woman of unparalleled achievement, towering intellect, sterling credentials and unyielding loyalty to the Constitution - Judge Amy Coney Barrett.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nMARTIN: Amy Coney Barrett currently sits on the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals in Indiana. President Trump has said correctly that his office carries the constitutional obligation to make a nomination. But the timing - just over a week after the death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, just weeks before fiercely contested national elections at a time when early voting is already taking place - makes this one of the most controversial nominations in recent decades.\n\nJoining me now to talk about the nominee and the politics is NPR legal affairs correspondent Nina Totenberg. Nina, welcome back.\n\nNINA TOTENBERG, BYLINE: Thank you.\n\nMARTIN: And NPR senior political correspondent Mara Liasson. Mara, welcome to you as well.\n\nAnd, Nina, let me start with you. What do we know...\n\nMARA LIASSON, BYLINE: Thanks for having me.\n\nMARTIN: What do we know about Judge Barrett?\n\nTOTENBERG: Well, we know that she's been on the 3rd - on the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals for three years, authored about 100 opinions. Prior to that, she was on the Notre Dame faculty for 15 years, was a beloved teacher and had an extensive record of legal writings in academia. That record is generally considered hostile to abortion rights and to Obamacare. At her confirmation hearing three years ago, she said that as an appeals court judge, of course, she would be bound by Supreme Court rulings. If she's confirmed, though, she will not be so bound.\n\nAnd I think you could look for her, conceivably, to vote to overrule some of those, including some of the Supreme Court's major abortion precedents. She's been critical of Chief Justice Roberts' opinion upholding Obamacare in addition. If confirmed to the court - she's 48 years old. She'd be the youngest justice on the court and would almost certainly serve for decades to come.\n\nMARTIN: And what would be the impact on the court if she is confirmed, given that the court already has a conservative 5-4 majority?\n\nTOTENBERG: Well, there'd be a 6-3 majority - at least on any, you know, close case. And so that means that even if one or - one other of the justices were to vote with the court's liberals, it would actually take two of them to switch their positions or to switch the position of the court from what one might expect. It also means, I think, that Chief Justice John Roberts would have less leverage. He, in the last term, was a critical vote in several important cases. And he would no longer be a critical vote. So his controlling vote would no longer be controlling. And that means that the court would go in a very, very conservative direction - probably for a very long time.\n\nMARTIN: Let's go to Mara Liasson. Mara, in terms of the politics - just 38 days until Election Day - how does President Trump going ahead with this nomination today affect the election on November 3? What are the potential risks and benefits for the president and for - frankly for his party?\n\nLIASSON: Well, there are risks and benefits. And we're all waiting to see which side is galvanized and energized more by this nomination. Is it Republican voters who now have gotten pretty much the holy grail - what they've been working for for 40 years? Conservative activists have wanted a durable conservative majority on the court. Now, they're going to get one, 6-3. Does that mean that they're happy and excited and grateful and turn out in larger numbers to vote for Donald Trump? Do suburban women take a look at Amy Coney Barrett and her beautiful family and decide she's like them and put aside some of their concerns about Donald Trump's behavior? Or do Democrats, who are extremely angry and upset, feel the process was unfair, feel their rights are going to be taken away by a 6-3 court? Are they more energized? So those are the big questions.\n\nIt also could have an effect in some Senate races. It could make it harder for Susan Collins of Maine or Cory Gardner of Colorado - two Republican incumbents - to win reelection because they are in blue states. But, on the other hand, it could help Lindsey Graham who is the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and he is in a surprisingly close race in South Carolina. So we're going to wait and see.\n\nMARTIN: Very briefly - the confirmation hearings begin on October 12. Nina, what do you expect to see - as briefly as you can?\n\nTOTENBERG: Well, I expect to see a lot of controversy. But in the last analysis, it will be - the Democrats will try to frame the argument in terms of Obamacare and abortion, I suspect, and the fact that they think that this is horribly unfair, undemocratic. And if - that last argument, Mara can speak to this, may not have much leverage.\n\nMARTIN: Well, I'm sure she will in the days ahead. That's NPR legal affairs correspondent Nina Totenberg and NPR senior political correspondent Mara Liasson. Thank you both so much.\n\nTOTENBERG: Thank you.\n\nCopyright © 2020 NPR.

Supreme Court To Consider Constitutionality Of Obamacare\n\nThe Supreme Court will hear a case Tuesday questioning the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act. NPR's Audie Cornish speaks with medical pricing expert Erin Fuse Brown about what's at stake.\n\nAUDIE CORNISH, HOST:\n\nThe fight over the Affordable Care Act that will play out at the Supreme Court tomorrow began more than a decade ago.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nBARACK OBAMA: Let's be the generation that says right here, right now, we will have universal health care in America by the end of the next president's first term. We can do that.\n\nCORNISH: That was then-Senator Barack Obama on a frigid February 10, 2007, announcing his run for the White House. And it was that seed - the call for universal health care - that would become the year's long legal and political fight over the Affordable Care Act. But in that time, millions have gotten insurance through the law - people like Amanda Shelley (ph), who could not qualify for insurance because of a preexisting condition...\n\nAMANDA SHELLEY: I was not one of the poor people that people think are signing up for Obamacare. I was - I'm one of the well-off people. On January 3, I started having some pain in my abdomen. And I tried to ignore it because I'm used to ignoring things because I didn't have insurance. And two days later, I had my gallbladder out urgently.\n\nCORNISH: ...Or Brad Stevens (ph) in Lakeport, Calif.\n\nBRAD STEVENS: I have been uninsured for most of my - let's see - adult life. I've always tried to take care of myself and be healthy, exercise and eat right. And boom. I ended up with cancer, thyroid cancer.\n\nCORNISH: Stevens qualified for Medicaid when California expanded its rules under the law. Now, not everything with the ACA has gone smoothly. There was the shaky rollout, an initial increase in premiums. But the biggest threat to its viability has always been the concerted and repeated efforts by Republicans to undermine it, a cause that then-candidate Donald Trump took up when he first ran in 2016.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: We're going to repeal and replace Obamacare. It is a total disaster. We're repealing and replacing Obamacare. It's gone.\n\nCORNISH: Trump and the GOP in Congress have yet to succeed in fulfilling that campaign promise, even though House Republicans voted several dozen times to overturn the law. Most of those were symbolic since few were ever taken up in the Senate. But the legislative effort to scrap the bill came close in the early hours of July 27, 2017.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nUNIDENTIFIED REPORTER: Republican Senator John McCain was the one who cast the deciding vote that defeated the Republicans' latest attempt to dismantle Obamacare. Hours after...\n\nCORNISH: Now, as things are about to change in Washington, it will be the nine justices of the Supreme Court who will decide if the ACA survives this latest challenge. Joining us now is Erin Fuse Brown. She's the director of the Center for Law, Health and Society at Georgia State College of Law.\n\nWelcome to ALL THINGS CONSIDERED.\n\nERIN FUSE BROWN: Hi, Audie.\n\nCORNISH: To begin, what is at stake tomorrow?\n\nFUSE BROWN: So the stakes couldn't be higher. The entire health care system was affected by the Affordable Care Act, and the entire Affordable Care Act is being argued in the court tomorrow. And so, in some ways, you know, the entire health care system is waiting to see what will happen because millions of people could lose coverage, and the entire health care system could be altered fundamentally if the court rules against the Affordable Care Act.\n\nCORNISH: I want to explore this idea of severability because this is at the heart of the case brought by the state of Texas. They argue that since Congress cut a part of the law, the individual mandate, the rest of the law needs to be invalidated. Can you talk about what kind of support that argument has?\n\nFUSE BROWN: Legal experts from both sides of the political spectrum have argued that this is a very, very weak argument because the presumption in most instances is that even if one part of a law is considered to be unconstitutional, the court is going to interpret it to preserve as much of the law as possible because that was what Congress would have wanted. And here, the idea is, can we separate the individual mandate - if it turns out to be unconstitutional - from the rest of this sprawling 1,000-page Affordable Care Act?\n\nCORNISH: There's some irony here because I remember covering Congress when the law was passed, and that actually was the argument from Democrats. Without the individual mandate, the whole thing doesn't work.\n\nFUSE BROWN: The individual mandate was considered very critical in the beginning. The thing that we've been surprised to find is that the individual mandate isn't exactly necessary. Since 2019, we actually haven't had a functioning individual mandate.\n\nCORNISH: Because people can't pay the penalty even if they wanted to, right? Like, you can't actually be financially penalized for not having insurance anymore.\n\nFUSE BROWN: Correct. So it's an entirely toothless mandate. It's unenforceable. And people are still buying insurance. And so what we found is that the individual mandate is not necessary to the entire statute for the - all of the insurance provisions to work.\n\nCORNISH: As you've described, it's your belief that this argument around severability isn't going to work, that it's weak. What happens if this law is struck down? Give us the what if.\n\nFUSE BROWN: So the what if - even if, you know, this is a legally weak argument, we are here at the Supreme Court. So there is a possibility, albeit small, that the Supreme Court could strike down the entire law. And if that happens, then utter chaos will follow. If the entire law is struck down, I think one of the biggest immediate implications is that over 21 million people are going to lose their health insurance.\n\nCORNISH: Why is that? Is the idea that all the insurers would just say, you know what; we've been making a ton of profit on this, but now we don't have to do it anymore, so good luck, everyone?\n\nFUSE BROWN: These are the people who actually gained coverage under the Affordable Care Act. So if you are someone who shops for insurance on healthcare.gov and gets subsidies - valuable, you know, payments to help make that coverage affordable - all of that subsidy would go away. Healthcare.gov would disappear. The products themselves may not be there anymore. So all of those people would lose coverage. In addition, the Affordable Care Act also expanded Medicaid. Medicaid's covered a lot, many, many millions of people. And so about 12 million people would lose their Medicaid coverage if the Affordable Care Act were to be struck down in its entirety.\n\nCORNISH: How would this affect people, though, who don't use the exchanges or get the subsidies? I mean, what would that mean to, I guess, the private market?\n\nFUSE BROWN: If you have employer-based coverage, one of the big things that the Affordable Care Act did was to make it illegal for these plans to limit annual or lifetime benefits. And so for people who have employer-based or private insurance coverage, this is really an important protection. If you have cancer, if you have a chronic illness, if you have really expensive health needs, then this is a huge protection.\n\nCORNISH: We've been here before, as you've said. I mean, also, we've been looking at 2012, when the court kept the law intact. Congress has since kind of whittled away at it even though they've never made it to a full repeal. Do you think that this is the end of this conversation?\n\nFUSE BROWN: No, I don't think this is the end of the conversation. I think, in some ways, you know, Congress still has a huge role to play. And the fact that Congress has been chipping away at the Affordable Care Act doesn't mean the Affordable Care Act has been eliminated. In fact, the only thing Congress was able to successfully eliminate was this penalty for the individual mandate. And so what we're seeing is that the Affordable Care Act remains alive and well. And this is just another sort of legal strategy to take it down because the legislative means have failed.\n\nAnd one of the things that this could open up, though, is for future Congress - a future congressional fix. And so if the Supreme Court, for example, were to decide that this is - the individual mandate is not severable or that the parts of the act have to be struck down, then it's really in Congress's hands at that point to fix it.\n\nCORNISH: Erin Fuse Brown is an associate professor of law at Georgia State University.\n\nThank you for explaining this to us.\n\nFUSE BROWN: Thank you.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF THE COMET IS COMING'S THE SEVEN PLANETARY HEAVENS)\n\nCopyright © 2020 NPR.

How Does 1 Man Have So Much Power Without Being President?\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Andrew Harnik/AP Andrew Harnik/AP\n\nHow does one man have so much power?\n\nOne hears that question asked in Washington a lot these days, often with exasperation and bewilderment.\n\nAnd it is not always a reference to President Trump.\n\nQuite often, the man in question is Mitch McConnell, the Republican senator from Kentucky.\n\nThe man who calls himself the Grim Reaper — of signature Democratic initiatives.\n\nMcConnell's status stems from his office as the Senate majority leader — elected by his party colleagues to lead their conference in the chamber. But few who have held this office have been able to wield it with this kind of results.\n\nIn today's Senate, McConnell can decide virtually by himself what the chamber will do — and even what it will consider doing.\n\nYou may have first noticed McConnell early in 2016 when he proclaimed the Senate would not consider any nominee appointed by President Obama to fill the Supreme Court seat vacated by the death of Antonin Scalia. McConnell made this announcement on his own, within hours of Scalia's death.\n\nThis year, McConnell has issued similar summary judgments on House-passed bills to reform election laws, combat foreign interference in U.S. elections and strengthen gun control.\n\nIn each of these instances, the question arose: How can one man make this kind of momentous decision and make it stick?\n\nMcConnell is a master of Senate procedure and rules. He is also a remarkable politician, as NPR reporters have detailed for decades and as Kelly McEvers has documented in her five-part series on the NPR Embedded podcast this summer.\n\nEmerging bosses of the Senate\n\nBut how much of McConnell's power comes from his position as majority leader?\n\nHow big a deal is the job itself? Through most of our history, there wasn't one. And since the office was created a century ago, its occupant has typically been little known outside of Washington.\n\nEveryone knows the most powerful member of the House is the speaker, a title that is found in Article I of the U.S. Constitution (as written in 1787). Successive generations have rewritten the definition somewhat, but the position remains enormously influential for its power to bring bills to the floor or ignore them.\n\nThe office of Senate majority leader does not appear in any of the founding documents. The speaker ranks high in the line of presidential succession, right after the vice president. The Senate majority leader's position in the succession is — nowhere.\n\nThe Founding Fathers saw the Senate as a small body (initially about two dozen) that would largely govern itself, under the watchful eye of the president of the Senate — a job assigned to whoever happened to be vice president of the United States. If the veep was unavailable, the task of presiding passed to a senator designated as the Senate president pro tempore — the presiding officer for the time being.\n\nAs the Senate evolved, the idea of the presiding officer atrophied in importance. The vice president stopped attending Senate sessions except for ceremonial occasions or to cast a tiebreaking vote. The Senate was largely run by its strongest personalities and committee chairmen.\n\nThe job of official majority or minority leader in the Senate did not even exist until about a century ago, in the era around the World War I when the Constitution had just been changed to elect senators by popular vote rather than by state legislators.\n\nThe Democrats started designating a leader in 1920. Republicans had an acknowledged leader at the time in Henry Cabot Lodge of Massachusetts, but they did not officially designate one until the mid-1920s.\n\nSince then, the elected leaders of the majority and minority parties have been the titular bosses, although largely beholden to the barons of the committee structure and other individual senators of importance.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption AP AP\n\nA sea change of sorts came with the elevation of Lyndon B. Johnson of Texas to the majority leader's post in 1955. Johnson had only been in the Senate for one term at the time but had the backing of the venerable Richard Russell of Georgia (the Dixie Democrat for whom the original Senate office building is named). Johnson grew rapidly in the job, finding it possible through force of personality and persuasion to move the Senate – including its notorious bloc of Southern segregationists.\n\nWhen LBJ left to become vice president in 1961, the job passed to Mike Mansfield of Montana, who held it for 16 years through the civil rights bills, the Vietnam War and the Watergate investigation. His successor was Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia, who wound up being the longest-serving senator in history and the party leader from 1977 to 1989.\n\nIllinois Sen. Everett Dirksen, also commemorated in a Senate office building, led the GOP from 1959 to his death in 1969 and left a legacy of eloquence and moderation. But he never got to be majority leader. His son-in-law, Howard Baker of Tennessee, led the GOP in the majority during the important first term of Ronald Reagan's presidency.\n\nOthers have also left a mark in a relatively short time in the job. Many Republicans still revere Robert A. Taft, who had the job for just six months before his death in 1953. George Mitchell of Maine was widely admired for his execution of the job for the Democrats for six years, four under President Bill Clinton.\n\nMore recently, the job had passed from one able and ambitious politician to another without much change in its status. It came to be mocked by some as the majority follower, as some who had the job struggled mightily to form consensus within their ranks. Some have also found being the leader was hazardous to their political health back home or hobbling for their presidential ambitions.\n\nMcConnell's tenure in the leader position\n\nMcConnell's predecessor as Republican leader was Bill Frist of Tennessee. He got the job suddenly and unexpectedly when Trent Lott of Mississippi resigned.\n\nA distinguished heart surgeon, Frist had not been in leadership before and never seemed at ease in the job. But he benefited by having a more seasoned deputy, Mitch McConnell, who then stepped up to be the party's No. 1 upon Frist's retirement in 2007. He has held that spot since.\n\nSo McConnell's current power is not inherent in his title. Nor is he so personally compelling that he bends the will of others to his own in the manner of LBJ.\n\nMcConnell has his remarkable power in the nation's affairs right now because his own position has become a pivotal nexus for other forces in Republican politics.\n\nThe election of Donald Trump in 2016, the loss of the party's majority in the House in 2018, the extraordinary cohesiveness of the Republican Senate in its public support of the president, and the sense of momentous demographic and social change coming in the decades ahead have made the job of Senate majority leader more important. It is now perhaps more important to the GOP than ever before.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption J. Scott Applewhite/AP J. Scott Applewhite/AP\n\nThe most evident of these forces is, of course, the election of Trump. McConnell was not onboard the Trump train in the early stages of the 2016 cycle. He officially backed Rand Paul, the Republican junior senator from his own home state. When Paul dropped out, McConnell stayed neutral. He was critical of Trump at times but did not join the active resistance to his nomination.\n\nControl of the Senate was very much up for grabs in the 2016 cycle, and, at times, it appeared likely Trump would lose to Hillary Clinton and depress Republican turnout in the process. That was seen as damaging or even fatal to the prospects of several Republicans in close races.\n\nMcConnell could see his status in the majority slipping away after having it just two years. So he calibrated his responses to campaign events carefully. At one point, he simply refused to take any questions at all regarding the party's presidential nominee.\n\nNonetheless, when Trump won, McConnell was right there to offer his full-throated support. And within days, the new relationship was cemented by Trump's appointment of McConnell's wife, Elaine Chao, as secretary of transportation. (Chao had been secretary of labor for all eight years of George W. Bush's presidency.)\n\nWhile their backgrounds and lifetime experiences are worlds apart, McConnell and Trump share an approach to politics that is more transactional than ideological. Both embrace a robust form of free market capitalism, with incentives for business emphasized over taxes and regulation. But like Trump, McConnell has found success as an organizer of political energy and power more than as a thought leader.\n\nMcConnell was not able to deliver the clean repeal of Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, that Trump wanted, but blame for that fell on the late Sen. John McCain, whose dramatic thumbs-down doomed the repeal in 2017. McConnell did, however, get credit for steering the big tax cut through the Senate labyrinth later that year.\n\nAnd McConnell has been crucial in securing the single clearest accomplishment of the Trump presidency to date – the confirmation of more than 130 federal judges, including two Supreme Court justices.\n\nMcConnell has been able to establish a veritable assembly line for judicial confirmations because he disarmed the Democratic minority by changing the rules of the Senate. He first eliminated the use of extended debate — or filibuster — to delay or defeat nominees to the Supreme Court. (Democrats had left the filibuster in place for the Supreme Court when they eliminated it for other presidential appointments such as Cabinet members.)\n\nThen, McConnell changed the procedures for processing other judicial appointments, procedures Republican senators had used to hold up scores of judicial nominees during the Obama presidency (leaving open the very vacancies that Trump and McConnell have since filled).\n\nNone of this would be possible, of course, without the remarkable degree of cohesion and loyalty McConnell has commanded within his own party in the Senate. While individual Republicans have at times complained privately about the president or the majority leader, they have stood by the two of them on virtually every vote since the Obamacare failure. An exception that tends to prove the rule was the Senate vote to block certain arms sales to Saudi Arabia. The president vetoed that, and the Senate upheld his veto.\n\nThe latest example was the Senate's acquiescence in passing the two-year budget deal that suspended the debt ceiling until 2021 and lifted caps on both military and domestic spending. The bill required conservative Republican senators to swallow more than $1 trillion in new debt in each of the next two budget years, and the high likelihood of still higher deficits thereafter. Moreover, the administration had negotiated it primarily with Speaker Nancy Pelosi.\n\nYet, when the time came for the crucial vote, McConnell delivered enough Republicans to get it done.\n\nAnother example of how the Trump era, at least on Capitol Hill, is best understood as the Trump-McConnell era.
ACA Insurers In The Supreme Court: Why Consumers Should Pay Attention\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Phil Roeder/Getty Images Phil Roeder/Getty Images\n\nMore than $12 billion is at stake for the nation's health insurers Tuesday when the Supreme Court hears a case involving the Affordable Care Act.\n\nFor the federal government, the potential damages could be far greater, as its reputation as a reliable partner to private businesses is on the line.\n\nUnlike earlier Obamacare cases before the high court — where the entire 2010 law and health coverage for millions of Americans was at risk — the latest case has largely flown under consumers' radar.\n\nThe case revolves around a temporary provision in the federal health law — called the risk-corridor program — that was designed to help health plans recover some losses in the first three years of ACA marketplaces' existence.\n\nThe Republican-controlled Congress in late 2014 stripped most of the money out of the program in a budget bill signed by President Barack Obama. This occurred a year after insurers began selling policies to millions of Americans with the expectation that the safeguard would back them up.\n\nRepublicans led by Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., who were determined to repeal the ACA, called the original provision an insurer slush fund. But researchers later found that the loss of the risk-corridor program was largely responsible for soaring premiums in 2016 and 2017 and contributed to several startup insurers going out of business.\n\nDozens of insurers have cried foul and sued the government. Lower courts were split on whether the government should be forced to make the payments.\n\nHere are five reasons you should pay attention to the case:\n\n1. The integrity of the federal government is at stake.\n\nHealth insurers say the government's decision on the risk-corridor program amounts to a bait-and-switch. The health plans took a chance with the new marketplaces, where they had little knowledge of how sick or expensive new enrollees would be. They said they expected the risk-corridor funding would back them up.\n\nThe latest data show the government owes insurers more than $12 billion in payments to cover losses on the insurance exchanges between 2014 and 2016.\n\nThis case warrants comparison to Lucy Van Pelt pulling the football away from Charlie Brown — with our nation's government cast as the capricious bully, the Association for Community Affiliated Plans, an industry group representing nonprofit health plans, says in an amicus brief to the Supreme Court. If the Federal Circuit's rule stands, then from now on no business can trust a statutory promise of payment from the government.\n\nThe risk-corridor program was one of several ACA safeguards for insurers. The law called for insurers that made large profits to pay some of it back to the government — to share with money-losing plans.\n\nBut the money taken in under the program fell billions short of the amount owed to insurers. The Obama administration told insurers that it would make up the difference with funds from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services' budget. The U.S. Government Accountability Office, the investigative arm of Congress, supported that decision for 2014.\n\nThe Trump administration argues the federal government never had power under the law to make the payments out of the CMS budget. The December 2014 budget deal confirmed that, according to the administration.\n\nThe federal government's top lawyer rejects insurers' notion that the risk-corridor money was ever guaranteed to them.\n\nCongress did not lure private parties into expensive undertakings with clear promises, only to renege after private parties have relied to their detriment and incurred actual losses, Solicitor General Noel Francisco has argued in court briefs.\n\n2. Obamacare consumers may benefit if the court sides with the insurers.\n\nThe Supreme Court case combined suits from four insurers: Moda Health Plan of Oregon, Maine Community Health Options, Blue Cross Blue Shield of North Carolina and Land of Lincoln Mutual Health Insurance, a now-defunct health plan from Illinois. But dozens of other insurers also have filed lawsuits. If the court rules in favor of insurers, it could force the federal government to pay them $12 billion.\n\nExperts say that could have a marginal effect on those insurers in setting future premiums. It could also force some plans to make rebate payments to customers based on another ACA provision that plans pay money back to members if they spend more than 20% of their premium dollars on administration, marketing and profits.\n\nMeg Murray, CEO of the Association for Community Affiliated Plans, says the government owes $627 million to about 20 of her organization's plans. The money would help them going forward in paying back debts or investing their plans or reducing premiums, she says.\n\n3. The co-ops have been stymied.\n\nWhen the Affordable Care Act was nearing its final votes, Democrats removed a controversial provision that would have set up a government-operated plan that would be a public option for consumers. It was replaced with federal money to start new, nonprofit insurers to bring more competition into many markets; lawmakers hoped such competition would help hold down premium costs.\n\nThere were 23 new health cooperatives that started enrolling members in 2014. Today, just four are still in business.\n\nMore than other insurers, the co-ops were most at risk when the money was eliminated because they operated on the smallest budgets.\n\nThis was a huge factor in the failure of the co-ops, says Timothy Jost, a retired law professor at Washington and Lee University in Lexington, Va., who has studied the ACA.\n\nKevin Lewis, CEO of Maine Community Health Options, says his company is owed $59 million. Without that money, his plan had to withdraw from New Hampshire and raise premiums in areas it still serves. Community Health Options is one of three health plans on the marketplace in Maine and has 38,000 members.\n\nWhile many factors caused the demise of the co-ops, Lewis says, the loss of risk-corridor money is high among them.\n\n4. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce — a leading opponent of Obamacare — is defending the risk-corridor provision.\n\nThe chamber has spent nearly a decade and millions of dollars fighting to overturn the Affordable Care Act. That's why its amicus brief supporting insurers' fight to restore its risk-corridor funding is so notable.\n\nIn its brief, the chamber says the health law promised funding to private insurers, and when the government reversed its commitment, it pulled the rug out from under them.\n\nThe court's ruling would reverberate well beyond just the health insurance industry if it does not reverse lower court rulings, according to the chamber.\n\nIf allowed to stand, the decision will chill the business community from working with the federal government in the future, the chamber says.\n\n5. A ruling could influence another big ACA case.\n\nIf the justices rule in favor of the insurers on this case, they may strengthen the industry's argument in a separate ACA lawsuit working its way through lower courts.\n\nInsurers have sued the federal government for $2.3 billion in unpaid cost-sharing reduction payments after the Trump administration stopped making the payments in 2017. Six insurers — in front of three different federal judges — have succeeded in their challenges over unpaid payments.\n\nThese ACA payments were intended to compensate insurers for reducing deductibles, copayments and coinsurance — reductions mandated by the ACA for marketplace enrollees with low incomes.\n\nSome lawsuits from insurers have been stayed, pending the court's ruling on risk corridors.\n\nKaiser Health News is a nonprofit, editorially independent program of the Kaiser Family Foundation.

How Rick Santorum Got A Haircut And Revived The GOP's Obamacare Repeal Effort\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Alex Wong/Getty Images Alex Wong/Getty Images\n\nHow Rick Santorum Got A Haircut And Revived The GOP's Obamacare Repeal Effort Listen · 3:55 3:55\n\nThere's a chance Republicans wouldn't be so close to repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act if former GOP Sen. Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania hadn't dropped into the Capitol barbershop this spring.\n\nI was up on the Hill, I happened to just go by the barbershop to see if I could get a haircut, and Lindsey was in the chair, Santorum said. And Lindsey asked me what I was doing, and I thought to myself, 'Well, let me just bounce it off Lindsey.' \n\nLindsey was Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., and it was an idea Santorum had just begun talking about with several members of the House Freedom Caucus — repealing large parts of Obamacare and replacing it with a system that's long been a Republican favorite, block grants of funding to states that come with far fewer federal mandates.\n\nSantorum has been mostly absent from Washington since he lost to Democrat Bob Casey in 2006. I haven't been to the Capitol, really other than just to say hi and take friends through tours, in the last 10 years, he said. Santorum was the runner-up in the 2012 GOP presidential primaries behind Mitt Romney, and didn't make it beyond the Iowa caucuses in 2016.\n\nBut he's long been drawn to the health care debate, and Santorum thought he had something to add to Republican repeal efforts. The block grant approach comes from a major welfare reform law that Santorum helped author in 1996. The reform, signed by Democratic President Bill Clinton, stands as the rare successful rollback of a previously issued government entitlement.\n\nSantorum made his pitch to Graham in the barber chair. Graham liked it and suddenly the two presidential also-rans were on a mission. Except, not quite. It was always a back burner until it was apparent in July that [Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's Obamacare repeal bill] wasn't going to pass, Santorum said.\n\nAfter that, talks continued behind the scenes until the bill was rolled out in a Capitol press conference last week. And there was Santorum, who hadn't held office since 2007, not only standing alongside four current Republican senators, but jumping into the mix and answering questions.\n\nSantorum argued the bill is much more politically viable than previous repeal efforts, because it doesn't quite repeal the current health care system. We don't cut as much as the McConnell bill does, he said. We recognized that there's a need out there and there's an entitlement in place, like the welfare issue. To be able to remove a broad-based entitlement is, in my mind, impossible to do.\n\nCritics say the measure would do much more than tweak the current system. While it would loosen many current federal health insurance requirements and turn money over to states, many states would see major shifts in their current funding levels. Obamacare defenders worry this would lead to unstable markets, and not a whole lot of protection for people with expensive or pre-existing medical conditions.\n\nRead a full analysis of the bill from NPR's Alison Kodjak here.\n\nWith this bill, Santorum is back in the mix in Washington — enough that, for a brief moment, someone recently floated the idea that maybe Santorum could step in as House speaker, if conservatives revolt against Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis.\n\nSantorum said he's not interested, and that he prefers the current role that he frames as a little bit of a special agent coming in and trying to help out. But his initial answer to what he made of that brief, low-flying trial balloon wasn't the type of laughing dismissal that many politicians would give.\n\nSantorum said, I think that came about because we're putting together a plan here in health care that people are looking at and saying, gee, why couldn't our leadership do something like that?\n\nOn Tuesday, Santorum was back on Capitol Hill, pitching Senate Republicans on the bill, now known as Graham-Cassidy. (Cassidy is Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La.) It's gone from an idea in a barber's chair to something that appears to have a shot of passing.
CHARTS: Here's What Donald Trump Has Said On The Issues\n\nEnlarge this image Gillian Blease/Getty Images/Ikon Images Gillian Blease/Getty Images/Ikon Images\n\nBefore Donald Trump takes the oath of office in January, there are a lot of questions about how he will decide key policy issues.\n\nWe've identified the top 10 issues voters care about most according to a 2016 survey from the Pew Research Center and charted what Trump has said about each of them. The issues are, in order: the economy, terrorism, foreign policy, health care, gun policy, immigration, Social Security, education, Supreme Court appointments and the treatment of racial and ethnic minorities.\n\nWhere we could, we gave Trump's stances a simple Yes or No, but also used the rating It's Complicated in cases where his stance is more nuanced or has changed.\n\n(Trump has given clues on what he'll prioritize in his first 100 days, which we've posted here and fact checked here.)\n\nThe Economy\n\nTrump hopes to grow the economy by significantly lowering taxes. Under his plan, he says a middle-class family with two children would get a 35 percent income tax cut. He will also reduce the number of tax brackets from seven down to three, which would largely benefit the wealthiest Americans. When it comes to business tax rates, Trump wants to go from a 35 percent rate to 15 percent.\n\nTrump is also big on infrastructure as a way to create jobs. He says he would grant the permit needed for the Keystone Pipeline despite opposition from environmental activists, as NPR's Scott Horsley outlined. He also plans to cancel all payments to U.N. climate change programs and put that money toward water and environmental infrastructure, as he wrote in his 100-day action plan. Trump would also lift restrictions on the oil, coal, shale and natural gas industries. In addition, he plans to impose tariffs to discourage companies from relocating to other countries.\n\nRelevant stories\n\nTerrorism\n\nTrump made fighting terrorism a central pillar of his campaign and strengthened his hard-line stances with each high-profile terror attack, from the shooting in San Bernardino, Calif., last December to the Pulse nightclub shooting in Orlando, Fla., in June.\n\nIn his 100-day action plan, Trump promised to suspend immigration from terror-prone regions where vetting cannot safely occur. All vetting of people coming into our country will be considered extreme vetting. During his campaign, he also condoned other extreme counter-terrorism tactics, like waterboarding.\n\nRelevant stories\n\nForeign Policy\n\nWhen it comes to foreign policy, Trump's main focus has been to upend U.S. trade policy. He has promised to renegotiate or withdraw from NAFTA, the United States' free trade agreement with Canada and Mexico. According to NPR's Marilyn Geewax, actually doing away with NAFTA might not actually be feasible, but Trump could undermine it. He also wants to label China a currency manipulator and, per his 100-day plan, identify all foreign trading abuses that unfairly impact American workers and direct them to use every tool under American and international law to end those abuses immediately.\n\nRelevant stories\n\nHealth\n\nTrump's main goal for health care policy is to repeal the Affordable Care Act. That feat will be harder than Trump seems to think, as we reported. To completely repeal and replace the act, he would need 60 votes in the Senate, which is the number needed to overcome a filibuster. Though they'll make up a majority, there will be only 51 Republican senators come January. He recently signaled in an interview that he may be open to keeping provisions of Obamacare that expand insurance to people with pre-existing conditions and to young people.\n\nTrump has also promised to allow tax deductions for child care and elder care and to create tax-free dependent care savings accounts, with matching contributions for low-income families. As we reported earlier this year, that would cost the government $25 billion annually.\n\nRelevant stories\n\nGun Policy\n\nDonald Trump aligned himself strongly with the National Rifle Association, which endorsed him, and also with Second Amendment protectionists (though no major candidate claimed to want to take away gun rights outright). Trump has said states should be more diligent about putting criminal and mental health records into existing background check systems.\n\nRelevant stories\n\nImmigration\n\nRestricting immigration appears to be top-of-mind for Trump's presidency, at least initially. In his 100-day plan, Trump promised to cancel federal funding to sanctuary cities, though he hasn't specified which funds he would cut. There's no legal definition for this type of city; it's used to describe places with policies limiting how much local authorities can collaborate with federal authorities on immigration issues, such as detention requests from Immigration and Customs Enforcement, according to CNN.\n\nTrump has also promised to undo all of President Obama's executive actions, which include two on immigration (only one of which is in effect). Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals allows certain people brought to the country illegally as children to apply for protection against deportation for two-year periods. That protection would go away, it seems.\n\nTrump has also promised to deport immigrants in the country illegally who have committed crimes, stop immigration from terror-prone regions and begin extreme vetting of people entering the U.S. He has also mostly stood by his vow to build a wall on the country's southern border, and make Mexico pay for it. Trump and some surrogates have said recently they would be OK with certain areas of the border having fence, rather than wall.\n\nRelevant stories\n\nSocial Security\n\nTrump does not want to privatize Social Security, nor does he want to raise the retirement age or increase taxes. He told AARP he plans to fund the entitlement program through an economy that is robust and growing, and he specifically highlighted his tax and immigration plans as key players in that growth.\n\nRelevant stories\n\nEducation\n\nTrump has been vocal about school choice, which allows parents to choose to send their child to any type of school: traditional public, private or charter. Critics say school choice leads to a gap in equitable school investment. Proponents say it increases competition between schools. In addition to school choice, Trump wants to end the Common Core standards, which are the federal guidelines created for K-12 education across the country. States were able to choose to opt in (some didn't) — and the federal government encouraged it.\n\nRelevant stories\n\nSupreme Court Appointments\n\nTrump has released two lists, adding up to 21 judges, to fill the Supreme Court vacancy resulting from Antonin Scalia's death last February. According to NPR's Nina Totenberg, the lists are very conservative and a lot is unknown about who is helping Trump make this selection. With two other justices over 80 years old, it's possible Trump will be able to nominate more than one justice during his presidency.\n\nRelevant stories\n\nThe Treatment of Racial and Ethnic Minorities\n\nThe relationship between police and their treatment of African-Americans was a common topic this election year. Trump ran as the law and order candidate and he's sticking to it: He plans on increasing funding for federal law enforcement to dismantle criminal gangs and put violent offenders behind bars. He also wants to provide more funding and training to local police departments.\n\nTrump has been criticized for his own rhetoric on minorities, most notably referring to Mexican immigrants as rapists in his June 2015 announcement speech and calling for a ban on Muslims entering the United States.\n\nRelevant stories\n\nStephan Bisaha, Alyson Hurt, Clinton King and Lisa Charlotte Rost designed the charts for this post. A version of this story, breaking down where all the major candidiates stood, was published ahead of Election Day.

And when police attempted to arrest him, he gave the cops a fake name. That probably would have worked if Bushman did not have his full name tattooed in giant letters on his neck. It also didn't help that he was also wearing a nametag from a recent forgers convention...\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nSAGAL: ...That said, hello, my name is guilty.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nSAGAL: Bill, how did Peter do on our quiz?\n\nKURTIS: Real good - six right, 12 more points, total of 14.

One of those...\n\nSAGAL: No.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nSAGAL: They had students - during this test to keep them from cheating, they had students wear cardboard boxes on their heads. A recent picture showed university students taking an exam while wearing these cardboard boxes with small cut out eye holes presumably to keep students from looking to their left or right and cheating off the person next to them. Or maybe just every student had ended up with a bad Halloween costume. The school has since apologized for doing this to their students. They say that when it comes to future ideas for preventing cheating, they'll try and think outside the box.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nSAGAL: Bill, how did Roy do on our quiz?\n\nKURTIS: He got three right, six more points, total of nine.

RENEE MONTAGNE, HOST:\n\nAnd to Lulu in Nevada now because it is election year, and politics isn't contained to Capitol Hill. Right, Lulu?\n\nLULU GARCIA-NAVARRO, HOST:\n\nYeah. Here in Las Vegas, thousands came out to the convention center draped in American flags to see President Trump.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED CROWD #1: (Chanting) USA, USA, USA.\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: His supporters, who were wearing red Make America Great Again hats, cheered as the president lobbed his usual jabs at the media and the Democrats. But then Trump made a direct appeal to this demographic.\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Hispanic. Any Hispanic here? I think so.\n\n(CHEERING)\n\nTRUMP: Hispanic-American unemployment is the lowest rate in history.\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: Trump has a reason to reach out to Latino voters. They make up about 28 percent of the population of this state - and growing. The vast majority of Latinos here do vote Democratic, but the Republicans will need some of those Latino votes if they're going to hang on to Nevada's crucial Senate seat currently held by Senator Dean Heller.\n\nTRUMP: Finally, I want you to please welcome the person that we're all here for tonight.\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: Now, Heller wasn't always a Trump guy. In the run-up to 2016, in fact, he was a vocal critic. But he's all in for Trump these days. He needs President Trump's star power to win in a tough race. He's the only Republican senator up for re-election in a state that Hillary Clinton won. Polls show him neck and neck with Democratic challenger Jacky Rosen - more about her later. At the rally, Heller had only fulsome praise for the president.\n\nDEAN HELLER: Thank you for putting Nevada back to work.\n\n(CHEERING)\n\nHELLER: Because of your administration, Nevada families have more money in their paychecks.\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: The problem for Heller is that Trump is controversial with Hispanics because of his pledge to repeal Obamacare and his hard line on immigration. Still, there are some who support him. In the crowd was Latina Lilia Heart, who likes Trump's immigration policies.\n\nLILIA HEART: He's cleaning house. And there's certain steps that he's taking that need to be taken for America to become what it needs to become.\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: The next day, we were able to sit down with Joel Garcia, Heller's Hispanic outreach director, about Heller's strategy with Latinos.\n\nJOEL GARCIA: The communities that we go into are faith-based communities, obviously with values, business communities.\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: Garcia is of Mexican descent and a small business owner himself. He told us Latinos are persuadable in his view. They respond to the economic message. And many don't realize they already embrace conservative values.\n\nGARCIA: When you actually have a conversation with them and start talking about issues, they come out of the woodwork. And they start saying, no, I'm pro-life. I'm for, you know, lower taxes. I'm for less government.\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: Heller, though, is being attacked by Democrats for his shifting policies on key issues. On health care, he's voted both for and against portions of Obamacare. With immigration, he has condemned Trump's family separation policies, but he's also supported a hard-line immigration bill championed by the president. I asked Garcia about the issue of family separation.\n\nGARCIA: Well, here it is. He was one of the first senators to come out against it. And that came out in June. When everything came out, he was one of the early Republican senators to come out. He also asked the Trump administration, please provide me regular updates on the progress of what's going on down there.\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: Well, what about health care? Leaving aside the issue of immigration...\n\nGARCIA: I'm not going to go into health care because I just don't want to go into that. Policy-wise, I just don't want to go into that.\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: He insisted health care never comes up with Latino voters, even though polling shows it's a top issue. Latinos have been a big beneficiary of the Medicaid expansion in this state. While Heller's team may not want to talk about healthcare policy, the Democrats here are running on that issue.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED CROWD #2: (Chanting) Si se puede. Si se puede.\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: Across town at the Culinary Workers Union, there is a different sea of red - union workers wearing red T-shirts, stuffing envelopes and preparing to knock on doors. They've endorsed Heller's challenger, Democratic Congresswoman Jacky Rosen, who was there to cheer them on.\n\nJACKY ROSEN: And I can tell you, too, that if you don't have your health, you don't have anything.\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: The Culinary Workers Union is the biggest in town, with 57,000 members from all over the hospitality industry, a majority of them Hispanic. They're here today on a vital mission for Democrats. In the last midterm election, there was a huge drop-off in Latino voting compared to 2012, a presidential election year, by about half. Pollsters describe it as going off a cliff, and that helped Republican candidates. Rosen cannot win if Latinos stay home this time, so she's trying to motivate them to vote.\n\nROSEN: We're going to fight for DREAMers. We're going to fight for a fair immigration system.\n\n(CHEERING)\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: Rosen is a first-time Congresswoman, and she doesn't have a lot of statewide name recognition, but this is her home turf. Some of the most populous parts of the state are in her district here. And when she was younger, she waitressed during the summers in Las Vegas, something she frequently cites.\n\nROSEN: I'm going to get a little choked up here for a minute because 40 years ago, I joined the Culinary Union.\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: After, the teams of canvassers prepare to head out. And we follow Fransisco Benitez and Telma Vasquez, two Hispanic union members.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF KNOCKING)\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: On a quiet street in North Las Vegas, they consult a list of addresses of union members, and they start knocking on doors. The tactic here is one that has been proven to work - colleagues coming from a trusted organization, pitching in person on a candidate.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF KNOCKING)\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: Fransisco Benitez tells me that first-generation Latinos especially are tough to motivate to vote. They don't see themselves as Democrats or Republicans, and they still have strong ties to their home countries.\n\nFRANSISCO BENITEZ: Most of them - they think like, OK. This is politics, but we are not involved too much in politics. But for example, in my case, I try to tell them, OK. This is important. This is for us. This is for - not only for yourself but for your children.\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: We end up at the house of Armando Saenz. He's a flirtatious and lively 78-year-old retiree. Benitez shows him pamphlets with Jacky Rosen's face on them, but Saenz is having none of it.\n\nARMANDO SAENZ: (Speaking Spanish).\n\nBENITEZ: (Speaking Spanish).\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: They are tricksters and liars, he tells us, like all politicians. Benitez says, not all of them. Saenz responds, When the moment comes, they don't do anything for us. He says he doesn't vote for any particular party. But Saenz does acknowledge that he's angry at the current administration's immigration policies.\n\nSAENZ: (Speaking Spanish).\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: Benitez and Vasquez try to persuade him using their last-ditch pitch.\n\nTELMA VASQUEZ: (Speaking Spanish).\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: It's for the future of the children, Telma says to him. The interaction ends with Saenz promising to come out to vote for the union's choice. In such a tight race, whether or not Saenz and other Latinos like him actually show up at the polls could decide who controls the Senate in November.\n\nCopyright © 2018 NPR. All rights reserved.

Worrying About Your Exchange Coverage? Obamacare Repeal Would Take A While\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption PhotoAlto/Frederic Cirou/Getty Images PhotoAlto/Frederic Cirou/Getty Images\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump has promised that he'll ask Congress to repeal the Affordable Care Act on Day 1 of his administration.\n\nSo if you're shopping for coverage on the health insurance marketplace now, should you even bother signing up? If everything's going to change shortly after coverage starts in January anyway, what's the point?\n\nWhile it's impossible to know exactly what changes are coming to the individual market and how soon they'll arrive, one thing is virtually certain: Nothing will happen immediately. Here are answers to questions you may have.\n\nHow soon after Trump takes office could my marketplace coverage change?\n\nIt's unlikely that much, if anything, will change in 2017.\n\nCongressional Republicans probably couldn't force through a repeal of the entire law because Democrats have enough votes to sustain a filibuster blocking that move. So Congress might opt to use a budget procedure, called reconciliation. That method only allows revenue-related changes, such as eliminating the premium tax credits, with simple majority votes. Yet even that process could take months.\n\nAnd reconciliation wouldn't address the other parts of the health law that reformed the insurance market, such as the prohibition on denying people coverage if the have pre-existing conditions. How some of those provisions of the Affordable Care Act will be affected is still quite unclear.\n\nIt's a complex process to alter a law as complicated as the ACA, said Sara Rosenbaum, a professor of health law and policy at George Washington University.\n\nHealth care industry consultant and longtime critic of the law Robert Laszewski agrees. It will likely be January 2019 before any new program would be completely in place, he said.\n\nThe current open enrollment period runs through January 2017. Shop for a plan, use it and don't focus on what Congress may do several months from now, Rosenbaum advised.\n\nWill my subsidy end next year if the new administration repeals or changes the health law?\n\nProbably not. Mike Pence, the vice president-elect, said on the campaign trail that any changes will allow time for consumers receiving premium subsidies to adjust.\n\nTimothy Jost, a professor emeritus at Washington and Lee University School of Law in Virginia and close watcher of the health law, also predicts a multiyear transition period.\n\nCongress and the new administration are not eager to have a bunch of angry, uninsured voters, Jost said.\n\nTheoretical conversations about changing the health law are one thing but making changes is another. I think that Congress may be less willing to just wipe the subsidies out if a lot of people are using them, says George Washington University's Rosenbaum. More than 9 million people receive subsidies on the marketplace, according to the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nCan my insurer drop out once the new administration takes over, even if the law hasn't been repealed?\n\nNo, insurers are generally locked in contractually for 2017, according to experts. But 2018 could be a whole different story, said consultant Laszewski.\n\nMany insurers are already losing money on their marketplace offerings. If they know that the health insurance marketplaces are being eliminated and replaced by something else in 2019, why would they stick with a sinking ship?\n\nThe Trump administration could be left with a situation where Obamacare is still alive, the subsidies are still alive, but not the insurers, Laszewski said. To prevent that from happening, the Trump administration might have to subsidize insurers' losses during a 2018 transition year, he said.\n\nMy state expanded Medicaid to adults with incomes up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level (about $16,000). Is that going to end if Obamacare is repealed?\n\nIt may. Trump has advocated giving block grants to finance the entire Medicaid program on the theory that it provides an incentive for states to make their programs more cost-effective. But that strategy could threaten the coverage of millions of Americans if the block grants don't keep pace with costs, Jost said.\n\nSo far, 31 states and the District of Columbia have expanded Medicaid under the health law. Republican governors in these states may play a key role in arguing against taking the expansion money away, Rosenbaum said.\n\nI have a heart condition. Does this mean I'm going to have a hard time finding coverage?\n\nIt's possible. The health law prohibits insurers from turning people away because they're sick and may be expensive to insure.\n\nRepublicans have generally promised to maintain that guaranteed insurability, but what that would look like is unclear. Some of their plans would require people to remain continuously insured to maintain that guarantee, said Laszewski.\n\nI would advise people who are sick to get good coverage now and hang on to it, said Washington and Lee's Jost.\n\nSince Republicans have pledged to repeal the law, can I ignore the law's requirement that I have health insurance?\n\nThe individual mandate, as it's called, is one of the least popular elements of Obamacare. As long as it's the law, you should follow it, the people I talked to said. Insurers have argued that the requirement that they take all comers who apply for health insurance only works if there's a coverage mandate or other mechanism that strongly encourages people to have insurance. Otherwise people wouldn't have incentive to get it unless they were sick.\n\nFor the past few years, Republicans have been pushing hard to eliminate the mandate, Laszewski noted.\n\nOne of the easy things they could do is just not enforce it, he said.\n\nKaiser Health News is an editorially independent news service that is part of the nonpartisan Henry J.

Week In Politics: Health Care, Southern Border\n\nWith the Mueller investigation behind him, President Trump has had a renewed focus on policy, from health care to Venezuela.\n\nSCOTT SIMON, HOST:\n\nPresident Trump seemed to focus on policies this week between some provocative tweets and punch lines at rallies. NPR's senior Washington correspondent Ron Elving joins us. Ron, thanks so much for being with us.\n\nRON ELVING, BYLINE: Good to be with you, Scott.\n\nSIMON: The president says Republicans will be the party of health care, which means he wants Republicans in Congress to overturn what we call Obamacare - but replace it with what?\n\nELVING: That still seems to be the question, doesn't it? Republicans in Congress don't seem to have a plan, and they say they want to see the president's plan. And they're worried because they think they lost a lot of House seats last November because voters were anxious about losing coverage for pre-existing conditions and on some other aspects of Obamacare. But now the Trump strategy is to kill Obamacare outright in the courts and then come up with a replacement that would have to pass to fill the vacuum.\n\nSIMON: President Trump says that he wants to - he may shut down the southern border of Mexico next week. Is he serious, and could that even be done?\n\nELVING: He says he's not playing games. But this is another case of an applause line that sounds great at a rally, but it doesn't match up with day-to-day reality. You can't block returning U.S. citizens. You can't block other people with a legal right to entry. And the commerce every day between these two countries affects millions of people and amounts to billions of dollars annually.\n\nSIMON: The president mocked people seeking asylum at a rally yesterday, and we've reported a lot of those stories. These are often people fleeing crime and drug violence, women who have been beaten and raped. The president called these stories a big fat con job. Are there any political consequences for this kind of rhetoric?\n\nELVING: Certainly, there are millions of Americans, Scott, who find that offensive. But the president is probably less concerned about reaching those Americans and more concerned about keeping the voters he had in 2016 with the campaign style that he had in 2016.\n\nSIMON: Keep us up to date now on the fallout from the end of the Mueller investigation. I can't read the rest of the question because it's been redacted (laughter).\n\nELVING: (Laughter) Scott, the attorney general has been asked to deliver the full report to the House Judiciary Committee by Tuesday. The chairman of that committee asked for that. And Attorney General William Barr says he can't do that but he'll try to get a redacted version to the Hill by mid-April - couple more weeks. But that will be far from the full report. So the showdown will continue. There will likely be subpoenas from Congress and a fight in court over enforcing them.\n\nSIMON: President did make a change about defunding the Special Olympics.\n\nELVING: So it seems. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos was on the Hill this week getting hammered for a budget decision to eliminate money for Special Olympics in some schools. And you know, that's a well-known sports competition for young people with disabilities. She didn't seem to have a defense or even know very much about it. But then the president, that night, told a gaggle of reporters suddenly that he had told his people, quote, unquote, to restore the money. And - so a lot of pain and embarrassment for yet another Cabinet member for apparently no good reason.\n\nSIMON: And finally, Ron, the administration trying to keep the heat on Venezuela.\n\nELVING: What has been a dire situation there keeps getting more desperate. The government of Nicolas Maduro has begun to admit some humanitarian aid. But he's also welcomed some military aircraft from Russia this week, clearly a warning to the U.S. not to get involved in a military intervention. And meanwhile, President Trump was meeting with the wife of the rival leader, Juan Guaido, and vowing he would, quote, fix it.\n\nSIMON: Ron Elving, senior Washington correspondent, thanks so much for being with us.\n\nELVING: Thank you, Scott.\n\nCopyright © 2019 NPR.

What Happens To Medicaid In California Under A Trump Administration?\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Rich Pedroncelli/AP Rich Pedroncelli/AP\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump has vowed that he will repeal and replace Obamacare. Specifics are scarce, but one plan Trump has outlined would change how the federal government funds Medicaid, health coverage for low-income people.\n\nTwenty-million Americans now have health coverage because of Obamacare. A full quarter of them are in California. And most of them are covered by Medi-Cal, California's version of Medicaid.\n\nWinding back the clock would create all kinds of turbulence and disruption, says Larry Levitt, senior vice president for special initiatives at the Kaiser Family Foundation.\n\nRight now, the federal government shares the cost of Medicaid with the states, no matter how many people are enrolled. But Trump wants to put a limit on that funding and give states a fixed pot of money called a block grant.\n\nA block grant would give California greater flexibility in running the Medi-Cal program, but it would also give the state less money, Levitt says.\n\nCalifornia would feel the pain more than other states. The effect is magnified in California in part because the state has been so successful in getting people signed up for coverage, Levitt says.\n\nAnd in California, 62 percent of Medi-Cal enrollees who have signed up since Obamacare allowed states to expand Medicaid are Latino, African-American, or Asian-American.\n\nTo save money, some states could pay doctors and hospitals less. But in California, payment rates are already the second lowest in the country.\n\nCalifornia can't really pay much less than it does to providers, says Gerald Kominski, a professor of health at the University of California, Los Angeles.\n\nIn the face of severe budget cuts, Kominski says, the only choice California really would have is to reduce services or reduce the number of people who get Medi-Cal.\n\nThat would have a devastating consequence on the Medicaid expansion population in California, and would basically put everyone who's been newly enrolled in the program back off the program, he says.\n\nIt's unclear how soon a Trump administration would change Medicaid funding, so health advocates are encouraging people to continue signing up for Medicaid and other coverage during the current Obamacare open enrollment season.\n\nCalifornia is not an island, says Anthony Wright, executive director of Health Access, an advocacy group, adding that the state must engage fully in the coming national debate on the future of health reform — especially as an example of what has been achieved, and what we can't give up.\n\nThis story is part of a reporting partnership with NPR, KQED and Kaiser Health News, which is an editorially independent news service that is part of the nonpartisan Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation.
Trump's Pick For HHS Chief Could Foreshadow Plans For Obamacare\n\nAs Donald Trump considers his pick for secretary of Health and Human Services, and mulls what to do with the Affordable Care Act, David Greene talks to Dr. Ezekiel Emanuel, an Obamacare architect.\n\nDAVID GREENE, HOST:\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump has said repeatedly that he's going to walk back one of President Obama's signature achievements, the Affordable Care Act. Trump wants to replace major aspects of Obama's health care legislation, including subsidies that help some people afford their insurance. And here's Trump's running mate, Vice President-elect Mike Pence talking about this.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nMIKE PENCE: Repealing Obamacare will be the first priority in a session that will be characterized by tax reform, rebuilding the military infrastructure...\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MAN: Now, Mr. Vice President...\n\nPENCE: ...Ending illegal immigration. And that's where we're focused.\n\nGREENE: Now, we reached Dr. Zeke Emanuel, who was one of the key architects of Obamacare, to see what he thinks of this.\n\nEZEKIEL EMANUEL: What I was interested in is that Mike Pence said repeal, and he didn't say replace it. And that, I think, is a serious issue that everyone has to be worried about.\n\nGREENE: Now, Donald Trump has said he will replace the law. He has vowed that people will not be kicked off coverage, and he has said people with pre-existing conditions will not be excluded, although Democrats have doubted those promises. As for specifics, well, there are different plans from different Republicans, and one comes from Republican Congressman Tom Price from Georgia, who is a physician. He is also reportedly being considered by Trump for secretary of health and human services. We asked Dr. Emanuel if he would be open to working with Price.\n\nEMANUEL: I think the issue is we need to have health insurance that covers all Americans, that controls health care costs and that improves the consistency of quality. And frankly, as a person interested in those goals, I'd work with anyone who wants to pursue those goals. But I would say all of the Republican plans leave millions of people who have been covered by President Obama's Affordable Care Act with less insurance.\n\nGREENE: Let me just ask you broadly - isn't it worth Democrats at least listening to the Trump administration and Republicans when they take over? You know, listen to their ideas, and dig in and work out some of these specifics with an open mind.\n\nEMANUEL: Oh, look, I'm completely open as to how to go. You know, I think there are other ways to get to universal coverage than the Affordable Care Act. It's not the only way. What I would say, though, is that the plans the Republicans have proposed so far get you far below that. They throw millions of Americans off coverage, and their guarantee of insurance if you have a pre-existing condition is not so solid.\n\nIt's very, very mushy. So I'm - I think we will have to negotiate, and we will have to have exchanges of ideas. But what we shouldn't have an open mind about is that you need a replacement if you're going to repeal. You can't kick the replacement years down the line and say, oh, everything will be fine because it won't be fine.\n\nGREENE: Dr. Emanuel, let me ask you - I mean, you worked very hard on this law. If negotiations begin, if they reach a place where you feel the law is improved but Donald Trump takes this new law and says we have, quote, unquote, repealed Obamacare and replaced it with something - I don't know if people start calling it TrumpCare (ph), let's say - would that be - would that be hard for you to swallow?\n\nEMANUEL: No. No, I - I'm not - I'm not wedded to any particular thing. I'm wedded to getting the United States the best health care system it can have. It has to have a universal health care coverage system. It has to guarantee people who have illnesses that they can get affordable insurance.\n\nIt has to innovate in the delivery of care so we have higher quality care at consistently lower costs. That's the goal. There are many ways to that goal, but we've got to agree on those four elements as the goal. And it seems to me I'm willing to work on lots of different ideas that get you to that goal.\n\nGREENE: All right. We've been speaking to Dr. Zeke Emanuel. He is chair of the department of medical ethics and health policy at the University of Pennsylvania and a senior fellow at the left-leaning Center for American Progress. Dr. Emanuel, thanks so much for your time.\n\nEMANUEL: Thank you for having me on. I appreciate it.\n\nCopyright © 2016 NPR. All rights reserved.

Affordable Care Act Central To Arizona's Senate Race\n\nThe Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, is a central issue in Arizona's election for U.S. Senate. But voters' perceptions of the health care law have changed dramatically over the past eight years.\n\nAILSA CHANG, HOST:\n\nI'm Ailsa Chang in Phoenix, Ariz., where I've been talking with a lot of voters about the midterm elections. We came to Arizona for reasons we're exploring throughout today's show. First, it's a state where tight races are going to be decided by the voters in the middle, the moderates, the independents. And their minds are on health care, which is nothing new. Health care has been a top issue for the past several elections. But the fight used to sound more like this.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nBARACK OBAMA: It's working despite countless attempts to repeal, undermine, defund and defame this law.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nMICHELE BACHMANN: Let's repeal this failure before it literally kills women, kills children, kills senior citizens.\n\nCHANG: But in 2018, the conversation about health care is different. Even though the Affordable Care Act has been weakened by the Trump administration, it is here to stay for now. And during this midterm election, both sides are reckoning with what that means. For Republicans, it's about acknowledging what the ACA got right and for Democrats acknowledging what it got wrong. And what I want to do now is introduce you to two voters who helped both sides get to this point.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF DOGS BARKING)\n\nCHANG: Yes, more dogs (laughter).\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF DOGS BARKING)\n\nCHANG: I traveled to the red rocks of Sedona to meet a man who used to be on one extreme of the Obamacare debate and then ended up on the other, Jeff Jeans, who lives with his wife, two cats and six dogs.\n\nAll right, tell me who everyone is right here.\n\nJEFF JEANS: Zoe, Jack, Peewee, Mia, Valentine and Pumpkin.\n\nCHANG: Pumpkin (laughter). Hello.\n\nSeven years ago, Jeans was just about the most fervent conservative you could find - no taxes, no government. As he puts it, the principle he lived by was everybody leave me the heck alone. And when it came to Obamacare, Jeans felt a special loathing.\n\nJEANS: You know, I told my wife we were going to close our business before I complied with this law because as owners of a small business, I would be obligated to provide health insurance. And I'd tell my wife we would close our business before I did that.\n\nCHANG: You would rather shut down then partake in Obamacare.\n\nJEANS: I would have.\n\nCHANG: But in late 2011, his worldview came crashing down. Jeans was on the phone one day, and suddenly his voice disappeared. He thought maybe it was just allergies. He didn't have health insurance, so he waited months before seeing a doctor. And that is when he learned the news. He had been living with stage 3 throat cancer.\n\nAnd when you heard that, you know, you're thinking you don't have health insurance. What is the first thing that went through your mind when you heard you had cancer?\n\nJEANS: That I was going to die. I mean, what do you think when somebody tells you you've got cancer? That you're going to die.\n\nCHANG: He first tried paying for his cancer treatment with cash, but the hospital wouldn't take on any long-term treatment unless he got health insurance. So his only choice was to sign up for coverage under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nJEANS: Well, it was kind of humorous that my coverage took effect on April 1.\n\nCHANG: (Laughter) April Fool's Day.\n\nJEANS: (Laughter) And we'll just kind of leave it at that (laughter).\n\nCHANG: The joke's on you now.\n\nJEANS: Yeah.\n\nCHANG: To this day, Jeans says Obamacare saved his life.\n\nJEANS: I actually sat in my hospital bed and cried because my perceptions of the health care system, of for-profit health care, of the fact if I got sick, I could show up in the emergency room and get treated were all just so wrong.\n\nCHANG: These days, Jeans is an advocate for the ACA. He appears in commercials and at rallies to champion the law.\n\nJEANS: I'd always wanted to thank President Obama. I'm sorry. I still get emotional about this.\n\nCORINNE BOBBIE: OK.\n\nCHANG: Seven years ago, a mother of two named Corinne Bobbie in Phoenix started at a very different place from Jeff Jeans. Bobbie, an independent, remembers her utter relief the day the ACA marketplace first went live.\n\nBOBBIE: The weight that was lifted when the rollout happened - I cried. And I am not an emotional person. And I went on the marketplace, and I saw that we could - I cried.\n\nCHANG: We met Bobbie right outside her children's school. And to understand just why the ACA was such a godsend to her, you first need to understand something about her daughter.\n\nBOBBIE: So Sophia was born with what's called complex congenital heart disease, or they'll call it - CHD is the acronym. And then she also has another health issue called heterotaxy syndrome, which is less known.\n\nCHANG: In other words, Sophia has several major heart defects. She was also born without a spleen, and some of her organs are in the wrong place.\n\nBOBBIE: They're in the wrong place.\n\nCHANG: All of which means staggering medical bills.\n\nBOBBIE: By the time she was 3, she had already surpassed a million dollars in health care.\n\nCHANG: Bobbie was at home caring for Sophia, and her husband didn't have health insurance through work, so Obamacare gave them hope during a pretty dark time at least for a while. But about three years into ACA coverage, Bobbie says Sophia started having problems getting the health care she needed.\n\nBOBBIE: Her specialists were changing. She wasn't able to get prescriptions that she was totally able to get before. Suddenly they weren't covered. There was more hoops suddenly to jump through. And then by I think, like, the fourth year, we started to notice that providers were pulling out of the marketplace every year. They just started dropping like flies.\n\nCHANG: By 2017, Maricopa County, where Bobbie lives, was down to just one health insurer in its entire marketplace. OK, at this point in our conversation, school lets out, and kids start spilling into the street in front of us. Bobbie waves at Sophia.\n\nWhich one is she?\n\nBOBBIE: She is - well, I can't see. She's coming right now. She's got the blue backpack straps.\n\nCHANG: Oh, yeah, I see her. OK.\n\nSophia is now a willowy 10-year-old with a huge smile gliding home on a hot pink scooter.\n\nSOPHIA BOBBIE: I really hate walking.\n\nCHANG: Why? Why is walking so bad?\n\nSOPHIA: It just hurts my legs.\n\nCHANG: But riding a scooter could be really risky now because remember how Maricopa County had only one insurer left on its exchange? Well, turns out the hospital had always treated Sophia terminated its contract with that one insurer. And Bobbie decided staying with those doctors was important, so she canceled the family's plan under the ACA, which means the Bobbies don't have any health insurance right now.\n\nWell, I'm thinking, what happens when some emergency happens...\n\nBOBBIE: Right.\n\nCHANG: ...With Sophia?\n\nBOBBIE: Exactly. So...\n\nCHANG: Really, no, what is your answer to that right now?\n\nBOBBIE: What is - it's - it literally - what I say is, OK, we'll cross that bridge if we come to it. Like, I don't have a backup plan right now.\n\nCHANG: How does that feel?\n\nBOBBIE: It's terrifying. It's absolutely terrifying.\n\nCHANG: Bobbie's hoping this will be temporary. She will have more options for coverage during the next open enrollment period in November. But when she thinks about how hopeful she was when Democrats rolled out the ACA, she says what she didn't see at the time were all the pockmarks underneath the makeup.\n\nWhen you hear Democrats cheering about it, applauding themselves for passing it, is there something a little bit impatient that...\n\nBOBBIE: Yes.\n\nCHANG: ...Wells up inside of you?\n\nBOBBIE: I think impatience is an excellent way to describe it. I'm like, it's - I'm impatient because I'm waiting and waiting and waiting and waiting.\n\nCHANG: Waiting for what?\n\nBOBBIE: For some sort of change, some sort of champion maybe.\n\nCHANG: Some fix.\n\nBOBBIE: Some - a fix would be amazing.\n\nCHANG: Corinne Bobbie says she doesn't know exactly what that fix should be, but she knows she wants to see Republicans and Democrats working together to come up with some compromise. And she says this is the single most important issue for her in this entire midterm election.\n\nAnd for more on how health care is playing out in Arizona's races, we are now joined by KJZZ's Will Stone, who covers health care. Hey there, Will.\n\nWILL STONE, BYLINE: Hi, Ailsa.\n\nCHANG: So, you know, we've seen a lot of issue ads about health care throughout the state, including one that Jeff Jeans starred in. But what are candidates actually saying about health care on the campaign trail?\n\nSTONE: Democrats are certainly framing it as a choice between two very different visions of health care and another referendum on the Affordable Care Act. The voters can expect the GOP to do what they tried to do last year, repeal the health care law. And this narrative is kind of forcing Republicans to take what I call a more defensive posture. It's very much on display in our tight Senate race between...\n\nCHANG: Democrats have been the defensive ones for the past eight years, but you think it's Republicans now.\n\nSTONE: That seems to be what's happening right now. I mean, if you just look at the race between Democrat Kyrsten Sinema - she's using that line of attack against her Republican opponent, Martha McSally. And, you know, in response, McSally's had to kind of soften, moderate her stance on the issue, saying we cannot go back to where we were before the ACA, that we need to fix the law and protect people with pre-existing conditions. And so for me, I think it shows that to win a statewide race in Arizona, which before the ACA had one of the highest uninsured rates in the country, Republicans like McSally need to reassure voters that they support certain key provisions of the health care law...\n\nCHANG: Right.\n\nSTONE: ...And it's not just a full repeal.\n\nCHANG: So you don't get the sense that the mantra repeal and replace resonates anymore in this state.\n\nSTONE: Not so much. And you can see that, you know, in the political races. And a lot of the concern revolves around Medicaid. Arizona expanded Medicaid under the ACA, and we had a lot of people who needed coverage, so there was a big rush to join the program. That was at risk under the GOP bill. And people in Arizona like the state's Medicaid program. Republicans, moderates like the program. It functions well. So no one wanted to see that damaged or cut. And as for those who shop for insurance plans on the marketplace, they say they want more options, cheaper plans, lower deductibles, but they do not want to see a full overhaul.\n\nCHANG: Yeah, on more options, you know, we heard Corinne Bobbie say that she was hoping to have more choices in terms of health insurance during the next open enrollment season that starts next month. What does it look like? I mean, does it look like there will be more options for this state?\n\nSTONE: It's looking remarkably better. The market has stabilized. It's rebounded. Health experts I talked to say there'll be more options. And it's really one of the more resilient examples in the country of a marketplace that's working.\n\nCHANG: That's KJZZ's Will Stone. Thank you very much, Will.\n\nSTONE: Thank you.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF LITTLE PEOPLE'S MAKEMEBETTER)\n\nCopyright © 2018 NPR. All rights reserved.

Sen. Bernie Sanders Defends His 'Medicare-For-All' Plan\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders delivered a defense of his Medicare for All plan Wednesday, as other candidates claim the mantle and former Vice President Joe Biden argues against his approach.\n\nMARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST:\n\nVermont Senator Bernie Sanders made the case today for eliminating private health insurance and shifting the country to a single-payer Medicare system.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nBERNIE SANDERS: The time is now to go forward. The time is now to expand Medicare to every man, woman and child in this country.\n\nKELLY: Of course, if that sounds familiar, it might be because Sanders has been making this same case for years that is now the central policy debate in a presidential race where Sanders is struggling to maintain the momentum he built up with progressives for the last four years. NPR's Scott Detrow is covering the presidential campaign. He is here in the studio now. Hey, Scott.\n\nSCOTT DETROW, BYLINE: Hey, good afternoon.\n\nKELLY: Hi. So as we noted, we have heard Bernie Sanders make the case for Medicare for All. I think we could all recite it in our sleep at this point. Did he shake it up at all? Did he, you know, spice up this message in his speech today?\n\nDETROW: Yeah. There was definitely a focus. You know, as you mentioned, this has become a focal point in the campaign. And one of the main points of contention between Sanders and former Vice President Joe Biden and one of the main criticisms has been something that Sanders readily acknowledges, that this plan would lead to a major tax increase as part of it. So Sanders spent a lot of time arguing today that that would be worth it because it would lower health care costs, and it would eliminate insurance payments.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nSANDERS: Oh, my God, dear. The insurance premium is here. What a wonderful day. Oh, wow.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nSANDERS: Let's celebrate. Hey, another $2,000 a month for insurance, and small businesses, they just love it, every month paying those insurance premiums.\n\nDETROW: So kind of in more of his Larry David mode there making fun of the idea that nobody likes to pay insurance payments. You know, there's no question this would be a massive shift to the American health insurance system. And that is another one of Joe Biden's big criticisms. He said, look; I was part of the fight to pass the Affordable Care Act, Obamacare - incredibly hard to pass. This is so much beyond that. It would be near impossible to pass. And you need to remember that whether it's Sanders or Biden or any other Democrat taking office, best-case scenario for them is a very narrow Senate majority and very likely Republicans would be in charge of the Senate.\n\nKELLY: I'm thinking of the biggest obvious difference between now and 2016, which is that Bernie Sanders is running in a very crowded field of Democrats, some of whom also support Medicare for All. How did he contrast his plan with the others that are out there?\n\nDETROW: What's been interesting is that he really hasn't made that contrast at all on Medicare for All, on any other front. He's instead just criticized Joe Biden a lot. And, you know, both Elizabeth Warren and Kamala Harris, who are gaining on him in the polls, have co-sponsored his Medicare for All bill, but both have been a lot more hesitant than Sanders at several points when it comes to the idea of totally eliminating private health insurance. Warren finally did embrace that position fully in the debate last month. Sanders did issue a challenge today to other candidates to refuse campaign contributions from the insurance and drug industry - not just PACs but individual executives in that field as well.\n\nKELLY: Step back from health care, Scott. On other issues when you look at this campaign as a whole, how is Sanders trying to distinguish himself in this, again, very crowded field?\n\nDETROW: You know, there's no question that he's really lost a lot of momentum in recent weeks. For much of the year, he and Biden were far ahead of any other candidate. But Elizabeth Warren has been steadily gaining ground for months now focusing on a lot of big policy plans that are very similar to what Bernie Sanders is talking about. And, of course, Kamala Harris had that big moment at the debate last month where she took on Joe Biden. Bernie Sanders was standing right between them, but he didn't really have that breakout moment in the debate. So this has been - you've seen his poll numbers be stagnant as Harris and Warren have gained. Sanders' campaign insists that they're not worried. I talked to his campaign manager, Faiz Shakir, about this.\n\nFAIZ SHAKIR: They are new candidates in the race, and that is a credit to them. Most people do not know who they are there. They're out there campaigning more. They're advertising themselves. They're raising money. They're fresher to the scene for that reason. And so you're seeing other candidates get a little more support, which is good. It's healthy. It's fine.\n\nDETROW: So they insist that this trend will go away. But if it continues, it cuts into a main argument Sanders is making, that he can bring the progressive change but also can be the person best positioned to defeat Donald Trump.\n\nKELLY: Scott, we've mentioned Joe Biden a couple of times, which is inevitable if you're covering this field of Democrats. He also rolled out a health care plan this week. What is it?\n\nDETROW: Yeah. The short version of that is he keeps Obamacare in place, and he builds on it by doing an optional plan like what Sanders is talking about for people who want to opt in to that government-run health insurance plan. This is the public option that you may remember from the original Obamacare debate. Biden wants to do that. And his a political argument here is that the plan that Sanders, Harris and Warren want to do does away with the current Obamacare system that, of course, has gotten more popular after Biden and Obama left office.\n\nKELLY: Thank you, Scott.\n\nDETROW: Thank you.\n\nKELLY: NPR's Scott Detrow.\n\nCopyright © 2019 NPR.

Divided Democratic Party Under Biden Requires Compromise, Says Progressive Rep. Khanna\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Andrew Harnik/AP Andrew Harnik/AP\n\nWhen Joe Biden won the Democratic primary months ago, many progressives got in line behind him with a common goal: beat President Trump.\n\nNow that President-elect Biden, a moderate Democrat, has signaled that he will govern as such, Rep. Ro Khanna, a progressive Democrat from California, sees room for their party to compromise.\n\nJoe Biden showed how to find common ground, as did Bernie Sanders — that we can speak about budgeting our values, Khanna, vice chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, said in an interview with NPR's Morning Edition on Thursday.\n\nThere has been debate recently within the Democratic Party over whether progressive positions cost Democrats seats in the House. Rep. Conor Lamb, D-Pa., told The New York Times recently that his constituents are extremely frustrated by the message of defunding the police and banning fracking.\n\nKhanna says that while Biden did not voice support for such actions, progressive voices helped galvanize a critical base to help win him the presidency.\n\nMy view is that the Black Lives Matter movement was very, very helpful, he said. They helped organize record turnouts in places like Milwaukee and Atlanta and Philadelphia and Detroit. And the language of activism helped the party, but it doesn't have to be the language that the party itself adopts.\n\nStill, Khanna is adamant that he and the party's progressive wing will work with the incoming Biden administration to push for their top concerns, including a bold clean energy plan and Medicare for All.\n\nInterview Highlights\n\nIs it possible that the language of activism works in some parts of the country and not in others? And if that's the case, what do you do about that — how do you find the common ground?\n\nI think Joe Biden showed how to find common ground, as did Bernie Sanders. We can speak about budgeting our values. In other words, we can make it clear that we support law enforcement. We recognize how essential their role is in a community, but that we also have to budget for mental health services, for social services, and community budgets need to reflect the diversity of needs of a community. And I think that if we are constructive in how we message it, we can appeal to this sentiment of the Black Lives Matter movement while explaining principles in matters of common sense.\n\nWhat are you going to be looking for to see how open to progressive ideas President-elect Biden will be?\n\nWell, President-elect Biden is off to a great start with his appointment of Ron Klain [as White House chief of staff]. I know Ron Klain very well. He has reached out many times to progressives, come to the Hill, indicated a willingness to work with us. So I think the personnel is going to matter a lot.\n\nAnd then, of course, the issues of his agenda. What are we going to start with in terms of the size of our stimulus and in terms of the size of our infrastructure program and other priorities?\n\nBiden says he doesn't want Medicare for All, likes the idea of Obamacare expansion, likes a public option, thinks the eligibility age for Medicare should be 60, not 65. As far as you are concerned, is that enough?\n\nWell, of course, I support Medicare for All. I think that that is the best system economically and also will cover everyone while lowering the premiums by not having premiums and copays. But I think a good starting point is to deliver on what the task forces came up with. So, let's at least extend Medicare to 60. Let's make sure we at least get a public option. And I think what progressives will be looking for is to implement, at the very least, the task forces that President-elect Biden ran on.\n\nNPR's Avery Keatley and Steve Mullis produced and edited this interview for broadcast. Emma Bowman adapted it for the Web.
Trump Makes Multiple Trips To Nevada To Campaign For Sen. Dean Heller's Re-Election\n\nDean Heller is the most vulnerable Senate Republican this cycle and Democrats in Nevada are hoping a boost in Latino and labor voters will help them defeat Heller, who is embracing President Trump.\n\nAUDIE CORNISH, HOST:\n\nNevada Senator Dean Heller is probably the most high-profile example of how the Republican Party has remade itself in President Trump's image over the past two years. Heller was once one of Trump's top skeptics. Now he's a close ally. And Trump is making repeated trips to Nevada to help Heller win a close campaign for re-election. NPR's Scott Detrow reports.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I want to introduce a man that really has done a fantastic job.\n\nSCOTT DETROW, BYLINE: This weekend in Elko, Nev., Trump and Heller stood on a stage and traded compliments.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nDEAN HELLER: In fact, I think everything you touch turns to gold.\n\n(CHEERING)\n\nDETROW: It was a far, far cry from last summer, when Trump sat next to Heller at a White House meeting and basically threatened him.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nTRUMP: Look, he wants to remain a senator, doesn't he?\n\nDETROW: The meeting's topic? The Republican attempt to repeal Obamacare. At the time, Heller was a no and was blocking the bill's progress in the narrowly divided Senate.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nTRUMP: We weren't friends. I didn't like him. He didn't like me.\n\nDETROW: Trump recounted the moment during another recent Nevada rally. Heller ultimately came around, supporting the failed repeal effort and then helping orchestrate one more push to undo the law a couple of months later. He says working with Trump on health care and other issues created a real bond.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nHELLER: What happened was success. He became president of the United States. We started working together. We started working together, and it built trust. When you have success, it builds trust. When you build trust, it builds friendships.\n\nDETROW: Trump put it another way.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nTRUMP: Then we started to like each other. Then we started to love each other.\n\nDETROW: A close relationship with Trump is an asset if a Republican wants to survive a primary challenge these days. It's not clear how that positioning plays, though, in a general election in an evenly divided state like Nevada. Heller's opponent, Democratic Congresswoman Jacky Rosen, is making the shift a key part of her campaign to unseat Heller. While many Democrats keep Trump out of their campaign talking points, Rosen's making her race all about the president.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nJACKY ROSEN: I think we're going to be a check and balance on the president. We're going to try to restore the dignity and decency of our democracy.\n\nDETROW: Rosen keeps campaigning on Heller's role in the Obamacare repeal attempt. Even though so many other things have happened since Trump took office, Rosen argues health care sticks in voters' minds since everyone gets sick.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nROSEN: And so that's the thing that binds every single person, even though there may be other reason - other things that they're worried about. That's why it matters. Dean Heller, guilty of the biggest broken promise in modern Nevada history.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nUNIDENTIFIED UNION MEMBERS: We vote, we win. We vote, we win. We vote, we win.\n\nDETROW: Rosen's campaign platform matters for sure, but so does Democratic mobilization. Nevada sees bigger swings between presidential and midterm voter turnout than most other states. If Rosen has a chance at winning, labor groups like Nevada's Culinary Union need to get their voters to the polls. Several hundred union members recently rallied with Rosen before going out to knock on doors.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF KNOCKING)\n\nDETROW: Union member Donna Yu found several Democrats who plan on voting for Rosen. She also ran into the type of apathy that Democrats worry about.\n\nDONNA YU: Do you like what's going on in our country?\n\nUNIDENTIFIED PERSON: I'm a gamer boy, so I really don't care. You know?\n\nDETROW: The party is working hard to boost turnout. In addition to all that canvassing, high-profile surrogates like former president Barack Obama and former vice president Joe Biden are visiting the state. Senator Catherine Cortez Masto says she's confident Democrats will show up.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nCATHERINE CORTEZ MASTO: You know, the telltale sign for me was our primary. And this primary had literally so much energy, more Democrats than Republicans. We've never seen that in the primary election in Nevada before.\n\nDETROW: Early voting numbers will provide a much clearer picture. Nevada voting began this past weekend. More than half of Nevada voters typically cast ballots early, so party voting totals can be a key indicator of how Election Day will turn out.

UnitedHealth To Leave Most Obamacare Exchanges In 2017\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Mike Bradley/Bloomberg via Getty Images Mike Bradley/Bloomberg via Getty Images\n\nInsurance giant UnitedHealth Group says it will stop selling insurance on Obamacare exchanges in most states starting next year.\n\nIn a Tuesday call detailing UnitedHealth's first quarter earnings, CEO Stephen Hemsley said the company would remain only in a handful of states, after losing money on the individual health plans it sold on state exchanges.\n\nThe decision won't affect UnitedHealth customers who have insurance through the company this year. However, customers in the states that the company is leaving will likely have to shop for a new plan for 2017.\n\nThe company, which is the largest U.S. health insurer, has about 795,000 customers who bought plans for 2016 through the exchanges, which were created under the Affordable Care Act. That's just a fraction of the 13 million people who bought Obamacare plans this year.\n\nOn Tuesday the company said it expects to lose $650 million on exchange plans this year, in part because the health status of the people who bought plans is worse than expected.\n\nStill, UnitedHealth's overall revenue rose 25 percent in the first quarter and profits rose 14 percent — to $1.6 billion.\n\nUnitedHealth has already informed several states that it intends to pull out of the exchange markets in 2017. Those include Michigan, Oklahoma, Arkansas and parts of Georgia.\n\nWe have been evaluating public exchanges on a state-by-state basis, Hemsley said on a conference call with reporters and equity analysts. Our own experience and performance have been unfavorable in these markets.\n\nOfficials at the Department of Health and Human Services, which administers the Affordable Care Act and the federal HealthCare.gov insurance exchange, say UnitedHealth's plans were priced higher than many others. In at least seven states, more than 90 percent of residents could buy plans that were cheaper than UnitedHealth's offerings.\n\nAs with any new market, we expect changes and adjustments in the early years with issuers both entering and exiting states, said HHS spokesman Ben Wakana, in a prepared statement. We have full confidence — based on data — that the marketplaces will continue to thrive for years ahead.\n\nThe effect of the company's withdrawal on consumers depends on where they live. An analysis released Monday by the Kaiser Family Foundation shows that premiums could increase as little as $1 a month in some counties, while in other areas they could rise by as much as $100 a month.\n\nResidents of Oklahoma, for example, may be left with only one company offering health insurance through the exchanges unless another company enters the market, the report shows.\n\nNationwide, however, premiums for health plans on the exchanges would likely rise only modestly — about 1 percent on average — if UnitedHealth pulls out of the market altogether. The premium increase would amount to about $4 a month.
What An Obamacare Repeal Would Mean For Rural Hospitals\n\nScott Simon speaks with Maggie Elehwany of the National Rural Health Association about a possible Obamacare repeal. She supports the law, but says the way it was implemented has hurt rural hospitals.\n\nSCOTT SIMON, HOST:\n\nThe House and Senate have taken the first steps to dismantle the Affordable Care Act. It's not clear whether lawmakers will have a replacement for the law before it's repealed. The Affordable Care Act has allowed millions of Americans to buy health insurance for the first time. But it has been controversial. We don't know the impact on hospitals. We're joined now by Maggie Elehwany. She's a lobbyist with the National Rural Health Association. They represent nearly 2,000 hospitals in rural America. Thanks for joining us.\n\nMAGGIE ELEHWANY: Thank you.\n\nSIMON: Recognizing that there's no one answer, how has the Affordable Care Act affected rural hospitals?\n\nELEHWANY: Well, let's talk about kind of the overview. So the goal of the ACA was to help the 37 million uninsured out there. And, yes, uninsurance rates have gone down dramatically or at historic lows. But I think a lot of things were unforeseen.\n\nAnd the way some of the regulations were implemented are actually harming rural America and not fulfilling the ultimate goals of the ACA. And what I mean by that is half of those 37 million - the goal was to expand Medicaid and get those folks into a Medicaid program. We know that a lot of states have taken the Supreme Court up on its option of opting out of Medicaid. That has predominantly hurt rural America.\n\nIn fact, if you're a rural state, if you're a poor state, more likely than not, you have not expanded Medicaid. So we're seeing millions of folks left behind at that. Our concern is that since the ACA was passed, we've had an escalation of rural hospitals close. We've had 80 rural hospitals close since 2010. If this rate continues, in less than 10 years' time, we're going to have 25 percent of rural hospitals close within less than a decade.\n\nSIMON: Do you have any concern about the Congress repealing the Affordable Care Act - what's called Obamacare - without a replacement?\n\nELEHWANY: We certainly do. I do not want to take away, by any means, the good that it has done in rural America. I said it's brought uninsured rates down by 8 percent. It's allowed families to keep their children on their plan until they're age 26. It's helped people buy insurance if they've had preexisting conditions.\n\nWe do not want to see rural Americans lose one lapse in the benefits that they have. We are not mad at Republicans or Democrats. We're mad at Republicans and Democrats. We want to make sure that they understand that the well intentions of the ACA have really fallen short and may actually be exacerbating the hospital-closure crisis.\n\nSIMON: We've done a little reporting. I've done some stories in rural hospitals and health care over the years. It can be hard to get doctors to some locations, can't it?\n\nELEHWANY: Yes, absolutely.\n\nSIMON: Because they spend a long time in medical school. And there just aren't necessarily the opportunities for economic success in a rural environment that they would have in a big city.\n\nELEHWANY: That's absolutely true. Recruitment and retention of physicians remains one of the top problems in rural-health-care delivery. And I talked about - to bring it back to the Affordable Care Act, there was some other positive provisions in the Affordable Care Act that, sadly, were never funded by Congress through the appropriations process that we think really could've helped recruitment and retention of physicians. There were some specific programs targeted to help workforce issues in rural America. We would love to see, when we address building upon the ACA, reforming it, those programs.\n\nSIMON: What do you hope Congress does?\n\nELEHWANY: I'm not speaking in one political aisle or the other.\n\nSIMON: Yeah.\n\nELEHWANY: But rural America spoke very loudly. On a 3-to-1 basis, they voted for Donald Trump. They were voting for a concept. I believe that they feel that they have been left behind. And if you think about it, it's not just health care, where they see their hospitals closing. And one hospital CEO described it as a three-pronged stool. It's the churches, the hospitals and the schools. If you lose one of those legs of that stool, the whole community collapses.\n\nSo these towns with their hospital closing are seeing elements of their community go away. Their physicians may leave 'cause they're hospital-based. The nurses leave. The pharmacists leave. These medical deserts are forming. You know, there's studies that show even housing values drop after a hospital closes. So what business wants to relocate to these communities?\n\nThere's just not the vitality, the job growth in rural communities.

What To Watch For As Trump Takes Aim At ACA Protections\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call Inc. Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call Inc.\n\nThe Trump administration is refusing to defend key parts of the Affordable Care Act, essentially arguing that federal courts should find the health law's protections for people with pre-existing conditions unconstitutional.\n\nThe federal lawsuit hinges on the ACA's individual mandate, or the requirement to get health coverage or pay a penalty. The mandate has long been a sticking point for conservatives, who argue that the government should not be telling individuals what coverage they must have.\n\nBut that mandate was crucial to persuading insurers to offer plans under the ACA. It helped expand their risk pools while the law forced them to guarantee coverage to any customer. Insurers were not allowed to raise costs for people with pre-existing medical conditions. The administration's legal brief, filed Thursday in federal district court in Fort Worth, Texas, takes aim at those links.\n\nTwenty Republican state attorneys general filed suit on Feb. 26, charging that Congress' changes to the law in last year's tax bill rendered the entire ACA unconstitutional. In the tax law, Congress repealed the penalty for people who fail to have health insurance starting in 2019.\n\nThe attorneys general argue that a Supreme Court decision in 2012 saved the ACA from being declared an unconstitutional overreach of congressional power by declaring the penalty a tax — and pointing out that Congress has the power to levy taxes. Without the tax penalty, they argue, the Court should hold that the ACA is unlawful and enjoin its operation.\n\nThe Trump administration Thursday did not go that far. Rather, it argued that without the tax to encourage healthy people to sign up, the parts of the law guaranteeing coverage to people who have chronic illnesses or other pre-existing health conditions should be struck down as well.\n\nThe administration called on the court to declare that the provisions that guarantee coverage will be invalid beginning on January 1, 2019, when the mandate penalty goes away.\n\nHere are five things to know about this latest in a long line of challenges to the health law:\n\n1. If this lawsuit succeeds, who will be affected?\n\nPeople who buy their own insurance, usually because they are self-employed or don't get coverage through their jobs or the government, will be vulnerable. There are about 21 million people who do so, buying either through insurance brokers or from a state or federal Affordable Care Act marketplace.\n\nBut it's not clear exactly how many Americans have pre-existing conditions and could be affected. Estimates vary widely because there is not a standard definition of what counts as a pre-existing condition. Before the ACA passed, insurers commonly refused coverage for people with cancer, heart failure, diabetes, arthritis and even less serious conditions.\n\nBased on those pre-ACA examples, the Kaiser Family Foundation estimates that 27 percent of people under age 65 have a pre-existing condition. Of course, not all of them buy coverage on their own.\n\nOn Friday, America's Health Insurance Plans, an insurance industry trade group, criticized the federal government's filing.\n\nZeroing out the individual mandate penalty should not result in striking important consumer protections that help guarantee coverage to people with pre-existing conditions, a written statement from the group said. Removing those provisions will result in renewed uncertainty in the individual market, create a patchwork of requirements in the states, cause rates to go even higher for older Americans and sicker patients, and make it challenging to introduce products and rates for 2019.\n\n2. Is anything going to change right away? What about next year?\n\nDon't look for big changes quite yet, though the move could boost premiums and reduce choices among plans as early as 2019.\n\nThe lawsuit could easily go all the way to the Supreme Court before there is a resolution, which could take years. So the pre-existing condition protections are likely to stay in place during that period.\n\nMore immediately, there might be some effect on premiums for next year. Health insurers are currently deciding whether to sell coverage in the individual market in 2019 — and what they're going to charge.\n\nThe more uncertainty there is, the more the actuaries are going to be plugging into their projections for premium rates, says Sabrina Corlette, a research professor at Georgetown University's Health Policy Institute.\n\nBut others say the legal brief may have minimal impact next year on premiums. That's because insurers already expected the Trump administration would not defend the ACA — and they know that a resolution of the case will be years away, says industry consultant Robert Laszewski.\n\nA bigger effect on premiums, according to both Corlette and Laszewski, are factors already in play that are expected to draw younger and healthier people out of the ACA marketplace. Those include Congress' decision to repeal the individual mandate penalty and rules expected soon from the administration that will expand the market for lower cost and short-term policies that won't have to follow all the ACA rules.\n\n3. How is this lawsuit different from previous challenges to the ACA?\n\nThe Supreme Court has twice upheld the constitutionality of the health law. Most famously, in 2012, a narrow majority led by Chief Justice John Roberts turned back a challenge that was also filed by Republican attorneys general along with the National Federation of Independent Business.\n\nRoberts wrote in a 5-4 ruling that the requirement for most Americans to either have insurance or pay a fine constitutes a tax — even though Democrats had gone to great lengths to not call it a tax — and was therefore constitutional.\n\nIn 2015, the court ruled that Congress did not intend to provide financial aid exclusively for premiums to individuals in states that operated their own insurance exchanges.\n\nThis current lawsuit, led by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton and Wisconsin Attorney General Brad Schimel, argues that since Congress has changed the law to remove the penalty forcing individuals to get insurance, it has inadvertently rendered the rest of the law impermissible, under the 2012 Supreme Court ruling.\n\nTexans have known all along that Obamacare is unlawful and a divided Supreme Court's approval rested solely on the flimsy support of Congress' authority to tax, said Paxton when the suit was filed. Congress has now kicked that flimsy support from beneath the law.\n\nOther legal observers point out that's not how the lawmaking process works.\n\nCongress is always free to amend its statutes, even to omit what it previously thought was essential, writes Nick Bagley, a law professor at the University of Michigan, in a Thursday evening blog post. That's what Congress did when it zeroed out the mandate. So we don't have to speculate what Congress would've done if it had a choice between invalidating the ACA's insurance reforms or just invalidating the mandate. Congress made that choice.\n\n4. If the Trump administration isn't going to defend the health law in this lawsuit, who will?\n\nIn May, the court allowed more than a dozen state attorneys general, all Democrats, to intervene in the case and defend the law.\n\nThe goal of Texas' lawsuit is to leave Americans without health insurance, forcing them to choose between their health and other needs, says California Attorney General Xavier Becerra. Allowing the Democratic officials to join the suit allows us to protect the health and well-being of these Americans by defending affordable access to health care.\n\n5. If nothing is going to happen right away, why is this such a big deal?\n\nThe guarantees for coverage for people with pre-existing conditions are among those most valued by the public. Even if the lawsuit stands little chance of success, putting those provisions back in play can create uncertainty for insurers and patients this summer and fall. It could also possibly provide Democrats another talking point for the coming midterm elections in November.\n\nLegal specialists also point out that the Trump administration's failure to defend the federal health law could have long-lasting implications for the rule of law in the nation.\n\nIf the Justice Department can just throw in the towel whenever a law is challenged in court, it can effectively pick and choose which laws should remain on the books, wrote Bagley. That's as flagrant a violation of the President's constitutional duty to take care that the laws are faithfully executed as you can imagine.\n\nKaiser Health News, a nonprofit news service, is an editorially independent program of the Kaiser Family Foundation and is not affiliated with Kaiser Permanente.
Sen. Rick Scott Wants To Drive Down Health Care Costs\n\nGOP Sen. Rick Scott of Florida, charged by President Trump to come up with an Obamacare replacement, tells Steve Inskeep that drug prices are too high. NPR's Alison Kodjak comments on the discussion.\n\nSTEVE INSKEEP, HOST:\n\nPresident Trump says he wants Republicans to be known as the party of health care. So how do they achieve that, given their record? When they controlled both houses of Congress, the promises to repeal Obamacare and replace it with something better ended in nothing. More recently, the Trump administration backed a lawsuit to overturn the Affordable Care Act with no replacement in sight. Now, the president does say he is counting on senators to fill that gap - senators including Rick Scott, our next guest. He is a former hospital executive and former governor of Florida, now a newly inaugurated United States senator. Senator, good morning.\n\nRICK SCOTT: Good morning. That's right. The - well, let's - I think we can all thank the president for his interest in health care. I've been involved in health care all my life. And so I'm glad with that. And I'm going to work hard to try to drive down the cost of health care. That'd be the most important thing to Americans.\n\nINSKEEP: Well, you said drive down the cost. Let's talk about what the Republican approach really is here. From talking with others Senate Republicans, we get the impression the idea is to really stop trying to repeal and replace Obamacare and just find some narrower improvements in the existing system. Is that a fair description?\n\nSCOTT: Well that's what I'm doing. Steve, drug prices are too high. So I put a bill out last week that would require transparency, so you know what things cost. But on top of that, Americans - it's not fair that we pay more for drugs than Europeans pay. I had the same problem when I was in the health care business. I had hospitals in America and in Europe. And the drug companies wanted to charge us more in America. And I said, that's not fair. And I'm not going to do it. And I think we have to have the exact same attitude. Why are we paying more than Europeans or Canadians or Japanese for drug prices? That's my bill. That's what I'm focused on.\n\nINSKEEP: You're going for, in a sense, a free market solution. You want more transparency so that people know what they're paying. And maybe they can shop around for cheaper drugs at pharmacies and that sort of thing. But isn't it still going to be really hard for the average consumer to navigate such a complicated system where, in the end, insurance companies, they would hope, are paying most of the bills?\n\nSCOTT: Oh, look. I think that it's difficult. But I grew up in a family that didn't have money. And I remember asking my mom one time, how much would it cost - how much would there be a change in a drug, you know, if you're going to pay for it before you would change pharmacies? She said, less than a buck. I think if we tell people - give people information, they'll make good decisions. One of the companies I had in health care was a walk-in doctor's office company who put all the prices up on a menu board, so people could decide, do I want my insurance, or do I want to pay out of pocket? And it worked. So I think transparency works. I think giving people information works. But on top of that, we - the drug companies have raised their prices too fast. And so we're going to - I want to stop them from being able to charge us more than they charge Europeans.\n\nINSKEEP: I want to ask about another source of costs in the health care industry, one with which you have direct experience - hospitals. You founded a large hospital corporation. And a lot of people - laymen - will know that hospitals are famous for charging immense bills which are often inexplicable to us. Presumably, insurance firms will just pay them. But there is this huge bill. Are hospitals a big part of the problem?\n\nSCOTT: I think you have to look at - the entire delivery system is an issue. We - I passed legislation when I was governor to require hospitals to disclose their prices. We've got to make this more simplistic, more transparent, so you as a consumer have better information. And that's true for the pharmacies. That's true for the hospitals. That's true for the insurance companies. Take insurance companies as an example. You probably know if you're on a stat (ph), as an example. Insurance companies should tell you what your copayment is before you buy the insurance that year. And they shouldn't change it on you for the 12 months. I mean, that's not fair. And so I think every part of this - we need to have - what I always thought about it is you've got to have more competition. And you've got to let people make more of the decisions on their own. They'll spend their money smartly if they have the information.\n\nINSKEEP: Now, you, of course, are in a Senate where I'm sure every Republican and every Democrat will be in favor, in theory, of lower prescription drug prices. Do you believe there is sufficient bipartisan support for the same approach to this?\n\nSCOTT: Well, clearly - I was in the Budget Committee last week. And everybody, including Bernie Sanders, was all in on lower drug prices. I think this idea that we should not pay more than Europeans pay - I think that's pretty common sense. And so I'm optimistic that we can get that done. I think - look. It's very partisan. I've just been up here three months. It's a partisan place. But that's why you've got to find things that everybody agrees on to get it done. I mean, look. We've got a divided Congress. And even in the Senate, takes 60 votes. So it takes Democrats to be onboard to get anything done, which - I'm fine with that. We ought to figure out how to work together.\n\nINSKEEP: Well, Senator, thanks very much for the time. Really appreciate it.\n\nSCOTT: All right. Have a great day.\n\nINSKEEP: Rick Scott, former governor of Florida, now U.S. senator. NPR's Alison Kodjak covers health care for us. And she was listening in. She's in our studios. Alison, good morning.\n\nALISON KODJAK, BYLINE: Morning, Steve.\n\nINSKEEP: What do you hear there?\n\nKODJAK: Well, the thing that stood out right at the beginning was that he really wasn't interested in engaging on a replacement for the Affordable Care.\n\nINSKEEP: He was frank. That's not the goal anymore.\n\nKODJAK: Exactly. But last week, the Trump administration changed its position and said it wants the law overturned in court. If it gets its way, that's going to leave a huge void in the health care system. And it doesn't look like the Senate's looking to step up and find a replacement.\n\nINSKEEP: You said it doesn't look like the Senate's looking to step up and find a replacement. But the president is looking there. We have Rick Scott introducing this bill. But the prospects don't seem very good when you observe this from the outside?\n\nKODJAK: Well, the bill he is introducing is about drug prices, which is not a replacement for the Affordable Care Act. It's not going to get people insurance if they have pre-existing conditions. And this lawsuit actually overturns that law. It is - the issue of drug prices is very important. And lowering health care costs is very important. Senator Scott - the other thing that he talked about - he focused on drug prices but slid over the issue of hospital costs. He's a former hospital executive. Hospital costs are much higher, generally, than drug prices. They take up a huge share of the medical costs that this country spends. Drug prices are rising faster.\n\nINSKEEP: If I'm concerned about my insurance costs, hospitals are a huge part of that, even though drug prices get the attention?\n\nKODJAK: Yeah. Drug prices are rising faster, but hospitals take up a much larger share of our overall health care spending.\n\nINSKEEP: Have they had much success in restraining hospital costs in this country over the last several years under Obamacare?\n\nKODJAK: Not really. They've had success in restraining payments to doctors but not overall payment - not overall costs charged by hospitals.\n\nINSKEEP: When you look at what Senator Scott just said, what other Republicans have said, what the president has said, do you see a coherent approach to health care by the Republican Party?\n\nKODJAK: I would say not an overall approach because if they - the president is saying he wants the Affordable Care Act completely overturned. And Republicans in the Senate and in the House and the president are also saying that they want people with pre-existing conditions protected, young people able to get affordable insurance. Nobody's looking for - to how to replace that and put those things in place if this law is overturned.\n\nINSKEEP: Alison, thanks for coming by.\n\nKODJAK: Thanks, Steve.\n\nINSKEEP: NPR's Alison Kodjak.\n\nCopyright © 2019 NPR.

Trump And Republicans' Timeline For Obamacare Repeal Getting Longer\n\nNPR's Scott Simon talks to the Republican former Rep. Richard Hanna about the Affordable Care Act. Hanna says despite Trump's pledge to repeal it, he thinks the ACA will largely survive.\n\nSCOTT SIMON, HOST:\n\nThe urgency among House Republicans to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act may be fading. Before he was inaugurated, President Trump said a repeal vote would probably happen within a week. It did not. He gave a different timeline in an interview with Bill O'Reilly on Fox News last Sunday.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I would like to say by the end of the year - at least the rudiments - but we should have something within the year and the following year.\n\nSIMON: We're joined now by Richard Hanna, retired congressman, a Republican from New York's 22nd district in Central New York. Mr. Hanna, thanks so much for being with us.\n\nRICHARD HANNA: Good morning. My pleasure.\n\nSIMON: You said that when faced with the tasks - with the task, Republicans may choose not to repeal at least a lot of the Affordable Care Act. Why?\n\nHANNA: Well, as a practical matter, there are over 130 million people on it - or not on it, but who have pre-existing conditions. There are tens of millions or about 20 million, I think, people who are under that system. And also, it's important to remember that we've never had a lower rate of people who are uninsured in this country in our history. So while we argue about the cost and how it's redistributed the cost and who it's affected, at the same time the law has done what it originally intended to do. And even though the Republican Party has turned it into a talking point and I, along with others, have voted many times to do something to it to be able to replace it.\n\nSIMON: Well, I was going to point that out. Several...\n\nHANNA: Right. What else was there to do (laughter)?\n\nSIMON: Several times you voted to repeal the Affordable Care Act.\n\nHANNA: Yes, and several times I did not when it was associated with women's health care and things like that that I've supported. I've always been a supporter of the LGBT community and Planned Parenthood, one of the few, if not the only. So there are parts of this...\n\nSIMON: You mean one of the few, if not the only Republican in the House.\n\nHANNA: Exactly. Thank you.\n\nSIMON: Not people. Yeah.\n\nHANNA: The - so I think, you know, they look a lot like the dog that caught the bus. And the fact that they want to have what they call patient-centered health care, it's a nice talking point. It sounds good. The question is what does it mean? And I think that the millions of people that are on the Affordable Health Care Act and the millions of people who object to it and the Republican Party should have it - have in their minds that they owe the public what it is they're going to do when they replace this.\n\nAnd I think Mr. Price, Tom Price, the secretary of health, is the most knowledgeable man to replace this. But also, it's deeply complicated, multifaceted and lots of it crosses back and forth in many different ways. It's not going to be easy. And, you know, when you're in the minority and you vote against something over and over knowing full well that the president is never going to sign a bill that undoes his signature legislation, it's pretty easy. The complicated part is - and I think is why people should look to divided government - is what do you do when you actually own all three branches of government and you can affect the things that you've talked about?\n\nSIMON: Well, let - but - got to ask you - didn't millions - don't millions of Americans feel that they voted to repeal the Affordable Care Act because that's what Donald Trump said he wanted to do, that's what most Republicans running for election to the House and Senate said they wanted to do and they have majorities?\n\nHANNA: Well, I think it's typical of our politics on the right and the left today. People are pandering to their base. The gerrymandering in this country has really become a train wreck for democracy, that if you want to get through a primary you talk to your base. And we increasingly elect those people who move further and further to the extreme on both sides. So they know that they can pick up a talking point - hating Obamacare or whatever it may be - and they can win a primary. And the choices we're left at - with at a general election are very limited.\n\nSIMON: Richard Hanna, retired congressman from New York. Thanks very much for being with us.\n\nHANNA: And thank you.\n\nCopyright © 2017 NPR. All rights reserved.

The Top Moments From A Decade That Reshaped American Politics\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Jewel Samad/AFP via Getty Images Jewel Samad/AFP via Getty Images\n\nWhether you think the new decade starts at midnight Tuesday or a year from then, the eve of 2020 seems like a good time to look back on the top political stories of the 2010s.\n\nIt was a tumultuous decade in politics that saw everything from the presidency and reelection of the first black president to the rise of the Tea Party and the improbable election of Donald Trump as president. The 2010s were marred by political polarization and gridlock, as American society struggled to deal with changing demography and a white grievance backlash.\n\nHere are some of the top moments of the decade that helped reshape American politics.\n\nObamacare signed into law\n\nThe Affordable Care Act was signed into law in March 2010 after passing the Senate on Christmas Eve of 2009. No single piece of legislation would come to define the decade more than Obamacare.\n\nObama's signature legislation brought down the number of uninsured in the country dramatically. It also led to the rise of the Tea Party and sweeping Democratic officeholder losses across the country. Despite dozens of GOP attempts to repeal it, the health care law remains a permanent fixture in American society.\n\nIt's notable how the politics, especially of Democrats, have changed on the law since the ACA was passed. Progressives back then were pushing Obama for a public option, but tactically Democratic leadership didn't think it could pass. Today, as is being fought out on the 2020 campaign trail, many progressives now see even a public option as not going far enough.\n\nThe rise of the Tea Party\n\nThe Republican Party was reshaped by the rise of the Tea Party. The GOP rode the 2010 Tea Party wave to take over the House, but governing proved difficult. Legislative priorities were unclear, as Tea Party conservatives cared most about cutting and restraining spending — not compromise.\n\nThat lack of compromise fueled government shutdowns and a debt-ceiling standoff that led to the first-ever U.S. credit downgrade. The Tea Party phenomenon also eventually ran a speaker out of Congress. John Boehner's hands were tied by his right flank of hardliners, who would not let him negotiate to the point he might have with President Obama.\n\nBoehner, in fact, notably said he would not use the word compromise. I reject that word, Boehner said in 2010. He tried to thread the needle with the phrase common ground instead, but to no avail.\n\nA direct through-line can be drawn from the Tea Party to President Trump. Many people in Tea Party crowds espoused conspiracy theories about Obama, including the false and racist birther narrative. Trump was a leader of the birther movement, and with him in the White House, conservative base supporters who were integral to the Tea Party's success don't seem to care as much about deficits that have only grown.\n\nThe Tea Party may have also been a leading indicator of what's happening within the Democratic Party. Obama led to the Tea Party, which led to Trump, who is leading to progressives rejecting the idea of compromise being a smart thing to do. And that's also playing out in the 2020 Democratic primary.\n\nAmericans like the idea of compromise; they just want the other side to do it.\n\nThe killing of Osama bin Laden\n\nIf the struggling economy after the Great Recession, the Tea Party and record GOP opposition had Obama in a defensive crouch, he rose out of that with the killing of Osama bin Laden in 2011.\n\nIt's easy to overlook that moment now, but realize that the mastermind of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks had escaped the reach of the most powerful military in the world and its allies for almost 10 years. He was like a ghost who haunted the American psyche. His killing also helped reinforce a president, who was branded as weak by opponents, a year before his reelection.\n\nObama's reelection\n\nThis is another event that's easy to overlook. But it was important for the legitimacy of the first black president. Imagine if he'd not been reelected. Republicans would have been able to reduce him to the way they talk about Jimmy Carter.\n\nWhat's more, presidents aren't seen as great if they stand for and lose reelection. None of the top 18 presidents, according to a 2019 survey of historians, lost reelection. And each of the top 13, except for John F. Kennedy, served for more than four years (Teddy Roosevelt, Harry Truman and Lyndon Johnson assumed office before winning election on their own.)\n\nObama, by the way, stands at No. 12 on the list.\n\nThe recovery after the Great Recession\n\nPart of the reason why Obama ranks on that great presidents list is because of his handling of the Great Recession, the worst recession since the Great Depression. Starting in December 2007, it saw pillars of finance collapse, mass layoffs and people kicked out of their homes after the housing and foreclosure crises. Auto bailouts, begun under President George W. Bush, and the recovery act were the first items on the list when Obama took office.\n\nOsama bin Laden is dead, and General Motors is alive! then-Vice President Joe Biden thundered at the 2012 Democratic National Convention, repeating what had become a mantra en route to Obama's reelection.\n\nTrump has been campaigning on the continuing strong economy and will certainly try to ride it to reelection. He gets his best ratings from Americans on his handling of the economy. But more than a political story, imagine what American society and the world would have been like if the U.S. didn't recover.\n\nAmericans were projected to spend some $728 billion this holiday season, so it's easy now to look past how consequential the 2010s were to the economic stability of the country — and the world.\n\nThe Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre\n\nTwenty children were killed, the president cried in the White House briefing room talking about it, and, yet, the gun lobby was so strong that Congress was not able to pass any legislation — even universal background checks, which are very popular with Americans. Still, this mass shooting was a marker.\n\nThe lack of action reflected the strength of the National Rifle Association at the time, but hundreds more have been killed in similar events since, in places like Parkland, Fla.; Las Vegas; Dayton, Ohio; and El Paso, Texas. And while little has come out of Washington legislatively since Sandy Hook, various states have adopted restrictions. There has been lots of activism around guns. And better-funded gun-restrictions groups now exist — and have begun winning. All of that comes as the NRA faces its own internal turmoil and financial difficulties.\n\nRinging the alarms on climate change\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Ronen Tivony /SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images Ronen Tivony /SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images\n\nMajor report after major report rang the alarm bells in the 2010s on the threat of climate change. President Obama signed the Paris climate accord, only to have the U.S. pull out of it under President Trump.\n\nBut even the markers set in that agreement are not enough to stave off the most catastrophic possible outcomes for the planet, according to a 2018 United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, or IPCC, report.\n\nThere is a big generational divide on views of climate change. A Gallup poll last year found that 70% of people 18 to 34 worry a great deal or fair amount about climate change, while 56% of those 55 and older said they do.\n\nFor a younger generation, this is not an existential problem, it's an urgent one, and how that will shape politics as younger Americans gain power will be interesting to watch.\n\nSame-sex marriage becomes legal\n\nIn the middle of the decade, in 2015, the Supreme Court made same-sex marriage legal in all 50 states. Public opinion and politics moved sweepingly on same-sex marriage in the 2010s.\n\nIt wasn't that long ago that Democratic politicians, for example, tried to walk the line on same-sex marriage, calling for civil unions. That, in fact, was Obama's stance in 2008, not wanting to offend religious groups.\n\nBut he eventually lent his support to the cause of marriage equality in 2012 when Vice President Biden said the Obama administration was in favor of legalization of same-sex marriage.\n\nTo understand why Obama might have been reticent to support same-sex marriage, just 40% of the country was in favor of legalizing it in 2009 when he was sworn in, according to Gallup. By 2012, just about half of Americans were in favor. Now, it's 63%, though still only 44% of Republicans.\n\nMarijuana becomes legal in states\n\nSpeaking of changing public opinion, the mainstreaming of marijuana has been a sea change. In 2012, pot became legal in Colorado and Washington state. Since then, nine more states and the District of Columbia have adopted expansive rules for recreational marijuana use. Marijuana for medical use is legal in almost two dozen other states.\n\nMarijuana is still illegal by federal law. But two-thirds of Americans now are in favor of legalizing marijuana, up from just 44% a decade ago, according to Gallup. Even a majority of Republicans now agree it should be legalized.\n\nThe legalization movement and overall changing public opinion won't just have implications for those looking for a recreational high. It will also have potentially serious implications for those locked up in prisons because of nonviolent drug offenses as bipartisan attention is given to criminal justice reform.\n\nGoing nuclear on the filibuster and changing the balance of the Supreme Court\n\nIn response to Mitch McConnell's record use of the filibuster to block Obama judicial nominees, Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid went nuclear and blew up the procedural tactic. It allowed Obama judicial nominees through with a simple majority rather than the 60 votes needed for cloture.\n\nBut McConnell pledged revenge when he was in the majority. That opportunity came after Republicans took over the Senate in 2014. He blocked Obama's Supreme Court nominee to replace the late Antonin Scalia, not even allowing a hearing for the well-regarded judge Merrick Garland.\n\nWhen Trump became president, McConnell then did away with the filibuster for Supreme Court nominees, allowing Trump to slide through two nominees. That changed the high court to a majority conservative court for the first time in three-quarters of a century. That will likely have ramifications for social policy for a generation to come.\n\nThe #MeToo movement\n\nThink of the legacies and views of men like Harvey Weinstein, Bill Cosby and Matt Lauer before the #MeToo movement. The movement has had sweeping effects, not just for powerful men across industries, but also in how companies deal with sexual harassment and misconduct.\n\nIt, of course, has touched politics, too, with differing ramifications. Congress changed its rules to make members more accountable, and members of Congress have resigned — male and female.\n\nBut some Democrats are smarting over the standard they set for themselves. Kirsten Gillibrand suffered consequences in her presidential campaign partly because of her leading role in helping force former Minnesota Sen. Al Franken to resign. And Biden, of course, has also faced allegations of inappropriate behavior.\n\nMeanwhile, there have been almost two dozen women who accused Trump of sexual misconduct, yet he was still elected.\n\nPresident Trump's election — and impeachment\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Christopher Gregory/Getty Images Christopher Gregory/Getty Images\n\nIf the script was written this way, the movie might never have gotten made.\n\nThe most unlikely scenario played out in 2016, and Trump won the American presidency by running to represent the forgotten man and woman. Even as his Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton won 3 million more votes in that election, Trump fired up rural voters and voters without college degrees in the right places to win the Electoral College.\n\nBut Trump was eventually impeached, with Democrats in charge of the House, after his administration withheld aid and a White House meeting from Ukraine, while Trump sought the announcement of public investigations into conspiracy theories about the 2016 election and the Bidens.\n\nBut the Republican Party is now Trump's party, and, in the new year, he is set to be acquitted by the GOP-controlled Senate. And that will set the stage for what is likely to be a bitter and closely divided 2020 election.\n\nWhat does the future hold?\n\nAmerica is the largest economy and military in the world, but some question U.S. moral values and leadership. Is America the globalist, interventionist country it was that helped maintain world order and security after World War II, or will it lurch further toward protectionism and nativism? What will America's role in the world be in the next 50 years?\n\nAnd, most importantly, what does it mean — and what will it mean — to be American? That was clearer after World War II than it is today, as technological advances threaten to shift global power with a click or a swipe.
With Shutdown Looming, Trump Is Tweeting Out Demands. Will He Stick By Them?\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Olivier Douliery-Pool/Getty Images Olivier Douliery-Pool/Getty Images\n\nI also protect myself by being flexible. I never get too attached to one deal or one approach.\n\nThose words from Donald Trump's The Art of The Deal may be giving congressional Republicans some hope this week.\n\nThat's because Congress is facing a midnight Friday deadline to pass legislation to keep the federal government fully open — or face a partial government shutdown precisely on President Trump's 100th day in office.\n\nGovernment shutdowns are not unheard of, but those in recent memory came when power was divided, not when one party controled both chambers of Congress and the White House. Republicans are aware that their party generally gets blamed for government shutdowns, even if it doesn't necessarily pay the price at the ballot box.\n\nRepublicans held the House and won control of the Senate in 2014 — a year after the public put much of the blame on their party for the shutdown in late 2013.\n\nBut on the heels of the failed GOP health care effort, Republicans are hoping to avoid an embarrassing episode as they try to prove they are a party that can govern effectively.\n\nThe president is working hard to keep the government open and addressing various issues, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told reporters Monday.\n\nTrump has several demands that could complicate hopes on Capitol Hill for a clean bill — one without controversial provisions. House Speaker Paul Ryan has vowed to avoid a shutdown, and told lawmakers on a conference call over the weekend, Wherever we land will be a product the president can and will support.\n\nSenate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said over the weekend that a deal could get done, if the president stays out of it and lets Congress negotiate among itself. He called Trump's demands the only fly in the ointment.\n\nTrump has made several of his demands known on Twitter. So what does he want?\n\n1. Wall funding\n\nCongressional leaders have been saying for months that they know they will have to put up money for Trump's request to build a wall on the border with Mexico. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell was asked whether Mexico would pay and had a simple answer: Uh, no.\n\nBut they've also maintained it would be a separate issue from keeping the government open.\n\nOnce the government is up and running, and stays open and running, then we have to fight this out over the next year, Rep. Peter King, R-N.Y., told Fox News Sunday.\n\nTrump's team has been sending mixed messages. Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly said on CNN, I would expect he'll be insistent on the funding. But in an appearance on NBC's Meet The Press, Trump's chief of staff Reince Priebus refused to say whether the president would veto a bill without border funding.\n\nThe Associated Press reported Monday evening that Trump told a group of conservative reporters he'd be willing to let the wall funding slide to September.\n\nDemocrats have been saying that wall funding is a non-starter, with public opinion on their side. A Washington Post-ABC News poll released over the weekend showed the following: Sixty percent of adults oppose building a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, while 37 percent support it. Of these respondents, 47 percent are strongly against it.\n\n2. Increased military spending\n\nFor all the goals Trump won't accomplish by his 100th day in office, he may feel more bullish about getting a boost in military spending included in the spending bill. It's seen as one of the controversial sticking points that can hold things up, but Trump has cover from some critics.\n\nWhite House press secretary Sean Spicer said it was the primary goal in spending negotiations on Monday.\n\nSen. John McCain, R-Ariz., said in March that he would not vote for a bill that didn't increase military spending above current levels. He told CNN that doing so destroys the ability of the military to defend this nation, and it puts the lives of the men and women in the military at risk.\n\nTrump had dinner Monday night with McCain and Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., another Trump critic in the GOP, who is in lock step with McCain on defense issues.\n\nDefense spending also lacks the the quality of being a hallmark Trump issue like the wall, so Democrats may not be as energized in opposing such an increase. Blocking wall funding would be a bigger win for them.\n\n3. Health care\n\nTrump is pushing a revival of GOP efforts to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, which imploded last month. He has been noncommittal as to whether a vote would need to happen this week and possibly tangle up passing a bill to keep the government open.\n\nBut with the Affordable Care Act in place, the president has been hinting at using the healthcare program as a bargaining chip with Democrats. The administration could drop subsidies to help reduce out-of-pocket costs for low-income Americans, which could destabilize the health-insurance market.\n\nWhite House budget director Mick Mulvaney told Bloomberg that the administration had made an offer to Democrats to maintain a dollar in subsidies for every dollar of wall funding they are willing to provide.\n\nTrump has said Democrats will take the heat if Obamacare collapses, but blaming the opposition for the consequences of such public threats from the president himself might prove challenging.\n\nDemocrats have already been turning it back on Trump.\n\nThe White House gambit to hold hostage health care for millions of Americans, in order to force American taxpayers to foot the bill for a wall that the president said would be paid for by Mexico is a complete nonstarter, Schumer spokesman Matt House said.\n\nTrump may be fixated on the bigger goal here, though. On Monday, he warned that Obamacare is already failing, something that the Congressional Budget Office says isn't true, and promised that the GOP will fix it with its own plan.\n\nTrump has emphasized his flexibility, but on the health care bill he demonstrated a willingness to walk away from the table in the midst of a negotiation.\n\nWith the prospect of another legislative defeat on the eve of his 100th day as president, Trump might be keeping in mind another passage from The Art of The Deal:\n\nYou can create excitement, you can do wonderful promotion and get all kinds of press, and you can throw in a little hyperbole. But if you don't deliver the goods, people will eventually catch on.
Supreme Court To Government: Pay Obamacare Insurers\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Patrick Semansky/AP Patrick Semansky/AP\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court has told the federal government that it has to pay $12 billion to insurance companies, money that was promised in the Affordable Care Act as part of the start-up costs of Obamacare in the first three years of its existence.\n\nThe law, as enacted, promised to limit profits and losses for insurance companies in the first three years of the Obamacare program. Some companies made more money than allowed by the formula, and had to pay some back to the government, and other companies lost money and were owed money by the government under the formula.\n\nBut in 2014, the first year that the ACA's plan was in place, the Republican-controlled Congress reneged on the promise to appropriate money for the companies that had lost money. It did the same for the next two years as well, adding to appropriation bills a rider that barred the government from fulfilling the promise in the statute. After President Trump was elected, his administration supported the GOP-led refusal to pay.\n\nThe insurance companies sued, and on Monday the Supreme Court ruled that the federal government has to pay up.\n\nThe vote was 8-to-1, with Justice Sonia Sotomayor writing for the majority that the decision reflects a principle as old as the nation itself. The government should honor its obligations.\n\nShe noted that the language of the ACA was rare in that it permitted lawsuits to enforce the provisions at issue here, provisions that declare the governmentshall pay the losses suffered by insurance companies that participated over the first three years.\n\nThe lone dissenter was Justice Samuel Alito, who called the decision a massive bailout for the insurance industry, which took a calculated risk and lost.\n\nMonday's decision was the third involving Obamacare at the Supreme Court. Conservative groups, and now the Trump administration, have consistently sought to invalidate or undermine the law — so far, with limited or no success. But next year, the Supreme Court is scheduled to consider once again whether the law is unconstitutional.\n\nDespite repeated efforts by Republicans in Congress and the Trump administration to either undermine or entirely do away with the program, Obamacare has remained popular, likely because it has enabled millions of Americans, including those with pre-existing conditions, to obtain medical insurance and medical coverage for the first time.
GOP Leaders Urge Donald Trump To Back Off Criticism Of Federal Judge\n\nDonald Trump shows no sign of backing off his racially charged criticism of a federal judge, even as he comes under increasing pressure from leaders in the Republican Party.\n\nARI SHAPIRO, HOST:\n\nNPR's Mara Liasson is here in the studio to discuss more about how unusual this turmoil in the Republican Party is. Hi, Mara.\n\nMARA LIASSON, BYLINE: Hi, Ari.\n\nSHAPIRO: So on a scale of routine to bizarre, what are we seeing right now?\n\nLIASSON: Well, it's more turmoil courtesy of Donald Trump. And of course we say this every time, but this one feels different. Five weeks from Indiana, the primary when he vanquished the GOP establishment and became the nominee, he's still acting like a sore winner.\n\nSHAPIRO: (Laughter).\n\nLIASSON: And this much-promised pivot to being presidential just hasn't materialized. In fact, he seems to be going in the opposite direction, pursuing these personal feuds with all sorts of enemies but first and foremost Judge Curiel, who, as you just heard, is the American judge trying the Trump University case.\n\nSHAPIRO: Talk about the reaction we're seeing from Republican leaders that we just heard Nina Totenberg describe. Are you surprised by what we're seeing from them?\n\nLIASSON: No. It's very candid and very anguished. You heard Mitch McConnell say, get back on message; talk about the economy and Obamacare. Stop talking about minorities and your enemies, and do it now. And almost as if his message was received at Trump headquarters, Trump - the campaign released a statement just now that says, it is unfortunate that my comments have been misconstrued as a categorical attack against people of Mexican heritage. I am friends with them and employ thousands of people of Mexican and Hispanic descent.\n\nThen he goes on to say the American justice system relies on fair, impartial judges. I don't feel that one's heritage makes them incapable of being impartial, which is exactly the opposite of what he's been saying. But he says, but based on the rulings that I've received in this case, I don't feel judge Curiel is being fair.\n\nSo sounds like he's trying to walk it back. But in the meantime, you had this avalanche of Republican criticism - unprecedented spectacle of people criticizing their own party's nominee. So far, one Republican - Senate incumbent up for reelection Mark Kirk of Illinois - has un-endorsed Trump. He's the only one.\n\nSHAPIRO: You say it's unprecedented for the leaders of the party to criticize their nominee this blatantly, so why is this happening?\n\nLIASSON: Well, you know, this is not about policy. This isn't about banning Muslims, deporting 11 million people or building a wall. Those policies have support, particularly inside the Republican Party. This is about what Paul Ryan called the textbook definition of racism, saying, at least until he seems to be walking it back, that a Mexican judge couldn't be fair and that a Muslim judge probably can't be fair to him either.\n\nYou know, it's interesting because previously, Trump has said that lots of legal immigrants support his policies on immigration. Now he seems to be saying - or at least until he maybe walked it back - that because of the things he himself has said about Mexicans and Muslims, he assumes that any Mexican or Muslim judge would be against him. He's almost conceding the point his opponents make that he has engendered racial divisions.\n\nSHAPIRO: Mara, Donald Trump created plenty of controversy during the primary which did not seem to hurt him much in the polls. Now that we're nearing a general election, do you expect that to change?\n\nLIASSON: Well, we don't know yet. We won't know until next week when we'll get a whole bunch of new polls. We do know that Donald Trump hasn't tweeted for the last 16 hours, which is the second time he's gone silent. The first time was right after Hillary Clinton's lacerating speech against him on Thursday. We know that so far he hasn't paid a price. Republicans I've talked to today say they're not seeing any slippage in his polling, at least in Senate battleground states.\n\nBut what we do know is that he's had a very hard time adjusting to being a general election candidate when you're in a much, much brighter spotlight. He seems to have totally abandoned his crisp, clear message, make American great again. He didn't have to respond to the questions about his donations to veterans groups the way he did. These were all self-inflicted wounds.\n\nHe also seems to have made very little effort to ramp up his campaign for the general election. He's still a one-man band. We have from our own Sarah McCammon reporting about the conference call where Trump himself essentially undercut his own campaign staff who were trying to keep a lid on the Judge Curiel controversy.\n\nWe also know that he turns 70 next week. People usually don't change when things that have been working for them for their whole lives - he doesn't seem any reason to change. Maybe the statement that he released today means that he will.\n\nSHAPIRO: NPR's Mara Liasson, thanks as always.\n\nLIASSON: Thank you.\n\nCopyright © 2016 NPR. All rights reserved.

Illinois Congressman On Why He Supports The Republican Health Care Plan\n\nCongressman Rodney Davis of Illinois supports the Republican Health Care Plan that's making its way through the House. But he says that there will likely be hurdles before the bill becomes a law.\n\nLAKSHMI SINGH, HOST:\n\nWe want to turn now to Congressman Rodney Davis. He is a Republican speaking to us from Decatur, Ill., and he is in favor of the bill being advanced by House Republicans. Congressman Davis, thanks so much for joining us.\n\nRODNEY DAVIS: Thanks for having me on.\n\nSINGH: So please tell us briefly why you are in favor of this bill.\n\nDAVIS: Because the status quo is collapsing. The health insurance marketplace as we know it is not sustainable under the current law. And if we do nothing and watch states like Illinois have to come up with hundreds of millions of dollars under the current law just to keep the Medicaid expansion in place that we have, then I'm abdicating my responsibility as a policymaker. The bill that I'm supporting I'm sure will be changed by the time it goes to the Senate and comes back to us. But I'm looking forward to the debate to make our health care system better than it is today.\n\nSINGH: We just heard from the president of the American Medical Association, who says that this bill will put health insurance out of reach for millions of Americans, especially older, lower-income patients. What do you make of that?\n\nDAVIS: Well, I disagree with the statements. And I've talked to many doctors over my time in Washington over the last four years who were very frustrated with the current status quo, with the Affordable Care Act as implemented. Doctors that I talked to are seeing less patients because of the compliance issues that they have to follow under Obamacare. We want to make the system better, and I look forward to having their input. But I would argue looking in Illinois, where we've had 45 to 55 - and friends of mine have had 87 percent increases in their premiums - Obamacare's already costly. And frankly, the promise for families of saving $2,500 on average did not come true.\n\nSINGH: Well, as you're well aware, there has been pushback from the right as well, a lot of Republicans, especially in the Senate, who say that this bill does not go far enough in repealing the current health care law, the Affordable Care Act, also widely known as Obamacare. Rand Paul has called the Republican plan Obamacare lite. What do you make of his resistance to this current bill?\n\nDAVIS: Well, I know Rand. Rand's a friend of mine. I think this is a publicity stunt, though, that is not based on facts. His own plan has refundable tax credits just like our plan does. You know, I want to make sure that we don't just pull the rug out from those who are dependent on coverage, those who may need the assistance through our Medicaid programs.\n\nI think our program as designed is a great off-ramp to be able to get to a system that's going to be affordable for every single American, that's going to stop the collapsing status quo we know as Obamacare, and also actually be able to provide opportunities for families to get off of Medicaid and then be able to afford the coverage that they need or be offered more affordable coverage through their employers or future employers.\n\nSINGH: Well, Congressman Davis, we know, though, that this is probably not going to be smooth sailing for this bill to be approved. There is enough resistance that there are going to be obstacles to getting to where you want to get. What is it going to take, you think, to get enough Republicans to bend behind this bill finally?\n\nDAVIS: Well, we'll see when we go back next week. I'm part of the deputy whip team, so we'll be asking members what their concerns are. But I would - I would let you know that no major piece of legislation that I've seen go across the House floor in my four years has ever been easy. And this one will be no different. But we also have to remember as Republicans we are now the majority and we have the White House. We have to move from an opposition party to a proposition party. Now's our time to put our ideas forward. And this is going to be a test for the Republicans, no doubt.\n\nSINGH: Congressman Rodney Davis, representing Illinois' 13th District, speaking to us from Decatur. Thank you so much for joining us.\n\nDAVIS: Thanks for having me on.\n\nCopyright © 2017 NPR. All rights reserved.

READ: Sen. Feinstein's Opening Statement On Amy Coney Barrett's Nomination\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Susan Walsh/Pool/Getty Images Susan Walsh/Pool/Getty Images\n\nSen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., said the Senate should not be moving forward on this nomination until the election is over and the next president has taken office.\n\nFeinstein, the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, delivered her opening statement at Amy Coney Barrett's confirmation hearing on Monday.\n\nBarrett is President Trump's nominee for the Supreme Court; Republicans intend to confirm her to the court before Election Day. There's little Democrats can do to prevent that, but they have plenty of objections.\n\nRead Feinstein's prepared remarks below.\n\nLess than one month ago, the nation lost one of our leading voices for equality: Ruth Bader Ginsburg left very big shoes to fill.\n\n[Justice] Ginsburg loved the law and she loved this country. She worked all of her life to ensure that the opening words of our Constitution — We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect union — included ALL the people, not just an elite few. She was a standard-bearer for justice.\n\nJustice Ginsburg's nomination was the first one that I participated in when I came to the Senate. It was a real thrill to be part of that crowded and celebratory hearing for someone who had broken down barriers and reopened doors and staunchly believed in a woman's right to full equality and autonomy.\n\nIn filling [Justice] Ginsburg's seat, the stakes are extraordinarily high for the American people — both in the short-term and for decades to come. Most importantly — health care coverage for millions of Americans is at stake with this nomination.\n\nSo over the course of these hearings, my colleagues and I will focus on that subject. We will examine the consequences if, and that's a big if, the Republicans succeed in rushing this nomination through the Senate before the next president takes office.\n\nBut most importantly, in just a few weeks — on November 10 — the Supreme Court will hear hearings in Texas v. California – a case brought to strike down the ACA.\n\nThe president has promised to appoint justices who will vote to dismantle that law. As a candidate, he criticized the Supreme Court for upholding the law and said: If I win the presidency, my judicial appointments will do the right thing unlike Bush's appointee John Roberts on ObamaCare. And when he appointed Judge Barrett to fill Justice Ginsburg's seat, the president said that eliminating the Affordable Care Act would be a big WIN for the USA.\n\nJudge Barrett, you've been critical of Chief Justice Roberts for his 5-4 opinion upholding the law, stating that Roberts pushed the Affordable Care Act beyond its plausible meaning to save the statute.\n\nThis well could mean that, if Judge Barrett is confirmed, Americans stand to lose the benefits that the ACA provides. So I hope you will clarify that in this hearing.\n\nFirst, more than 130 million Americans with preexisting conditions like cancer, asthma or even COVID-19 could be denied coverage or charged more to obtain health insurance. This includes more than 16.8 million Californians with preexisting conditions. And we are just one state. But I think you should know how we feel.\n\nSecond, some 12 million working Americans are covered through the ACA's Medicaid expansion. If the act is struck down, they lose their health care.\n\nThird, the more than 2 million Americans under the age of 26 who are covered by their parents' health insurance and they could lose that coverage.\n\nFourth, insurers could charge higher premiums for women simply because of their gender.\n\nAnd fifth, women could lose access to critical preventive services and maternity care, including cancer screenings and well-woman visits.\n\nNow, the bottom line is this: There have been 70 attempts to repeal the ACA. But clearly the effort to dismantle the law continues, and they are asking the Supreme Court to strike down the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThis, I believe, will cause tremendous harm. Consider people like Christina Munro Garcia of my home state.\n\nAt age 60, Christina's eyesight started to fail because of cataracts. She had always struggled to obtain insurance because of pre-existing conditions, including C-sections and epilepsy. The cost of coverage — when it was even offered to her — averaged between $2,500 and $3,000 a month, far more than she and her husband could afford.\n\nIn 2010, she was able to obtain coverage through the Affordable Care Act. Within weeks, she was able to have cataract surgery. This saved her life.\n\nChristina described her reaction when she was able to get coverage through the California Health Exchange following passage of the ACA: It was like manna from heaven. I cried. After all these years of struggling to obtain coverage, I was able to get insurance through the California Exchange, no questions asked about my pre-existing conditions. The premium was worth $200 a month, as compared to the $2,500 to $3,000 monthly payments I would have to pay before the ACA — if I could even get an insurer to offer me coverage.\n\nAs Christina further explained: People just don't understand what it was like — the incredible fear before the Affordable Care Act – having to worry about being able to cover medical expenses and not being able to find affordable insurance.\n\nWe can't afford to go back to those days when Americans could be denied coverage or charged exorbitant amounts. That's what's at stake for many of us, for America, with this nomination. And that's why the questions we will ask and the views, hopefully, that you will share with us are so important.\n\nWe are now just 22 days from the election, Mr. Chairman. Voting is underway in more than 40 states. Senate Republicans are pressing forward full speed ahead to consolidate a court that will carry their policies forward, with I hope some review of the will of the American people.\n\nPresident Trump said last week said that he had instructed my representatives to stop negotiation [over a COVID-19 relief package] until after the election and to focus full time on confirming Judge Barrett to the Supreme Court.\n\nWhen Justice Scalia died in February 2016, Senate Republicans refused to consider a replacement for his seat until after the election. At the time, Senator McConnell said: The American people should have a voice in the selection of their next Supreme Court justice.\n\nWhen asked in October 2018 if Republicans intended to honor their own rule if an opening were to come up in 2020, Chairman Graham promised: If an opening comes in the last year of President Trump's term, and the primary process has started, we'll wait till [after] the next election.\n\nRepublicans should honor this word [and] their promise and let the American people be heard. Simply put, we should not be moving forward on this nomination — not until the election has ended and the next president has taken office.
Obamacare Takes Another Hit In Federal Appeals Court Ruling\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Albin Lohr-Jones/Pacific Press/LightRocket via Getty Images Albin Lohr-Jones/Pacific Press/LightRocket via Getty Images\n\nUpdated at 8:28 p.m. ET\n\nA federal appeals court panel in New Orleans has dealt another blow to the Affordable Care Act, agreeing with a lower-court judge that the portion of the health law requiring most people to have coverage is unconstitutional now that Congress has eliminated the tax penalty that was intended to enforce it.\n\nBut it is sending the case back to the lower court to decide how much of the rest of the law can stand in light of that ruling.\n\nThat likely means the fate of the law will not be settled before the 2020 election.\n\nThe stakes could not be higher. The case is widely expected to end up at the Supreme Court. California Attorney General Xavier Becerra, who is leading a coalition of states defending the health law, announced Wednesday night that he would appeal to the high court immediately. And if the high court — which has upheld the ACA twice since its original passage in 2010 — agrees with the appeals court, the decision could upend the nation's entire health care system.\n\nIt's time to get rid of the uncertainty, Becerra told reporters at a news conference. Americans don't need to be jerked around when it comes to their health care.\n\nHanging in the balance is not only health coverage for the roughly 20 million Americans who are directly served by the ACA, but also hundreds of millions more whose health care and coverage have been affected by the thousands of changes that the ACA made to federal law. Those include provisions as wide-ranging as changes in Medicare drug copayments, requirements for calorie counts on menus, a pathway for approval of generic copies of expensive biologic drugs and, perhaps most important politically, protections for people with preexisting conditions.\n\nThe requirement for coverage, often referred to as an individual mandate, was inserted in the law to give insurers a wide pool of customers since they were now required to cover people with chronic medical conditions.\n\nConcerns about losing that guaranteed coverage for preexisting conditions was a potent argument of the Democrats when they made big gains in the 2018 midterm elections.\n\nPresident Trump heralded the court's decision, saying that he has long asserted that the individual mandate, by far the worst element of Obamacare, is unconstitutional. He said overturning the mandate will not alter the current health care system and said his administration will work to protect guarantees of coverage for people with medical problems. But he didn't give any specifics of how that would work.\n\nMeanwhile, Democrats point out that the law has been working fine without the tax penalty – which was officially eliminated at the beginning of this year. They say that means, by definition, that the mandate is not necessary for the function of the rest of the law.\n\nIn the court's decision, two of the three judges on the panel agreed with the plaintiffs in the case, who wanted the law struck down. Judge Jennifer Walker Elrod wrote that the individual mandate is unconstitutional because it can no longer be read as a tax, and there is no other constitutional provision that justifies this exercise of congressional power.\n\nBut at the same time, the appeals court majority declined to say how much else of the law can remain. Instead, it ordered the lower court to employ a finer-toothed comb ... and conduct a more searching inquiry into which provisions of the ACA Congress intended to be inseverable from the individual mandate.\n\nThe third judge on the panel, Carolyn Dineen King, disagreed with both the lower court and the other two judges. In her dissent, she wrote that sending the case back to the lower court will unnecessarily prolong this litigation and the concomitant uncertainty over the future of the healthcare sector.\n\nReaction to the appeals court decision mostly broke along ideological lines.\n\nDemocrats were angry.Tonight's ruling is a sharp reminder to Americans that a heartless lawsuit supported by Congressional Republicans and President Trump is why vital health care protection, especially protections for people with pre-existing conditions, are in grave danger, said a statement from Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer.\n\nConservatives were pleased. Today's decision reminds us that Obamacare has been on shaky ground since its creation, said Marie Fishpaw of the conservative Heritage Foundation. Patients deserve better than the high costs, limited choices and narrow provider networks that Obamacare brought to the health care system.\n\nBut many Republicans also know that if the law is struck down, it could cause major repercussions to the health system. Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) said in a statement that while he was satisfied that the individual mandate itself might be unconstitutional, I am not aware of a single senator who said they were voting to repeal Obamacare when they voted to eliminate the individual mandate penalty.\n\nA group of Republican governors and state attorneys general filed the case, Texas v. United States, in early 2018. They charged that when Congress eliminated the financial penalty for not having insurance as part of its 2017 tax bill, it rendered the rest of the health law moot. That is because the 2012 Supreme Court decision upholding the law said it was the tax that made the law constitutional, since the ACA relied on appropriate taxing powers given to Congress through the Constitution.\n\nLegal scholars on both sides say that the high court's logic is flawed, but in December 2018, U.S. District Judge Reed O'Connor, of the Northern District of Texas, ruled the entire law unconstitutional.\n\nThe Trump administration, meanwhile, has taken several positions on the case. Last year, it told the lower court it did not believe eliminating the tax required the entire law to be declared void.\n\nBut Justice Department officials said they supported striking down the provisions of the law most closely tied to the tax penalty: the ones requiring insurance companies to sell coverage to people with preexisting health conditions and not charge them more.\n\nThose are among the most popular provisions of the law. Democrats' success in taking back the House in last year's midterm elections was largely credited to consumers' fears of losing that provision when Republicans threatened to repeal the health law in 2017.\n\nAfter the lower-court ruling, however, the administration decided to support the GOP plaintiffs. In March, a Justice Department spokeswoman said officials had determined that the district court's comprehensive opinion came to the correct conclusion and will support it on appeal.\n\nThat left a group of Democratic state attorneys general to defend the law, led by California's Xavier Becerra, along with the U.S. House of Representatives — which voted in January, after Democrats formally took over the majority, to join the lawsuit.\n\nBut in July, the Trump administration's position shifted again. In a filing with the court, its attorneys argued that perhaps the health law should be invalidated only in the GOP states that are suing, rather than in all states. It is unclear how that would work.
Why An ER Visit Can Cost So Much — Even For Those With Health Insurance\n\nTERRY GROSS, HOST:\n\nThis is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. You wouldn't believe what some emergency rooms charge, or maybe you would because you've gotten bills. For example, one hospital charged $76 for Bacitracin antibacterial ointment. One woman who fell and cut her ear and was given an ice pack but no other treatment was billed $5,751. My guest, Sarah Kliff, is a health policy journalist at vox.com who spent over a year investigating why ER bills are so high even with health insurance and why the charges vary so widely from one hospital to the next.\n\nThrough crowdsourcing, she collected over a thousand ER bills from around the country. She interviewed many of the patients and the people behind the billing. She's reported her findings in a series of articles on Vox. She's also spent years reporting on the battle over health insurance policy. We'll get some updates on the state of Obamacare a little later in the interview.\n\nSarah Kliff, welcome back to FRESH AIR. Why did you want to do an investigation into emergency room billing?\n\nSARAH KLIFF: You know, I wanted to do this because the emergency room is such a common place where Americans interact with the health care system. There are about 140 million ER visits each year. It's a place where you can't really shop for health care. You can't make a lot of decisions about where you want to go. So I think that is big-picture what got me interested.\n\nSmall picture was actually a bill that someone sent me almost three years ago now, where they took their daughter to the emergency room. A Band-Aid was put on the daughter's finger, and they left. And they got a $629 bill. And they said - you know, they - the parents sent this to me, saying, how could a Band-Aid cost $629? And I said, I don't know, but I'm going to find out. And that kind of opened up the door to this, you know, multi-year project I've been working on right now. It started with trying to figure out why a Band-Aid would cost $629.\n\nGROSS: OK. So let's get to that $629 for treatment that was basically a Band-Aid placed on a finger. You investigated that bill.\n\nKLIFF: Yes.\n\nGROSS: Why'd it cost so much?\n\nKLIFF: So what cost so much was really the facility fee. So this is a charge I hadn't heard about before as a health care reporter. This is a charge that hospitals make for just keeping their doors open, keeping the lights on, the cost of running an emergency room 24/7. So if you look at that particular patient's bill, the Band-Aid - you know, I hesitate to say only - but the Band-Aid only cost $7, which, as anyone who's bought Band-Aids knows, is quite expensive for a single Band-Aid.\n\nBut the other $622 of that bill were the hospital's facility fees for just walking in the door and seeking service. And these fees are not made public. They vary wildly from one hospital to another. And usually patients only find out what the facility fee of their hospital is when they receive the bill afterwards, like that patient, you know, that sent me this particular bill.\n\nGROSS: And does the facility fee vary from facility to facility?\n\nKLIFF: It does significantly. You know, I've seen some that are in the low hundreds. I've seen some that are in the high thousands. And it's impossible to know what facility fee you're going to be charged until you actually get the billing documents from your hospital. And if you try and call up a hospital and ask what the facility fee is, usually you won't get very far.\n\nSo it's this fee that, from all the ER bills I've read, is usually the biggest line item on the bill. But it's also one that is very, very difficult to get good information about until you've already been charged.\n\nGROSS: So you're paying the facility fee to basically share in the cost of running the emergency room.\n\nKLIFF: Yes, that's how hospital executives would describe the fee.\n\nGROSS: But you don't know that when you're going to the emergency room.\n\nKLIFF: You don't, no. And you don't know how much it'll be. You don't know how it's being split up between different patients. You don't know any of that.\n\nGROSS: So is this also why one bill had $60 for the treatment of ibuprofen and another $238 for the treatment of eyedrops?\n\nKLIFF: Yeah. And, you know, this is something I see all the time reading emergency bills - I've read about 1,500 of them at this point - is that things you could buy in a drugstore often cost significantly more in the emergency room. And the people I talked to who run hospitals will say this is because they have to be open all the time. They have to have so many supplies ready.\n\nBut I think one of the things that I find pretty frustrating is, you know, patients aren't usually told, we can give you an ibuprofen here, or you can pick some up at the drugstore if you leave, and the cost will be a fraction of what we would charge you here. That information often isn't conveyed to patients who are well enough, you know, to go to a drugstore on their own. But it's just huge variation for these simple items.\n\nOne place I see this a lot is pregnancy tests. If you're a woman who's of childbearing age, you go to the emergency room, they will often want to check if you're pregnant. I've seen pregnancy tests that cost a few dollars in emergency room. The most expensive one I saw was over $400. I believe that was at a hospital in Texas. It's just widespread variation for, you know, some pretty simple pieces of medical equipment.\n\nGROSS: I want to get back to the $60 ibuprofen. Is that - does that include the facility fee? Or is that just for the ibuprofen, and the facility fee is separate?\n\nKLIFF: That's just for the ibuprofen. The facility fee is totally separate.\n\nGROSS: So how do they justify that?\n\nKLIFF: They say they have to stock, like, a wide array of medicine, so they have to have everything on hand from ibuprofen, from, you know, expensive rabies treatments - I've talked to a lot of people who've been to the emergency room for exposure to bats and raccoons - and that they need to have all these things in stock. And, you know, one of the things you pay for at the emergency room is the ability to get any medication at any hour of the day right when you need it. I don't necessarily buy that explanation, to be clear. That's what I've heard from hospital executives.\n\nI think it's pretty telling that ibuprofen has a very, very different price depending on which emergency room you go to. The fact that there's so much widespread price variation suggests to me that it's not just the cost of doing business driving it, that there's also business decisions being made behind ibuprofen that are driving the prices different hospitals are setting.\n\nGROSS: Now, of course, trips to the emergency room aren't always as simple as getting a Band-Aid or ibuprofen or some eyedrops. I want you to describe the case of a young man who was hit by a pole on a city bus in San Francisco.\n\nKLIFF: Yeah. So this patient, his name is Justin. He was a community college student in northern California, was walking down a sidewalk in downtown San Francisco one day. And there was a pole hanging off the back of the bus that wasn't where it's supposed to be. It essentially flew off the back of the bus, hit him in the face and knocked him unconscious.\n\nAnd the next thing he knows, he's waking up at Zuckerberg San Francisco General, which is the only Level I trauma center in the city. He ends up needing a CT scan to check out some brain injuries. He needs some stitches. And then he's discharged. He ends up with a bill for $27,000.\n\nBut, you know, as I began figuring out through my reporting, San Francisco General does not contract with private insurance, and they end up pursuing him for the vast majority of that bill. He has $27,000 outstanding. And somewhat ironically, San Francisco General, it is the city hospital. It is run by the city of San Francisco. So this student is hit by a city bus, taken by an ambulance to the city hospital and ends up with a $27,000 bill as a result.\n\nGROSS: So did he have insurance?\n\nKLIFF: He did. He had insurance through his dad.\n\nGROSS: So why doesn't Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital contract with private insurers?\n\nKLIFF: So what they have told me when I've talked to some spokespeople there is that they are a safety net hospital, and that is, you know, definitely true. They generally serve a lower-income, often indigent population in San Francisco that would have trouble getting admitted and seeking care at other hospitals in the city. So they have told me that their focus is on serving those patients and that therefore, you know, they're not going to contract with private insurance companies.\n\nThe thing I found a little bit confusing about that, though, is there are lots of public hospitals, say, that, you know, also serve low-income populations. And some of them for their inpatient units, you know, for their scheduled surgeries, they're not going to contract with private insurance because they want to make sure beds are available for the publicly insured folks and people on Medicaid and Medicare.\n\nBut when it comes to the emergency room, you know, every other public hospital I was in touch with would contract with private insurers there because people don't decide if they're going to end up in the emergency room. So, you know, that's the justification they offered, that it is a hospital meant to serve those with public insurance. But it is not something you see public hospitals typically doing.\n\nGROSS: Isn't - I think legislation was proposed in California to change that. Did that pass?\n\nKLIFF: It's still pending in the California State Assembly. And the hospital has also promised to reform its billing practices, although we haven't seen what exactly their new plan is yet.\n\nGROSS: So the position that Justin was in is that, like, he's unconscious. He's not asking to be taken anyplace. (Laughter) But he's unconscious. He's taken to the emergency room and ends up getting this $27,000 bill. I mean, that just seems so unfair, especially since he has insurance.\n\nKLIFF: Yeah.\n\nGROSS: Like, it's supposed to cover him for things like that (laughter).\n\nKLIFF: Yeah. You know, there's one other patient who kind of makes this point really well who was also seen at San Francisco General. Her name is Nelly. And she fell off a climbing wall and, somewhat amazingly, you know, turns out she had a concussion. But one of the first things she does is she calls her insurance's nursing hotline to ask, should I go to the ER?\n\nAnd they say yes. And she says, can I go to Zuckerberg San Francisco General? It's the closest. They say, no, don't go there. It's not in network. Go to another hospital. She gets to the other hospital, but the other hospital won't see her because she's a trauma patient. She fell from a really high height. And San Francisco General is the only trauma center in San Francisco. So she tries to go to an in-network hospital. She's then ambulance-transferred to Zuckerberg San Francisco General, and she ends up with another bill over $20,000 that the hospital was pursuing from her until I started asking questions from it, and the hospital ultimately dropped the bill.\n\nBut I think it's just such a frustrating situation for someone like Justin, for someone like Nellie (ph). They're either shopping for this good unconscious, they're really trying to do the right thing, and the health care system is just so stacked against the patient. It's so stacked for the hospital to be able to bill the prices that they want to bill.\n\nGROSS: So apparently, the moral of the story is if you want to challenge your emergency room bill, you should get Sarah Kliff to write about you. (Laughter).\n\nKLIFF: It's - (laughter). That's what some people have said. But there's only one of me, and there's about 2,000 bills in our database. And, you know, we have had over $100,000 in bills reversed as a result of our series. But I don't think it's a great way to run a health care system where we just, you know, the people who get their bills reversed are those who are lucky enough to have a reporter write a story about them.\n\nGROSS: Yes. Agreed. Let me reintroduce you. If you're just joining us, my guest is Sarah Kliff. She's a senior policy correspondent at Vox, where she focuses on health policy. She also hosts the Vox podcast, The Impact, about how policy actually affects people.\n\nSo we're going to take a short break, and then we'll talk more about emergency billing. And then later, we'll talk about what's left of Obamacare, and what the president and Congress and candidates are saying about health care, after this break. This is FRESH AIR.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ALEXANDRE DESPLAT'S SPY MEETING)\n\nGROSS: This is FRESH AIR. And if you're just joining us, my guest is Sarah Kliff. We're talking about emergency room billing and why it's so unpredictable and often so incredibly high. She's a senior policy correspondent at Vox, where she focuses on health policy. She also hosts the Vox podcast, The Impact, about how policy affects people.\n\nSo we were talking about the hidden facility fee, which most people don't know exists, and is responsible for a large chunk of a lot of emergency room bills. There's also, like, a trauma unit fee. It's a similar hidden fee in hospitals that have trauma centers in their emergency rooms. So explain the trauma fee and how that kicks in.\n\nKLIFF: Yeah. This is something I also had never heard of till I started reading a lot of emergency room bills, and this is the fee that trauma centers charge for essentially assembling a trauma team to meet you when you're coming in and those folks out in the field, maybe the EMTs, for example, have determined that you meet certain trauma criteria.\n\nSo I've talked to people who have been charged trauma fees who were in serious car accidents. One case was a baby who fell from more than 3 feet, and that's considered to trigger a trauma activation. So this is essentially the price for having a robust trauma team - a surgeon, an anesthesiologist, nurses - all at the ready to receive you when you get to the hospital.\n\nAnd again, these fees can be pretty hefty. San Francisco General, which, I've done the most reporting on their billing, you know, they can charge up to $18,000 for their trauma activation services. I wrote about one family who was visiting San Francisco from Korea when their young son rolled out of the hotel bed. They were nervous. They didn't know the American health care system well. So they called 911, which sent an ambulance, brought him over to the hospital. Turns out, he was fine. They gave him a bottle of formula. He took a nap and went home.\n\nAnd then a few months later, they get an $18,000 charge for the trauma team that assembled for when that baby came to the hospital. And these are another, you know, pretty significant fee that, again, you don't really know about. You have no idea that the trauma team is assembling to meet you when you're coming into the hospital. You just find out after the fact. And you also have no say in the decision to assemble trauma. That's really left up to the hospital, not the patient.\n\nGROSS: So I'm going to have you compare two possibilities. You go to an emergency room, and the bill is very high. There's two people who have the same problem who go to the emergency room. One of them has a copay. One of them has a high deductible that they haven't paid off yet. How are they treated differently, in terms of what they're billed for the emergency room visit?\n\nKLIFF: Well, the person with the deductible will likely be billed significantly more. You know, if they're just, let's say, at the start of the year, they are going to essentially have to bear the costs of that emergency room visit up until the point they hit their deductible and the insurance kicks in, whereas the person who has a co-payment, they're just going to have to pay that flat fee and, you know, probably not worry about paying more, but there's often surprise bills lurking in the corner that could affect both of those patients as well.\n\nGROSS: Like what?\n\nKLIFF: So one of the most common things we see is out-of-network doctors working at in-network emergency rooms. So you know, you have an emergency, you look up a hospital, you see their ER is in network, so you go there. It turns out that emergency room is staffed by doctors who aren't in your insurance. There's pretty compelling academic research that suggests 1 in 5 emergency room visits involves a surprise bill like that one.\n\nGROSS: That seems so unfair. How are you to know - if you're choosing a hospital that's in network, how are you to know whether the doctor treating you is in network or not?\n\nKLIFF: You know, you really - there isn't a great way to tell, to be honest. This is - you know, when I had to go to the emergency room over the summer, you know, this is something I worried about. You know, I was seeing a doctor who worked for the hospital, but they were sending off my ultrasound to be read by a radiologist who I was never going to meet. I couldn't ask them if they were in-network. I just kind of had to cross my fingers and hope for the best, and luckily, I didn't get a surprise bill.\n\nBut I've talked to multiple patients who, you know, tried to do their research, who thought they were in network, only to get a bill, often for thousands of dollars, after leaving the emergency room, from someone who, you know, never mentioned to them, hey, I'm not in your network like this hospital is.\n\nGROSS: So the bill that you'd get would be for the difference between what you pay when somebody is - when a doctor's in network and what you pay when they're not in network?\n\nKLIFF: Yeah, often it's just what that out-of-network doctor wants to charge. So a good example of this is a patient I wrote about in Texas named Scott (ph), who was attacked in downtown Austin, left on the street unconscious, some bystander called him an ambulance, and he woke up at a hospital. And one of the first things he does, because this is the United States, is he gets on his phone and tries to figure out which hospital he is at, and, you know, is that in his insurance network? And he finds out - good news - it is. And a surgeon comes by, tells him he's going to need emergency jaw surgery because of the attack that happened.\n\nSo he says, OK. You know, he's not really in a place to go anywhere. Gets the surgery. Goes home. A few weeks later, he gets an $8,000 bill from that oral surgeon, who the insurance companies paid a smaller amount. The oral surgeon didn't have a contract with the insurance and said, you know, I think my services are worth a lot more, so pursued the balance of the bill from Scott.\n\nGROSS: I have to say, I mean, that does seem unfair to the patient because they haven't been informed. They can't make a choice about it if they don't know. And, like, $8,000 is a lot of money.\n\nKLIFF: Yeah. And I think, you know, even more, let's say he did say he was out of network. It kind of puts the patient in an unfair situation, too. You know, one of the things we talk about a lot in health policy is, what if we had more transparency? What if we let patients know the prices? What if we let patients know who is in and out of network? And that - it would be a good step.\n\nBut, you know, I think with someone like Scott, sitting in a hospital with a broken jaw, there's not much you can do with that information. He doesn't have, you know, the ability to go home, like, research, like, make an appointment with a new surgeon. So, you know, it'd be great if he knew that the doctor was out of network. It'd be even better if he had some kind of protections against those type of bills.\n\nGROSS: What kind of protection could there be?\n\nKLIFF: So we're actually seeing a lot of action on this in Congress. There's some pretty strong bipartisan support for tackling this specific issue and essentially holding the patient harmless. When there is a situation like Scott's, for example, where there's this $8,000 bill, that's really a dispute between a health insurance company and a doctor, where the doctor says, I want more money, the insurer says, I want to pay you less money. And what Congress wants to do - what a few states have already done with their laws - is said, you can't go to the patient for that money. You, the hospital, and you, the health insurance company, you have to get down to a table and work things out together.\n\nAnd some state laws will set certain amounts that are allowed to be charged, other ones will force the insurance company and the hospital into an arbitration process. But the general concept is to take the patient out of this billing situation because, like you said, Terry, they really aren't in a position to negotiate. They aren't in a position to shop. They shouldn't be the ones who are left holding the bag at the end of the day.\n\nGROSS: My guest is Sarah Kliff. She covers health policy for Vox. After a break, we'll talk more about why ER bills can have some unpleasant surprises, and she'll give us an update on Obamacare. And Maureen Corrigan will review two books about forgotten stories from Hollywood. I'm Terry Gross, and this is FRESH AIR.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF JESSICA WILLIAMS TRIO'S KRISTEN)\n\nGROSS: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. Let's get back to my interview with journalist Sarah Kliff, who covers health policy and how it affects people for Vox. For the past year and a half, she's been writing about why emergency room visits can be so expensive and the pricing so secretive and mysterious, as well as inconsistent from one hospital to the next. She collected over 1,000 bills and tracked down stories behind the billing. She interviewed many of the patients and the people behind the billing to decipher why ER bills can have some surprise costs.\n\nHere's another surprise that often awaits people who go to emergency rooms - some insurance plans only cover true emergencies, and whether it is a true emergency is sometimes determined after the diagnosis is made. So how are you supposed to know before the diagnosis whether you're going to be categorized as a true emergency or not? Like, if you go to the hospital, you don't know if you have a broken bone or not.\n\nKLIFF: Right.\n\nGROSS: Somebody needs to X-ray it and tell you.\n\nKLIFF: Right. The whole point you go to the emergency room is to help them figure out what the emergency is and what treatment you need. This is a policy that the insurance company Anthem has been pioneering for a few years. It's been in Kentucky. It's been in Georgia - a few other states. And, you know, I wrote about one patient out in Kentucky named Brittany, who - she was having really severe abdominal pain. She called her mom who is a nurse, and the nurse said, that might be appendicitis. You've got to get to the emergency room. Turns out it wasn't appendicitis. It was an ovarian cyst. She got it treated elsewhere later down the line.\n\nAnd Anthem, you know, sent her a letter saying, we're not going to cover that visit because it was not a true emergency. She appealed it. Her appeal was denied. This is another one where, once I started asking them about it, the bill suddenly disappeared. But - and it seems like as Anthem has gotten more attention for this policy - they haven't announced it publicly, but some pretty compelling data The New York Times got their hands on suggest they've backed off this policy.\n\nBut it's just, you know - there are so many traps you can fall into going into an emergency room. It just feels like you're walking into this minefield, and this is kind of one of those mines that's lurking in there.\n\nGROSS: Hospital pricing and emergency room pricing seems to vary so much from hospital to hospital. Are there, like, national guidelines that help determine what a hospital or a hospital emergency room charges for services? I mean, who decides, and why is there such a variation?\n\nKLIFF: So hospital executives get to decide, and I think that is why there is such variation. There aren't really guidelines that they're following. You know, one thing you could do as a hospital executive - you could look at what Medicare charges - those prices are public - and, you know, maybe use that as a benchmark. There are some databases. There's one called FAIR Health, for example, where you could look and see, you know, some information on what local prices typically are. But in terms of, you know, what you want to charge, that's kind of up to you as someone running a hospital.\n\nOne of the things that's really, really unique about the United States, compared to our peer countries, is that we don't regulate health care prices. Nearly every other country in the developed world - they see health care something as, you know, akin to a utility that everyone needs, like electricity or water. It's so important that the government is going to step in and regulate the prices. That doesn't happen in the United States. You know, if you're a hospital, you just choose your prices. And, you know, that is, I think, why you see so much variation and why you see some really high prices in American health care.\n\nGROSS: So what advice do you have for people who actually need an emergency room and don't want to get hit with a shocking bill afterwards?\n\nKLIFF: Yeah, this is, you know, one of those questions - it just makes me a little frustrated that - 'cause this is the most common question I get - right? - is, how do I - how do we - how do I prevent a surprise bill? And I find it kind of upsetting that, you know, it has to be on the patient because honestly, there really isn't a great way to do this. I've talked to so many patients who tried so hard to avoid a big medical bill and weren't able to.\n\nYou know, there's certain things, yes, you can do. You can look up the network status of your hospital. You can try and badger each doctor you see about whether they are in network. You can try to be a really proactive patient, but I think that's just such a huge burden on people who are in, like, really emergent situations. And some people don't have that opportunity, you know, like Justin Zanders, the guy we were talking about earlier who was taken to a hospital while he was unconscious. I cannot think of anything he could've done to avoid that bill. It just was not possible.\n\nGROSS: So your advice is, good luck.\n\nKLIFF: Short of that, I mean, good luck. You know, I'm actually in the middle of reporting a story right now about people who have successfully negotiated down their bills. And, you know, you can certainly - if you do end up with a surprise bill, you can call up the hospital, see if there's a discount. Sometimes there will be. Sometimes there won't. You can call again. Customer service representatives - different ones - often offer you different discounts, I've learned from interviewing patients. You can ask for a prompt pay discount if you pay right away.\n\nYou can - you know, one health attorney who negotiates these a lot on behalf of patients - he says one of his favorite tactics is to choose the amount you want to pay; send a check with that amount; and in the note, write, paid in full; and hope they don't come after you after that. I have no idea if that works or not, but he says it works for his patients. But it's a mixed bag. And at the end of the day, the hospital has all the power. You can ask for discounts. You can ask nicely. You can ask angrily. It's up to the hospital if they want to grant you that or not.\n\nGROSS: So what is the status of Obamacare now? You know, Republicans promised to repeal and replace. That didn't work out. So have Republicans given up on repeal and replace?\n\nKLIFF: For the time, it seems pretty clear that repeal and replace is dead on arrival, especially with Democrats taking control of the House this year. Those proposals aren't being talked about as much. They're not really going anywhere. The one big thing we did see Republicans succeed at is repealing Obamacare's individual mandate, the requirement that all of us carry health insurance. That happened as part of the big tax package that passed at the end of 2017.\n\nSo we've seen, you know, President Trump, for example, essentially declare victory, declare that repealing the individual mandate is repealing Obamacare, so we're good on that goal. But, you know, generally, Obamacare is still standing. There are millions of people getting their coverage through the Affordable Care Act still today.\n\nGROSS: So now that there's no individual mandate, conservative attorney generals are challenging Obamacare - the Affordable Care Act - and saying it's no longer constitutional after Congress's repeal of the individual mandate. Could you explain that?\n\nKLIFF: Yeah, so this is a challenge that's come up through the courts in the past few months. Obamacare is constantly being challenged in court. It's been through multiple Supreme Court suits. This one - you know, it's a multiple-part argument, so I'll try my best to walk through it.\n\nGROSS: OK.\n\nKLIFF: So essentially, it starts with the fact that the individual mandate - they weren't quite able to repeal it for boring technical reasons. But what they were able to do is change the fee for not having health insurance from $700 to $0. So it - in all practical terms, it feels like repealing it because there is no fee for not carrying health insurance. The individual mandate was upheld as a tax when the Supreme Court said, yes, this is constitutional. The government has a right to tax people. Now that there is no fee associated with not carrying health insurance, the conservative attorneys general who are bringing this case argue that it's not a tax anymore, and therefore, it is not constitutional. That whole defense that John Roberts wrote in 2012 is moot. So that's the first part of it.\n\nThey go even further and say the individual mandate is so core to the Affordable Care Act, it is not severable. And if you, the courts, rule the individual mandate unconstitutional, then you need to rule all of Obamacare unconstitutional. And the first judge who heard this case - he is a, you know, judge in a district court in Texas. He agreed with them. He agreed that - first step - that the individual mandate is no longer constitutional. And second step, that means that the entirety of Obamacare has to fall. This is now being appealed up to the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals.\n\nAnd I will say there are a lot of critics of this case. There are a lot of people who were parties to previous Supreme Court challenges to Obamacare who think this is a bad legal argument and that it will not succeed. But it is already, you know, gone through the district court level. It's moving up to the appellate court level. It is something that is in the mix that could become a threat to the Affordable Care Act.\n\nGROSS: Well, if it goes to the Supreme Court, it would be very interesting to see what Justice Roberts says since he voted for the ACA, saying that the individual mandate was a tax.\n\nKLIFF: Yeah. You know, and I think where some legal scholars would see it shaking out is that the - someone like John Roberts, he might agree, OK, yeah, the individual mandate is unconstitutional, but would not make the leap to the second half of this, that the rest of the law has to fall.\n\nI think one of the most compelling arguments against this case is that Congress knew what they were doing when they repealed the individual mandate. You know, they had the opportunity to repeal Obamacare. They didn't. They'd specifically took aim at this one specific part. So it feels like it might be a bit of a reach to argue that what Congress really meant to do was repeal all these other parts of the Affordable Care Act. But, you know, the Supreme Court is changing. We have a new justice. You know, we have a lot in the mix. So it's always an open question of how a decision like this could go.\n\nGROSS: So correct me if I'm wrong here - the Department of Justice has sided with the conservative attorneys general who are challenging Obamacare, saying it's no longer constitutional, and I think that the Justice Department is also asking the judge to strike down the ACA's mandatory coverage of pre-existing conditions.\n\nKLIFF: Yeah, that's right. So it's a kind of unusual situation. Usually, it's the Justice Department that is going to defend a federal law in court. But, you know, given the Trump administration's opposition to the Affordable Care Act, they have decided to side with the conservative attorneys general. They have a slightly different argument. They don't think all of Obamacare should fall if the mandate falls, but they do think some big parts, like you mentioned, the protections for pre-existing conditions, should be ruled unconstitutional if the mandate falls.\n\nSo this has led to a bit of an unusual situation where you've had this coalition of Democratic attorneys general step in and take over the case, basically saying that the federal government is going - is not going to defend the Affordable Care Act. We are going to defend the Affordable Care Act. So you have this coalition of Democratic attorneys general, led by the attorney general of California, stepping in and, you know, offering a defense as this case works its way up through the court system.\n\nGROSS: Let's take a short break here, and then we'll talk some more. If you're just joining us, my guest is Sarah Kliff. She's senior policy correspondent at Vox, where she focuses on health policy. And she hosts the Vox podcast The Impact, about how policy actually affects people. We'll be right back. This is FRESH AIR.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF THE WEE TRIO'S LOLA)\n\nGROSS: This is FRESH AIR. And if you're just joining us, my guest is Sarah Kliff, senior policy correspondent at Vox, where she focuses on health policy.\n\nDo you think health insurance is shaping up to be a big issue in the 2020 campaign?\n\nKLIFF: I do, and I think it's going to be a big issue both in the primary, where you're already seeing candidates get pressed on, should we still have private health insurance, and giving pretty different answers to that question.\n\nAnd then I think one of the things you're also going to see is whoever is the Democratic nominee is probably going to run on Obamacare. They are going to point at the fact that President Trump tried to repeal the Affordable Care Act. That's pretty different than, you know, the 2012 election, where Democrats were pretty scared to run on Obamacare. It still wasn't popular. The benefits hadn't rolled out. In this past midterm and now again in the 2020 election, it seems pretty clear that Democrats are pretty excited to point out that Republicans wanted to repeal Obamacare. So I think it really will come up.\n\nGROSS: What are some of the biggest falsehoods you've heard from politicians about health insurance costs or health insurance policy?\n\nKLIFF: You know, one of the ones that's come up a lot is actually around the role of private health insurance. So I've - I don't know if it counts as a falsehood, but I think it's a bit of a misunderstanding of how health insurance often works is, you know, when I talk to single-payer supporters, most of them want to eliminate private insurance completely. They just don't think there is a role for it in the health care system.\n\nAnd one of the things I think that's actually pretty interesting, when you look at any other country - you look at Canada, you look at the U.K., you look at France, which all have national health care systems - all of them have a private health insurance market, too. There are always some kind of gap in the system that the public insurance can't cover, where the government step - where the private industry steps in and offers coverage. In Canada, for example, their public health plan doesn't cover prescription drugs, so two-thirds of Canadians take out a private plan, often through their employer, like us, to cover prescription drugs, to cover their eyeglasses, to cover their dental. So I think that's a confusion I see a lot in the Medicare for All debate coming up right now.\n\nI think the other thing I see a lot of confusion around - and we've talked about this a little bit with emergency room billing - is the role of transparency in health care. I see a lot of, you know, if we just made the prices public, like, that is what we need to do to fix the system, and I think that really misses the fact that, even if the prices were public, health care is so different from everything else we shop for. It might be - I think it is the only thing we purchase when we are unconscious.\n\nGROSS: (Laughter).\n\nKLIFF: And when you're unconscious, you're not really going to be great at price shopping. So I see that as, you know, a halfway solution that I often hear talked about here in Washington that would be great but is not going to suddenly result in, you know, prices dropping because they've been exposed in a spotlight.\n\nGROSS: Is there a country that you think has a good health care model that we could borrow?\n\nKLIFF: Oh, yeah. I've been thinking about this a lot lately actually. So I've gotten very interested in the Australia health care system, which is a little far away. But I think they're a really interesting model because they have a public system, everyone's enrolled in it, but they also really aggressively try and get people to buy a private plan, too, and that private plan will get you sometimes faster access to doctors, maybe a private room at a hospital.\n\nIt's really hard for me to see the U.S. creating a health care system, similar to Canada's actually, where you can't buy private insurance, where if you're rich or you're poor, everyone waits in the exact same queue, you can't jump to the front of the line. Because I think wealthier Americans have gotten so used to having really good access to health care that they would be very upset with a system like that.\n\nI think Australia is a kind of interesting hybrid between, you know, where we're at in the U.S. right now and what Canada is like, where it says, yes, we're going to create a public system for everybody, but we're also going to have these private plans that compete against the public system. So I've become increasingly, you know, interested in how Australia's system works. And they have - about 47 percent of Australians are buying a private plan to cover the same benefits that the public plan does.\n\nGROSS: So it's not supplemental. It's instead of.\n\nKLIFF: Right. So it's very different from Canada. So in Canada, you can buy complementary insurance, you know, to cover the benefits the public plan doesn't but the government expressly outlaws supplemental insurance. You know, like, what people buy here to cover the gaps in Medicare, that is not allowed. You cannot buy your way to the front of the line in Canada.\n\nOne of my favorite sayings about the Canadian health care system is from a doctor in a book I read about Canadian health care is they said, you know, we're fine waiting in lines for health care in Canada as long as the rich people and the poor people have to wait in the exact same line. Their system is all about equality. And I just don't know that we're at a place as a country where we value the same sort of equality in our health care system.\n\nGROSS: Is there any developed country around the world that has a system similar to ours with all these competing insurance companies and, you know, some government plans and, like, a thousand different bureaucracies that doctors have to deal with and that patients have to deal with?\n\nKLIFF: Absolutely not. There's nothing like it. I mean, our system is so unique. I'd say the closest but it's not even close are a few countries that have national health care systems, but they do it through tightly regulated private health insurance plans. So if you look at, like, Netherlands or Israel, there isn't a government-run plan. Instead, in both countries, you actually have four tightly regulated health insurance plans that compete against each other for the citizens' business. I guess that's the closest, but that is so different from what we have here right now. There's really nothing like it in any developed country.\n\nGROSS: Sarah Kliff, thank you so much for talking with us.\n\nKLIFF: Well, thank you for having me.\n\nGROSS: Sarah Kliff covers health policy for Vox, where you'll find her series about emergency room bills.

Enlarge this image toggle caption Susan Walsh/Pool/Getty Images Susan Walsh/Pool/Getty Images\n\nDemocrats opposed the current Supreme Court confirmation process even before they knew Judge Amy Coney Barrett would be President Trump's nominee.\n\nRepublicans reneged on their earlier stance not to consider a Supreme Court vacancy ahead of an election, Democrats have argued, and they say the choice to do so will damage the Senate's credibility and that of the high court.\n\nYou are moving ahead with this nomination because you can. But might does not make right, said Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., on Thursday. In your hearts, you know that's what's happening here is not right ... history will haunt this raw exercise of power.\n\nIn 2016, Republicans used their majority in the upper chamber to deny then-President Barack Obama a Supreme Court nominee, waiting until after Donald Trump had been elected and he could submit a name of his own. And although senators including the Judiciary Committee's chairman, Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., had suggested they wouldn't do that again, they are.\n\nThis is not on the level, said Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del.\n\nThen there is the nominee herself, whom Democrats call too hostile to health care and other issues they've made a priority.\n\nIn Democrats' telling, Trump and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., need Barrett confirmed as soon as possible so she will be in position to hear arguments in a case in November that could affect the Affordable Care Act.\n\nRepublicans haven't been able to throw out the law, also known as Obamacare, through action in Congress — but with Barrett, they could try again, her critics say.\n\nRepublicans' discussion about Barrett's humility, her dependence on texts, her interpretation of judicial doctrine — that is a smokescreen, said Sen. Mazie Hirono, D-Hawaii.\n\nShe, Coons, Blumenthal and the other Judiciary Committee members warn that the Barrett-era Supreme Court could be consequential across a number of other issues, too, and they cited Barrett's unwillingness to give substantive answers about climate change, voting practices and even Trump's claim about his power to pardon himself.\n\nBarrett, invoking former Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, whose seat she would take, argued that it would be inappropriate for her to talk in detail about policy matters she might confront on the court. Democrats hear that as an alarm bell for their priorities — albeit one they're not in a position to do anything about.\n\nThere has been little tension about Barrett's nomination since a sufficient number of members of the Senate majority suggested they would go along generally and support her specifically, and she appears on track to be confirmed.\n\nThe Senate Judiciary Committee's ranking member, 87-year-old Dianne Feinstein of California, once hoped to preside as chairwoman over a slate of nominees offered by President Hillary Clinton. On Thursday, Feinstein lamented the turn that history took instead.\n\nThese are lifetime appointments. They last for decades. What is done here will affect policies long after our lifetimes end, she said. There's never been a situation quite like this.
Democrats Debate Health Care And Other Issues At Miami Forum\n\nAt the first night of the debate, one issue where there were clear differences was where the Democratic presidential contenders stood on health care.\n\nSTEVE INSKEEP, HOST:\n\nModerator Lester Holt got the candidates last night to put a difference in health insurance on display.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nLESTER HOLT: Who here would abolish their private health insurance in favor of a government-run plan? - just a show of hands to start out with.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nINSKEEP: OK, two candidates raised their hand, saying they wanted to abolish private health insurance - Elizabeth Warren and Bill de Blasio. Some others did not, meaning private insurance would stay. NPR political reporter Danielle Kurtzleben has been following this story. She's in our studios.\n\nGood morning.\n\nDANIELLE KURTZLEBEN, BYLINE: Hey, Steve.\n\nINSKEEP: Did you learn something in that moment?\n\nKURTZLEBEN: Yeah. I mean, listen. What that moment was for me was really important for two big reasons. One is that it was a sort of change in tone for Elizabeth Warren, who was at center stage. All eyes were on her. She has co-sponsored a Medicare for All bill, the one that Senator Bernie Sanders has introduced. But in interviews, she had been kind of loose on how to get there. She would say, you know, first, we have to stabilize the Affordable Care Act - or Obamacare. And then she would say, you know, there are multiple paths to get to Medicare for All.\n\nWell, last night, she was definitive. Everybody was watching. And her hand went straight up. She said not only that, yes, I would be willing to abolish private insurance, which would be - which would virtually happen under Medicare for All - but she said, I'm with Bernie, which is important at a time that she's battling him for progressive voters.\n\nINSKEEP: I'm remembering during the Obamacare debate, President Obama got in trouble because he said if you like your current health plan, you can keep it - turned out not to be true in all cases. Now you have candidates saying, no matter what you think of your plan, it's going to be a government plan. Is this where voters are at the moment?\n\nKURTZLEBEN: No. I mean, not necessarily. It depends on the voter, of course. But, I mean, listen. Looking at Democratic voters, you see a really interesting thing in the polling. You do have some who are in favor of Medicare for All. But one thing the polling also shows is that they don't necessarily know what it means. And when you say to voters, OK, do you support Medicare for All? - and also, it might mean that you would lose your private insurance. Suddenly, support very much drops. So this is a potentially big political risk that a candidate takes if they say that.\n\nINSKEEP: The public option is an easier sell, I guess, because it sounds like people can get whatever they want.\n\nKURTZLEBEN: Yes. And you have multiple people on the stage last night who were saying that Beto O'Rourke and Amy Klobuchar are a couple who have been pretty vocal in favor of public options.\n\nINSKEEP: Danielle, thanks for the insights - really appreciate them.\n\nKURTZLEBEN: Thank you.\n\nINSKEEP: NPR's Danielle Kurtzleben.\n\nCopyright © 2019 NPR.

What A Democratic House Could Mean For Trump's Legislative Agenda\n\nMICHEL MARTIN, HOST:\n\nIn the days after the midterm elections, one big question has been answered. Republicans will continue to run the Senate. But, come January, Democrats will run the House. Still up in the air - what this all means for the Trump administration's legislative agenda. So we called someone we think can speak to the challenge even if it isn't on his plate anymore. That is Marc Short. He is the former director of legislative affairs for the Trump administration. He left that position this past summer to become a senior fellow at the Miller Center at the University of Virginia. He does some other things, but he's kind enough to join us here in our studios in Washington, D.C.\n\nWelcome. Thank you so much for joining us.\n\nMARC SHORT: Thank you for having me, Michel.\n\nMARTIN: So this certainly isn't the first time, you know, that a White House has had to deal with a House majority of a different political ideology. You know, most recently President Obama had to navigate a Republican Congress after his first couple of years in the White House. So I wondered if you took any lessons from how that played out in thinking about how you planned the legislative work at the White House those first two years. For example, did you front-load the legislative agenda thinking that this might happen?\n\nSHORT: I don't know how much we front-loaded it, Michel. I will tell you that I sat down with people who'd served in the Obama Administration of Legislative Affairs so I could get guidance and advice from them. And that was incredibly helpful as to how we should think through working with Congress. But, you know, the reality was that somewhere to the Obama administration, when they had control the first two years - that's when you saw the most significant amount of their legislative agenda accomplished.\n\nSo, for the Trump administration, obviously there's an effort to repeal Obamacare that we fell short on. But the tax reform agenda, the regulatory agenda, the confirmation of judges certainly were big things they were able to be accomplished on a partisan manner. As you say, the next couple years, it's a question of what can actually be accomplished in a bipartisan manner, which is a different equation entirely.\n\nMARTIN: What kind of conversations are they having right now in your old office?\n\nSHORT: I'm probably more bullish, Michel, in believing there's actually more that can get accomplished. I think that the president always had more affinity for the Democrat plan on infrastructure spending, and I think that's - could be a big opportunity for the next couple years. And I also think there's opportunity on drug pricing - that the president probably has some opinions that are more in line with Democrat thinking on that issue as well. Of course, though, the White House leg affairs team is going to be handling a lot of subpoenas for information or inquiries for investigations. And against that backdrop will be, what do Democrats in the House decide to do regarding investigations or potential impeachment hearings? And how does that impact the legislative agenda, too?\n\nMARTIN: But let's talk about how the Trump commission deals with its own caucus, the Republicans, at the moment. Because, as you just pointed out, there are issues on which the president says that he has more affinity with the Democrats' perspective than with a number of the Republican conservatives, for example - the sort of people who see themselves primarily as conservatives. They don't like those big stimulus packages. They don't want to see changes in the trade agreement with Mexico and Canada. So how do you deal with them?\n\nSHORT: So I think they're each a little bit different. Let's talk infrastructure for one second because I think, typically, Republicans have talked a good game about being concerned about spending, and we have a debt that's now over $21 trillion. But, in reality, when push comes to shove, Republicans haven't shown much more willingness to stop spending than Democrats have. And so when you have an infrastructure spending bill that actually would provide resources back to their home state, I think you could see an avenue where Republicans work with the president.\n\nKeep in mind as well that the president, I think, has more leverage now over the Senate because, in many cases, those members who won in this midterm cycle, I think, owe a lot of that victory to the president. And some of the president's biggest opponents among the Republicans in the Senate, whether or not it's the passing of John McCain and the retirement of Bob Corker, retirement of Jeff Flake, means he has a Republican conference that's more in line. So I think he has more leeway to say, hey, look - I've helped you. I need your help on this infrastructure package.\n\nMARTIN: And what about on big issues where the parties really do have very different philosophies about the way forward? I'm thinking about immigration. How do you navigate something like that? Or do they just say that, the next two years, nothing's going to happen? It's all going to be...\n\nSHORT: No.\n\nMARTIN: ...Executive orders and the courts.\n\nSHORT: I wouldn't say that. But I do have a caution there as far as optimism because I think that the immigration issue is one that certainly has pulled our two parties apart. And, big picture, I think there's an opportunity to say, I'll give you more leniency on giving a pathway to citizenship or guest worker programs if you give me border security, and everybody can talk about that. But when push comes to shove, and you get down in the details, the politics of each party begin to pull that apart.\n\nMARTIN: And before we let you go, now that you're out in the private sector, you have a different life. I mean, you still keep your hand in, obviously. Are you concerned about the tone of our public discourse now? Is it OK with you the way people are...\n\nSHORT: No.\n\nMARTIN: ...Talking to each other?\n\nSHORT: I think the tone has deteriorated, unfortunately. I think it's deteriorated across the board. I think it's deteriorated from the White House, but I think it's also deteriorated from Congress and - frankly, and deteriorated from the way the media covers the White House. So I think it's going to require people on all sides to have a new commitment to the way that we talk about these issues collectively.\n\nMARTIN: That's Marc Short, former White House director of legislative affairs, now a fellow at the University of Virginia's Miller Center. He was kind enough to join us here in Washington, D.C.\n\nThank you so much for talking to us.\n\nSHORT: Thanks for having me.\n\nCopyright © 2018 NPR. All rights reserved.

Critics Join Supporters On Trump's Florida Stop Of 'Thank-You' Tour\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump continued his Thank you tour in Florida Friday, where both Trump supporters and critics gathered.\n\nSCOTT SIMON, HOST:\n\nAnd NPR's Scott Horsley has been with Donald Trump, who's on a thank you tour. Last night, he spoke in Florida.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nDONALD TRUMP: Let's start off by saying Merry Christmas, everyone. Merry Christmas.\n\n(CHEERING)\n\nSCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: The line of Christmas evergreens behind Donald Trump looked a little out of place in this semi-tropical environment. But the president-elect seemed very much at home here in his adopted state in front of an adoring crowd at the Central Florida Fairgrounds. These are some of the voters who helped Trump carry Florida and its 29 electoral votes on the way to a White House victory that defied so many expert forecasts. Both Trump and his supporters love retelling that story and how the news media got it wrong.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nTRUMP: They're very dishonest. They have written very dishonestly about all of us. It's a movement like they've never seen before. And yet we won, folks. We won, right?\n\n(CHEERING)\n\nHORSLEY: That suspicion of a hostile news media spills over into post-election stories about Russian hackers, possibly directed by Vladimir Putin himself, who set out to interfere in the U.S. election and swing it in the direction of Donald Trump.\n\nBETH YOUNG: It's questionable. You know, the mainstream media - I don't trust them. I don't believe them. I haven't for a long time.\n\nHORSLEY: Beth Young (ph) of Ocala, Fla., says the cyberattacks on the Democratic National Committee and the Clinton campaign should be investigated. But she's not convinced the Russians are responsible, and she certainly doesn't think those hacks played a decisive role in the election.\n\nYOUNG: It's just more of the Clinton campaign trying to say, you know, she couldn't win on her own accord, so now she has to blame somebody else.\n\nHORSLEY: Some of Trump's Florida critics have seized on the hacking story, though. A small group of protesters gathered outside the fairgrounds, heckling Trump supporters as they came in.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MAN: Good job making Russia great again.\n\nHORSLEY: Grayson Lonzo (ph) notes Hillary Clinton actually outpolled Trump in this part of central Florida.\n\nGRAYSON LONZO: Orange County is our home, and he lost this county. This community rejected him and his ideals and the people who he supports. Because the election went their way doesn't mean they win forever.\n\nHORSLEY: Last night, though, protesters were far outnumbered by Trump supporters. Sean Tuthill (ph) of Crystal River is convinced the president-elect will bring good things to the country.\n\nSEAN TUTHILL: Like the thing I saw today on Facebook. He's a billionaire that gave up his cushy life to help us Americans. That's got to count for something. Our country is a big business. It needs to be run by people in business - period - not community organizers.\n\nHORSLEY: Trump reiterated his campaign promises to cut taxes, rollback regulations, repeal Obamacare and renegotiate trade agreements. In recent days, he's been alternating between these thank you rallies and meetings with his new Cabinet nominees, many of whom are wealthy businesspeople or retired military.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nTRUMP: You know, the media was saying, the people that are negotiating your trade deals are very rich. I said, but isn't that what we want?\n\n(CHEERING)\n\nTRUMP: And they said, why is it that the people protecting our border are generals? Because that's what we want. We want generals. We want generals.\n\nHORSLEY: Trump gloated a bit at the rally about being named Time magazine's Person of the Year, though he said he prefers the old title, Man of the Year. Trump added some of the credit should go to the often-maligned voters who turned out in such numbers to elect him.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nTRUMP: They're not so deplorable anymore. In fact, the other side's trying to figure out, well, in four years, how do we get some of these deplorable to our side, right?\n\nHORSLEY: There will be plenty of time to chew that over. For now, Trump and his team have an inauguration to plan, a government to organize and another thank you rally this afternoon in Mobile, Ala.

Democrats Push Back On Senate Republican Health Care Bill\n\nMany Democrats were encouraged that Republicans had to push off their vote on a Senate bill to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, in the midst of vocal opposition from the left.\n\nROBERT SIEGEL, HOST:\n\nSenators are leaving Washington for a week-long recess, but negotiations over a repeal of the Affordable Care Act continue. Democrats are trying to ramp up pressure against the repeal effort. NPR's Scott Detrow has more.\n\nSCOTT DETROW, BYLINE: When Senate Republican leaders delayed the vote on the Obamacare repeal, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer was quick to not declare victory.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nCHUCK SCHUMER: We're not resting on any laurels, nor do we feel any sense yet of accomplishment other than we are making progress because the American people are listening to our arguments.\n\nDETROW: Because this bill will pass or fail based on Republican votes, arguing is the most Democrats can do. Perhaps that's enough.\n\nMEAGHAN SMITH: Health care in general is a complicated policy, but for people to understand what this bill will do to them has been pretty simple.\n\nDETROW: Meaghan Smith is a strategist at PR firm SKDKnickerbocker. She's helping coordinate messaging for a number of progressive groups trying to block the health care repeal. Smith says activists are focusing on big-picture ideas like that the Republican bill would increase health care costs for many people.\n\nSMITH: You pay increased premiums, or your out-of-pocket health care costs go up dramatically.\n\nDETROW: As outside groups do that, Schumer and other senators are trying as best as they can to bring their arguments down to a scale people can relate to. At an event this week, every Democrat held up a big poster of a constituent facing a health care challenge.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nSCHUMER: And we ask you - those of you from local papers and outlets - to talk to your senators about the person that they are holding up.\n\nDETROW: As the debate has gone on, Democratic lawmakers keep returning to one main attack point. Here's New Jersey Senator Cory Booker.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nCORY BOOKER: Massive tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans - and to pay for that, we're taking away health care for millions and millions of Americans. It's just - it's as plain as that.\n\nDETROW: Booker orchestrated one of the Democrats' more viral moments on Monday. He sat down on the Capitol steps with Georgia Congressman John Lewis...\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nBOOKER: Let's take a seat.\n\nJOHN LEWIS: Take a seat?\n\nBOOKER: Yeah. Why don't we take a seat up here on the on the top here? And it's a beautiful day.\n\nDETROW: ...And began talking about the health care repeal. Other lawmakers joined in, and soon a crowd did, too.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nUNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: What do we want?\n\nUNIDENTIFIED CROWD: Health care.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: When do we want it?\n\nUNIDENTIFIED CROWD: Now.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: What do we want?\n\nDETROW: In the end, the livestream lasted about three and a half hours. That was followed up by another large Capitol rally, this one organized by Planned Parenthood and other groups. The big question is whether any of this matters. The bill has come this far despite low public opinion numbers. And the bill's fate comes down to a dozen or so Republican senators. That's why efforts by people like Stephanie Powell may be more important. Powell lives in Anchorage, Ala. And every morning at around 8 a.m., she calls Senator Lisa Murkowski's office.\n\nSTEPHANIE POWELL: I call her Anchorage office, Juneau office, Fairbanks office, her Washington office. I usually try to call the local number so they know I'm from here.\n\nDETROW: Powell says she voted for Murkowski, one of several key swing votes in the Senate. Powell says her family uses Medicaid. She tells staffers that on the rare moments her calls actually go through.\n\nPOWELL: They know more about my health history than maybe my own mother (laughter) at this point because I've been very upfront with them on what this means to us.\n\nDETROW: This gets at what's probably Democrats' best weapon and something Republicans successfully tapped into for several elections in a row. It's not hard to oppose a complicated legislative effort by focusing on how it could disrupt voters' lives.

Trump Administration To End Obamacare Subsidies For The Poor\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Nicholas Kamm/AFP/Getty Images Nicholas Kamm/AFP/Getty Images\n\nUpdated at 11:40 p.m. ET\n\nThe Trump administration said Thursday that it would end the Affordable Care Act's cost-sharing reduction payments designed to help low-income Americans get health care. Not paying the subsidies, health care experts have warned, could send the health insurance exchanges into turmoil.\n\nThe payments, which started under the Obama administration, had been continued by President Trump, despite his strong opposition to the ACA, also known as Obamacare. But the subsidies had never been funded by Congress, and the White House on Thursday said that because there was no appropriation for it, the Government cannot lawfully make the cost-sharing reduction payments.\n\nThe bailout of insurance companies through these unlawful payments is yet another example of how the previous administration abused taxpayer dollars and skirted the law to prop up a broken system, the White House said in a statement. Congress needs to repeal and replace the disastrous Obamacare law and provide real relief to the American people.\n\nThe decision ends speculation about whether the Trump administration would continue making the monthly payments to insurers. That money particularly helps people earning between 100 percent and 250 percent of the poverty level pay for the insurance and health care that they get through the exchanges set up by the Affordable Care Act.\n\nEnding the payments could cause premiums to spike, push insurers out of the marketplace and even cost the government $2.3 billion more in 2018 than it would otherwise spend, according to one analysis.\n\nIt was not clear when the payments, known as CSRs, would end.\n\nThe news was not received well by Democratic leaders on Capitol Hill. In a joint statement, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Senate Minority Leader Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., called the move a spiteful act of vast, pointless sabotage.\n\nSadly, instead of working to lower health costs for Americans, it seems President Trump will singlehandedly hike Americans' health premiums, the leaders said in a statement. Make no mistake about it, Trump will try to blame the Affordable Care Act, but this will fall on his back and he will pay the price for it.\n\nThe CSRs are a key part of keeping Obamacare working, but they have been threatened since 2014. That's when House Republicans filed a lawsuit against the Obama administration, arguing that the CSRs are unconstitutional because Congress had not appropriated the money — rather, the administration was paying the money on its own.\n\nThe judge ruled in Republicans' favor, but it was also decided that the payments could go on amid the appeals process.\n\nIn a statement issued shortly after Thursday's announcement, House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., said the decision preserves a monumental affirmation of Congress's authority and the separation of powers.\n\nObamacare has proven itself to be a fatally flawed law, and the House will continue to work with Trump administration to provide the American people a better system, Ryan said.\n\nThough the Trump had repeatedly threatened to end the payments (including in a July 29 tweet), the White House has until now maintained the Obama administration's appeal. That put the administration in the odd position of defending the previous administration's position on the CSRs — that is, that the CSRs are constitutional.\n\nThe D.C. circuit court hearing the appeal said that a group of 15 Democratic state attorneys general could intervene in the appeal. The rationale, the court said, is accumulating public statements by high-level officials, indicating that the White House might decide not to defend the CSRs.\n\nThe bottom line is that now, one avenue of ending the CSRs has closed for Trump, as University of Michigan law professor Nick Bagley explained in an Aug. 1 blog post.\n\nIf the Trump administration wanted to stop making cost-sharing payments, the easiest way to do so would be to dismiss the appeal. The lower court entered an injunction to stop those payments, but put its injunction on hold to allow for an appeal. If Trump were to order the appeal's dismissal, the injunction would spring into force, and the payments would end. Now the states can keep the appeal alive, even if Trump wants to get rid of it.\n\nBut then, the Trump administration could also simply say that it doesn't think the payments are constitutional — that could also end the subsidies.\n\nThose subsidies will cost around $7 billion in fiscal year 2017 and $10 billion in 2018, according to estimates from the Congressional Budget Office.\n\nIronically, the uncertainty the administration has sown surrounding the cost-sharing payments has exacerbated two problems for which the president often criticizes the Affordable Care Act — namely, high premiums and the exit of insurers from some of the marketplaces.\n\nWhile Trump and Capitol Hill Republicans say they despise Obamacare, it nevertheless presents them with a dilemma: Stripping out parts of it could not only please the GOP base but also make health care more expensive (or even unavailable) for many Americans — many who are located in states that Trump won.
What's At Stake For U.S. Health Policy With This Year's Midterm Elections\n\nThe midterm elections will determine which party controls the House and Senate for the next two years — and that could have a major effect on the future of U.S. health policy.\n\nARI SHAPIRO, HOST:\n\nObamacare won't be on ballots in next month's elections, but the fate of the 8-year-old health care law and other ambitious health care initiatives could be decided depending on which party wins control of Congress. NPR's Scott Horsley reports on what's at stake for health care in the midterms.\n\nSCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: Republican strategist Karl Rove recently wrote an op-ed about health care that was headlined The Sleeper Issue Of 2018. The alarm clock is about to go off. Voters like Lou Hendricks in Kansas City are telling pollsters health care is a defining issue as they get ready to cast their midterm votes.\n\nLOU HENDRICKS: One of the big concerns that we have as a family is making sure that there continues to be coverage for previous conditions.\n\nHORSLEY: Democratic Senator Claire McCaskill, who's in a tough battle for re-election in Missouri, is trying to tap into that concern. McCaskill describes her own struggle with breast cancer in a new campaign ad.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nCLAIRE MCCASKILL: I don't talk about it much, but those who face cancer and many other illnesses have a pre-existing condition when it comes to health coverage.\n\nHORSLEY: McCaskill blasts her Republican opponent, Josh Hawley, for joining a lawsuit that seeks to overturn Obamacare and its requirement that insurance companies offer coverage regardless of a person's medical history. Republicans insist they will protect patients with pre-existing medical conditions, though they've been vague in saying how.\n\nDemocrats around the country have seized on this issue. Erika Franklin Fowler, who directs the Media Project at Wesleyan University, says health care dominates congressional campaign ads, outpacing jobs, taxes and immigration.\n\nERIKA FRANKLIN FOWLER: Democrats have been laser-focused on health care this year.\n\nHORSLEY: It's the mirror image of what we saw in past election cycles when, Fowler says, Republicans ran a blitzkrieg of ads attacking Obamacare while Democrats stayed largely quiet.\n\nFRANKLIN FOWLER: Regardless of how Americans feel about the Affordable Care Act, there are provisions of it that are very popular. Once it became clear that those provisions are in trouble, I think that has sort of changed the landscape of how politicians will talk about it this cycle.\n\nHORSLEY: Democrats are determined to protect those popular provisions if they win one or both houses of Congress in November. On the other hand, if Republicans keep control, they could take another run at repealing Obamacare.\n\nVice President Jessica Anderson of the Conservative group Heritage Action says that could happen during the lame-duck session even if Republicans lose in November.\n\nJESSICA ANDERSON: Many Republicans want the ability to finish the job. They've campaigned on this for over eight years.\n\nHORSLEY: No matter which party controls Congress next year, Anderson says the Trump administration will likely keep trying to chip away at Obamacare. For example, the administration has already relaxed regulations, allowing stripped-down insurance policies with reduced coverage.\n\nANDERSON: The president will still be in office, and his administration will still be active in trying to find places to roll back harmful regs.\n\nHORSLEY: But Democrats might be able to put the brakes on some of those efforts if they win a majority in November. Drew Altman heads the Kaiser Family Foundation, a health care research organization.\n\nDREW ALTMAN: What you're likely to see is much greater and even fierce oversight of the administration's efforts to change and, many would say, undermine the ACA.\n\nHORSLEY: Lou Hendricks, the voter we heard from earlier, calls himself a fan of the Affordable Care Act even though he's a Republican. Hendricks, who's retired, used to get insurance through his employer. But more and more he's leaning towards a single-payer insurance system which progressive advocates like to call Medicare-for-all.\n\nHENDRICKS: It makes it easier and simpler for everybody with the exception of Aetna, Blue Cross Blue Shield - enter the medical insurance company here.\n\nHORSLEY: Even if they win a sweeping midterm victory, Democrats won't have the power to pass Medicare-for-all. But they might jumpstart the conversation ahead of the next election in two years. Scott Horsley, NPR News, Washington.\n\nCopyright © 2018 NPR. All rights reserved.

What Does The 'War' Over Obamacare Reveal About Our Governing Bodies?\n\nTERRY GROSS, HOST:\n\nThis is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross.\n\nObamacare, the Affordable Care Act, was passed in 2010. Since then, there have been many unsuccessful attempts by Republicans to kill it. The left has been pushing to have the government insure everyone directly through what's described as Medicare for All. Now this debate is happening during a pandemic, when health care is at the forefront of people's minds.\n\nMy guest, Jonathan Cohn, is the author of the new book The Ten Year War: Obamacare And The Unfinished Crusade For Universal Coverage. It's about the politics and special interest groups that shaped the Affordable Care Act, the ACA. He writes, figuring out how to fix American health care has never been entirely or even primarily about what kind of system would work best; it's also been about what kind of changes can actually survive the political process. His book focuses on that political process, dating back to the 1920s. He's been reporting on health care since the late '90s. He's a former senior editor at The New Republic and is now senior national correspondent at HuffPost, where he covers politics and policy and has been focusing lately on COVID.\n\nJonathan Cohn, welcome back to FRESH AIR. It's been a few years. Great to have you back.\n\nJONATHAN COHN: I'm so happy to be back on the show.\n\nGROSS: In the book, you describe the ACA as a highly flawed, distressingly compromised, woefully incomplete attempt to establish a basic right that already exists in every other developed nation. It's also the most ambitious and significant piece of domestic legislation to pass in half a century. It's not nearly good enough, and yet so much better than what came before.\n\nJonathan, having tracked the political process of health care legislation, do you now accept not nearly good enough as a giant step forward in a way that you wouldn't have had you not witnessed the difficulty of the political process of getting Obamacare passed?\n\nCOHN: Definitely. You know, when I started writing on health care, you know, back in the late 1990s and coming to this and seeing all the problems of our health care system, you know, of course, your mind starts to think, well, what kind of system should we have? And if you care about universal health care, if you think health care should be a right like it is in the rest of the world, you think, well, we need a system like that. And so your standard is getting to that system, some kind of national health insurance system where everybody is covered and no one really faces the prospect of financial hardship because they've gotten sick.\n\nThen, you know, I had a chance to actually watch the political process chew over this and see in real time how the idea of universal coverage gets translated into a proposal that then becomes a series of bills that then go through Congress that get signed and is being implemented and fighting resistance efforts at repeal. And, yeah, you get an appreciation for how hard this is. I mean, any kind of large-scale public policy reform is difficult. Health care reform is especially difficult. And I think it did give me some appreciation for the importance of partial success and partial victories, even when they don't accomplish everything you might want and even when there are big parts of them that you think, gosh, that's regrettable; I wish this looked different.\n\nGROSS: Do other countries that have national health care systems, including England, Canada, Europe - did they go through a similar political process with special interest groups and lobbies and everybody wanting their own thing in or their own thing out that ends in a big compromise in a complicated bureaucracy, or did they have another approach?\n\nCOHN: Every country is different. And the basic rule of thumb here is the earlier that you set up your health care system, the easier it is to do because you're operating - there's a blank slate. The pieces are not in place, and you can set it up in a way that seems rational and works for your country.\n\nThe longer it takes, as you go later on in history, well, now you've got a health care industry building up. There's doctors. There's hospitals. People have got their insurance arrangements in place. And inevitably, you're going to have to disrupt some of those things. You're going to have to take some money out of people's pockets and move it somewhere else. And that is very hard to do politically. And so it gets complicated.\n\nHere in the U.S., this is a big reason we've never gotten to fully universal coverage. Inevitably, it's going to - you know, to do it properly, to get everybody insurance, to make sure it's good insurance, to finance the system, get costs under control - one way or another, you know, you're going to be taking money away from the drug industry and from the hospital industry. You're going to be changing some people's insurance arrangements. And every one of those changes is a fight. It's a struggle. And it's just really hard to do.\n\nGROSS: And it ends up in a lot of compromise.\n\nCOHN: It does end up in a lot of compromise. And that is how the Affordable Care Act came to be and why it looks like it does.\n\nGROSS: So Republicans, you know, had been trying to defeat it before it was passed and continued, you know, after it was passed. Where do we stand now? It wasn't, to my knowledge, a major issue in the 2020 campaign. Have Republicans given up on trying to unravel or cancel Obamacare?\n\nCOHN: You know, I thought so many times the Republicans were done with fighting Obamacare and then proven wrong. I hate to say anything definitively. But it is very clear in the last two elections - the 2018 midterms to 2020 presidential election - Republicans did not emphasize Obamacare repeal and, in fact, did their best to convince people that they were not trying to take away protections for preexisting conditions, that they were not trying to take away Medicaid coverage I think because they learned after trying to repeal it and then the 2018 midterms that that is extremely unpopular, that the public does not want to give up what they got with the Affordable Care Act. And so I think Republicans are now much more reluctant to make a sort of frontal assault on it, which doesn't mean they don't think about health care.\n\nI'm sure we will continue to see them try to change the health care system in the same way they now try to change Medicare. I mean, they don't say they hate Medicare anymore like they - some - a lot of them did originally. But they're trying to privatize it. They're trying to cut its funding. I imagine that is where we are probably going.\n\nGROSS: So President Biden has undone some of Trump's undoing of the ACA. So what has Biden done so far to strengthen the ACA?\n\nCOHN: So on Day 1, the Biden administration got to work undoing changes that the Trump administration had made to the Affordable Care Act. You know, the Republican effort at repeal failed, but the Trump administration was very good at finding small, technical ways of changing the law so that, for example, the financial assistance that people got buying insurance was lower. And this involves things like adjusting the formula for actuarial value. And just sort of saying that phrase I think puts people to sleep, but it's important. And there are, you know, a dozen or so of these changes that the Trump administration made.\n\nAnd on Day 1, basically, the Biden administration came in and said, we're going to reverse these. We're going to change these. And actually, we're going to turn those dials back, and we're going to do things like fund outreach. So that's already underway. And that can all be done mostly through just pure executive authority. That's just changing regulations. It takes some time to do, but they don't need Congress.\n\nThe second thing, and this is part of - you know, there's a bill, the COVID relief bill, moving through Congress right now, the big one with the checks for people and the assistance for vaccinations. Inside that bill is a boost to the subsidies for people who are buying insurance at healthcare.gov or one of the state-run exchanges like Covered California.\n\nThis is something that the architects of the law always wanted to do but never had the power to do because I think they recognized early on the bill was underfunded, and there's just not enough assistance for people. People need more help buying insurance. So there would be more money for people who get subsidies now, and more people would become eligible for subsidies. People who make a little too much money to qualify for assistance now - they would get help, too. So that is in the bill. It's only temporary. That's the asterisk there. It's a two-year bump. So even if it becomes law, if they want to make that permanent, they would have to come back and extend it. But those are two very concrete steps that are now already in motion.\n\nGROSS: Does Biden have other plans to try to expand the ACA?\n\nCOHN: Well, you know, in his campaign, he talked about adding a public option. And people who remember the original debate about the Affordable Care Act remember this was a very big part of the original proposal and was a bit of a compromise to please progressives who, remember; for all - historically had always wanted something like, you know, what we call Medicare for All, a single-payer system, the government insuring everybody. Well, that wasn't in the cards politically.\n\nBut the idea was to have a sort of optional government-run program for people who want to go into it and that this program would, you know, would work like Medicare works and, because of that, you know, in principle, in theory, would be more efficient. It would be cheaper. So it'd be a cheaper option for people. And, also, it would, you know, introduce some new competition - right? - for the private sector 'cause if you're a private insurer and you're competing with this public insurance option that's cheaper, you're going to lower your rates, too. That did not make it into the bill. It is not part of the law. Biden has said he wants to have one of those.\n\nAnd interestingly, and this is important, it's an actually more ambitious version than the original in the sense that it would be open to anybody, even people who have employer insurance right now. He would basically say, if you want, you can jump over to that public option. And for that matter, you can also jump over to a private insurance plan that's subsidized through healthcare.gov if that's a better deal for you. And together, those two changes - that actually could deliver a lot of price relief. In other words, people would see - would be able to save money on their premiums for people who now have employer policies that are starting to get expensive and they're sweating out the premiums. So that could be a pretty big difference.\n\nGROSS: So this is a pretty broad question, but why did Republicans make health care coverage, government health care coverage such a big target? I mean, everybody wants health care. Of course, some people prefer to do it through private insurance, through employer insurance. But what were some of the motivations behind such strong Republican opposition? And, you know, how much of it do you think was ideological - you know, a belief that government should not be funding this? How much of it do you think was, like, you know, budget hawks saying, we just can't afford to spend this; it's a bad idea; we're going to go into debt? And how much of it was money, like lobbyists who, you know, support Republicans who didn't want the ACA to pass and threatened to withdraw their funding?\n\nCOHN: Let's start with the philosophy. I think philosophical differences are a big part of it. I mean, ever since we've been debating universal health care, conservatives have - in this country have fought it. And it makes sense given, you know, conservative views in this country. I mean, what don't conservatives - what does universal health care require? Well, it requires government spending. It requires either having the government displace the private insurance industry or regulate it very closely. And, of course, it was going to require finding new money to fund this through taxes. Well, conservatives - they don't like taxes. They don't like regulation. They don't like government spending. They don't like having the public sector do what the private sector could do. So you're going to always run into some resistance in this country up against conservatives.\n\nHaving said that, there was certainly a period not that long ago when you had a significant number of Republicans who, although generally, you know, they don't like taxes, they don't like regulation, nevertheless bought into the idea that we should have some kind of universal coverage system and really focus on, OK, well, how can we do this in a way that kind of fits what we prefer about how the world works? So maybe we do it through private insurance instead of public insurance. And we do - we don't make it so generous so it doesn't cost so much money. And you kind of go down the list.\n\nAnd, you know, what was interesting was the premise of the Affordable Care Act when they kind of got - when the Democrats got power was they hoped that they crafted a plan that they thought had a lot of those elements and that looked like things conservatives had praised before in the hopes that that would get at least some Republican buy-in. And, of course, it didn't. And I think that's where you get into the other factors at play. Some of this was the Republican Party, the conservative movement in this country became more extreme in its opposition to the welfare state. And, you know, and this was a sort of ongoing change. A lot of this - you know, and then amplified by groups funded by the Koch brothers, for example.\n\nAnd then some of this was, frankly, just about opposing the Democrats, opposing Obama. And, you know, that's a whole other conversation - well, why was the opposition to Obama so intense? - and something I try to talk about in the book. But I always say, you know, I'm not surprised that Republicans generally opposed, you know, the Affordable Care Act. I'm surprised they all did. I'm surprised they did so intensely. And it's just hard to escape the idea that the opposition to Obamacare was as much about the Obama part as it was about the care part.\n\nGROSS: Let me reintroduce you here. If you're just joining us, my guest is Jonathan Cohn. His new book is called The Ten Year War: Obamacare And The Unfinished Crusade For Universal Coverage. We'll be right back. This is FRESH AIR.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF AMY RIGBY'S PLAYING PITTSBURGH)\n\nGROSS: This is FRESH AIR. Let's get back to my interview with Jonathan Cohn. His new book, The Ten Year War, is about the politics behind the passage of Obamacare, the Affordable Care Act, and the subsequent attempts to dismantle or repeal it.\n\nSo the pandemic is a true test of any health care plan or any national health care plan. How is the ACA functioning during this COVID pandemic?\n\nCOHN: A pandemic really holds up a mirror to our health care system. And so, you know, one way to look at it is we still have millions of people uninsured. We have people with insurance with really big deductibles, can't get to the doctor. So, you know, in one way, you could say, gee, this shows all the inadequacies of the Affordable Care Act. The flip side is if you imagine a world where we don't have the Affordable Care Act in place, there would be so many more people who didn't have health insurance. There would be so many more people with insurance that had, you know, high deductibles, couldn't get to a doctor.\n\nYou know, it's kind of remarkable we don't have - you know, it takes a while to get really good statistics on insurance coverage. It doesn't - it looks like the number of people without insurance has not dramatically increased, which is pretty remarkable given the number of people who have lost their jobs. So that's a pretty clear sign that the Affordable Care Act is doing its job. There's a lot more to be done. But it's working, you know, like it's supposed to work.\n\nGROSS: So another example of how it's an imperfect plan, but it's better than not having it, in your opinion?\n\nCOHN: Exactly. Exactly.\n\nGROSS: So there are certain weaknesses in the ACA. Can you give an example of something that you think is a weakness that is a result of a compromise that had to be made in order to get the bill passed?\n\nCOHN: Yeah. I mean, I think the most obvious one is the amount of money that went into the funding, the overall funding of the health care legislation. When they were debating this, there was a commitment that outlays, you know, the sort of amount money you spend that the Congressional Budget Office measured. It couldn't be more than a trillion dollars over 10 years. And there's no magical economic value to a trillion dollars. That's just - that's where, basically, it was thought to be politically sellable. As the debate went on, there was just a lot of pressure to hold that number down, mostly from more conservative Democrats, partly because they'd also - they had said they were going to be fiscally responsible. They weren't going to spend money they didn't have.\n\nSo every dollar they were going to spend, they had to find somewhere else. It had to be new taxes, or it had to come out of the pockets of the drug makers or the hospitals. The problem is, if you only spend - if you can't spend more than a trillion dollars over 10 years, you end up in a situation where you're spending less now to help people buy insurance. And so that's why today, especially when you get into the middle-class people who are buying insurance on their own, you have a lot of people who are looking at very high premiums, really big deductibles. And, yeah, they have insurance. Yes, this is better than not having insurance. But, boy, it's a lot of money. It's not very affordable. And - you know, and that is why - one of the big reasons we're still here 10 years later saying, what do we need to do to fix our health care system?\n\nGROSS: What is an example of a compromise that Nancy Pelosi made in the House, because she had a lot of trouble getting enough votes?\n\nCOHN: Yeah. Well, the most famous one, it was on abortion rights. You know, she's a staunch defender of abortion rights, has been for, you know, her career. When - you know, as she was moving a bill through, it became very apparent they did not have the votes unless they convince a group of Democrats who oppose abortion rights. And, you know, the actual - you know, the big issue came down to federal funding of abortion rights, which always comes - of abortion, which comes up every time there's a health care bill.\n\nThe architects of the legislation, they felt like they had structured it in a way that basically, you know, the money was siphoned off. And, you know, money that came from the government couldn't be used to actually pay for abortion. But a group of Democratic House members said, no, that wasn't good enough. And she basically had to say, fine. We'll give you this restriction that threatened to make abortion very unavailable for people buying private insurance. She did not want to do it. Some of her closest allies did not want to do it. But she basically said to them, we have to make this deal because if we don't, this bill doesn't pass.\n\nGROSS: Harry Reid was the Senate majority leader at the time. What's something that he did either to compromise or to convince Democratic senators to sign on to the bill in order to get the ACA passed?\n\nCOHN: Well, Harry Reid had a tough job. They needed 60 votes. And they had 60 members of the Democratic caucus, could not lose a single member. The most famous compromise he had to make was on the public option. Progressive Democrats really wanted that. They felt like they had given up so much already. But a number of Democrats were against it. The most vocal of them was Joe Lieberman from Connecticut. And Lieberman basically made very clear, he said, I will not have a public option. If there's a public option in this bill, I will join a Republican filibuster. And you won't be able to pass this. And Reid tried his best to come up with some compromise. He set up a committee with moderate and liberal Democrats. They thought they had an alternative. Lieberman came out against that as well. And he had to drop it. And analogous a little bit to what Pelosi went through with abortion, Reid had to go to his progressive members and say, look, I did my best. I tried to do this. I don't like it. We don't have a choice.\n\nGROSS: If you're just joining us, my guest is Jonathan Cohn. He's the author of the new book called The Ten Year War: Obamacare And The Unfinished Crusade For Universal Coverage. Jonathan, we have to take another break here. And then we'll talk some more. So we'll be right back. I'm Terry Gross. And this is FRESH AIR.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF URI CAINE ENSEMBLE'S CANON AT THE 4TH IN 4/4)\n\nGROSS: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross, back with Jonathan Cohn, author of the new book The Ten Year War: Obamacare And The Unfinished Crusade For Universal Coverage. The book reports on the behind-the-scenes politics that led to the passage of the ACA, the Affordable Care Act. It's also about the decades of attempts to provide health care coverage to Americans dating back to the 1920s.\n\nHow did Harry Reid, the Senate majority leader at the time, get the support of Bernie Sanders? And Bernie Sanders, as everybody knows, has made universal health care or, you know, Medicare for All, a signature issue for him? And this this was a real - this was a distance away from what Bernie Sanders has wanted and advocated for for years. So what did it take to get Bernie Sanders to sign on?\n\nCOHN: Yeah, it was a big distance. And Bernie Sanders had a demand, although I think it says a lot about Bernie Sanders, the nature of the demand. When we talk about demands senators make, you know, some - oh, you know, I want a tax break for an industry in my state or, you know, extra Medicaid money for my state or what have you. Bernie Sanders said, if you want my vote, I want money to go directly to what are called federally qualified health centers. And these are basically clinics all over the country. They - it's part of a program that started in the 1960s that exclusively give health care, either free or discounted, to people who either don't have insurance or can't pay their medical bills.\n\nAnd basically, his special interest favor was something that would get health care to the sort of most financially, medically needy people in the country. It was a lot of money. So it was not - it required shuffling things around in the bill. It was not an easy thing to accommodate necessarily. But the end of the day, it was all about getting health care to people who need it, which, of course, was the No. 1 purpose of the legislation. So I think Harry Reid felt, the White House felt, everyone felt like, OK, this is something we can definitely live with.\n\nGROSS: And so that was written in?\n\nCOHN: It was written in. And that funding has, you know, has done enormous good when you look at the impact of the law. If you really want to see the impact of the Affordable Care Act just vividly, you know, find a community clinic in your area, one of these federally qualified health clinics, and ask them what the last few years have been like. Between that extra money and just in general, more people getting Medicaid, which they take, these clinics, they can serve many more people. And they've added all kinds of important services. You know, they do addiction counseling. They do diet counseling, things that help them, you know, not just help treat illness, but keep people from getting sick. And especially when you're dealing with communities where you have such high rates of diabetes, hypertension, people aren't getting cancer screenings - this it makes an enormous difference. And it's really a place where you really see what I would say is the best of the Affordable Care Act, where it's really done the most good.\n\nGROSS: What would you say is one of the biggest compromises that Democrats made with the pharmaceutical industry in order to get the bill passed?\n\nCOHN: So one of the big, you know, the big ideas for how Democrats were going to pass health care reform was they were going to negotiate with all of the industries. And they were going to go to every industry and basically say, look, you work with us. We'll work out some kind of deal where you'll give up something. We'll pay you a little less here or there. And in exchange, we will not - you know, we will not go to - we will not be as aggressive as we could be with you. And in exchange for that, you won't fight us on the bill. And this was all - came out of the failures in the past. And the saying was sort of, you know, on the bus or in front of the bus or, you know, on the menu or at the table.\n\nSo with the drug industry, the original idea was they wanted - there's a whole series of things they wanted to do. They wanted to spend less on drugs through Medicare and Medicaid. And there was talk of - you know, there was talk of having the government start to negotiate prices directly with the drug companies, which is something that happens in other places in the world. And the drug industry basically came back and said, look, we will - we're OK with you paying us less somewhat through Medicare and Medicaid, but we're not going to accept the kind of reductions you want. And by the way, no way we're going to accept government negotiation of prices. If you do that, we're done. And not only are we done, but you can look forward to us using our war chest to finance advertisements against this legislation. And we'll tell every senator and congressman who listens to us - which is, by the way, most of Congress - to oppose this bill. And your bill will be dead just as surely as the past ones were.\n\nSo Democrats basically had to agree. At the end of the day, they did reduce payments to the pharmaceutical industry relative to what they would have been, but not by that much. And in addition, they took government negotiation of prices off the table, you know, for the moment. They always could come back to it later. And in fact, here we are 10 years later. We actually are talking about it again.\n\nGROSS: So just standing back a second and assessing the route that the ACA took to being passed and what went on behind the scenes, what impression did that leave you with about how our government functions, how the political process functions?\n\nCOHN: So I think it functions badly. And I think a fair amount of that is the way the sort of institutions of our government, especially the Congress, especially the Senate, are set up really thwart change and thwart progressive change in particular. And that is because of the sort of bias towards small states that's built into the way the Senate is designed. You know, a senator from Wyoming has the same amount of influence as a senator from New York. And because of the way the country's population is distributed, that pulls everything in a much more conservative direction. You throw the filibuster on that - so you actually need 60 votes, not 50, to pass something - and it's just very hard to do anything. And, you know, I think going forward, that's why I think progressives, if you're thinking about the future, how to pass reforms, they really need to attack those impediments to change or otherwise they're going to run into the same struggles that the Democrats of 2009 did.\n\nGROSS: So the Republicans had stood for repeal and replace. The replacement part never really got drafted even though President Trump had kept promising it's coming soon, a couple of weeks. It never materialized. Do you think that the explanation you just gave of Republicans becoming better at generating outrage than generating legislation and really knowing the art of legislation, do you think that explains in part why replace never got formulated?\n\nCOHN: I think that's a really big part of it. You know, I - by comparison, I compare the years leading up to the Affordable Care Act's enactment to the years leading up to the attempt to repeal. And when you look at how - why did Democrats get their legislation across the line? Well, a big reason was they spent 10, 15 years looking at where they had failed in the past and having these very complex, difficult debates internally about how to design a plan that would work, that could - they could sell politically, that they could get through Congress. So they were really ready. They'd done a ton of homework by the time, you know, 2009 comes around and they have the ability to actually pass legislation. You compare that to the Republicans. You know, in the period between 2010 and 2017, they had seven years really to do that, to sort of go through the same process, to really kind of say, all right, what does our replacement look like? How do we pass it? And, you know, health care is hard, right?\n\nAnd once you get past the slogans, you immediately discover all the trade-offs, all the parts of, you know, someone's going to feel some pain in order to give someone else some benefit. And they never did those - they never did that work. You know, there were a handful of intellectuals who had plans. There were a handful of members of Congress who had bills. But they really didn't focus on it all.\n\nThey landed there early 2017 ready to go. And they don't have a plan. And, of course, you know, have they had done that exercise, they might very well have discovered that, gee, our slogan that we're going to repeal Obamacare and replace it with something that's way better and still true to our conservative principles, well, that wasn't going to happen because at the end of the day, there was no such. But you couldn't - not even in theory, it just wasn't possible. But they never realized that because they hadn't done the homework.\n\nGROSS: Let me reintroduce you here. If you're just joining us. My guest is Jonathan Cohn. He's the author of the new book The Ten Year War: Obamacare And The Unfinished Crusade For Universal Coverage. We'll be right back after this break. This is FRESH AIR.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)\n\nGROSS: This is FRESH AIR. Let's get back to my interview with Jonathan Cohn. His new book, The Ten Year War, is about the politics behind the passage of Obamacare, the Affordable Care Act and the subsequent attempts to dismantle or repeal it.\n\nSo a lot of people are pushing for universal health care. And some people see the ACA as a step in that direction, and I think others see it as a bureaucracy that takes us in a way further away from universal health care. And of course, some people don't want universal health care because it's more government interference in health care. But do you think that the U.S. will ever have universal health care?\n\nCOHN: I do think we'll get there eventually. I think it will take time. You know, the people who wrote the Affordable Care Act, certainly were trying to get to universal health care. That's what they believed. And I think they would see and I would agree that it's a big step on the road towards universal health care, both in the sense that we've covered many more people. So the number of people who don't have insurance at this point is much lower than it was.\n\nBut also, we've really established some of the key principles. They're sort of widely accepted politically. Again, you know, you just see that in the fact that Republicans these days, who are the opponents of Obamacare, nevertheless say but, you know, just to be clear, we think everybody should have a right to insurance regardless of preexisting condition. Well, that was not a reality 10 - more than 10 years ago. So that has changed. So we've gotten closer clearly. You know, how we get the rest of the way, you know, to what extent it involves building on the architecture of the Affordable Care Act versus tearing that architecture down, putting something new in its place, I think that is the debate going forward.\n\nGROSS: You've been writing about health care coverage and health care, you know, policy for basically your whole adult life. What's kept you doing that?\n\nCOHN: Well, you know, I would say two things. First of all, the problem never gets solved. So there is always, you know, it's an ongoing effort to sort of figure out what to do about it and to understand it. It's such a complex system. I mean, I have been writing about health care for a long time, but I learn new things every day. There are vast swaths of our health care universe I don't understand and I'm still trying to learn. And of course, conditions change. And sometimes, you know, you need to write about the changes and figure out, OK, what's new now? How do we need to rethink what we thought before?\n\nThe other reason is, you know, I'm a - you know, having spent so much time over the years talking to people who have struggled with medical bills, who've gone through real hardship. And it hits you every time that it's not that these people have made all the right decisions necessarily, it's not that they've always put themselves in the best positions, but the end of the day, they're - people, you know, are unlucky and they suffer because of it. And, you know, I - you know, I'm not afraid to sort of say that. I think just as a moral principle, if you're facing an injury or a serious illness, you shouldn't also have to worry about paying your bills. It's bad enough to have to worry about the illness or the injury. That's hard. Anyone who's ever been through that, anyone who's been - had a family member go through that, it can be incredibly traumatic. It's difficult. It's hard.\n\nThe least a society can do is to say we may not be able to cure you, we may not be able to make you better, but the very least we're going to make sure that, you know, you don't have to worry about going bankrupt, paying your bills. And we don't do that as a society. Now, other societies do that. And, you know, until we get to that point, I imagine I'll keep writing about this.\n\nGROSS: Your mother died after a long illness. She was in a nursing home. And she died during the COVID pandemic, so you were not able to be with her or to visit her. I'm very sorry for your loss. So - but I'm going to ask you a more technical question here. I don't know how much you had to deal with her bills and with the nursing home doctors and nurses. It's so hard when you have somebody who you care about and you can't see them and they're in a hospital or a nursing home. What did you learn about our health care system from the period when you were able to visit her and then in COVID when you couldn't?\n\nCOHN: Yeah. Well, thank you for the sympathy. I learned a lot. You know, as someone who writes about health care, to be on the other end of it, sort of experiencing this and navigating this and trying to navigate the health care system - in that case, this is, you know, the technical term for nursing home care, assisted living, that's all called long-term care. And it's a real mess. It has - every problem of our health care system is exists in the long-term care system and it's worse. It's hard to figure out who pays what bill. You're constantly dealing with the networks. You think your insurance covers something, and then you discover that it doesn't. And you have to get on the phone and fight. And the amount of time you spend on this, you know, which is time you want to be spending with your loved one - and, you know, these are - you know, and anyone who's gone through this particular experience knows this is incredibly hard. You have some incredibly difficult decisions you have to make. You're constantly second guessing. And again, having to sort of spend your time, your emotional energy, dealing with insurance bureaucracies, dealing with all these payment questions. It's just - it makes it such a greater burden at a time when, even under the best of circumstances, it's an incredible burden.\n\nGROSS: Another issue related to nursing homes and to hospital care and to home health care is that a lot of the nurses and home health care workers, I think, are really underpaid. And I think it's a weakness in the system. We expect, we demand so much of them. And some of them are making so little in return. And I think it sometimes shows up in the care that you get.\n\nCOHN: Unquestionably. People who provide direct care, that is such a hard job. It requires a combination of skills that you learn and talent that some people have. And they're paid ridiculously low, frequently without benefits. The facilities themselves are frequently understaffed. You know, it was - it's been heartbreaking to me during the pandemic to see how many, not just residents of long-term care facilities were suffering, but staff, who, you know, especially, you know, obviously, at the beginning, they didn't have enough protective gear. Some of them still don't have enough protective gear but were being asked to bear such a burden, you know, both taking care of these people who lived in these facilities and also, frankly, provide a lot of the emotional support for families like mine that couldn't be there physically.\n\nAbsolutely, they need to be paid more. You know, this is - you know, but if you look at it as a policy problem, you will quickly discover that, you know, this is one - this is a hard problem to solve because there's exactly one way you solve it, and that's you spend more money on it. You know, we need to spend more money on long-term care. This is something in this country we've never done. There's a whole complex set of reasons for that, a lot of it tied to who the people are who traditionally do this work, the fact that it's people who are easily discriminated against. But, yeah, we need to pay these people more. We need to pay these people a lot more.\n\nGROSS: Lately, you've been covering the pandemic. What are some of the changes the Biden administration has been making or plans to make regarding the pandemic?\n\nCOHN: Yeah. So there's no one silver bullet. I mean, really, what they've done is they've sort of come up with a list of all the little things you need to do to improve vaccine distribution. And they are basically working on all of them. So - you know, they run the gamut. I mean, we're seeing them set up these mass vaccination clinics, for example, big parking lots and stadiums. We're also seeing them pay attention to supplies for the vaccine makers, making sure that the vaccine - you know, vaccine production is very difficult. It requires certain kind of machines. It requires certain raw materials. And so they're using what's known as the Defense Production Act to make sure that the supply orders have priority. They're trying to do a much better job of communicating with the state, saying, look, this - you can count on getting X vaccines for the next three weeks.\n\nAnd that's a big deal because a lot of the problems we're seeing in terms of being able to get shots, not people get shots, is that there's just - there's a lot of miscommunication between the states and the local departments and the hospitals. And that comes from the fact that the states are not sure what they're getting a week from now. So it's hard to make plans. So they're working on all of these things. They're also paying a lot of attention to equity. You know, they're making - you know, it's not just how quickly shots are getting into arms. But are they going into everybody's arms? In particular, are they going to the sort of people who are most at risk? I mean, it's sort of - it's sad. But, you know, in general, higher income groups are doing a much better job of getting shots than lower income groups. But lower income groups, in general, they're the essential workers. They're the ones in overcrowded housing. They're at the greatest risk. So the Biden administration is trying to do something about that.\n\nGROSS: Well, Jonathan Cohn, thank you so much for talking with us. It's a pleasure to talk with you again.\n\nCOHN: Thanks for having me on the show.\n\nGROSS: Jonathan Cohn is a senior national correspondent at Huff Post and author of the new book The Ten Year War: Obamacare And The Unfinished Crusade For Universal Coverage. After we take a short break, John Powers will review the new film Minari, which won the top jury prize and top audience prize at last year's Sundance Film Festival.

Encore: The History Of Government Shutdowns In The U.S.\n\nEarlier this year, when a different shutdown loomed in January, NPR's Ron Elving provided a history lesson on government shutdowns. As the partial shutdown continues, we revisit those of the past.\n\nMARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST:\n\nDeja vu all over again. Well, if that's how you're feeling about this shutdown, you are not alone. We are ringing out 2018 much as we ring it in. Back on January 18, we were on the edge of a government shutdown. And back on January 18, we summoned NPR's Ron Elving, senior editor and correspondent, to give us a history lesson, a history lesson we seem to keep reliving. It's still relevant. So here's Ron, again, reminding me of a moment at the start of the Reagan era when 241,000 federal employees were furloughed for two days.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)\n\nRON ELVING, BYLINE: This goes back to changes to the budget process that were made in the 1970s that made it really necessary for the president and Congress to work together in certain ways. And here's a news flash. Sometimes they don't.\n\nKELLY: (Laughter).\n\nELVING: There were three short shutdowns while Ronald Reagan was president and another short one under George H.W. Bush.\n\nKELLY: You said short, though - so in the grand scheme of things, not as huge a deal as they could've been.\n\nELVING: Just nuisances, theatrical gestures, if you will. But then Newt Gingrich happened. He was the new speaker. In 1995, the Republicans had a brand new majority in the House, and Newt Gingrich decided the budget was the place to go to war with President Bill Clinton.\n\nKELLY: OK. What happened then?\n\nELVING: In November of that year and again in December and January, Congress sent bills to the president, daring him to veto them. He did, and that meant no new appropriations were made. And that meant all non-emergency functions of the government started shutting down.\n\nKELLY: And how long did they stay shut down?\n\nELVING: First time was several days, and people thought everyone had learned their lesson. But they came back for a full three weeks the second time around.\n\nKELLY: Three weeks - I had forgotten that. Now, have we seen that long a shutdown in the years since?\n\nELVING: In the fall of 2013, Ted Cruz was a newly elected Republican senator, and he convinced a large group of like-minded House Republicans that they could go to war with their leadership as he went to war with his as well as of course going to war with the White House. Barack Obama was president. And the big issue was Obamacare, and they wanted to cripple it in the budget. And they managed to shut the government down for about two weeks.\n\nKELLY: To be clear, the military does not shut down. Air traffic controllers still have to show up at work. What does it actually mean...\n\nELVING: That's right.\n\nKELLY: ...When they say shutdown?\n\nELVING: TSA still looks at your bags and so on. Much of the shutdown disruption applies to things that are not emergencies. But we do talk these days about 800,000 immediate furloughs in the federal government. More than a million other federal employees are told to show up with no idea when they're going to be paid. As a result, the federal government does not function well in anything other than the emergency processes. But it should be made clear, it's not as though the military is suddenly going to go on furlough.\n\nKELLY: And does this actually save money?\n\nELVING: It does not because in the long run, all the same work has to be done, and all the same paychecks are always issued. And so in the end, it costs money because there are shutdown and restart costs. The frictional costs of these shutdowns are actually quite substantial - tens of millions of dollars at least. And as a result, they actually lose money.\n\nKELLY: Do they actually accomplish anything?\n\nELVING: It's hard to see how they accomplish anything in terms of the efficiency or effectiveness of the government itself. But they do have the effect of energizing and emphasizing the differences between the political parties and the factions within the parties.\n\nKELLY: Sure.\n\nELVING: They can be highly stimulating for donors and activists.\n\nKELLY: Now, I had that conversation with Ron Elving in January right before the first of three shutdowns this year. As we mentioned, that one lasted two days. It ended with a short-term funding bill that kicked the can to February 9, when there was a baby shutdown - just nine hours. As for our current shutdown, it's now on day 10 and counting.\n\nCopyright © 2018 NPR. All rights reserved.

While In Las Vegas, Trump Reaches Out To Latino Voters\n\nThe Senate race between GOP incumbent Sen. Dean Heller and Democratic challenger Rep. Jacky Rosen, is one to watch this November. Appealing to the Latino vote will be crucial to whoever wins.\n\nRENEE MONTAGNE, HOST:\n\nAnd to Lulu in Nevada now because it is election year, and politics isn't contained to Capitol Hill. Right, Lulu?\n\nLULU GARCIA-NAVARRO, HOST:\n\nYeah. Here in Las Vegas, thousands came out to the convention center draped in American flags to see President Trump.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED CROWD #1: (Chanting) USA, USA, USA.\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: His supporters, who were wearing red Make America Great Again hats, cheered as the president lobbed his usual jabs at the media and the Democrats. But then Trump made a direct appeal to this demographic.\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Hispanic. Any Hispanic here? I think so.\n\n(CHEERING)\n\nTRUMP: Hispanic-American unemployment is the lowest rate in history.\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: Trump has a reason to reach out to Latino voters. They make up about 28 percent of the population of this state - and growing. The vast majority of Latinos here do vote Democratic, but the Republicans will need some of those Latino votes if they're going to hang on to Nevada's crucial Senate seat currently held by Senator Dean Heller.\n\nTRUMP: Finally, I want you to please welcome the person that we're all here for tonight.\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: Now, Heller wasn't always a Trump guy. In the run-up to 2016, in fact, he was a vocal critic. But he's all in for Trump these days. He needs President Trump's star power to win in a tough race. He's the only Republican senator up for re-election in a state that Hillary Clinton won. Polls show him neck and neck with Democratic challenger Jacky Rosen - more about her later. At the rally, Heller had only fulsome praise for the president.\n\nDEAN HELLER: Thank you for putting Nevada back to work.\n\n(CHEERING)\n\nHELLER: Because of your administration, Nevada families have more money in their paychecks.\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: The problem for Heller is that Trump is controversial with Hispanics because of his pledge to repeal Obamacare and his hard line on immigration. Still, there are some who support him. In the crowd was Latina Lilia Heart, who likes Trump's immigration policies.\n\nLILIA HEART: He's cleaning house. And there's certain steps that he's taking that need to be taken for America to become what it needs to become.\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: The next day, we were able to sit down with Joel Garcia, Heller's Hispanic outreach director, about Heller's strategy with Latinos.\n\nJOEL GARCIA: The communities that we go into are faith-based communities, obviously with values, business communities.\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: Garcia is of Mexican descent and a small business owner himself. He told us Latinos are persuadable in his view. They respond to the economic message. And many don't realize they already embrace conservative values.\n\nGARCIA: When you actually have a conversation with them and start talking about issues, they come out of the woodwork. And they start saying, no, I'm pro-life. I'm for, you know, lower taxes. I'm for less government.\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: Heller, though, is being attacked by Democrats for his shifting policies on key issues. On health care, he's voted both for and against portions of Obamacare. With immigration, he has condemned Trump's family separation policies, but he's also supported a hard-line immigration bill championed by the president. I asked Garcia about the issue of family separation.\n\nGARCIA: Well, here it is. He was one of the first senators to come out against it. And that came out in June. When everything came out, he was one of the early Republican senators to come out. He also asked the Trump administration, please provide me regular updates on the progress of what's going on down there.\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: Well, what about health care? Leaving aside the issue of immigration...\n\nGARCIA: I'm not going to go into health care because I just don't want to go into that. Policy-wise, I just don't want to go into that.\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: He insisted health care never comes up with Latino voters, even though polling shows it's a top issue. Latinos have been a big beneficiary of the Medicaid expansion in this state. While Heller's team may not want to talk about healthcare policy, the Democrats here are running on that issue.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED CROWD #2: (Chanting) Si se puede. Si se puede.\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: Across town at the Culinary Workers Union, there is a different sea of red - union workers wearing red T-shirts, stuffing envelopes and preparing to knock on doors. They've endorsed Heller's challenger, Democratic Congresswoman Jacky Rosen, who was there to cheer them on.\n\nJACKY ROSEN: And I can tell you, too, that if you don't have your health, you don't have anything.\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: The Culinary Workers Union is the biggest in town, with 57,000 members from all over the hospitality industry, a majority of them Hispanic. They're here today on a vital mission for Democrats. In the last midterm election, there was a huge drop-off in Latino voting compared to 2012, a presidential election year, by about half. Pollsters describe it as going off a cliff, and that helped Republican candidates. Rosen cannot win if Latinos stay home this time, so she's trying to motivate them to vote.\n\nROSEN: We're going to fight for DREAMers. We're going to fight for a fair immigration system.\n\n(CHEERING)\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: Rosen is a first-time Congresswoman, and she doesn't have a lot of statewide name recognition, but this is her home turf. Some of the most populous parts of the state are in her district here. And when she was younger, she waitressed during the summers in Las Vegas, something she frequently cites.\n\nROSEN: I'm going to get a little choked up here for a minute because 40 years ago, I joined the Culinary Union.\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: After, the teams of canvassers prepare to head out. And we follow Fransisco Benitez and Telma Vasquez, two Hispanic union members.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF KNOCKING)\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: On a quiet street in North Las Vegas, they consult a list of addresses of union members, and they start knocking on doors. The tactic here is one that has been proven to work - colleagues coming from a trusted organization, pitching in person on a candidate.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF KNOCKING)\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: Fransisco Benitez tells me that first-generation Latinos especially are tough to motivate to vote. They don't see themselves as Democrats or Republicans, and they still have strong ties to their home countries.\n\nFRANSISCO BENITEZ: Most of them - they think like, OK. This is politics, but we are not involved too much in politics. But for example, in my case, I try to tell them, OK. This is important. This is for us. This is for - not only for yourself but for your children.\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: We end up at the house of Armando Saenz. He's a flirtatious and lively 78-year-old retiree. Benitez shows him pamphlets with Jacky Rosen's face on them, but Saenz is having none of it.\n\nARMANDO SAENZ: (Speaking Spanish).\n\nBENITEZ: (Speaking Spanish).\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: They are tricksters and liars, he tells us, like all politicians. Benitez says, not all of them. Saenz responds, When the moment comes, they don't do anything for us. He says he doesn't vote for any particular party. But Saenz does acknowledge that he's angry at the current administration's immigration policies.\n\nSAENZ: (Speaking Spanish).\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: Benitez and Vasquez try to persuade him using their last-ditch pitch.\n\nTELMA VASQUEZ: (Speaking Spanish).\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: It's for the future of the children, Telma says to him. The interaction ends with Saenz promising to come out to vote for the union's choice. In such a tight race, whether or not Saenz and other Latinos like him actually show up at the polls could decide who controls the Senate in November.\n\nCopyright © 2018 NPR. All rights reserved.

Exclusive Audio: In New Memoir, Sen. John McCain Rests His Case\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption William Thomas Cain/Getty Images William Thomas Cain/Getty Images\n\nEXCLUSIVE AUDIO: John McCain Reads From 'The Restless Wave' 3:10\n\nAnyone who has followed the saga of Sen. John McCain or ever reacted with emotion to his words or actions will recognize the man speaking in this valedictory volume.\n\nThe voice and manner are familiar enough that we can almost hear and see him on every page.\n\nIt recalls his previous literary efforts (he has written seven books with longtime collaborator Mark Salter), but it also ventures deeper into our collective memories of McCain and his world — as we prepare to part with both.\n\nThe Restless Wave is a plain-spoken and often painful personal accounting; a résumé of a contentious career and a defense of controversial political decisions. It may inspire or enrage. But it is less an effort to provoke such conflicting responses than a paean to McCain's idea of America.\n\nMcCain wants to celebrate the America he knew — or perhaps only imagined — in the full flower of its global pre-eminence. Call it heritage or call it myth, it is a concept of America that McCain clearly feels he personifies, and one he senses is passing even as he reaches the end of his own life.\n\nAt 81, he is battling the same kind of brain cancer that claimed his Senate friend and frequent antagonist Ted Kennedy. McCain knows the odds and even notes that he may not live to see this book published.\n\nThe Restless Wave Good Times, Just Causes, Great Fights, and Other Appreciations by John McCain and Mark Salter Hardcover, 288 pages | purchase close overlay Buy Featured Book Your purchase helps support NPR programming. How?\n\nThis is a man who should have leave to speak his mind. He has served more than 30 years in the U.S. Senate, after serving almost as long in the U.S. Navy. He suffered more than five years in a Vietnamese prisoner of war camp, ran twice for president as a Republican, once as his party's nominee. Through it all, he has been stubbornly individual, at times cantankerous and even exasperating to friend and foe alike, relishing his political persona as The Maverick.\n\nThere are flashes of that McCain in The Restless Wave. He lashes out at conservative talk show hosts and at those who use the Internet to spread conspiracy theories and calumnies about candidates to people with an appetite for that sort of thing or an inability to discern what could be true from something spawned in the fever dreams of people who should probably seek psychiatric help.\n\nThe Maverick moniker figured prominently in both of McCain's bids for president, in 2000 and 2008. But in this memoir, McCain picks up the narrative with the latter. He recalls his campaign's near collapse in the previous summer, then revels in recalling how he climbed back to win the New Hampshire primary. He attributes his capture of the Republican nomination to his emphasis on the improving battlefield situation in Iraq.\n\nBut McCain's march to the White House was blocked that fall by the Barack Obama phenomenon and two major distractions. One was the mortgage-backed-securities crisis that tanked Wall Street and prompted an unpopular bailout for financial institutions and a deep recession for the U.S. economy. McCain bore no special responsibility for that campaign catastrophe, but he does own up to choosing Sarah Palin, his ill-fated running mate.\n\nMcCain recounts fighting with his campaign staff over his first pick, the Democratic Sen. Joe Lieberman of Connecticut, who had been Al Gore's running mate in 2000. Relenting, McCain looks around as the Republican convention in St. Paul, Minn., looms. Desperate for a way to reframe the election, McCain goes with the upstart, populist governor of Alaska.\n\nShe was a popular, energetic and accomplished reformer as mayor, governor and as a campaigner, McCain writes. He also thought she would appeal to Democrats who had preferred Hillary Clinton to Barack Obama in that year's primaries. McCain notes her knockout speech at the party convention, but he admits it was downhill thereafter.\n\nShe stumbled in some interviews, McCain relates, and had a few misjudgments in the glare of the ceaseless spotlight. Those missteps too are on me. She didn't put herself on the ticket. I did.\n\nThe bulk of the book strives to re-litigate the major issues of the past dozen years, both before and after the 2008 campaign. We revisit the Iraq War, the use of enhanced interrogation techniques (which the administration of George W. Bush insisted on calling EITs and McCain calls torture), the surge that stabilized the situation, and the later battles over how long the U.S. should stay. McCain also devotes a chapter to his repeated efforts at comprehensive immigration reform, an issue that united him with both Bush and Kennedy but put him at odds with much of his own party — including in his own state of Arizona.\n\nHe also devotes substantial space to the struggle he now sees defining U.S. foreign policy, which is the struggle against Russia — particularly against Russian President Vladimir Putin. He reminds us of his personal duels with Putin, who once said McCain had been driven mad by his years as a captive kept in a pit in Vietnam.\n\nHere is where McCain finally gets serious about talking about the current U.S. president, who rates only passing mentions in the first 270 pages (there are roughly twice as many mentions of Putin). But what thoughts he does give to Donald Trump are troubled.\n\nI'm not sure what to make of President Trump's convictions, he writes, adding later, He threatened to deliberately kill the spouses and children of terrorists, implying that an atrocity of that magnitude would show the world America's toughness.\n\nHe also has no use for the Trump stance on refugees. The way he speaks about them is appalling, as though welfare or terrorism were the only purposes they could have in coming to our country.\n\nAnd: His reaction to unflattering news stories, calling them 'fake news' whether they're credible or not, is copied by autocrats who want to discredit and control a free press.\n\nMost of all, he is disturbed at what he sees as Trump's tolerance of Putin, implying moral equivalence when Trump said, We have a lot of killers too. McCain responds: It was a shameful thing to say, and so unaware of reality.\n\nMcCain also makes repeated reference to Putin's attacks on American democracy through the Internet, which he calls Putin's revenge on Hillary Clinton for supporting popular protests against the regime in Russia: [Putin] would seek revenge ... by ordering his trolls and hackers and subcontractors at WikiLeaks to help defeat her.\n\nAnother foreign policy issue especially salient for McCain regards torture and its use by the U.S. in the war on terrorism. He examines the efforts of Vice President Dick Cheney and others in the administration of President George W. Bush to overcome McCain's opposition to anti-terrorism tactics he regarded as torture. Drawing on his hellish experiences in Vietnam as a torture victim, McCain explains why torture is likely to produce misleading or faulty intelligence. But his real point is that torture betrays the American ideals for which he and countless others have risked or sacrificed their lives.\n\nAt one point, McCain quotes a letter he received from an Army captain who was disturbed at reports of the U.S. using torture on suspected terrorists. The captain writes, I would rather die fighting than give up the smallest part of the idea that is America. And McCain adds, If there is a finer declaration of an American duty and sense of honor, I haven't heard it.\n\nThe Restless Wave constitutes McCain's own declaration.\n\nIt is framed by a deep commitment to the military and to the traditions of McCain's own family. Descendants of a man who settled in the Mississippi Delta in the mid-19th century, the 20th century McCains produced two Navy admirals (the senator's father and grandfather). The latter stood on the deck of the USS Missouri at the surrender ceremony that ended World War II. He witnessed the beginning of an American era unlike any before it. His grandson has written a tribute to that era, to his own place in it and to his hopes for its future.\n\nThose hopes include McCain's long-standing special causes. He cares about the military. He cares about the way our political campaigns are now conducted. He cares about the frayed traditions of Congress and mourns its loss of bipartisanship.\n\nMcCain also renews his crusade to rein in the campaign finance excesses of the 1990s and beyond, a surge in political spending that beggars the imagination and threatens to upend the electoral system entirely. And he writes at length about the thought process and emotional struggle that led to his vote against his own party's signature legislation in 2017, the repeal of Obamacare.\n\nAt its best, the prose in The Restless Wave has some of the terse effectiveness we associate with the 20th century writer Ernest Hemingway. And on his final page, McCain returns to the model of the Hemingway character he calls his hero, Robert Jordan of For Whom the Bell Tolls. That novel ends with Jordan lying wounded on open ground, armed to fight one last battle that he knows will end with his death. The world is a fine place and worth the fighting for, Jordan says to himself, and I hate very much to leave it.\n\nTo this, McCain adds his own response: And I do too. I hate to leave it. But I don't have a complaint. Not one. It's been quite a ride. ... I made a small place for myself in the story of America and the history of my times.
10 Notable People Leaving Congress\n\nThe next Congress is going to be missing some familiar faces. Thanks to a mix of retirements and defeats on Tuesday, some high-profile lawmakers will soon be exiting Capitol Hill.\n\nSome were longtime Democratic targets in the Senate that the GOP finally vanquished. Others were vocal Republican critics of President Trump who chose not to run for re-election. Others simply thought it was time to hang it up — including the outgoing speaker of the House, Paul Ryan (R-Wis.).\n\nHere are 10 of the most notable politicians making their exit from Washington:\n\nSen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Scott Olson/Getty Images Scott Olson/Getty Images\n\nThe Missouri senator was Republicans' white whale. She won in 2006, a good Democratic year, and six years later, she drew a deeply flawed GOP challenger that helped her win re-election. But this year, Republican state Attorney General Josh Hawley finally ousted her. McCaskill was a regular on TV and Sunday talk shows and leaves as the top Democrat on the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee. McCaskill was seen as a moderate in the Democratic caucus, but her votes against both of Trump's Supreme Court nominees, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh, helped Republicans finally sink her.\n\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Toya Sarno Jordan/Getty Images Toya Sarno Jordan/Getty Images\n\nThe Wisconsin Republican fashions himself a policy wonk and a budget nerd, and during his nearly two decades in Congress, he became chairman of both the House Budget and the Ways and Means committees. But he also found himself thrust into the national spotlight, occasionally to his chagrin.\n\nRyan was chosen by Mitt Romney to be his vice presidential running mate in 2012, and after their defeat, Ryan became one of the de facto leaders in an increasingly divided GOP conference. After conservatives helped oust John Boehner as speaker in 2015, Ryan somewhat reluctantly accepted the job. Once Donald Trump ascended to become the GOP's presidential nominee and then to the White House, Ryan had to walk a fine line — sometimes criticizing the unconventional chief executive while also trying to find a way to work with him.\n\nUltimately, it may have been too much, and Ryan — along with a record number of other GOP lawmakers — seemed to see the writing on the wall that Republicans were likely to lose the House and announced his retirement in April. A close confidant of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell told The New York Times that McConnell thought the move was selfish.\n\nRep. Beto O'Rourke, D-Texas\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n\nThe Texas congressman was first elected to the House in 2012, knocking off an incumbent congressman in the Democratic primary. Launching his bid for the Senate in March 2017, O'Rourke seemed like the longest of long shots in deep red Texas.\n\nBut his unconventional campaign took a grassroots approach. He visited all 254 counties in Texas and soon began drawing huge crowds. His rock-star-like status would soon propel him to fame beyond just Texas, as he raised an unheard of nearly $70 million for his campaign. Ultimately, O'Rourke fell just short of unseating Republican Sen. Ted Cruz — though his finish within less than 3 points was the best for a Democrat in a statewide race in decades.\n\nO'Rourke may not be coming back to D.C. as a senator but don't count him out of the political mix — the Beto 2020 buzz has already begun.\n\nSen. Heidi Heitkamp, D-N.D.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Shawna Noel Widdel/AP Shawna Noel Widdel/AP\n\nThe North Dakota Democratic senator is another lawmaker Republicans had been targeting ever since she won her seat six years ago. Heitkamp was often hailed as the rare red state Democrat who could still attract rural and crossover GOP support; she narrowly won in 2012 even as Romney carried the state by almost 20 points. Trump won it four years later by an even wider 36-point margin, and he traveled repeatedly to the state to hammer her. Heitkamp often tried to bolster her moderate credentials and even sided with the president on occasion, voting for Gorsuch, his first Supreme Court nominee. But she voted against Kavanaugh after allegations of sexual assault against him surfaced earlier this year. By then, she was already seen as the most vulnerable Democratic incumbent and was likely to lose, but that vote probably sealed her fate. Some Democrats had pointed out that she was down in the polls in 2012, too, and went onto win, but on Tuesday, it wasn't even that close as Republican Kevin Cramer beat her by 10 points.\n\nSen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n\nThe Arizona senator chose to retire rather than face a primary challenge he was probably going to lose — something Trump gloated about at his postelection press conference on Wednesday. Flake was a vocal critic of Trump from the start and, unlike other Republicans in Congress, never really wavered. He even wrote a book blasting Trump as being a fake conservative and accusing others in the GOP of making a Faustian bargain when accepting him. In his speech announcing his retirement, Flake decried the worsening of politics and flagrant disregard for truth or decency ushered in by Trump.\n\nHe has already started floating a possible primary challenge to the president in 2020.\n\nSen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Drew Angerer/Getty Images Drew Angerer/Getty Images\n\nCorker wasn't an original Trump skeptic like Flake was and for a time was even mentioned as a potential running mate or a candidate for secretary of state. But the Senate Foreign Relations Committee chairman would soon sour on Trump, becoming especially critical of his handling of foreign policy.\n\nAfter one of Trump's Twitter tirades, Corker famously tweeted: It's a shame the White House has become an adult day care center. Someone obviously missed their shift this morning. Corker even flirted with deciding to run again after he had announced his retirement, but he probably would have lost that primary with now-Sen.-elect Marsha Blackburn. Corker has remained a Trump critic, and the exits of both him and Flake will leave a void in the U.S. Senate.\n\nRep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Drew Angerer/Getty Images Drew Angerer/Getty Images\n\nThe California Republican decided to retire after nearly two decades in Congress, facing a tough re-election in a district that had voted for Hillary Clinton. (Democrat Mike Levin won his House seat in Tuesday's election). Issa gained national prominence when he became the chairman of the Oversight and Government Reform Committee after Republicans flipped the House in 2010. He wielded his gavel to investigate the Obama administration on a variety of matters, including the IRS and its treatments of conservative groups; the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives' failed Fast and Furious operation; and the 2012 Benghazi attacks.\n\nRep. Trey Gowdy, R-S.C.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Mark Wilson/Getty Images Mark Wilson/Getty Images\n\nThe South Carolina Republican picked up the mantle from Issa, putting to use his prosecutorial background as chairman of the House Select Committee on Benghazi. Gowdy became a conservative hero for his grilling of Hillary Clinton when she testified before the committee for 11 hours. He would later assume the chairmanship of the Oversight and Government Reform Committee, as well. But Gowdy never completely toed the party line under Trump, debunking Trump's unsubstantiated claims that Democrats in the FBI had embedded a spy in his campaign. Despite his national fame, Gowdy has said he doesn't want to run for any other office or remain in political life but simply wants to go back to being an attorney after his retirement from Congress.\n\nRep. Dave Brat, R-Va.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Jay Paul/Getty Images Jay Paul/Getty Images\n\nThe former economics professor became a conservative icon when he notched one of the most unlikely upsets in political history by knocking off then-House Majority Leader Eric Cantor in his 2014 GOP primary. In the House, Brat joined the conservative House Freedom Caucus, but back home, his Richmond-area district was changing. Redistricting in 2016 removed some of the state's rural GOP strongholds, and by 2018, he faced a tough challenger in former CIA operative Abigail Spanberger. Brat tried to run a traditional GOP campaign, tying Spanberger to Nancy Pelosi more than two dozen times in their only debate and campaigned on repealing the Affordable Care Act and cutting taxes. But 2018 wasn't a traditional year, and Spanberger racked up strong margins in the diverse, affluent suburbs to overcome Brat's strength in the rural areas.\n\nSen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n\nThe 84-year-old Hatch retires as the longest-serving GOP senator in history. During his 42-year tenure, the Utah Republican has chaired the Senate Judiciary Committee, where he oversaw important judicial nominations, and finally the Senate Finance Committee, helping pass sweeping tax reform last year. Hatch was cozy with Trump, and the president even said he had hoped Hatch would run for another term. Trump may not get along as well with Hatch's successor — 2012 GOP presidential nominee Romney, who has been critical of Trump in the past. We do hope that Hatch maintains his hilarious Twitter feed when he leaves office though.
Sunday Politics\n\nWe look at what to expect in the impeachment inquiry. Also, Sen. Elizabeth Warren finally released a plan for how to pay for Medicare for All.\n\nLULU GARCIA-NAVARRO, HOST:\n\nThere have been multiple officials who have testified behind closed doors in the impeachment inquiry. And a lot of what they've said confirms that the president did indeed withhold military aid from Ukraine in exchange for an investigation into his rival Joe Biden and his son. With more subpoenas and testimonies expected, there is much left to uncover. Our own Mara Liasson is here with us, and she's the national political correspondent. And she's going to talk about what's happening.\n\nHi, Mara.\n\nMARA LIASSON, BYLINE: Hi, Lulu.\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: All right. What's coming this week? What can we expect?\n\nLIASSON: We know that the House has asked to hear tomorrow from John Eisenberg, who's the National Security Council top lawyer. He's the one who's been described in other testimony as being the person who decided to put the rough transcript of the call with the president and the president of Ukraine into a special restricted access computer system called NICE. That stands for NSC Intelligence Collaboration Environment. Democrats say that's...\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: Doesn't seem like the best word, but yes.\n\nLIASSON: (Laughter) Democrats say that's the sign of a cover-up. Republicans say he was just trying to prevent leaks. We don't know if Eisenberg will appear. We do know that the House has asked to hear from national - former national security adviser John Bolton on Thursday. Bolton has yet to receive a subpoena, but when he does, he will probably join the suit filed by his deputy, Charles Kupperman. And they say they won't appear before the House unless a court tells them to because the White House has directed them not to testify.\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: OK. The impeachment inquiry isn't the only big political story right now. The Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren finally came out with a plan for how to finance her Medicare for All plan without raising taxes, she says, for the middle class. Tell us about it.\n\nLIASSON: Well, that's right. She's been pressed on this for weeks and weeks. Bernie Sanders, who has a similar plan, says, yes, taxes would have to go up for everyone, including the middle class. But Warren says she has another way to not directly tax middle-class taxpayers.\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: All right. So no middle-class tax hike, apparently. Does that mean Medicare for All will be an easy sell in a general election?\n\nLIASSON: No, it doesn't. There are a lot of Democrats who are really worried that while Elizabeth Warren is clearly running a very skillful Democratic primary campaign, she is adopting proposals that will be extremely unpopular in a general election in battleground states like Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Even in Ohio, in a poll of Democrats only taken by The New York Times and Siena College, voters preferred, by a 14-point margin, to build on Obamacare and add a public option - in other words, a voluntary Medicare buy-in. They preferred that over Warren's mandatory Medicare for All plan where private insurance is abolished.\n\nAnd Democrats worry that when you dig into the details of Warren's pay-fors, there are a lot of taxes. Taxes go up on employers. That wealth tax on billionaires goes up from 3% to 6%. And even at - the Urban Institute, a liberal think tank, says that Warren has vastly underestimated the cost of this. She says it will be $20 trillion over a decade. They say it's actually 34 trillion.\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: Yeah. And speaking of how Democrats are seeing this, Nancy Pelosi, who is the most powerful Democrat in Washington, made her feelings about Medicare for All clear here on Bloomberg TV. Let's listen.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nNANCY PELOSI: I'm not a big fan of Medicare for All. I mean, I welcome the debate. I think that we should have health care for all. Myself, I think, remember November. This is a time when we have to win the Electoral College.\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: She's clearly linking this with winning the election.\n\nLIASSON: Yes, and she knows how to count votes. She said, as a left-wing San Francisco liberal, I can say to these people, what are you thinking?\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: That's NPR's national political correspondent Mara Liasson. Thanks, Mara.\n\nLIASSON: Thank you.\n\nCopyright © 2019 NPR. All rights reserved.

Supreme Court Appears Likely To Uphold Obamacare\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Alex Brandon/AP Alex Brandon/AP\n\nUpdated at 4:35 p.m.\n\nThe Supreme Court, with a newly constituted and far more conservative majority, took another look at Obamacare on Tuesday. But at the end of the day, even with three Trump appointees, the Affordable Care Act looked as though it may well survive.\n\nTo many, it may have seemed like déjà vu.\n\nYes, the Supreme Court did uphold Obamacare eight years ago. It ruled that the so-called individual mandate, requiring people either to have health insurance or pay a penalty, was constitutional because it amounted to a tax. But in 2017, Congress decided it did not need the penalty and zeroed it out. At the time, not only congressional leaders but also President Trump crowed about terminating the mandate.\n\nBut on Tuesday, the Trump administration and a group of GOP-dominated states, including Texas, were back in the high court with a new challenge. They contended that because the mandate language is still on the books, and because the mandate was so interwoven with other provisions of the Affordable Care Act, the whole law should be struck down in its entirety.\n\nDefending the law, California Solicitor General Michael Mongan, representing 20 states that support the ACA, set out the stakes.\n\nWhat's before the court today is an enormously consequential statute, he said. It provides health insurance and other lifesaving benefits and protections to hundreds of millions of Americans.\n\nAlso defending the law was the House of Representatives, and its lawyer, Donald Verrilli, who eight years ago successfully defended the mandate as the Obama administration's solicitor general. Chief Justice John Roberts reminded Verrilli of that argument.\n\nEight years ago, those defending the mandate emphasized that it was the key to the whole act, Roberts said. But now the representation is that, 'Oh no, everything's fine without it.' Why the bait and switch?\n\nVerrilli replied that in 2010 Congress made predictive judgments that the penalty was needed to get people to buy insurance, but in 2017 the Congressional Budget Office concluded that the market would remain the same even if the penalty were zeroed out.\n\nCongress is allowed to learn from empirical evidence ... and adjust its policy choices, Verrilli said. And that's what happened here.\n\nJustice Amy Coney Barrett wondered aloud why the court should not strike down the mandate since it raises no revenue now, and thus could no longer be justified under Congress' taxing power.\n\nBut when the lawyers seeking to have the whole law struck down began to argue, they ran into real pushback, and not just from the court's liberals.\n\nAddressing Texas Solicitor General Kyle Hawkins, Roberts said, I think it's hard for you to argue that Congress intended the entire act to fall if the mandate were struck down when the same Congress that lowered the penalty to zero did not even try to repeal the rest of the act.\n\nAnd with a jab at congressional Republicans, Roberts added, I think, frankly, that they wanted the court to do that. But that's not our job.\n\nMoments later, Roberts was even more explicit, pointing to what is called the court's doctrine of severability. It calls for the court to preserve the rest of a law when it can, even if one provision or another is struck down. Roberts explained that here, Congress left the rest of the law intact when it lowered the penalty to zero. That seems to be compelling evidence on the question.\n\nJustice Brett Kavanaugh echoed the chief justice's sentiments, saying, It does seem fairly clear that the proper remedy would be to sever the mandate provision and leave the rest of the act in place, the provisions regarding preexisting conditions and the rest.\n\nJustice Clarence Thomas chimed in with this question for the Texas solicitor general: The individual mandate now has no enforcement mechanism, so it's really hard to determine exactly what the threat is ... of action against you.\n\n\n\nJustice Sonia Sotomayor said that the argument for striking down the whole law, without proof of substantial harm to anyone, including Texas and other conservative states, did not make much sense. At some point, common sense seems to me would say, 'Huh?' \n\nAnd when the Trump administration's Jeffrey Wall, the acting solicitor general, weighed in, arguing for the whole law to be struck down, he took incoming flak even from Justice Samuel Alito.\n\nAt the time of the first case, there was a strong reason to believe that the individual mandate was like a part in an airplane that was essential to keep the plane flying, Alito said. But now the part has been taken out, and the plane has not crashed. So, if we were to decide this case the way you advocate, how would we explain why the individual mandate in its present form is essential to the operation of the act?\n\nA decision in the case is expected later in the term.
Former HHS Secretary Details To How Make State Of The Union Response Stand Out\n\nNPR's Lulu Garcia-Navarro asks former Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius about the challenge of giving a response to the State of the Union address.\n\nLULU GARCIA-NAVARRO, HOST:\n\nThe State of the Union is Tuesday. And afterwards, there'll be a response from the opposing party. We're curious about how these responses come together and why they're so hard to, let's say, hit out of the park. So we turn now to someone who's given one, Kathleen Sebelius. She was governor of Kansas in 2008 when she gave hers and later became President Obama's Health and Human Services secretary, the architect of Obamacare. Secretary, thank you so much for joining us.\n\nKATHLEEN SEBELIUS: Good to be with you, Lulu.\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: Former Georgia governor candidate Stacey Abrams will be speaking after the president this Tuesday night. And I guess the common sense advice is always be natural, be yourself, right? Remembering your response to President Bush in 2008, what's some advice you would have for Abrams?\n\nSEBELIUS: Well, I would start by saying it's a very tough gig. You get lots and lots and lots of advice from lots and lots and lots of people.\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: (Laughter).\n\nSEBELIUS: It just caused me to be I think more and more frozen about what this possibly meant. I was governor at the time. So the setting I thought would be sort of comfortable. But by the time all the lights and camera and makeup and everything else gets there, it doesn't feel like you're in a natural setting at all. Stacey is a not only very gifted speaker but a very smart, strategic Democrat. And I think whatever she chooses to say, I'm sure she will say eloquently.\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: Last year's respondent, Congressman Joe Kennedy, advises Abrams to misplace her Chapstick, of course, because his lips looked...\n\nSEBELIUS: (Laughter).\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: ...So shiny during his address. It was apparently all anyone could focus on. I'd like to know how these speeches come together. Aren't there people there to tell you that your lips are shiny? Who actually is in the room when you're giving this address?\n\nSEBELIUS: In my case, it was some of my family members, lots of strangers, crews and lighting and makeup. And they sort of take over. It's - it's just a difficult venue to appear natural, to be calm, whatever. The speech that I gave was widely panned appropriately for being too wooden and too repetitive and too whatever. I did get a call from a good friend who said, but your makeup looked terrific.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nSEBELIUS: I think he was searching for a compliment, and that's as close as he could get.\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: Keeping in mind all the grousing about how the State of the Union is less informative, that it's an infomercial for whoever - whatever president gives it, do you think the response is really necessary? Do you think it's - it's really a moment where you can engage the American people?\n\nSEBELIUS: Well, I thought it was really interesting - at least if the numbers are accurate - that the last time the president spoke to the nation and delivered a national security speech, which was, again, you know, some kind of infomercial for a wall and his particular and, I would say, somewhat peculiar view of what national security is all about, the response had more viewers than did the president's address. Clearly...\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: But there - they might have - they might have - there might have been a lot of people watching, but they were panned. I mean, people said that they looked strange and wooden. And also, is there - is there any way to really get a win out of this, I guess is the question.\n\nSEBELIUS: I thought the visuals were a little odd. But there is visuals. There is the message. There's - I think there probably is a need for some kind of response. And probably, if you've got eyeballs on the president, you want to take advantage of that and give some alternate and maybe reality-based view of the world.\n\nBut the speech is clearly not meant as a refute to the State of the Union because you have no idea - particularly this time - no idea what it is that this president may actually suggest to the American people. I think the best you can do - and I think Stacey will do a great job delivering this - is a message that can serve as an alternative vision for the country and where we need to go.\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: That's former HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius. Thank you so much.\n\nSEBELIUS: Great to talk to you, Lulu.\n\nCopyright © 2019 NPR. All rights reserved.

Fear And Loathing At The Supreme Court — What Is Chief Justice John Roberts Up To?\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Jabin Botsford/AFP/Getty Images Jabin Botsford/AFP/Getty Images\n\nWhat was he thinking? That is the question many are asking on both sides of the political spectrum.\n\nChief Justice John Roberts repeatedly voted with the Supreme Court's conservatives this term, except in one, and only one, 5-4 decision. Written by Roberts, the ruling blocked the addition of a citizenship question on the 2020 census, leaving an angry President Trump desperately trying to find a way around it.\n\nIt also left a lot of speculation about the motives of the chief justice.\n\nHe often does appear like he's very focused on his legacy and on being popular rather than on doing what a judge should do.\n\nFor some conservatives, Roberts' vote in the census case was another original sin, much like his vote in 2012 to uphold key provisions of Obamacare. The chairman of the American Conservative Union has even called for Roberts' impeachment.\n\nI'm for impeaching the Chief Justice for lying to all of us about his support of the Constitution, tweeted ACU Chairman Matt Schlapp. He's responsible for Robertscare and now he is angling for vast numbers of illegal residents to help Dems hold Congress.\n\nCurt Levey, president of the conservative Committee for Justice, doesn't go that far, but he said the census decision means that having a conservative majority on the court is still a dream rather than a reality.\n\nYet even Levey concedes that Roberts has been a reliable conservative vote on the court. Indeed, Roberts racked up an 80% rate of agreement with the court's other conservatives in all opinions, the same percentage as the court's most conservative justice, Clarence Thomas.\n\nAs for liberal, and moderate, advocates and activists, they were not exactly out there speaking about the chief justice in glowing terms. While relieved that the census looked — for now — immune to political machinations, they were infuriated by another, and perhaps even more important, Roberts opinion.\n\nTraitor or agenda-driven conservative?\n\nWriting for himself and the court's four other conservatives, the chief justice slammed the door shut on court challenges to extreme partisan gerrymanders. The decision will allow many state legislatures unfettered discretion to draw congressional and state legislative district lines so as to entrench their own political power.\n\nBecause Republicans now control state legislatures in 30 states, versus 18 controlled by Democrats, the decision is a boon to GOP power. (There are 22 states completely controlled by Republicans, and 14 where Democrats have total control).\n\nLaw A Recap Of The Supreme Court Term A Recap Of The Supreme Court Term Listen · 5:08 5:08\n\nIt isn't just liberals who have pushed for some court supervision of extreme partisan gerrymandering in an era of computer-driven hyper-partisanship.\n\nThere's no doubt there's an agenda here, said Harvard Law professor Charles Fried, who served for four years in the Reagan administration as solicitor general, the government's chief advocate in the Supreme Court.\n\nHe and other Republican former officeholders filed a brief on behalf of those challenging extreme partisan gerrymanders. Alluding to Roberts' famous confirmation hearing comment that the job of a judge is not to bat for one side but to call balls and strikes, Fried observes caustically, This is not balls and strikes. This is a long term, shrewdly played, but persistent program.\n\nThe agenda is to get the law, whether it's the courts, or the Constitution, or the legislators out of regulating anything to do with elections.\n\nFried catalogs Roberts' decisions in this regard. He wrote the court's 5-4 decision striking down the Voting Rights Act, a law passed and reenacted repeatedly by large and bipartisan congressional majorities. He wrote or participated in a series of decisions striking down longstanding, as well as newer, limits on campaign contributions, also enacted by Congress, and aimed at limiting the role of big money in politics.\n\nAnd when the court, by a 5-4 vote, upheld independent redistricting commissions established by voter referenda, Roberts wrote the dissent. The decisive fifth vote in that case was Justice Anthony Kennedy, now retired, and Fried worries that the 2015 decision is now in peril, even though Roberts, in the gerrymandering decision, pointed to the commissions as one way to take redistricting out of the hands incumbents.\n\nWhile Fried and others fret about what they see as Roberts' deviousness, Roberts' conservative critics are not the least bit appeased. They view him as something of a traitor, mainly for the Obamacare and census decisions.\n\nLevey, of the Committee for Justice, sees Roberts as a man more concerned with his image than the law.\n\nHe often does appear like he's very focused on his legacy and on being popular rather than on doing what a judge should do, Levey said, adding that all the pressure from the mainstream media and the establishment is to move left.\n\nMotivated by a Solomonic dogma?\n\nOthers, like Josh Blackman, a constitutional law professor at South Texas College of Law Houston, have a different view. Though Roberts has been dubbed the new swing justice, in the wake of Kennedy's retirement last year, Blackman thinks that is a misnomer.\n\nHe sees Kennedy and retired Justice Sandra Day O'Connor as actually somewhere in the middle, whereas Roberts is a solid conservative, but for whatever reason, in certain high-profile cases, he takes these very bizarre paths that no one else in the court goes along with.\n\nIt is true that nobody on the court went along with all of Roberts' reasoning in either the census case or the the Obamacare case.\n\nI think Roberts is motivated by some sort of Solomonic dogma, that in any given case of high note, Blackman said, that the correct decision is one where he splits the proverbial baby.\n\nOf course, chief justices — Republican and Democratic, liberal and conservative alike — have uniformly believed that they have a particular duty to maintain public confidence in the court as an institution.\n\nFor instance, in 2000, then-Chief Justice William Rehnquist, wrote the opinion upholding a decision he had long reviled, the decision that 34 years earlier required police to warn criminal suspects of their rights.\n\nAnd, in the 1930s Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes worked hard behind the scenes, on and off the court, to prevent President Franklin Roosevelt's court-packing plan from becoming law. Some historians believe that he was even instrumental in persuading one justice to moderate his views to defuse the threat.\n\nToday, Roberts faces similar threats: a president who openly and repeatedly castigates judges in partisan and even ethnic terms, and Democratic presidential contenders, who think the number of justices on the Supreme Court should be expanded by statute if the Democrats take control of the Senate. They argue that Republicans, by refusing for nearly a year to consider President Barack Obama's Supreme Court nominee, have so stacked the deck that the move is necessary.\n\nAs some who know Roberts observe, while this and other such proposals are still in their relative infancy, the chief justice cannot ignore the alarm bells. And he knows that if the court moves too far to the right and too fast, those bells will only ring louder.
Trump Is Trying Hard To Thwart Obamacare. How's That Going?\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption BRENDAN SMIALOWSKI/AFP via Getty Images BRENDAN SMIALOWSKI/AFP via Getty Images\n\nThe very day President Trump was sworn in — Jan. 20, 2017 — he signed an executive order instructing administration officials to waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay implementing parts of the Affordable Care Act, while Congress got ready to repeal and replace President Obama's signature health law.\n\nMonths later, repeal and replace didn't work, after the late Sen. John McCain's dramatic thumbs down on a crucial vote (Trump still frequently mentions this moment in his speeches and rallies, including in his recent speech on Medicare).\n\nAfter that, the president and his administration shifted to a piecemeal approach as they tried to take apart the ACA. ObamaCare is a broken mess, the president tweeted in the fall of 2017, after repeal in Congress had failed. Piece by piece, we will now begin the process of giving America the great HealthCare it deserves!\n\nTwo years later, what has his administration done to change the ACA, and who's been affected? Below are five of the biggest changes to the federal health law under President Trump.\n\n1. Individual mandate eliminated\n\nWhat is it? The individual mandate is the requirement that all U.S. residents either have health insurance or pay a penalty. The mandate was intended to help keep the premiums for ACA policies low by ensuring that more healthy people entered the health insurance market.\n\nWhat changed? The 2017 Republican-backed tax overhaul legislation reduced the penalty for not having insurance to $0.\n\nWhat does the administration say? We eliminated Obamacare's horrible, horrible, very expensive and very unfair, unpopular individual mandate. A total disaster. That was a big penalty. That was a big thing. Where you paid a lot of money for the privilege [...] of having no healthcare. — President Trump, The Villages, Florida, Oct. 3, 2019\n\nWhat's the impact? First of all, getting rid of the penalty for skipping insurance opened a new avenue of attack against the entire ACA in the courts, via the Texas v. Azar lawsuit. Back in 2012, the ACA had been upheld as constitutional by the U.S. Supreme Court, because the penalty was essentially a tax, and Congress is allowed to create a new tax. Last December, though, a federal judge in Texas ruled that now that the penalty is $0, it's a command, not a tax, and is therefore unconstitutional. He also reasoned that it cannot be cut off from the rest of the law, so he judged the whole law to be unconstitutional. A decision from the appeals court is expected any day now.\n\nEliminating the penalty also caused insurance premiums to rise, says Sabrina Corlette, director of the Center on Health Insurance Reforms at Georgetown University. Insurance companies were getting very strong signals from the Trump administration that even if the ACA wasn't repealed, the Trump administration probably was not going to enforce the individual mandate, she says. Insurance companies figured that without a financial penalty, healthy people would opt not to buy insurance, and the pool of those that remained would be smaller and sicker.\n\nSo, even though the $0 penalty didn't actually go into effect until 2019, Corlette says, insurance companies — in anticipation of the individual mandate going away and in anticipation that consumers would believe that the individual mandate was no longer going to be enforced — priced for that for 2018. According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, premiums went up about 32%, on average, for ACA silver plans that went into effect in early 2018, although most people received subsidies to offset those premium hikes.\n\n2. States allowed to add work requirements to Medicaid\n\nWhat is it? Medicaid expansion was a key part of the ACA. The federal government helped pay for states (that chose to) to expand Medicaid eligibility beyond families to include all low-income adults, and to raise the income threshold, so that more people would be eligible. So far, 37 states and Washington have opted to expand Medicaid.\n\nWhat changed? Under Trump, if they get approval from the federal government, states can now require Medicaid beneficiaries to prove with documentation that they either work or go to school.\n\nWhat does the administration say? When you consider that, less than five years ago, Medicaid was expanded to nearly 15 million new working-age adults, it's fair that states want to add community engagement requirements for those with the ability to meet them. It's easier to give someone a card; it's much harder to build a ladder to help people climb their way out of poverty. But even though it is harder, it's the right thing to do. — Seema Verma, administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, Washington, Sept. 27, 2018\n\nWhat's the impact? Even though HealthCare.gov and the state insurance exchanges get a lot of attention, the majority of people who gained health care coverage after the passage of the ACA — 12.7 million people — actually got their coverage by being newly able to enroll in Medicaid.\n\nMedicaid expansion has proven to be quite popular. And in the 2018 election, three more red states — Idaho, Nebraska and Utah — voted to join in. Right now, 18 states have applied to the federal government to implement work requirements; but most such programs haven't yet gone into effect.\n\nThe one work requirement program that's actually gone into effect is in Arkansas, says Nicholas Bagley, professor of law at the University of Michigan and a close follower of the ACA. We now have good data indicating that tens of thousands of people were kicked off of Medicaid, not because they were ineligible under the work requirement program, but because they had trouble actually following through on the reporting requirements — dealing with websites, trying to figure out how to report hours effectively, and all the rest.\n\nIf more states are able to implement work requirements, Bagley says, that could lead to the loss of coverage for tens of thousands — or even hundreds of thousands — of people.\n\nCMS administrator Verma has pushed back on the idea that these requirements are some subversive attempt to just kick people off of Medicaid. Instead, she says, their aim is to put beneficiaries in control with the right incentives to live healthier, independent lives.\n\nWork requirements in Arkansas and Kentucky were put on hold by a federal judge in March, and those cases are on appeal. The issue is likely headed to the Supreme Court.\n\n3. Cost-sharing reduction subsidies to insurers have ended\n\nWhat is it? Payments from the federal government to insurers to motivate them to stay in the ACA insurance exchanges and help keep premiums down.\n\nWhat changed? The Trump administration suddenly stopped paying these subsidies in 2017.\n\nWhat does the administration say? I knocked out the hundreds of millions of dollars a month being paid back to the insurance companies by politicians. ... This is money that goes to the insurance companies to line their pockets, to raise up their stock prices. And they've had a record run. They've had an incredible run, and it's not appropriate. — President Trump, the White House, Oct 17, 2017\n\nWhat's the impact? This change had a strange and unexpected impact on the new insurance markets set up by the ACA. Insurers were in a bind: They had to offer subsidies to low-income people applying for insurance, but the federal government was no longer reimbursing them.\n\nThe first thinking [was], 'Oh gosh, that's going to cause premiums to go up, and it's going to hurt the marketplace,'  says Christine Eibner, who tracks the ACA at the nonpartisan RAND corporation. What ended up happening is, insurers, by and large, addressed this by increasing the price of the silver plan on the health insurance exchanges.\n\nThis pricing strategy was nicknamed silver loading. Because the silver plan is the one used to calculate tax credits, the Trump administration still ended up paying to subsidize people's premiums, but in a different way. In fact, it has probably led to an increase in federal spending to help people afford marketplace premiums, Eibner says.\n\nWhere the real damage has been done is for folks who aren't eligible for subsidies — who are making just a little bit too much for those subsidies, Corlette adds. They really are priced out of comprehensive ACA-compliant insurance.\n\n4. Access to short-term skinny plans has been expanded\n\nWhat is it? The ACA initially established rules that health plans sold on HealthCare.gov and state exchanges had to cover people with preexisting conditions and had to provide certain essential benefits. President Obama limited any short-term insurance policies that did not provide those benefits to a maximum duration of three months. (The original idea of these policies is that they can serve as a helpful bridge for people between school and a job, for example.)\n\nWhat changed? The Trump administration issued a rule last year that allowed these short-term plans to last 364 days and to be renewable for three years.\n\nWhat does the administration say? We took swift action to open short-term health plans and association health plans to millions and millions of Americans. Many of these options are already reducing the cost of health insurance premiums by up to 60% and, really, more than that. — President Trump, The White House, June 14, 2019\n\nWhat's the impact? The new rule went into effect last October, though availability of these short-term or skinny plans varies depending on where you live — some states have passed their own laws that either limit or expand access to them. Some federal actuaries projected lots of people would leave ACA marketplaces to get these cheaper plans; they said that would likely increase the size of premiums paid by people who buy more comprehensive coverage on the ACA exchanges. But a recent analysis from the Kaiser Family Foundation finds that the ACA marketplaces have actually stayed pretty stable.\n\nStill, there's another consequence of expanding access to these less comprehensive plans: People who get these skinny plans aren't really fully protected in the event that they have a serious health condition and need to use their insurance, Eibner says. They may find that it doesn't cover everything that they would have been covered for under an ACA-compliant plan.\n\nFor instance, you might pay only $70 a month in premiums but have a deductible that's $12,500 — so if you get really sick or get into an accident, you could be in serious financial straits.\n\n5. Funds to facilitate HealthCare.gov sign-ups slashed\n\nWhat is it? The ACA created Navigator programs and an advertising budget to help people figure out specifics of the new federally run insurance exchanges and sign up for coverage.\n\nWhat changed? In August 2017, the administration significantly cut federal funding for these programs.\n\nWhat does the administration say? It's time for the Navigator program to evolve. ... This decision reflects CMS' commitment to put federal dollars for the federally facilitated Exchanges to their most cost effective use in order to better support consumers through the enrollment process. — CMS Administrator Seema Verma, written statement, July 10, 2018\n\nWhat's the impact? It's hard to document what the impact of this particular cut was on enrollment. The cuts were uneven, and some states and cities got creative to keep providing services. We have seen erosion in overall health insurance coverage, Corlette says. But it's hard to know whether that's the effect of the individual mandate going away, the short-term plans or the reductions in marketing and outreach — it's really hard to tease out the impact of those three changes.\n\nOverall, Nicholas Bagley says, the ACA has been pretty resilient to everything, so far, that the Trump administration has thrown at it. Some of Trump's efforts to hobble the law have been caught up in the courts; others have not gone into effect. And despite efforts to lure people away from the individual insurance marketplaces or to make ACA policies unaffordable, the marketplaces have proved themselves to be remarkably resilient, Corlette says.\n\nAbbe Gluck, director of the Solomon Center for Health Law and Policy at Yale, cautions that though the law has proven to be stronger than expected, all these actions by the Trump administration have, indeed, had an effect.\n\nThese actions have been designed to depress enrollment — they have depressed enrollment, she says. They have increased insurance prices. Also, the uninsured rate for U.S. residents also went up in 2018 for the first time since before the ACA was passed.\n\nDespite that, one of the things that has kept the marketplaces as strong as they are, Gluck notes, is that they're not all run by the federal government.\n\nSince the Affordable Care Act is implemented half by state governments — mostly blue states — those state governments have been able to resist these sabotaging efforts, Gluck says.\n\nThey have been able to extend enrollment, and they have been able to do outreach, because they run their own insurance markets. And in those states there is already evidence that sabotage attacks have not been felt as strongly.\n\nThe piecemeal attacks on the ACA have made many people nervous about the future of their health coverage, Gluck says. The most important theme of [Trump's] administration of the ACA has been to sow uncertainty into the market and destabilize the insurance pool, she says.\n\nWith open enrollment for 2020 health plans set to kick off in just a few weeks, Bagley wants people to know the ACA is still strong.\n\nThe federal health law has been battered, Bagley says. It has been bruised. But it is still very much alive.
Hillary Clinton Hitches Her Health Care Wagon To Obamacare\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Justin Sullivan/Getty Images Justin Sullivan/Getty Images\n\nHillary Clinton wants you to know that she was doing health care before health care was cool.\n\nYou know, before it was called Obamacare it was called Hillarycare, Clinton said recently at a rally in Elko, Nev.\n\nIt's a stock line these days in her stump speeches and debates.\n\nThe term Hillarycare was coined back in the 1990s, when Clinton tried and failed to restructure the U.S. health care system during her husband's first term as president. It was supposed to be an insult, but now she's embracing it.\n\nThat's because Clinton-the-presidential-candidate has made the Affordable Care Act — or Obamacare — the center of her health care plan.\n\nShe's not looking to be a revolutionary like her opponent, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. He wants to replace private health insurance with a universal health care system in which the government pays the bills.\n\nInstead, Clinton has gone all in with Obamacare, embracing the controversial health law and promising to defend and expand it.\n\nI am a staunch supporter of President Obama's principal accomplishment, namely the Affordable Care Act, she said in a debate in Milwaukee on Feb. 11.\n\nHer plan to expand Obamacare consists of a slew of wonky measures that together are intended to cut costs and improve coverage for patients.\n\nThere are as many as 20 separate proposals and none of them by themselves are giant proposals. Each one is an incremental step, says Drew Altman, president of the Kaiser Family Foundation. But taken together it actually is a significant package of what I think of as beyond the ACA, consumer-oriented proposals.\n\nAmong the ideas:\n\nCreate a tax credit for people whose out-of-pocket costs amount to more than 5 percent of their income.\n\nGuarantee three sick visits a year to a doctor without having to meet a deductible.\n\nEliminate drug companies' ability to deduct marketing costs from their taxes. No more discounts for all those TV ads hawking pills.\n\nRequire a minimum investment by pharmaceutical companies in research and development.\n\nMake it harder for health insurance companies to merge.\n\nAltman says Kaiser Family Foundation polls show voters are frustrated because they keep paying more for health care. Employers are shifting more and more of their health care costs onto employees. As a result, deductibles have more than tripled in the past 10 years and copays are also on the rise.\n\nClinton's proposals are designed to reduce those out-of-pocket costs.\n\nHer bona fides as knowledgeable on health insurance really are beyond question whether you agree with her proposals or not, says Henry Aaron, a health care economist at the Brookings Institution. And she understands that a lot of the changes are down in the weeds.\n\nBut this smorgasbord of tweaks doesn't generate huge applause like Sanders does when he promises free health care for everyone.\n\nAnd many in the health care industry — including drug manufacturers — are gearing up to oppose her proposals to reduce costs by putting tighter regulations on how they do business.\n\nPutting in place onerous regulations and mandates that make it harder to develop new treatments and cures for patients is the wrong approach, says Robert Zirkelbach, a spokesman with the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, the lobbying group for the drug industry.\n\nZirkelbach says medications hold down health costs because they keep people out of the hospital, which is far more expensive than almost any prescription drug. Clinton, he says, shouldn't be making drug companies the bad guys.\n\nThese proposals are being driven by the false notion that medicine spending is what is fueling rising health care costs in this country, Zirkelbach says.
The History Of 'Public Charge' Requirements In U.S. Immigration Law\n\nNPR's Mary Louise Kelly looks at the history of the public charge requirement in U.S. immigration law with Kunal Parker, historian at the University of Miami School of Law.\n\nAILSA CHANG, HOST:\n\nA bronze plaque at the Statue of Liberty reads, in part, give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free.\n\nMARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST:\n\nWords from the 1883 poem by Emma Lazarus, The New Colossus. Well, today, the acting head of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services offered a tweak to that poem.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)\n\nKEN CUCCINELLI: Give me your tired and your poor who can stand on their own two feet and who will not become a public charge.\n\nKELLY: Ken Cuccinelli speaking today on NPR's Morning Edition.\n\nCHANG: Cuccinelli was defending a new Trump administration rule, the so-called public charge rule that will make it harder for immigrants who have used safety net programs like Medicaid or food stamps to stay permanently in this country. He says even though the rule is new, it's based on a concept as old as Emma Lazarus' poem.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)\n\nCUCCINELLI: It's a privilege we've offered to people all around the world for the entire duration of our history. But that privilege has - starts with certain expectations. And for the last 140 years, among those expectations is that the people who will come here will not become a burden on the taxpayers and the government. And again, that doesn't seem like too much to ask as we open our doors currently to more than a million new people a year that they not become a burden on an already, frankly, overburdened and bankrupt welfare system.\n\nKELLY: To gauge reaction to this definition of who gets to be a permanent U.S. resident, we went out to the southern tip of Manhattan to find people waiting in line to get on a boat and see the Statue of Liberty.\n\nCHANG: We met Armando Blancas (ph) of California. He says he doesn't think newcomers should draw upon public benefits at all.\n\nARMANDO BLANCAS: You know, I was born here. My kids couldn't go to summer school or, you know, get free college and all that, you know, so, I mean, why do we have to pay for that?\n\nCHANG: Josiah Folsom (ph) of Oregon says people who come to the U.S. should expect to work hard when they get here.\n\nJOSIAH FOLSOM: And I feel like that's what the Statue of Liberty represents. You know, it's a land of opportunity. People come here to work to earn, you know, a new life. You know, new lives aren't just handed out. You have to work for it.\n\nKELLY: Others saw this path from foreigner to American differently. Here's Arianna Imayan (ph) of nearby Long Island, N.Y.\n\nARIANNA IMAYAN: We're all immigrants, and I don't think that people should be discriminated against based on, like, their ethnicity or their pay grade or whatever. You work your way up here.\n\nCHANG: Some thoughts there about whether immigrants should be allowed to stay here if they draw upon public benefits.\n\nKELLY: Now let's dig deeper into the history of this public charge rule. And to do that, I am joined by Kunal Parker. He's an immigration historian and professor at the University of Miami School of Law.\n\nProfessor Parker, welcome.\n\nKUNAL PARKER: Thank you for having me.\n\nKELLY: So take us back to the 1880s when Congress passed the first U.S. general immigration law, as we heard Ken Cuccinelli saying there, it did include a public charge provision designed to keep out certain immigrants. What did it say?\n\nPARKER: So the law that was passed in 1882 excluded from entry into the United States, quote, any convict, lunatic, idiot or any person unable to take care of himself or herself without becoming a public charge. And that language has been a feature of federal immigration law ever since. But there's a lot more to be said about that, largely because the federal law itself built upon centuries of practice at the state and local level.\n\nKELLY: So this was being handled at a local level by cities, by towns, but this was the first time that the federal government tried to take it on. Is that right?\n\nPARKER: That is correct. Post-Civil War, the federal government monopolizes immigration restriction.\n\nKELLY: And you mentioned this was post-Civil War. What was public sentiment in the 1880s toward immigrants?\n\nPARKER: Public sentiment towards immigrants obviously varied depending on who you are.\n\nKELLY: Sure. Then as now.\n\nPARKER: Right. Then as now. Immigration largely at this point was from Northern and Western Europe. But it was beginning to consist increasingly of immigrations from Southern and Eastern Europe, as well as from Asia. And there was a lot more negative sentiment towards immigrants from the east and south of Europe and from Asia.\n\nKELLY: A nativist sentiment we might refer to it as.\n\nPARKER: Exactly.\n\nKELLY: So did this law then sit there on the books for the next century or so, or has it been modified and changed over the years?\n\nPARKER: So the law has been on the books, and it was also applied, right? But the point is that it was applied in ways that might be a little bit different from the ways in which Mr. Cuccinelli is thinking about it, which is that it is true that immigration officials would exclude people whom they thought were likely to be public charges. This usually involves checking whether an entering immigrant had cash or whether they were ill, you know, whether they looked like they would turn to assistance, right? But it's important to keep in mind that this was before the rise of the modern welfare states.\n\nKELLY: You're saying the very way we think about what would count as a public charge has changed dramatically in all those years.\n\nPARKER: Particularly if you think about what the proposed rule is going to target, it includes things like general welfare, food stamps, Medicaid, the earned income tax credit. None of this stuff was around then.\n\nKELLY: So I want to focus us in on one particular year, 1996, because Ken Cuccinelli also referenced that year, and he referenced a law from that year in our interview with him this morning.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)\n\nCUCCINELLI: We implement - a 1996 law passed on a bipartisan basis, and the guidance that was put in place after that law passed has proven ineffective. And this rule will make that law effective.\n\nKELLY: What is the 1996 law that he's talking about?\n\nPARKER: So in 1996, Congress passed the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act which was a massive overhaul of the welfare system. Essentially, what the law provided was that most legal immigrants were going to be ineligible to receive a range of benefits for the first five years of U.S. residence. What Mr. Cuccinelli might not have mentioned - I'm not sure - is that many of those benefits were reinstated in 2002. Also what the new Trump rule is targeting is obviously things like Obamacare subsidies, which weren't in existence in 1996.\n\nKELLY: Right. And to fact-check one other thing that Mr. Cuccinelli told us, he said most Americans get that this is the way this country has worked for the last 140 years, that people entering the U.S. should not enter and then become a burden on American taxpayers and the government. Is that historically accurate? Is that the way...\n\nPARKER: No.\n\nKELLY: ...Public opinion trended in the 19th century?\n\nPARKER: No, it's not. And it's certainly not true of the way public sentiment has trended. And it turns out that most communities were entirely supportive of European immigrants receiving welfare. But it certainly - if his suggestion is that this is sort of universal in all times in all contexts, that I would disagree with.\n\nKELLY: That's professor Kunal Parker of the University of Miami School of Law.\n\nThank you.\n\nPARKER: Thank you.\n\nCopyright © 2019 NPR.

Morning News Brief\n\nFlorida's House rejected a measure banning assault-style rifles, like the one used in last week's shooting. The president is directing the Justice Department to develop regulations to ban bump stocks.\n\nRACHEL MARTIN, HOST:\n\nOne week after the school shooting in Florida, the renewed push for gun law changes is getting mixed results.\n\nSTEVE INSKEEP, HOST:\n\nYeah. Yesterday, members of Florida's House overwhelmingly voted not to consider a bill that would ban assault-style rifles like the one used in last week's shooting. Students from Parkland, Fla., were in the gallery for that vote, and today some of them meet lawmakers. Kyle Kashuv made the trip to Tennessee (ph) and says his opposition to gun laws has changed.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nKYLE KASHUV: I've been a strong Trump supporter. Someone like myself has been able to go to the middle ground and understand that there needs to be changes. That's great. And that really shows how important what we're doing right now is.\n\nINSKEEP: In Washington, there was a sign of movement yesterday. It came from President Trump who says he is ready to ban bump stocks.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I signed a memorandum directing the attorney general to propose regulations to ban all devices that turn legal weapons into machine guns.\n\nINSKEEP: Bump stocks are those attachments that cause a semi-automatic rifle to fire like a machine gun. A man in Las Vegas, you may recall, used bump stocks last fall while spraying bullets into a crowd with multiple weapons.\n\nThe president also said he supports stronger background checks - though on this day that the president meets survivors of mass shootings, it is an open question which laws could change.\n\nMARTIN: All right, let's get into it with NPR's Greg Allen. He is in Florida. He's been covering all of this. We're also joined on the line by NPR White House correspondent Tamara Keith. Good morning to both of you.\n\nTAMARA KEITH, BYLINE: Good morning.\n\nGREG ALLEN, BYLINE: Good morning.\n\nMARTIN: All right, I want to start with you, Tam. You have looked at President Trump's memo on bump stocks. What exactly is he proposing? And when would this happen - question mark?\n\nKEITH: When is a big question mark. And what is sort of a question mark, too. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives in December began a review process of these bumps stocks. That process is ongoing. And basically, the president's memo says hurry up and...\n\nMARTIN: Hurry up and do it.\n\nKEITH: ...Act and...\n\nMARTIN: Finish your review.\n\nKEITH: ...He would like...\n\nMARTIN: (Laughter).\n\nKEITH: Hurry up and do it...\n\nINSKEEP: Oh, so he ordered...\n\nKEITH: ...And he would like ATF...\n\nINSKEEP: ...Them to do something they're already doing. OK.\n\nKEITH: Yes. And - but he is taking a position. He is saying that he would like the Justice Department to put out for notice for public comment a rule banning all devices that can turn legal weapons into machine guns. But there is a very big question here, which is whether ATF actually has the authority to do that. It has found over the years that it doesn't have that authority. And some are saying that legislation is really the only way to legally do this.\n\nMARTIN: So also - the president tweeted yesterday on the issue of gun control. He said the following - whether we are Republican or Democrat, we must now focus on strengthening background checks.\n\nOK. So how significant is that tweet? Is he talking about any kind of specific legislation here?\n\nKEITH: What he appears to be talking about - Sarah Sanders, the press secretary, said that he is supportive of making the background checks system more efficient and looking at better ways to improve that process. So not expanding background checks - who would be subjected to them, how they would work - but simply there's legislation out there from Senators Cornyn and Murphy that would basically tell states and local governments and federal agencies to follow the existing law and encourage them to do that. And that appears to be what the president is supportive of.\n\nMARTIN: OK. Meanwhile, at the state level, let's talk about what happened in Florida, Greg. The Florida House yesterday refused to even consider this piece of legislation that would have banned assault-style rifles. Right? What were the arguments against this measure?\n\nALLEN: Right. Well, this is a bill that was introduced last year by Democrats, and it was bottled up in committee. It was really going nowhere. Even after the Parkland shooting, there had been no hearing scheduled. So the people who supported it - it kind of a desperation move to take it out of committee. They had a vote to take it out of committee and take it directly to the House floor. It'd be very unusual, somewhat of a desperation measure, I think as much as getting the votes on the record as anything else. And it failed on a largely party-line vote. But as you noted at the top, there were some Parkland students in the gallery, and there was some great disappointment and some tears when that happened.\n\nMARTIN: Right. So the governor of Florida, Rick Scott, has said in the wake of the shooting that, quote, everything is on the table in regards to gun policy. So what does that mean, especially in light of yesterday's vote?\n\nALLEN: Well, you know, a ban on high-powered rifles like the AR-15 that was used last week in Parkland is a real long shot here. This is a state with a long history of supporting gun rights legislation. You know, this is where they developed the stand your ground law, for instance. There's a real...\n\nMARTIN: That was instrumental in the Trayvon Martin shooting.\n\nALLEN: That's right. Yeah. And there's a bill right now, for example, moving in the legislature that would allow people with conceal-carry permits to bring their guns to church. Although there was one that would allow certain teachers to bring them to school, that one has been postponed for now. So they are taking some notice of it. But you know, that said, lawmakers are sobered by last week's shooting. And they're talking about limiting firearm sales and taking steps to keep them out of the hands of the mentally ill.\n\nMARTIN: I mean. They're going to have this meeting. Right? Like, these students from Parkland who are in that gallery, they're going to meet face to face with lawmakers in Florida today. That's going to be emotional, I imagine.\n\nALLEN: Oh, yeah. And the people - and they're listening here. There's - the governor says he's going to have a proposal on Friday. And the legislature - or the lawmakers - Republican lawmakers, who control both chambers, are looking at several measures to limit sales here.\n\nMARTIN: So meanwhile in D.C., Tam, another meeting is happening, some more listening. The president is supposed to meet with a group of people from Parkland. Who's going to be in this?\n\nKEITH: Yeah. So this is a listening session with parents, teachers and students. What the White House is saying - that it will include members of the Parkland community as well as individuals who were impacted by past school shootings. That includes Columbine and Sandy Hook.\n\nINSKEEP: For better or worse, of course, making law is a process. It can be a very long process. We're at a point now where the president of the United States has been signaling that he is willing to go for change, willing to push for change. But we should note that there was a time when he was eager for changes to Obamacare, which did not get through Congress. There was a time when he signaled eagerness to help DACA recipients, and that hasn't happened either necessarily. So he...\n\nMARTIN: Right. Listening is one thing.\n\nINSKEEP: Yeah, exactly.\n\nMARTIN: We'll see what actually happens. All right, NPR correspondent Greg Allen reporting from Tallahassee, and we were also joined by Tamara Keith.\n\nThanks so much to both of you.\n\nALLEN: You're welcome.\n\nKEITH: You're welcome.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)\n\nMARTIN: All right, we're going to turn now to Damascus, the capital of Syria. There is a suburb around Damascus that is currently being bombarded.\n\nINSKEEP: It's called eastern Ghouta. It's home to nearly 400,000 civilians, and it's been controlled for some time by rebel forces. For the past couple of days, the Syrian government has been bombing that area - warplanes overhead. Videos from that suburb show streets filled with hunks of concrete from blasted out buildings and rescue workers pulling survivors from the buildings that remain. According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, more than 200 people have been killed just since Sunday.\n\nMARTIN: OK. Let's turn to NPR's Ruth Sherlock.\n\nRuth, what more can you tell us about what's happening in this town, Ghouta?\n\nRUTH SHERLOCK, BYLINE: Hi. Yes. Well, it is a relentless campaign there. As you said, you know, these airstrikes are hitting civilian buildings. Hospitals have also been hit - several. The Union of Medical Care and Relief Organization, which has aid groups running hospitals there, said that eight hospitals have been hit just in the last couple of days. We spoke - and there's also lots of children dying. There's terrible images on social media of corpses of small children who were killed in the airstrikes. We spoke with one little girl, Nour (ph). She's 12 years old. We found her through activists, and she was with her mother at the time. She says she's in Ghouta, and she told us about what it feels like to be there.\n\nNOUR: (Foreign language spoken).\n\nSHERLOCK: Here she says, I'm so, so scared. She says she's hiding under the stairwell 'cause there's no basement. She's hiding under the stairwell from the airstrikes. And she just appeals to the world asking for help.\n\nMARTIN: Why is this particular place a target right now, Ruth?\n\nSHERLOCK: Well, as you said, you know, this area has been held by rebel groups. And it's one of the last main rebel-held areas in Syria. And it still threatens the government. And it's right on the outskirts of Damascus. So now, it seems, that this air offensive is basically a prelude to a ground attack.\n\nThere's this guy General Suheil al-Hassan who's become the leader of one of the government's main militias fighting there, called the Tiger Force. And he's filmed in a video giving this speech of fiery rhetoric. He's saying, I promise I will teach them a lesson in combat and fire. And you won't find a rescuer. And if you do, you'll be rescued with water that feels like boiling oil. You'll be rescued with blood. So they're saying that troops are amassing on the border there.\n\nThe U.N. has appealed for a ceasefire. But so far, few have heeded that - no one seems to have heeded their calls.\n\nMARTIN: Wow - so a ground war - so more people dying, most likely.\n\nSHERLOCK: Yeah.\n\nMARTIN: Meanwhile, the Syrian government is also working on taking back territory elsewhere in the country - right? - in the north around a place called Afrin. What can you tell us about that?\n\nSHERLOCK: Yes, exactly. And this war is complicated, and there are many countries now involved, many different interests. Here we're talking about Afrin, which is a town near the Turkish border. And in recent weeks, Turkish troops have been attacking that area because it's run by a Kurdish militia. And they - the YPG, whom Turkey considers a terrorist organization - the YPG was losing ground there. And it's desperate not to lose to the Turks.\n\nSo as a kind of half-measure, or compromise, they've invited in the Syrian government militias into the town. But this means that now Turkey and the Syrian regime are in the position to be fighting each other directly, which is a whole new complication in the conflict. And so - you know, the regime is getting the upper hand, but this war is far from over.\n\nMARTIN: NPR's Ruth Sherlock.\n\nThanks so much, Ruth. We appreciate it.\n\nSHERLOCK: Thank you.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF B-SIDE'S THOUGHTFUL)\n\nCopyright © 2018 NPR. All rights reserved.

Politics Chat: A Look At Trump And Biden's Election Strategies Amid The Pandemic\n\nWe look at President's re-election strategy now that the economy isn't making a fast recovery and coronavirus cases are rising. We also look at his rival, Vice President Joe Biden's policy agendas.\n\nLULU GARCIA-NAVARRO, HOST:\n\nIt is a year and an election year like none other. More than 140,000 people have died in the United States from the coronavirus. The number of daily deaths continues to rapidly climb, so much so that the CDC is now projecting by August 8, there could be as many as 170,000 deaths. Millions of Americans are infected, and millions are out of work. NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson is with us now.\n\nGood morning.\n\nMARA LIASSON, BYLINE: Good morning, Lulu.\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: Those are sobering numbers. It seems clear now that the president knows he cannot tell this triumphant story that he was hoping to tell on beating the pandemic or bringing about an economic recovery.\n\nLIASSON: That's right. The president originally wanted to run on a kind of triumphant story about the great economy. Then he wanted to run on a COVID-going-away story or an economy-bouncing-back story. Right now, both of those are very hard, if not impossible, for him to do.\n\nAnd this was the week that the polls really got worse for the president. Remember, polls are a snapshot, not a prediction. But two polls showed him with a - with Joe Biden with a double-digit lead over President Trump. And the NBC/Wall Street Journal poll showed that people think the country is on the wrong track by 72%. That's very high. And it's never a good sign for an incumbent.\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: Let's talk about the Democratic nominee, Vice President Joe Biden. He has been rolling out his policies. In a TV interview today, the - President Trump took a shot at Vice President Biden's police reforms that he has proposed with Fox News's Chris Wallace refuting his claims. Let's listen.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: And Biden wants to defund the police.\n\nCHRIS WALLACE: Sir, he does not.\n\nTRUMP: Look. He signed a charter with Bernie Sanders.\n\nWALLACE: It says nothing about defunding the police.\n\nTRUMP: Oh, really? It says abolish. It says - let's go.\n\nWALLACE: All right. Well...\n\nTRUMP: Get me the charter, please.\n\nWALLACE: All right.\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: Well, Biden's charter indeed does not say anything about defunding the police. So what does it say?\n\nLIASSON: Joe Biden has been very clear that he opposes the defund the police movement, but he has said that some funding for police departments should be redirected to other services like counseling, mental health care. He has also said that police forces are too heavily armed with militarized equipment. He's talked about - he says, the last thing you need is an up-armored Humvee coming into your neighborhood. So that's where he is. He has not been in favor of defunding the police or abolishing the police.\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: He's rolled out a number of other policy agendas as well. What can you tell us about those? Are they just an indictment of President Trump's policies, or does he lay out his own vision for the future?\n\nLIASSON: No. Joe Biden is trying to go beyond a heavily anti-Trump measure and lay out his own vision for the future. He has talked about much more government investment in the economy, in low-income housing, in low-income schools, free community college. He has not endorsed the Green New Deal, but he has come out with a pretty ambitious environmental agenda. He wants to cut U.S. carbon emissions by 2050. He wants to spend $500 million on solar panels.\n\nOn health care, he has still stuck to the middle ground in the Democratic debate. He doesn't want mandatory Medicare for All, but he does want to add a public option to Obamacare. And he has tried to stick to the middle ground on things like fracking. He doesn't want an outright ban, but no new permits on federal lands.\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: Finally, Mara, we only have a few seconds left. The president was silent for a long time on the death of Congressman John Lewis. It was at least half a day before he tweeted very brief condolences.\n\nLIASSON: He did tweet out something that was grammatically strange. He said, quote, saddened to hear the news of civil rights hero John Lewis passing. Melania and I send our prayers to he and his family. And he also ordered American flags to be flown at half-staff for the rest of the day on Saturday yesterday.\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: And that is national political correspondent Mara Liasson.\n\nThank you so much.\n\nLIASSON: Thank you.\n\nCopyright © 2020 NPR.

Trump Administration Clears The Way For Medicaid Block Grants\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Mandel Ngan/AFP via Getty Images Mandel Ngan/AFP via Getty Images\n\nThe Trump administration wants to dramatically alter the way the federal government gives money to states for Medicaid.\n\nOn Thursday, Seema Verma, the administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, announced a new pathway for states to receive a capped amount of federal dollars for part of the program. The new demonstration program, called Healthy Adult Opportunity, would not be mandatory for states and would not affect all Medicaid beneficiaries, only adults under age 65 who are not disabled.\n\nBut for states that adopt the new approach, it could profoundly reshape how Medicaid operates.\n\nMedicaid covers health care for 71 million people across the country — most are low-income people, disabled people, and children. It's set up as a federal-state partnership — a state contributes money to cover its Medicaid population, and the federal government matches that contribution using a formula based on a state's per capita income. Therefore, low-income states get more from the federal government than high-income states do.\n\nThere is currently no limit to what the federal government contributes — Medicaid beneficiaries across the country have a right to whatever care they need for however long they need it.\n\nWith the announcement, CMS is inviting states to design Medicaid plans that work with a new capped-funding approach; they have flexibility in how they design these plans and could be exempted from certain Medicaid requirements. For example, the plan would allow states to create a formulary to pick and choose which drugs are covered — normally Medicaid covers all drugs.\n\nIn her remarks, Verma anticipated critics who might consider this an attack on the safety net. She spoke passionately about the purpose of Medicaid, calling it a lifeline for millions of Americans.\n\nBut she justified the new approach as a means to ensure financial sustainability for the program in the long term by letting states operate with a defined budget. This has historically been called a block grant, but Verma was careful not to mention those words in her remarks.\n\nThe Healthy Adult Opportunity represents an innovative and historic approach to surmounting Medicaid's structural challenges, she said.\n\nWith this announcement, the Trump administration is delivering on a longtime conservative ideal — block grants for Medicaid have been discussed for nearly as long as Medicaid has existed, going back to the Nixon administration. Every time, either Congress or the White House has declined to take the plunge, and Medicaid has remained open-ended.\n\nWhen enrollment goes up or during an economic downturn or the cost of prescription drugs go up, it costs the states more money to finance their programs, but the federal government matches those dollars to states, said Robin Rudowitz, vice president of the Kaiser Family Foundation and co-director of the foundation's program on Medicaid and the uninsured.\n\nWhether Thursday's announcement will upend that system depends on what states do with the new guidance. States will have to ask CMS for a waiver and wait for approval. It's usually a lengthy process, although on Thursday, Verma indicated the agency would be attempting to streamline things by creating a template application. Most likely, it will be months before this plan could go into effect in a state.\n\nThere's also a question about whether this would be legal. Another major initiative from Verma to transform Medicaid was permission for states to get a waiver to make work requirements part of the program. That effort has been blocked in the courts and is currently on appeal.\n\nOne the few states that put into effect a work requirement — a requirement for some beneficiaries to report that they are working, going to school or doing community service — was Arkansas, and one analysis found thousands of people lost their health coverage as a result.\n\nThat has created the legal challenge for the government. The legal argument against them, which has made headway in courts, is that work requirements fail to promote the objectives of the Medicaid program, which is primarily to provide affordable health coverage to low income people, said Rudowitz.\n\nOklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt joined Verma at Thursday's announcement, calling the new approach to Medicaid a game-changer. He said his state hopes to be among the first in the nation to apply for the waiver. Stitt, a Republican, is promoting his Medicaid plan as an alternative to a measure on the ballot in the upcoming election to expand Medicaid in his state, a move he said would be wrong and will be ineffective.\n\nHe said the waiver would allow the state to innovate, including finding new ways to contain costs and adding premiums and work requirements to the plan for adults. He said his approach will create expectations for able-bodied individuals to see this as a true trampoline to their future.\n\nThis move is geared toward red-state governors like Stitt, said Jamila Michener, an assistant professor of government at Cornell University. They can't outright support Medicaid expansion or support Obamacare, also known as the Affordable Care Act, she said. Work requirements were a way for them to kind of help save face, to expand Medicaid, but still be able to make it appear as though they were remaining true to their conservative bona fides. Now that work requirements are tied up in litigation, this presents another way to accomplish a similar political goal, she says.\n\nPast efforts through the decades to institute block grants in Medicaid have come through Congress and would have changed Medicaid in all states at once — most recently in 2017 as part of the plan to repeal and replace Obamacare. Since states will have to apply for the Healthy Adult Opportunity waiver, this won't change Medicaid in many states that don't opt in. (Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, for one, tweeted, Hard pass.)\n\nCritics responded quickly to Thursday's announcement. Eagan Kemp, health care policy advocate with the liberal advocacy group Public Citizen, called the program a Medicaid block grant by another name.\n\nEdwin Park of the Georgetown University Center for Children and Families said this kind of arrangement is a bad deal for states. [They're] placing a fiscal straitjacket on themselves that will only lead to eventual cuts to their programs and harmful effects to their budgets, he said.\n\nIt's a political risk for the Trump administration as well. Polling suggests that Medicaid is very popular and that capping federal spending in the program is not. Medicaid is more popular than it has ever been because people understand that if it's not their immediate family, their kids, it's their parents, it's neighbors and others who rely on the program, Park adds.\n\nMichener pointed out the wonkiness of this move might insulate it from the disapproval of voters in an election year.\n\nIf there's a way to get at Medicaid, which is what this administration [has been] trying to do the entire time, then this is the way, she said. And it helps, she adds, that the Trump administration can make this change on its own: You don't have to fight Congress — like you did with repeal and replace — and lose in the end.
Who Is The Senate Parliamentarian Who Ruled Against A Minimum Wage Increase?\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption J. Scott Applewhite/AP J. Scott Applewhite/AP\n\nThe Senate parliamentarian, a critical but often low-profile arbiter of the chamber's procedural actions, is the subject of frustration from some liberals after a crucial blow to Democrats' agenda late Thursday.\n\nElizabeth MacDonough is the unelected, nonpartisan interpreter of chamber rules, commonly referred to as the Senate referee. She nixed a Democratic push to add a $15-an-hour federal minimum wage increase to President Biden's $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package, dubbed the American Rescue Plan.\n\nThe reason?\n\nShe said it did not meet the strict requirements of reconciliation, a fast-track process that allows the majority party to pass big-ticket legislation with a simple 51-vote majority.\n\nMacDonough's decision has thrust her into the spotlight, especially as some progressives have called for her decision to be ignored, and for Vice President Harris, who serves as the president of the Senate, to overrule her. Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., called for MacDonough to be replaced.\n\nThe White House issued a statement saying the president was disappointed in the ruling but respects the parliamentarian's decision.\n\nWho is Elizabeth MacDonough?\n\nMacDonough is the first woman to serve as Senate parliamentarian. She was named to the job in 2012, when Democrats were in control of the chamber.\n\nHer predecessor, Alan Frumin, actually held the position twice.\n\nHis second stint came about in 2001 following the Republican ouster of then-parliamentarian Robert Dove. Dove angered the GOP majority, including Majority Leader Trent Lott, for rulings that made it difficult to push President George W. Bush's budget and tax agenda through an evenly split Senate, according to The Washington Post.\n\nMacDonough is a career civil servant who previously served as a reference assistant in the Senate Library. She studied at George Washington University, where she earned a degree in English literature. and later attended Vermont Law School, according to her profile on LinkedIn.\n\nShe briefly served as an assistant district counsel for the U.S. Justice Department before taking a position as senior assistant parliamentarian in 1999. It was a post she would hold for the 13 years, before being assuming her current role.\n\nRefereeing Obamacare fight\n\nThe ruling against congressional Democrats' prized push to boost the federal minimum wage is not the first time MacDonough has been in the spotlight.\n\nIn a 2015 profile, Politico said, She may very well be the most powerful person in Washington in determining how far Republicans can go in trying to repeal Obamacare.\n\nAs The Wall Street Journal recently wrote, when Republicans attempted to repeal the Affordable Care Act, they ran into issues rolling back the individual mandate portion of the law.\n\nHowever, after the GOP majority conferred with MacDonough, it decided to leave the mandate intact, but ultimately reduced the penalty to $0, effectively making the penalty moot.\n\nBipartisan praise\n\nMacDonough has largely been considered a steady and measured Senate presence.\n\nIn the mid-1990s, when then-Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., and the chamber's then-Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., both praised MacDonough before she left for law school.\n\nThe Senate will lose one of its most dedicated floor staffers today, Dole said, according to an Aug. 5, 1995, congressional record.\n\nIn addition to her duties preparing the morning business section of the RECORD, Liz can be found sitting at the corner of the Reporters' table in the well of the Senate, listening intently to our every word, ready to chase us down to retrieve those materials we have asked to have printed in the RECORD. We will miss her dedication and wonderful sense of humor, Dole said.\n\nDaschle added: She has been a delight to work with. We wish her well as she goes on to school and hope that she comes back frequently. She has been a very, very important member of the floor staff, and we are delighted to have had the opportunity to work with her.\n\nNPR's Jane Gilvin and Mary Glendinning contributed research for this report.
Trump Picks Kavanaugh To Replace Retiring Justice Kennedy\n\nPresident Trump's Supreme Court pick is almost certainly going to be more conservative than Anthony Kennedy, the justice who is retiring at the end of July.\n\nNOEL KING, HOST:\n\nPresident Trump has picked Judge Brett Kavanaugh as his second nominee to the Supreme Court. Now, interestingly, Kavanaugh was not on President Trump's original list of potential Supreme Court picks. But then in November of 2017, in anticipation of a possible second Supreme Court appointment, his name was added to the list. NPR's legal affairs correspondent Nina Totenberg has the story.\n\nNINA TOTENBERG, BYLINE: Trump may have campaigned as an outsider, but Kavanaugh is a creature of Washington with deep political roots in Republican politics. In a city full of people clawing their way to the top, Kavanaugh has risen steadily upwards through hard work and without appearing driven. His performance last night was Exhibit A in why he's been so successful. He was witty, warm, graceful and gracious, teased his two daughters, and praised his wife and his mother. Indeed, he hit all the right notes for a guy who knows that an army of women's groups are lining up in opposition to his nomination, in part because the president who's nominated him pledged during the 2016 campaign to name Supreme Court justices who would overrule the Supreme Court's 1973 abortion decision Roe v. Wade. Kavanaugh began by pointing to his mother, a onetime public high school teacher turned lawyer and judge, or as the nominee put it last night...\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nBRETT KAVANAUGH: The president introduced me tonight as Judge Kavanaugh, but to me, that title always belonged to my mom.\n\nTOTENBERG: He went on to note that he'd taught hundreds of students at Harvard Law School over the years, pointedly observing that the dean who hired him was Elena Kagan, later named to the Supreme Court by Barack Obama. And he said he was proud of the fact that in his 12 years on the appeals court, a majority of his law clerks have been women. Even as he was saying this, protesters were rallying outside the Supreme Court, demanding that Roe be protected.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF PROTEST)\n\nUNIDENTIFIED PROTESTERS: (Chanting) Protect Roe now. Protect Roe now.\n\nTOTENBERG: If anyone is prepared to face the onslaught that faces him, it is Brett Kavanaugh. After clerking for Justice Anthony Kennedy, the man he's been nominated to succeed, Kavanaugh worked for special prosecutor Kenneth Starr investigating President Clinton. After a brief stint in private practice, he then went to work for the Bush-Cheney campaign, was a foot soldier in the Florida election recount and worked on the celebrated Bush v. Gore Supreme Court case that decided the outcome of the 2000 election. He went on to serve in top positions in the Bush White House, was nominated in 2003 for the federal appeals court in D.C., but faced strong opposition from Democrats and was not confirmed until 2006. Even then, it was a tough haul with hostile questioning from some of the same Democrats who will lead the opposition this time, Democrats like Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer, who asked him 12 years ago if he considered Roe to be an abomination.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nKAVANAUGH: On the question of Roe v. Wade, if confirmed to the D.C. Circuit, I would follow Roe v. Wade faithfully and fully. That would be binding precedent of the court. It's been decided by the Supreme Court.\n\nCHUCK SCHUMER: I asked you your own opinion.\n\nKAVANAUGH: And I'm saying if I were confirmed to the D.C. Circuit, Senator, I would follow would follow it. It's been reaffirmed many times.\n\nSCHUMER: I understand, but what is your opinion?\n\nKAVANAUGH: I don't think it would be appropriate for me to give a...\n\nSCHUMER: Not the going to answer the question.\n\nKAVANAUGH: ...Personal view on that case.\n\nTOTENBERG: As tough as the questioning was then, Supreme Court precedent is binding on lower court judges, but not on the Supreme Court itself, so expect the questioning will be far more intense this time. Kavanaugh's lengthy written record, however, is not on abortion but most other legal topics of the day. At 53, he's written some 300 opinions while on the federal appeals court here, where he has a record as an extremely skilled and conservative judge. And although he's never ruled directly on abortion, he did write a recent decision that temporarily barred a pregnant teenager who was in immigration custody from obtaining an abortion. The decision for a three-judge court was subsequently overturned by the full court over Kavanaugh's dissent.\n\nOn many other issues, he's been on the conservative side, sometimes slicing the legal salami thinner than some hard-line conservatives would've liked, as he did on the question of Obamacare. On questions involving government regulation, he often, but not always, sought to limit or throw out Obama-era environmental regulations. And on a number of high-profile cases, he signed onto or authored opinions deferring to presidential power. Indeed, just over a decade after he helped write the Starr report, leading to the impeachment of President Clinton, he wrote a law review article declaring that after serving in the Bush White House, he had concluded that presidents should be immune not just from civil lawsuits, but also from criminal investigation while they're in office. Such views could have enormous implications for the Mueller investigation of President Trump, including the question of whether the president can be subpoenaed to testify about his possible involvement in criminal activity.\n\nNina Totenberg, NPR News, Washington.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF PHILHARMONIA ORCHESTRA PERFORMANCE OF OLIVER KNUSSEN'S SYMPHONY NO. 3, OP. 18: ALLEGRO CON FUOCO)\n\nCopyright © 2018 NPR.

FACT CHECK: Donald Trump's Republican Convention Speech, Annotated\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Win McNamee/Getty Images Win McNamee/Getty Images\n\nDonald Trump accepted the Republican nomination for president Thursday night, delivering a speech that lays out America's struggles with crime, terrorism and immigration and how he plans to address them.\n\nNPR's politics team has annotated Trump's speech below. Portions we commented on are highlighted, followed by analysis, context and fact check in italics.\n\nThank you, thank you. Thank you very much.\n\nFriends, delegates and fellow Americans: I humbly and gratefully accept your nomination for the presidency of the United States.\n\nUSA, USA, USA, USA, USA.\n\nWho would have believed that when we started this journey // because we are a team would have received almost 14 million votes the most in the history of the Republican party and that the Republican party would get 60 percent more votes than it received eight years ago. Who would have believed this. Who would have believed this.\n\nThe Democrats on the other hand received 20 percent fewer votes than they got four years ago. Not so good. Not so good.\n\nTogether, we will lead our party back to the White House, and we will lead our country back to safety, prosperity, and peace.\n\nWe will be a country of generosity and warmth.\n\nBut we will also be a country of law and order.\n\n[Law and order has become a big theme for Trump in recent weeks, particularly since the killings of five police officers in Dallas. — Sarah McCammon]\n\nOur Convention occurs at a moment of crisis for our nation. The attacks on our police, and the terrorism of our cities, threaten our very way of life. Any politician who does not grasp this danger is not fit to lead our country.\n\nAmericans watching this address tonight have seen the recent images of violence in our streets and the chaos in our communities. Many have witnessed this violence personally, some have even been its victims. I have a message for all of you: the crime and violence that today afflicts our nation will soon, and I mean very soon, come to an end.\n\nBeginning on January 20th of 2017, safety will be restored.\n\n[Policing, public safety and the vast majority of the criminal justice apparatus are controlled by state and local authorities, not the federal government. — Carrie Johnson]\n\nThe most basic duty of government is to defend the lives of its own citizens. Any government that fails to do so is a government unworthy to lead. It is finally time for a straightforward assessment of the state of our nation.\n\nI will present the facts plainly and honestly.\n\nWe cannot afford to be so politically correct anymore.\n\nSo if you want to hear the corporate spin, the carefully-crafted lies, and the media myths the Democrats are holding their convention next week. Go there.\n\nBut here, at our convention, there will be no lies. We will honor the American people with the truth, and nothing else.\n\n[Fact checkers might beg to differ. PolitiFact, for instance, has found a number of false statements uttered at this week's RNC. — Tamara Keith]\n\nThese are the facts: Decades of progress made in bringing down crime are now being reversed by this Administration's rollback of criminal enforcement. Homicides last year increased by 17 percent in America's fifty largest cities. That's the largest increase in 25 years.\n\n[These data seem to come from a January Washington Post analysis that found homicides were up by 17 percent in 2015 over 2014, and that it indeed was the largest increase since 1990. — Danielle Kurtzleben] [However, violent crime is an intensely local phenomenon and murders were not up in all of those 50 cities. — Carrie Johnson] [And there's a broader context for crime figures: While violent crime may be climbing this year, rates are far below their peak in the early 1990s. — Danielle Kurtzleben] [Americans in recent years have said they believe crime is getting worse even though the overall trend is down. — Sarah McCammon]\n\nIn our nation's capital, killings have risen by 50 percent. They are up nearly 60% in nearby Baltimore.\n\n[That same Post analysis found murders up by 54.3 percent in Washington, D.C., and 58.5 percent in Baltimore in 2015 over 2014. — Danielle Kurtzleben]\n\nIn the President's hometown of Chicago, more than 2,000 people have been the victims of shootings this year alone.\n\n[Just three days ago, the Chicago Tribune reported that nearly 2,200 people have been shot in Chicago this year, with 329 of those people dead. The Tribune also reported that that's 100 more such deaths than at this point last year. — Danielle Kurtzleben]\n\nAnd more than 4,000 have been killed in the Chicago area since he took office.\n\nThe number of police officers killed in the line of duty has risen by almost 50% compared to this point last year.\n\n[The National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund says as of July 21, 2016, total fatalities this year compared with the same time last year reflect an increase of five deaths, or 8 percent. Deaths related to firearms are up by 14 deaths, or 78 percent. — Carrie Johnson]\n\nNearly 180,000 illegal immigrants with criminal records, ordered deported from our country, are tonight roaming free to threaten peaceful citizens.\n\nThe number of new illegal immigrant families who have crossed the border so far this year already exceeds the entire total from 2015.\n\n[The number of families apprehended this fiscal year along the Southwestern border thus far (that is, starting in October 2015) is around 51,000, according to Border Patrol data. That is already over the nearly 40,000 apprehended during fiscal year 2015. Total apprehensions are also on pace to exceed their 2015 total, as well, according to these data. However, that wouldn't be a very high number in the context of recent years; total apprehensions at the border today are far, far lower than they were in the early 2000s. — Danielle Kurtzleben]\n\nThey are being released by the tens of thousands into our communities with no regard for the impact on public safety or resources.\n\nOne such border-crosser was released and made his way to Nebraska. There, he ended the life of an innocent young girl named Sarah Root. She was 21 years-old, and was killed the day after graduating from college with a 4.0 Grade Point Average. Number one in her class. Her killer was then released a second time, and he is now a fugitive from the law. I've met Sarah's beautiful family. But to this Administration, their amazing daughter was just one more American life that wasn't worth protecting. No more.\n\nOne more child to sacrifice on the order and on the altar of open borders.\n\n[America does not have open borders. It has restrictions on immigration and Border Patrol agents who make hundreds of thousands of apprehensions a year. — Danielle Kurtzleben]\n\nWhat about our economy? Again, I will tell you the plain facts that have been edited out of your nightly news and your morning newspaper: Nearly 4 in 10 African-American children are living in poverty, while 58% of African-American youth are now not employed.\n\n[Thirty-six percent of African-Americans under 18 were below the poverty line as of 2014, according to the Census Bureau. It's not entirely clear what Trump means by not employed, which is not technically the same as unemployed, which counts people who aren't working and are looking for work. However, the unemployment rate for black Americans ages 16 to 19 was 38.1 percent as of June. — Danielle Kurtzleben]\n\n2 million more Latinos are in poverty today than when President Obama took his oath of office less than eight years ago.\n\n[That's roughly true, by the latest data available. Around 11 million Hispanic-Americans were in poverty in 2008, compared with 13.1 million in 2014. The poverty rate makes more sense to compare, though — that has grown 0.4 points since 2008, but it has also declined lately, down by nearly 3 points since 2010. As for whether President Obama is responsible for this, we get to that below. — Danielle Kurtzleben]\n\nAnother 14 million people have left the workforce entirely.\n\n[There's a lot going on in this statistic. So here goes: Trump may be talking about the number of adults not in the labor force — that is, neither working nor looking for work (so it includes retirees and students, for example). That figure has climbed by 14 million since January 2009 (importantly, this isn't people leaving the labor force; it's just people not in it, period). But while labor force participation is relatively low, the labor force has still been growing — Trump's 14 million figure might imply that it's not. And that low labor force participation isn't entirely about a tough economy — a lot of it is simple demographics. In 2014, the Congressional Budget Office found that half of a recent 3-point drop in the rate had been due to baby boomers retiring. The other half was economic factors. — Danielle Kurtzleben]\n\nHousehold incomes are down more than $4,000 since the year 2000. That's sixteen years ago.\n\n[That's true, using median household income data, though he is not measuring from the start of the Obama administration as he is for the other stats here. If he measured from 2008, the drop was $1,656. Measuring from 2000 means measuring from the figure's near-peak. [A broader point about all of these economic statistics: A lot of them have been true, but the question is whether Obama is to blame. Higher poverty, for example, doesn't appear to be Obama's doing, as we wrote in a fact check last year. Moreover, many experts believe a president generally has only very limited ability to affect the economy. — Danielle Kurtzleben]\n\nOur trade deficit has reached an all-time high think of this, think of this, our trade deficit is nearly $800 billion, think of that, 800 billion dollars, last year alone. We're going to fix that.\n\nThe budget is no better. President Obama has almost doubled our national debt to more than $19 trillion, and growing. And yet, what do we have to show for it? Our roads and bridges are falling apart, our airports are Third World condition, and forty-three million Americans are on food stamps.\n\nNow let us consider the state of affairs abroad. Not only have our citizens endured domestic disaster, but they've lived through one international humiliation after another.One after another. We all remember the images of our sailors being forced to their knees by their Iranian captors at gunpoint. This was just prior to the signing of the Iran deal, which gave back to Iran $150 billion and gave us absolutely nothing – it will go down in history as one of the worst deals ever negotiated.\n\n[PolitiFact has debunked this — that $150 billion is an estimate (and a high one) of the value of Iranian assets tied up by economic sanctions, according to the site. — Danielle Kurtzleben]\n\nAnother humiliation came when president Obama drew a red line in Syria – and the whole world knew it meant absolutely nothing. In Libya, our consulate – the symbol of American prestige around the globe – was brought down in flames.\n\n[The diplomatic outpost in Benghazi was not a consulate. Here's how former CIA Deputy Director Michael Morell described it in a Politico article: [The State Department facility in Benghazi has been widely mischaracterized as a US consulate. In fact it was a Temporary Mission Facility (TMF), a presence that was not continuously staffed by senior personnel and that was never given formal diplomatic status by the Libyan government. — Tamara Keith]\n\nAmerica is far less safe – and the world is far less stable – than when Obama made the decision to put Hillary Clinton in charge of America's foreign policy.\n\n[Editor's note: Crowd chants Lock her up.]\n\nLet's defeat her in November, okay?\n\nI am certain that it was a decision that President Obama truly regrets.\n\n[President Obama has enthusiastically endorsed Clinton, so it would seem unlikely that he regrets choosing her to be his secretary of state. — Tamara Keith]\n\nHer bad instincts and her bad judgment – something pointed out by Bernie Sanders – are what caused so many of the disasters unfolding today. Let's review the record.\n\nIn 2009, pre-Hillary, ISIS was not even on the map. Libya was stable. Egypt was peaceful. Iraq was seeing and really a big big reduction in violence. Iran was being choked by sanctions. Syria was somewhat under control. After four years of Hillary Clinton, what do we have? ISIS has spread across the region, and the entire world. Libya is in ruins, and our Ambassador and his staff were left helpless to die at the hands of savage killers. Egypt was turned over to the radical Muslim brotherhood, forcing the military to retake control. Iraq is in chaos. Iran is on the path to nuclear weapons. Syria is engulfed in a civil war and a refugee crisis, now threatens the West. After fifteen years of wars in the Middle East, after trillions of dollars spent and thousands of lives lost, the situation is worse than it has ever been before. This is the legacy of Hillary Clinton: death, destruction, terrorism, and weakness. But Hillary Clinton's legacy does not have to be America's legacy.\n\n[Attacks on Hillary Clinton and the argument that she is part of the status quo that is making many Americans unhappy in their lives are a common theme at Trump rallies. — Sarah McCammon]\n\nThe problems we face now – poverty and violence at home, war and destruction abroad – will last only as long as we continue relying on the same politicians who created them in the first place.\n\nA change in leadership is required to produce a change in outcomes.\n\n[Many of these ideas are familiar: making better trade deals, fighting terrorism, putting America first, and the notion that only a dramatic change in the leadership of the country will be able to solve national problems. — Sarah McCammon]\n\nTonight, I will share with you my plan for action for America. The most important difference between our plan and that of our opponents, is that our plan will put America First.\n\nAmericanism, not globalism, will be our credo. As long as we are led by politicians who will not put America First, then we can be assured that other nations will not treat America with respect. The respect that we deserve.\n\nThe American People will come first once again.\n\nMy plan will begin with safety at home – which means safe neighborhoods, secure borders, and protection from terrorism. There can be no prosperity without law and order.\n\nOn the economy, I will outline reforms to add millions of new jobs and trillions in new wealth that can be used to rebuild America.\n\nA number of these reforms that I will outline tonight will be opposed by some of our nation's most powerful special interests. That's because these interests have rigged our political and economic system for their exclusive benefit. Believe me. It's for their benefit.\n\nBig business, elite media and major donors are lining up behind the campaign of my opponent because they know she will keep our rigged system in place.\n\nThey are throwing money at her because they have total control over everything single thing she does. She is their puppet, and they pull the strings.\n\nThat is why Hillary Clinton's message is that things will never change. Never ever.\n\n[Clinton has reams of plans and proposals to change everything from the nation's immigration system and criminal justice policies to the way people pay for college. — Tamara Keith]\n\nMy message is that things have to change – and they have to change right now.\n\nEvery day I wake up determined to deliver a better life for the people all across this nation that have been neglected, ignored, and abandoned. I have visited the laid-off factory workers, and the communities crushed by our horrible and unfair trade deals. These are the forgotten men and women of our country. And they are forgotten. But they're not going to be forgotten long.\n\nThese are people who work hard but no longer have a voice. I am your voice.\n\nI have embraced crying mothers who have lost their children because our politicians put their personal agendas before the national good. I have no patience for injustice -\n\n[Editor's note: Protester interrupts, crowd shouts USA]\n\nHow great are our police! And how great is Cleveland?\n\nThank you.\n\nI have no patience for injustice. No tolerance for government incompetence of which there is so much, no sympathy for leaders who fail their citizens. When innocent people suffer, because our political system lacks the will, or the courage, or the basic decency to enforce our laws – or still worse, has sold out to some corporate lobbyist for cash – I am not able to look the other way. And I won't look the other way.\n\nAnd when a Secretary of State illegally stores her emails on a private server, deletes 33,000 of them so the authorities can't see her crime, puts our country at risk, lies about it in every different form and faces no consequence – I know that corruption has reached a level like never ever before in our country.\n\n[There was no official determination that the private server was illegal, although the State Department inspector general found it was not approved and would not have been had Clinton asked. — Carrie Johnson]\n\nWhen the FBI Director says that the Secretary of State was extremely careless and negligent, in handling our classified secrets, I also know that these terms are minor compared to what she actually did.\n\n[FBI Director James Comey had plenty of criticism for Clinton but said no reasonable prosecutor would charge Clinton with a crime for the emails. — Carrie Johnson]\n\nThey were just used to save her from facing justice for her terrible, terrible crimes.\n\nIn fact, her single greatest accomplishment may be committing such egregious crime and getting away with it – especially when others who have done far less, have paid so dearly. When that same Secretary of State rakes in millions and millions of dollars trading access and favors to special interests and foreign powers I know the time for action has come.\n\nI have joined the political arena so that the powerful can no longer beat up on people who cannot defend themselves.\n\nNobody knows the system better than me.\n\nWhich is why I alone can fix it.\n\nI have seen firsthand how the system is rigged against our citizens, just like it was rigged against Bernie Sanders – he never had a chance. Never had a chance. But his supporters will join our movement, because we will fix his biggest single issue: trade deals that strip our country of its jobs and strip us of our wealth as a country.\n\n[Sanders had a lot of issues that he was deeply passionate about, including trade, but it wouldn't be at the top of his list. His campaign revolved most intensely around two things: income inequality and a broken campaign finance system. — Tamara Keith]\n\nMillions of Democrats will join our movement, because we are going to fix the system so it works fairly and justly for all Americans.\n\n[A recent Pew poll found that just 9 percent of Democratic and Democratic-leaning Sanders supporters said they planned to vote for Trump in the general election. 85% say they plan to vote for Clinton in the general election, compared with 9% who say they will vote for Trump and 6% who volunteer that they will vote for another candidate or don't know. [Sanders got approximately 12 million popular votes. Back-of-the-envelope calculation, 9 percent of 12 million is a bit more than 1 million, not millions. And that poll was taken before Sanders endorsed Clinton. — Tamara Keith]\n\nIn this cause, I am proud to have at my side the next Vice President of the United States: Governor Mike Pence of Indiana. And a great guy.\n\nWe will bring the same economic success to America that Mike brought to Indiana. Which is amazing.\n\nHe's a man of character and accomplishment. He's the man for the job.\n\n[Trump is saying that he and Pence will improve U.S. trade deals, but trade is just one of several areas on which they differ. Pence has been a strong proponent of free trade in the past, having approved of NAFTA and the Trans-Pacific Partnership, as the New York Times reports. — Danielle Kurtzleben]\n\nThe first task for our new Administration will be to liberate our citizens from the crime and terrorism and lawlessness that threatens our community. America was shocked to its core when our police officers in Dallas were so brutally executed. Immediately after Dallas, we have seen continued threats and violence against our law enforcement officials. Law officers have been shot or killed in recent days in Georgia, Missouri, Wisconsin, Kansas, Michigan and Tennessee.\n\nOn Sunday, more police were gunned down in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Three were killed, and three were very, very badly injured. An attack on law enforcement is an attack on all Americans.\n\nI have a message to every last person threatening the peace on our streets and the safety of our police: when I take the oath of office next year, I will restore law and order to our country. Believe me. Believe me.\n\nI will work with, and appoint, the best and brightest prosecutors and law enforcement officials to get the job properly done.\n\n[The president does select U.S. attorneys, but those top federal prosecutors handle a small fraction of violent crime cases in the nation. Most murders, robberies and assaults are prosecuted by local authorities. — Carrie Johnson]\n\nIn this race for the White House, I am the Law And Order candidate.\n\nThe irresponsible rhetoric of our President, who has used the pulpit of the presidency to divide us by race and color, has made America a more dangerous environment that frankly that I have ever seen of anybody in this room has ever watched or seen.\n\n[The Brennan Center for Justice says overall crime rates from 2014 to 2015 were nearly identical. Violent crime rose by 3 percent over that period. — Carrie Johnson]\n\nThis Administration has failed America's inner cities. Remember, it has failed America's inner cities. It's failed them on education. It's failed them on jobs. It's failed them on crime. It's failed them in every way and at every single level. When I am President, I will work to ensure that all of our kids are treated equally, and protected equally.\n\nEvery action I take, I will ask myself: does this make better for young Americans in Baltimore, in Chicago, in Detroit, in Ferguson who have really, in every way folks, the same right to live out their dreams as any other child in America? Any other child.\n\nTo make life safe for all of our citizens, we must also address the growing threats from outside the country. We are going to defeat the barbarians of ISIS and we're going to defeat them fast.\n\nOnce again, France is the victim of brutal Islamic terrorism. Men, women and children viciously mowed down. Lives ruined. Families ripped apart. A nation in mourning. The damage and devastation that can be inflicted by Islamic radicals has been proven over and over – at the World Trade Center, at an office party in San Bernardino, at the Boston Marathon, at a military recruiting center in Chattanooga, Tennessee. And many many other locations.\n\nOnly weeks ago, in Orlando, Florida, 49 wonderful Americans were savagely murdered by an Islamic terrorist. This time, the terrorist targeted LGBTQ community. No good, and we're going to stop it.\n\nAs your President, I will do everything in my power to protect our LGBTQ citizens from the violence and oppression of a hateful foreign ideology. Believe me.\n\n[The party is well to Trump's right on LGBT issues, as NPR's Brian Naylor has reported. The Log Cabin Republicans have called it the most anti-LGBT platform in GOP history, according to ABC News. — Danielle Kurtzleben]\n\nAnd I have to say as a Republican it is so nice to hear you cheering for what I just said. Thank you.\n\nTo protect us from terrorism, we need to focus on three things. We must have the best, absolutely the best gathering of intelligence anywhere in the world. The best. We must abandon the failed policy of nation building and regime change that Hillary Clinton pushed in Iraq, in Libya, in Egypt and in Syria. Instead, we must work with all of our allies who share our goal of destroying ISIS and stamping out Islamic terrorism and doing it now, doing it quickly. We're going to win. We're going to win fast.\n\nThis includes working with our greatest ally in the region, the State of Israel.\n\nRecently, I have said NATO is obsolete because it did not properly cover terror. And also that many of the member countries were not paying their fair share. As usual, the United States has been picking up the costs. Shortly thereafter, it was announced that NATO will be setting up a new program in order to combat terrorism. A true step in the right direction.\n\nLastly, and very importantly, we must immediately suspend immigration from any nation that has been compromised by terrorism until such time as proven vetting mechanisms have been put in place. We don't want them in our country.\n\nMy opponent has called for a radical 550% increase in Syrian, think of this. Think of this, this is not believable but this is what's happening. A 550 percent increase in Syrian refugees on top of existing massive refugee flows coming into our country already under the leadership of President Obama.\n\nShe proposes this despite the fact that there's no way to screen these refugees in order to find out who they are or where they come from.\n\n[PolitiFact ranked the claim about the lack of a vetting system false. [However, PolitiFact did find that Trump's number is correct as to the increase in refugee admissions proposed by Clinton. Interestingly, about a month ago, Trump said it would be a 500 percent increase. PolitiFact noted that it actually worked out to 550 percent. Trump has adjusted to the higher and more accurate number. [In 2015, the U.S. admitted (per the State Department) 1,682 Syrian refugees. That is well under President Obama's goal. It would be hard to argue that is massive. — Tamara Keith]\n\nI only want to admit individuals into our country who will support our values and love our people.\n\nAnyone who endorses violence, hatred or oppression is not welcome in our country and never ever will be.\n\nDecades of record immigration have produced lower wages and higher unemployment for our citizens, especially for African-American and Latino workers. We are going to have an immigration system that works, but one that works for the American people.\n\nOn Monday, we heard from three parents whose children were killed by illegal immigrants: Mary Ann Mendoza, Sabine Durden, and my friend Jamiel Shaw. They are just three brave representatives of many thousands who have suffered so greatly. Of all my travels in this country, nothing has affected me more, nothing even close I have to tell you, than the time I have spent with the mothers and fathers who have lost their children to violence spilling across our borders which we can solve. We have to solve it.\n\nThese families have no special interests to represent them. There are no demonstrators to protect them and certainly none to protest on their behalf. My opponent will never meet with them, or share in their pain. Believe me. Instead, my opponent wants Sanctuary Cities.\n\nBut where was the sanctuary for Kate Steinle?\n\nWhere was the Sanctuary for the children of Mary Ann, and Sabine and Jamiel? Where was sanctuary for all the other, it's so sad to even be talking about it, because we can solve this problem so quickly. Where was the sanctuary for all of the Americans who have been so brutally murdered, and who have suffered so horribly? These wounded American families have been alone. But they are not alone any longer.\n\nTonight, this candidate and the whole nation stand in their corner to support them, to send them our love, and to pledge in their honor that we will save countless more families from suffering and the same awful fate.\n\nWe are going to build a great border wall to stop illegal immigration, to stop the gangs and the violence, and to stop the drugs from pouring into our communities.\n\nI have been honored to receive the endorsement of America's Border Patrol Agents.\n\nAnd will work directly with them to protect the integrity of our lawful, lawful, lawful immigration system. Lawful.\n\nBy ending catch-and-release on the border, we will end the cycle of human smuggling and violence. Illegal border crossings will go down. We will stop it, it won't be happening very much anymore. Believe me.\n\nPeace will be restored. By enforcing the rules for millions who overstay their visas, our laws will finally receive the respect that they deserve.\n\nTonight, I want every American whose demands for immigration security have been denied – and every politician who has denied them – to listen very, very closely to the words I am about to say. On January 20th of 2017, the day I take the oath of office, Americans will finally wake up in a country where the laws of the United States are enforced.\n\nWe are going to be considerate and compassionate to everyone. But my greatest compassion will be for our own struggling citizens.\n\nUSA. USA. USA.\n\n[Editor's note: Trump chanted along with the crowd here.]\n\nMy plan is the exact opposite of the radical and dangerous immigration policy of Hillary Clinton. Americans want relief from uncontrolled immigration. Which is what we have now. Communities want relief. Yet Hillary Clinton is proposing mass amnesty, mass immigration, and mass lawlessness.\n\nHer plan will overwhelm your schools and hospitals, further reduce your jobs and wages, and make it harder for recent immigrants to escape the tremendous cycle poverty that they're going through right now and make it almost impossible for them to join the middle class.\n\nI have a different vision for our workers. It begins with a new, fair trade policy that protects our jobs and stands up to countries that cheat. Of which there are many.\n\nIt's been a signature message of my campaign from day one, and it will be a signature feature of my presidency from the moment I take the oath of office.\n\nI have made billions of dollars in business making deals – now I'm going to make our country rich again.\n\nUsing the greatest business people in the world, which our country has, I am going to turn our bad trade agreements into great trade agreements.\n\nAmerica has lost nearly-one third of its manufacturing jobs since 1997, following the enactment of disastrous trade deals supported by Bill and Hillary Clinton. Remember, it was Bill Clinton who signed NAFTA, one of the worst economic deals ever made by our country. Or frankly, any other country. Never ever again.\n\n[As we have pointed out in two earlier Trump speech annotations, and as NPR's Chris Arnold reported this year, it appears that NAFTA didn't have a huge effect on jobs. As the Congressional Research Service reported in 2015, the agreement neither lived up to proponents' promises nor caused the massive job losses that opponents claimed it would. Also, Bill Clinton was not solely responsible for NAFTA; it was negotiated under George H.W. Bush before it became law under Clinton. — Danielle Kurtzleben]\n\nI am going to bring our jobs back to Ohio and Pennsylvania, and New York, and Michigan, and all of America – and I am not going to let companies move to other countries, firing their employees along the way, without consequence. Not going to happen anymore.\n\nMy opponent, on the other hand, has supported virtually every trade agreement that has been destroying our middle class. She supported NAFTA, and she supported China's entrance into the World Trade Organization – another one of her husband's colossal mistakes and disasters.\n\nShe supported the job-killing trade deal with South Korea. She supported the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Which will not only destroy our manufacturers, but will make America subject to the rulings of foreign governments. And it's not going to happen.\n\nI pledge to never sign any trade agreement that hurts our workers or that diminishes our freedom or independence. We will never sign bad trade deals. America First again. America First.\n\nInstead, I will make individual deals with individual countries. No longer will we enter into these massive transactions, with many countries, that are thousands of pages long – and which no one from our country even reads or understands.\n\nWe are going to enforce all trade violations, against any country that cheats.\n\nThis includes stopping China's outrageous theft of intellectual property, along with their illegal product dumping, and their devastating currency manipulation. They are the greatest that ever came about. They are the greatest currency manipulators ever.\n\nOur horrible trade agreements with China and many others will be totally renegotiated. That includes renegotiating NAFTA to get a much better deal for America – and we'll walk away if we don't get that kind of a deal.\n\nOur country is going to start building and making things again.\n\nNext comes the reform of our tax laws, regulations and energy rules. While Hillary Clinton plans a massive, and I mean massive, tax increase, I have proposed the largest tax reduction of any candidate who has run for the president this year – Democrat or Republican.\n\nMiddle-income Americans and businesses will experience profound relief, and taxes will be greatly simplified for everyone. I mean everyone.\n\nAmerica is one of the highest-taxed nations in the world.\n\nReducing taxes will cause new companies and new jobs to come roaring back into our country. Believe me, it'll happen and it'll happen fast.\n\nThen we are going to deal with the issue of regulation, one of the greatest job-killers of them all. Excessive regulation is costing our country as much as $2 trillion a year, and we will end it very, very quickly.\n\n[A few analyses have found that regulation costs around $2 trillion — one of the best-known, from the Competitive Enterprise Institute, estimated it at around $1.9 trillion this year. But as the Washington Post's Fact Checker has pointed out, in the past this figure has been characterized as a back of the envelope count, and that moreover, it doesn't make sense to talk about costs without trying to count the benefits of regulation. — Danielle Kurtzleben]\n\nWe are going to lift the restrictions on the production of American energy.\n\nThis will produce more than $20 trillion in job-creating economic activity over the next four decades. My opponent, on the other hand, wants to put the great miners and the great steelworkers of our country out of work and out of business – that will never happen with Donald J Trump as president. Our steelworkers and our miners are going back to work again.\n\nWith these new economic policies, trillions and trillions of dollars will start flowing into our country. This new wealth will improve the quality of life for all Americans – We will build the roads, highways, bridges, tunnels, airports, and the railways of tomorrow. This, in turn, will create millions of more jobs. We will rescue kids from failing schools by helping their parents send them to a safe school of their choice.\n\nMy opponent would rather protect bureaucrats than serve American children. And that's what she's doing. And that's what's she's done. We will repeal and replace disastrous Obamacare.\n\nYou will be able to choose your own doctor again.\n\nAnd we will fix TSA at the airports! Which is a total disaster.\n\nWe're going to work with all of our students who are drowning in debt to take the pressure off these young people just starting out in their adult lives. Tremendous problem.\n\nWe will completely rebuild our depleted military, and the countries that we protect, at a massive cost to us, will be asked to pay their fair share.\n\nWe will take care of our great Veterans like they have never been taken care of before.\n\nMy just released 10 point plan has received tremendous veteran support. We will guarantee those who serve this country will be able to visit the doctor or hospital of their choice without waiting five days on a line and dying.\n\nMy opponent dismissed the VA scandal. One more sign of how out of touch she really is. We are going to ask every Department Head in government to provide a list of wasteful spending projects that we can eliminate in my first 100 days.\n\nThe politicians have talked about this for years, but I'm going to do it.\n\n[Editor's note: Crowd chants Yes You Will]\n\nWe are going to appoint justices of the United States Supreme Court who will uphold our laws and our Constitution.\n\nThe replacement of our beloved Justice Scalia will be a person of similar views and principles and judicial philosophies. Very important. This will be one of the most important issues decided by this election. My opponent wants to essentially abolish the 2nd amendment.\n\nI, on the other hand, received the early and strong endorsement of the National Rifle Association and will protect the right of all Americans to keep their families safe.\n\nAt this moment, I would like to thank the evangelical and religious community because I'll tell you what. Because the support they've given me, and I'm not sure I totally deserve it, has been so amazing. And has had such a big reason for me being here tonight. True. So true.\n\nThey have so much to contribute to our politics, yet our laws prevent you from speaking your minds from your own pulpits. An amendment, pushed by Lyndon Johnson, many years ago, threatens religious institutions with a loss of their tax-exempt status if they openly advocate their political views. Their voice has been taken away.\n\n[Here's an IRS explanation of the rules on churches and taxes, saying that to be tax-exempt, a church may not participate in, or intervene in (including the publishing or distributing of statements), any political campaign on behalf of (or in opposition to) any candidate for public office. This LA Times piece from 2008 is a breakdown of some of the arguments for and against the Johnson Amendment. — Danielle Kurtzleben]\n\nI am going to work very hard to repeal that language and to protect free speech for all Americans.\n\nWe can accomplish these great things, and so much more – all we need to do is start believing in ourselves and in our country again. Start believing. It is time to show the whole world that America Is Back – bigger, and better and stronger than ever before.\n\nIn this journey, I'm so lucky to have at my side my wife Melania and my wonderful children, Don, Ivanka, Eric, Tiffany, and Barron: you will always be my greatest source of pride and joy. And by the way, Melania and Ivanka, did they do a job.\n\n[There's also a bit more of the personal in this speech. Trump not only talks about his children, as he often does, but also his parents and siblings. This week we've seen an effort to humanize a man who is known for being bold and confrontational, and that continues here. — Sarah McCammon]\n\nMy Dad, Fred Trump, was the smartest and hardest working man I ever knew. I wonder sometimes what he'd say if he were here to see this, and to see me, tonight.\n\nIt's because of him that I learned, from my youngest age, to respect the dignity of work and the dignity of working people.\n\nHe was a guy most comfortable in the company of bricklayers, and carpenters, and electricians and I have a lot of that in me also. I love those people.\n\nThen there's my mother, Mary. She was strong, but also warm and fair-minded. She was a truly great mother. She was also one of the most honest and charitable people I have ever known, and a great great judge of character. She could pick 'em out from anywhere.\n\nTo my sisters Mary Anne and Elizabeth, my brother Robert and my late brother Fred, I will always give you my love you are most special to me.\n\nI have had a truly great life in business. But now, my sole and exclusive mission is to go to work for our country – to go to work for you. It's time to deliver a victory for the American people. We don't win anymore, but we are going to start winning again.\n\nBut to do that, we must break free from the petty politics of the past. America is a nation of believers, dreamers, and strivers that is being led by a group of censors, critics, and cynics.\n\nRemember: all of the people telling you you can't have the country you want, are the same people telling you that wouldn't stand, I mean they said Trump doesn't have a chance of being here tonight. Not a chance. The same people. Oh we love defeating those people. Don't we? Don't we? Love it. Love it. Love it.\n\nNo longer can we rely on those same people in the media media, and politics, who will say anything to keep a rigged system in place.\n\n[Americans as a whole aren't fans of the news media, but Republicans dislike the media even more. According to a 2015 Pew Research Center report, 17 percent of Republicans say the national news media has a positive effect on the way things are going in the country, compared with 33 percent of Democrats. — Danielle Kurtzleben]\n\nInstead, we must choose to Believe In America. History is watching us now. We don't have much time, but history is watching. It's waiting to see if we will rise to the occasion, and if we will show the whole world that America is still free and independent and strong.\n\nI am asking for your support tonight so I can be your champion in the White House. And I will be your champion.\n\nMy opponent asks her supporters to recite a three-word loyalty pledge. It reads: I'm With Her. I choose to recite a different pledge.\n\n[I'm With Her started out as a hashtag and sometimes supporters do chant it at events, but the Clinton campaign doesn't ask supporters to pledge loyalty by reciting it. The campaign's current slogan is Stronger Together. — Tamara Keith]\n\nMy pledge reads: I'M WITH YOU – THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.\n\nI am your voice. So to every parent who dreams for their child, and every child who dreams for their future, I say these words to you tonight: I am With You, and I will fight for you, and I will win for you.\n\nTo all Americans tonight, in all of our cities and in all of our towns, I make this promise: We Will Make America Strong Again. We Will Make America Proud Again. We Will Make America Safe Again. And We Will Make America Great Again.\n\nGod bless you, and goodnight. I love you.
Midterm Results: Democrats Take Back Control Of The House\n\nDemocrats have retaken the House in Tuesday's elections and more than 100 women have been elected to Congress. Meanwhile, Republicans consolidated their control of the Senate.\n\nSTEVE INSKEEP, HOST:\n\nA central result of last night's congressional elections was this - in a high turnout election for a midterm, a substantial majority of Americans voted for Democrats in the House. They defeated Republican leaders who aggressively defended President Trump, and they empowered a party whose leader, Nancy Pelosi, says she will be independent of the president.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nNANCY PELOSI: Today is more than about Democrats and Republicans. It's about restoring the Constitution's checks and balances to the Trump administration.\n\nINSKEEP: Pelosi is now favored to be the next speaker of the House, after Democrats gained something in the neighborhood of 30 seats or a little more. Republicans added to their majority in the Senate, defeating three Democrats who held seats in more rural and conservative states. NPR's Mara Liasson and Scott Detrow are here to talk all this through. Good morning guys.\n\nSCOTT DETROW, BYLINE: Good morning.\n\nMARA LIASSON, BYLINE: Good morning.\n\nINSKEEP: So, Scott, how big a change in Washington is that House result?\n\nDETROW: It's a major change. All the big pushes that President Trump and Republicans pushed for the last few years - repealing Obamacare, big tax cuts - that stops dead, and Democrats now have the leverage to try and get a permanent fix for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, among other Democratic priorities. They have a lot of leverage for spending. But the most important change is that Democrats now have oversight control. They have subpoena power. That means they can dig into the Trump White House, whether it's things related to Mueller's investigation or scandals in the EPA and other departments or - get this - President Trump's tax returns and the relationship between his personal business and government action.\n\nINSKEEP: Yeah, I'm just thinking - the House Intelligence Committee. Devin Nunes was the chairman - avid defender of the president. Adam Schiff, presumably, will be the chairman now, assuming that things stay as they are. However, Mara Liasson, Republicans add to their majority in the Senate, which, among other things, is the body that confirms judges, isn't it?\n\nLIASSON: That's right. And I think this is where Democrats really failed to limit their losses. That was their goal in the Senate. And this is where Trump traveled. This is where he put his energy. And this is where he mattered - in the red-state Senate races, so he gets to crow about that victory. As a practical matter, I think it's less significant than the Democrats taking over the House because even with just 50 votes and Mike Pence, they could have continued in the Senate to confirm Donald Trump's judges. It makes it a little bit easier, and it sets the Republicans up for what will be a much harder cycle for them in 2020.\n\nINSKEEP: Let's listen to one of the winning Senate candidates from last night, Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, kept his seat despite a dramatic and much-followed challenge from Democrat Beto O'Rourke. Let's listen to Ted Cruz.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nTED CRUZ: All the money in the world was no match for the good people of Texas and the hard-working men and women across our state.\n\nINSKEEP: OK, Scott Detrow, there was a lot of money in this election but also a lot of voters. Wow. More than 8 million people voted in a midterm in Texas.\n\nDETROW: Yeah, this is - Democrats aren't looking for, you know, consolation prizes on a day like today on the Senate side. But yeah, Democratic turnout was pretty big. The gap between Cruz and O'Rourke was incredibly small, especially for Texas - same goes for the Georgia governor's race where Democrats, at the moment, are trailing in a very close contest. But Democrats were able to mobilize voters who hadn't turned out before and get Democrats a lot more excited in states where, typically, they don't compete on the statewide level.\n\nINSKEEP: So guys, there was all this debate over whether it was going to be a blue wave, and President Trump was at rallies saying no, there's going to be a red wave. So let's just say one definite election result is that that was an utterly meaningless debate over a metaphor. And I'd like to know is there something that's a little more genuine that either of you feels you did learn from these results last night?\n\nLIASSON: Well, America is deeply divided, and it's particularly divided between rural areas and metro-suburban areas. Right now, Democrats have the people, Republicans have the real estate. And that really matters because of the way Congress is set up. But we are even more divided, I think, today than we were before the election.\n\nINSKEEP: Scott Detrow, you get the last word.\n\nDETROW: Well, I was going to say exactly what Mara Liasson just said right now. And I think the biggest question that I have no answer to is what this means for 2020 because, you know, states like Florida and a lot of Republican states, pretty solid for President Trump. He seemed to not pay any sort of consequences for, you know, the very divisive rhetoric from the closing weeks of the race.\n\nINSKEEP: Scott Detrow and Mara Liasson, thanks to you both.\n\nDETROW: Thank you.\n\nLIASSON: Thank you.\n\nCopyright © 2018 NPR.

Exclusive: Trump Wants To Pick Cuccinelli For DHS, But Worries Senate Would Balk\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Win McNamee/Getty Images Win McNamee/Getty Images\n\nUpdated at 8:45 p.m. ET\n\nPresident Trump has told Republican allies in the Senate that he would like to nominate immigration hard-liner Ken Cuccinelli as his next Homeland Security secretary, but has said he does not believe Republican Senate leaders would back the choice, according to sources familiar with the discussions.\n\nCuccinelli, the former attorney general of Virginia, has made enemies in his own party. He used to lead a group that raised money to challenge incumbent Republican senators, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.\n\nTrump announced two weeks ago that Kevin McAleenan, who had been the acting secretary, would leave his post. That touched off a wave of jockeying for the position between competing factions inside the White House over who should lead the department charged with immigration policy, a key pillar of his presidency and re-election campaign.\n\nSources say immigration hard-liners inside and outside the White House are fighting to keep Cuccinelli — who Trump made his acting director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services — in the running.\n\nA Republican Senate aide told NPR that Trump has said he would name Cuccinelli if he thought Senate leadership would support his nomination. A White House official confirmed Trump has told allies he wants Cuccinelli in the role.\n\nPresident Trump needs someone at DHS that believes in his vision for immigration enforcement, and that person is Ken Cuccinelli, the Republican Senate aide said.\n\nCuccinelli has championed some of Trump's toughest immigration policies, including new protocols making it harder for immigrants to obtain legal permanent residency by denying green cards to those who use or are likely to use government benefits, such as Medicaid and food stamps.\n\nA spokesman for McConnell declined to comment, but directed NPR to previous comments the Republican leader has expressed about Cuccinelli as a candidate for the job.\n\nI've not spoken to [Trump] about any of them. I have expressed my, shall I say, lack of enthusiasm for one of them ... Ken Cuccinelli, McConnell told reporters during a briefing in April.\n\nCuccinelli did not mince words when raising money for the Senate Conservatives Fund in August 2017, criticizing sitting Republican senators.\n\nMitch McConnell has filled the Senate with people like Lisa Murkowski, John McCain, Shelley Moore Capito, Lamar Alexander, and Dean Heller who all promised the voters they would repeal Obamacare, but when the time came to do it they refused, Cuccinelli wrote in a fundraising message for the group, Roll Call reported. Instead of admitting his mistake, McConnell is blaming the president for having 'excessive expectations' even though he was the one who set those expectations with years of empty promises!\n\nIt's unlikely that enough Republican senators would support a nominee who led efforts to defeat them, said Alex Conant, former communications director for Sen. Marco Rubio's 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nRepublican Senators are angry about Syria, weary of an impeachment trial and would rather not confirm somebody who is likely to cause more headaches.\n\nGiven the president's precarious political situation, asking Republican senators to support someone who funded primaries against them is a difficult ask, Conant said. Republican Senators are angry about Syria, weary of an impeachment trial and would rather not confirm somebody who is likely to cause more headaches.\n\nWhite House staffers have warned Trump that Cuccinelli is not eligible to become acting DHS secretary because of technicalities in federal vacancy rules, according to two people familiar with the conversations.\n\nSean Doocey, the White House director of presidential personnel, told Trump that both Cuccinelli and another candidate — Mark Morgan, the acting commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection — were ineligible because of federal vacancy laws. But hard-liners have argued the White House should find work-arounds to federal vacancy rules.\n\nThe Federation for American Immigration Reform, a group close to the administration that advocates for immigration restrictions, argues McConnell works with other Republican senators once backed by the Senate Conservatives Fund, so he should be able to get over his political differences with Cuccinelli. While the fund once backed a primary challenger to McConnell, that was before Cuccinelli became its president, FAIR says.\n\nDan Stein, president of FAIR, warned Republicans could face political consequences by picking the wrong person in the middle of an election year.\n\nEnough with the acting secretaries – come together and confirm someone who works well with the president and is totally in line with his immigration agenda, Stein said.
Biden's First 100 Days: Here's What To Expect\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Carolyn Kaster/AP Carolyn Kaster/AP\n\nUpdated at 2:42 p.m. ET\n\nPresident-elect Joe Biden will take office in January with a lot of promises to keep. He has pledged to enact new policies swiftly that veer the U.S. off President Trump's current path.\n\nBiden ran a heavily policy-focused campaign, releasing dozens of lengthy and ambitious plans ranging from large-scale economic and environmental initiatives to broad actions on racial justice, education and health care. A significant amount of Biden's agenda also centers on reversing or updating positions taken by the Trump administration, especially on immigration and foreign policy. Biden heads into office with strategies to address the COVID-19 crisis and the search for a vaccine as well.\n\nThe sheer volume of Biden's plans could make it a challenge to execute them all. On immigration alone, he has proposed more than a dozen initiatives to complete within 100 days of taking office, a feat that could prove difficult to execute.\n\nAs the president-elect sorts through which priorities to push first, he'll need to consider that he is likely to face a divided Congress. Control of the Senate is still up in the air, with two Georgia runoff elections set for January, but Republicans are poised to maintain control. Democrats also have a slimmer majority in the House of Representatives, where the GOP made gains contrary to most party leaders' and analysts' predictions.\n\nThe political dynamic on Capitol Hill means Biden may have to pull back from some policy proposals that many on the left of his party have been pushing on health care and the environment. He will likely need to focus more immediately on issues that could attract bipartisan support, such as providing COVID-19 relief and improving U.S. infrastructure.\n\nNPR has taken a look through some of Biden's promises and short-term goals for his presidency, some of which are laid out on a new transition website. Here's what might be coming:\n\nWhat Biden says he'll do on Day 1 or beforehand\n\nCOVID-19: Assemble a coronavirus task force during his presidential transition\n\nDays after becoming president-elect, Biden announced a team of advisers that will spearhead his pandemic response once he takes office. The task force will be led by Dr. David Kessler, a former Food and Drug Administration commissioner; former Surgeon General Vivek Murthy; and Dr. Marcella Nunez-Smith, an associate professor of medicine and epidemiology at Yale School of Medicine.\n\nThe advisory board will help shape my approach to managing the surge in reported infections; ensuring vaccines are safe, effective, and distributed efficiently, equitably, and free; and protecting at-risk populations, Biden said in a statement Monday morning.\n\nCOVID-19: Push for immediate coronavirus legislation\n\nAs part of this initiative, the president-elect has also promised to begin working on a new coronavirus aid package before officially taking office, vowing to coordinate with state governors, mayors and other local politicians.\n\nI'll ask the new Congress to put a bill on my desk by the end of January with all the resources to see how both our public health and economic response can be seen through the end, he said at an event in late October.\n\nBiden's proposed COVID-19 response plan calls for expanding coronavirus testing resources as well as for increasing the country's capacity to make personal protective equipment by leveraging the Defense Production Act. He has also backed legislation that would create a separate COVID-19 Racial and Ethnic Disparities Task Force, which Vice President-elect Kamala Harris proposed in the Senate in the spring.\n\nAs part of a COVID-19 relief package, Biden has in the past called for at least $10,000 in student loan debt to be canceled for all Americans.\n\nCOVID-19: Release a vaccine distribution plan\n\nBiden has said he'll start working to install an effective distribution plan for a potential COVID-19 vaccine on the first day of his presidency. His plan would spend $25 billion on vaccine production and disbursement, and calls for an eventual vaccine to be free for all Americans.\n\nBiden has expressed skepticism over the Trump administration's promises to provide a vaccine quickly. Trump has said he will have a vaccine ready for distribution by the end of 2020.\n\nCOVID-19: Listen to science by rejoining WHO and keeping Fauci as a close adviser\n\nAs president, Biden says he will mend the U.S. relationship with the World Health Organization, rejoining the body on his first day in office. Trump pulled out of WHO over the summer.\n\nBiden also said that he plans immediately to ask Dr. Anthony Fauci, the government's top infectious disease expert, to stay in his post as director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, a job he's had since 1984.\n\nTrump had hinted that if he won the election, he might fire Fauci.\n\nEconomy: Reverse Trump's corporate tax cut\n\nBiden has pledged that on his first day as president he will raise corporate income taxes to 28% — compared with the current 21% rate set by the GOP-led tax cuts of 2017. Also, this promise falls under Biden's larger proposed tax plan, which stresses that Americans making less than $400,000 would not pay more in taxes.\n\nEnvironment: Make the U.S. an international leader on climate change\n\nIn one of his longest-standing campaign promises, Biden heads into office planning to reenter the U.S. immediately into the landmark Paris climate accord of 2015. Trump's move to pull the U.S. out of the agreement became official this month after a mandatory one-year waiting period that started when the president formally notified the United Nations.\n\nRacial equity: Extend the Voting Rights Act\n\nBiden has pushed for the passage of laws to strengthen the Voting Rights Act. Legislation to do so passed the U.S. House last year but not the Senate. Biden advocated for extending the original 1965 legislation following the death of civil rights icon Rep. John Lewis of Georgia.\n\nImmigration: Comprehensive immigration changes\n\nBiden has said that on his first day as president he will produce comprehensive immigration legislation that creates a pathway to citizenship for 11 million migrants living in the U.S. illegally. It would also provide a pathway to citizenship for people commonly known as DREAMers, who are part of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program.\n\nBiden has additionally pledged to make the DACA program permanent on his first day in office, a move that comes after years of Trump administration attempts to rescind the program.\n\nImmigration: Stop family separation at the U.S.-Mexico border\n\nThe president-elect has vowed to stop the practice of separating immigrant families trying to enter the U.S. from Mexico. On Day 1 as president, Biden has said he plans to pass an executive order establishing a task force focused on reuniting children and parents separated at the border.\n\nImmigration: End Trump's executive order banning travelers from some Muslim-majority countries\n\nBiden says he will immediately rescind current restrictions that bar people in some Muslim-majority countries from traveling or immigrating to the United States. He supports legislation that would outlaw such restrictions and has vowed to sign off on it as president.\n\nWhat Biden says he'll do during his first 100 days\n\nImmigration: Reverse a slew of Trump policies, including the construction of a U.S.-Mexican border wall\n\nWithin the first 100 days of his administration, Biden says he wants to reform the U.S. asylum system and the treatment of people at the border with Mexico, specifically calling for a stop to the Trump administration's Migrant Protection Protocols as well as to the policy of metering asylum cases.\n\nThe president-elect also pledges to take away funding toward continued construction of a wall along the southern U.S. border. But Biden says he wouldn't take down parts of the wall that have already been built.\n\nThe president-elect's immigration plan also would increase government supervision over U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement as well as Customs and Border Protection, calling for the need to hold personnel accountable for inhumane treatment. This comes as a whistleblower complaint was filed in September concerning medical conditions at a Georgia immigrant detention center.\n\nCriminal justice: Increase police reform\n\nIn response to the national outcry that erupted over police killings of George Floyd and other Black Americans, Biden said he will institute a national police oversight commission within his first 100 days of taking office. It's part of a larger plan to help overhaul policing, including investing $300 million into community policing measures across the U.S. and tasking the Justice Department with investigating possible issues of police and prosecutorial misconduct.\n\nCriminal justice: Enact comprehensive criminal justice reform\n\nAs the first step in a set of goals addressing prison reform and crime prevention, Biden says he will quickly push Congress to pass the SAFE Justice Act, proposed by Rep. Bobby Scott, D-Va. The legislation would include taking steps to reduce the use of mandatory minimum sentencing for nonviolent offenses and institute policies geared at lowering recidivism.\n\nForeign policy: Repair alliances and plan a global Summit for Democracy\n\nBiden has said he intends to pick up the pieces of Donald Trump's broken foreign policy, vowing to reach out to U.S. allies soon after taking office. Within his first year, Biden wants to plan an international summit where democratic leaders will discuss ways to push back against corruption and authoritarian practices as well as expand human rights.\n\nBiden also wants to organize a climate world summit to assist nations with high carbon emissions to take climate action. Questions remain about how either summit would be doable during a global pandemic.\n\nOther potential early policy steps\n\nIt's not clear when we might start seeing some of Biden's big plans for the economy, environment, education system and health care take form — especially as the president-elect may enter the White House with a divided Congress. That said, these plans were substantial parts of his campaign, and his administration is likely to begin addressing them.\n\nEconomy: Make major investments in the U.S. economy to boost domestic growth\n\nBiden hopes to create 5 million jobs through a series of large investments geared at benefiting different business areas. His proposed Made in America plan would pour $400 billion into procurement measures to boost domestic manufacturing as well as an additional $300 billion into research and development.\n\nEnvironment: Start on a $2 trillion climate plan\n\nThe president-elect also heads into office with an extensive set of environmental goals proposed through his clean energy plan, which includes getting the country to net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.\n\nThe proposal calls for a $2 trillion investment, throughout his term, to boost reliance on clean energy and climate sustainable practices. Biden also says that 40% of the funding will be used to support communities disproportionately affected by climate change, as laid out in his environmental justice plan.\n\nHealth care: Build on the Affordable Care Act if it isn't too late\n\nA large part of Biden's health care proposal offers a new public option plan that builds on the existing Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. But the ACA's fate remains in question during the rest of Trump's term and into next year.\n\nOn Nov. 10, the Supreme Court is set to hear arguments against the ACA from the Trump administration and multiple states. If the justices side with Trump next year when they make their decision, Biden's plans for health care could completely change.\n\nEducation: Make first moves in a large education agenda\n\nBiden has laid out extensive plans for changes to higher education as well as pre-K through high school, but he has not expressed many clear deadlines during his first year.\n\nNotably, the president-elect has expressed support for the College for All Act, proposed in 2017 by Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., which would eliminate tuition at public colleges and universities for families making up to $125,000. Biden also is advocating for private historically Black colleges and universities and minority-serving institutions to be tuition-free.\n\nFor a comprehensive list of Biden's campaign proposals, check out NPR's issue tracker.
Amy Klobuchar Runs On A Record Of Accomplishments — Including With Republicans\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Amr Alfiky/NPR Amr Alfiky/NPR\n\nMinnesotans like Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar. She was re-elected in the purple state in 2018 by 24 points, and in January Morning Consult polling found her to be one of the most popular senators in the country.\n\nShe's hoping that strong support in her home state — which happens to be in the upper Midwest, neighboring states where Donald Trump carved his path to victory — can translate into support from primary voters looking for someone who can beat President Trump as they choose the 2020 Democratic presidential nominee.\n\nBut on the way, Klobuchar faces some obstacles: her moderate politics (at least, relative to many of her competitors for the nomination) may turn off some Democratic primary voters, as may some of the reports that she has mistreated her staff.\n\nKlobuchar discussed her approach to policy, politics and leadership with NPR's Rachel Martin.\n\nShe's the fifth 2020 candidate to talk to Morning Edition for an Opening Argument conversation, exploring the presidential candidates' core messages.\n\nOn health care\n\nMartin: Several Democratic presidential candidates support some version of Medicare for All or single-payer health care system. Do you?\n\nKlobuchar: Every American deserves affordable health care, and we have to move to universal health care. So, what I support is moving to universal health care as quickly as possible.\n\nMartin: And when you say universal health care, you mean a single-payer system.\n\nKlobuchar: I mean health care for everyone ... and we may end up there one day. But what's the fastest way we can expand health care more immediately? I would do cost-sharing and reinsurance. That's a bill that's out there right now to help with premiums. ...\n\nThen, the public option, in the first year we should pass legislation for a public option that could be done with Medicaid or with Medicare. You could expand Medicare. You could expand Medicaid, but have a public option, which is the original idea that President Obama conceived. Why? Because then you would have a less expensive option for people to go to. That could result in a lot of people leaving other private plans to go to that public option, and Medicaid's an interesting way to do it.\n\nMany Democrats in this presidential field are backing some form of single-payer health care, following the lead of Bernie Sanders' 2016 campaign, in which he pushed his Medicare for All plan.\n\nThat sets Klobuchar apart from some of her competitors.\n\nHer route to universal health care doesn't mean putting everyone on a government-administered insurance plan. Rather, she first supports a bipartisan plan backed in the last Congress by Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., and Sen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn. That bill, which ultimately failed, would have stabilized the Obamacare exchanges.\n\nIn addition, Klobuchar has said that she wants to allow people to buy into Medicaid via a bill sponsored by Sen. Brian Schatz, D-Hawaii — a public option plan.\n\nThat said, Klobuchar explains that she's not exactly against Medicare for All.\n\nShe told NPR, We may end up there one day. But what's the fastest way we can expand health care more immediately?\n\nOn being more moderate than many of her Democratic opponents\n\nMartin: More than any candidate, in a very large field of Democratic presidential hopefuls, you have a proven record of working across the aisle with Republicans. You are by most definitions someone who legislates from the center — a political moderate. Do you think that helps you or hurts you in this campaign?\n\nKlobuchar: I would hope that it helps me, because when you look at my record I have stood up on so many progressive issues, whether it is choice, whether it is the environment, whether it is standing up for immigrants and against racial injustice.\n\nBut there are moments where we can find common ground.\n\n... I worked with [Former Utah GOP] Sen. [Orrin] Hatch to get a billion dollars for school safety after the tragedy in Parkland. But that doesn't mean that I don't stand my ground.\n\nSo while I was the lead Democrat on the school safety money, which passed overwhelmingly, I also was standing my ground against the president when it comes to universal background checks and an assault weapon ban. I sat directly across from him at that meeting, listened to him say nine times he wanted to get universal background checks done, and then saw him bow to the NRA the next day.\n\nThat's just wrong. So, I use that example because on one hand you can find common ground with people like Sen. Hatch on the billion dollars for school safety, and then you can fight the bigger battles.\n\nProgressive voters are clearly energized in this campaign, as evidenced by the kinds of positions many of the candidates are taking.\n\nKlobuchar still takes some relatively liberal stands — she's a co-sponsor on the Green New Deal, and a public option isn't exactly a popular proposal among Republicans. But she has also stopped short of endorsing Medicare for All and said she opposes tuition-free college.\n\nHer willingness to reach out to Republicans might help her with those voters who believe Washington is broken, and that compromise would break gridlock. But it's easy to see how in a primary, running as a candidate who reaches across the aisle might not endear her to those Democratic voters who simply do not want compromise on their most important issues.\n\nAnd while Democrats say they want someone ultimately who is electable, there are disagreements over whether that means someone who can appeal to the political center or has a clear, progressive message to excite the party's base.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Amr Alfiky/NPR Amr Alfiky/NPR\n\nOn regulating big tech\n\nMartin: Sen. Elizabeth Warren — also running for president — has identified privacy and transparency as an issue when it comes to these tech companies... She wants to break up those companies, so that they can't sell the same products on their platform where competitors are also trying to get an edge in. Do you agree with that plan? Do you think it goes too far?\n\nKlobuchar: Well, what's interesting is I see it an even larger way, which is why I've been trying to use antitrust law and make changes there. ... Yeah, some of them you may spin off parts of the companies, some of them you may break off.\n\nAnd you can do things like that, but I think you should do it by getting those things investigated and figure out which company is doing what, number one.\n\nNumber 2: I would then change the standards under the law so that no longer does the government have to prove that it reduces competition to throw something out; that in fact the companies have to prove that they don't materially reduce competition, which is also a language change to the standard, and also that you can look back at deals like what Facebook just did by buying Instagram and other apps, that you can look to see, even though they already did it, is that anti-competitive?\n\nTech regulation and, more broadly, antitrust regulation may be topics on which Klobuchar can set herself apart from a wide field of candidates. She is well-respected for her knowledge on the topic, and it's an area where she has been active in the Senate.\n\nAlong with Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., and the late Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., she introduced the Honest Ads Act in 2017. That bill would require better disclosure of the people and organizations who fund online political advertisements.\n\nShe has also introduced antitrust legislation that could make mergers tougher for large companies. While that might be a dry policy topic to many voters, it could be more of a hot topic this year, as tech firms' uses of customers' private data, as well as the spread of hate speech and propaganda online, have angered many Americans.\n\nOn her treatment of her staff\n\nMartin: There are reports citing several former staffers from your office who allege that you mistreated them. And I ask about this because we are in a moment in this country where we are having a national conversation about power and workplace dynamics and what is acceptable and what is not, especially in a leader.\n\nDo you think your behavior in these instances should raise concerns in the minds of voters?\n\nKlobuchar: No, I don't. And I would first point to that over 60 of our staff — former staff came together, everyone from chiefs of staff to people on the front line that worked with me, that were in the car with me all day, and said that they had a good experience working in our office. So, to me that was really important when I saw that letter, and I think it's worth looking at. So that's the first thing.\n\nSecondly, I do have high standards. I do push people hard. I have high standards of myself, of our staff and also for our nation. And so that is the way I'm going to look at this going forward. And that is — I can always do better and I will. But we have gotten so much done with our team. My state director has been with me seven years. My chief of staff around five years. My campaign manager 14 years.\n\nYou don't win elections like we have, which is winning every single congressional district in Minnesota, including [former GOP Rep.] Michele Bachmann's. You do not pass — get Vanderbilt to rate you as the No. 1 Democratic senator for getting things done under 15 metrics in the U.S. Senate and the first minority party senator to break the top five since John McCain in 1994.\n\nYou don't get that done alone. You get that done because you have great staff that work with you, and they're not only just working for me, they are working for our country, and I'm very proud of them.\n\nIn multiple news stories, former Klobuchar staffers have alleged that the senator engaged in abusive behaviors from bullying to throwing a binder that accidentally hit a staffer.\n\nThat is raising questions for voters, and Klobuchar has been attempting to answer those stories by acknowledging her high standards for her staff. She has also taken the chance to pitch herself as a candidate with a strength of character that would serve the country well.\n\nWhen you're out there on the world stage and dealing with people like Vladimir Putin, yeah, you want someone who's tough, she told CNN. You want someone that demands the answers and that's going to get things done, and that's what I've done my whole life.\n\nBo Hamby and Eric McDaniel produced and edited this interview for broadcast.
Democrat Chrissy Houlahan On Pennsylvania's 6th\n\nNPR's David Greene talks to Chrissy Houlahan, winner of the (unopposed) Democratic primary in Pennsylvania's 6th Congressional District, about how she plans to flip the seat in the midterm elections.\n\nDAVID GREENE, HOST:\n\nOne big reason President Trump won in 2016 was his success in Pennsylvania. His message about jobs and bringing back struggling industries resonated even with many Democrats. In 2018, if Democrats end up succeeding and taking control of the House, a big reason could be Pennsylvania. The state Supreme Court threw out its congressional map this year, re-drew district lines, and Democrats think they can flip a number of seats. They took some first steps yesterday as Pennsylvania, along with a number of other states, held primaries. And Democrat Chrissy Houlahan won in a district that includes some Philadelphia suburbs as well as the city of Reading. She joins me this morning.\n\nI know you were unopposed, but it's official now. You're the candidate. Congratulations.\n\nCHRISSY HOULAHAN: Thank you, thank you, and thank you for having me on today.\n\nGREENE: Yeah, thank you for taking the time. I want to ask you about one of the big themes yesterday. It looks clear now that Pennsylvania is going to have at least one female member of Congress. Both candidates are women in one district - could be more than one in Congress if you win. Now, Pennsylvania's entire congressional delegation has been men. Politics aside, is there an issue you feel that's been neglected because of that?\n\nHOULAHAN: So I'm not sure exactly if you're asking me if there's an issue with the fact that there are only men in our delegation. I think that's clearly an issue (laughter). And I'm hopeful that - as you mention - that not just one but maybe several of us will be able to make it through the gauntlet in the fall and be able to break that barrier in Pennsylvania.\n\nGREENE: Is there something that has been neglected because they are men? Do you feel like if there are women serving Pennsylvania that there will be some difference?\n\nHOULAHAN: Well, I think certainly that there are a lot of issues that, I guess, would be considered women's issues, but I would argue are more likely called family issues that, I think, probably would be better served by having a more diverse delegation in Pennsylvania. But similarly - not just gender-based - we ought to have a delegation that includes people with diverse backgrounds and experiences. And relevant in my case, as an example, I'm also a veteran, and I'm also an engineer. And so I think that in our congressional delegation in Pennsylvania right now, it's not just that it's largely men. It's largely men who are either businessmen or who have been kind of successful in climbing the ranks of politics.\n\nGREENE: Well, let me ask you about politics. Let's say you have a Pennsylvania voter in your district who backed President Trump - maybe likes the big tax cut, maybe doesn't like the Affordable Care Act - Obamacare - feels that the president has shown leadership on the world stage. How do you win that person over?\n\nHOULAHAN: So actually, in talking to a lot of people who are, I guess, would be self-described as Republicans or independents, I actually haven't found a whole lot of people who fit that bill. Most of the folks in my community particularly, who may have voted for President Trump, have now realized that the tax bill that did pass is not necessarily one that is good for them personally, particularly in Pennsylvania. As you probably know, we are one of those state and local tax places. And so that tax bill isn't particularly good for our community, for property values, for schools and that sort of thing. I think also, increasingly, people have come to, relatively speaking, embrace the Affordable Care Act more certainly than they had in the beginning. They, at least in my conversations with them, would like to see the Affordable Care Act shored up to some degree to make sure that we have affordable care. And so I don't think that I have personally run into a lot of people who are Republicans or independents who necessarily have that narrative of why they voted for President Trump.\n\nGREENE: Let me ask you - there seems to be a struggle in your party about strategy. I mean, in a special election in Pennsylvania that made a lot of news, Democrat Conor Lamb won after distancing himself from House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi. Do you support Pelosi?\n\nHOULAHAN: Yeah, and so I have a very similar answer to that. I answered that question yesterday. It's interesting that I only get that question from the press or from media or, you know, from people in Washington, D.C. Again, it's something that doesn't really come up in our community at all. It's something - when we talk about things in our community, it's jobs. It's education. It's making sure that we have affordable health care. And those kinds of decisions, you know, that are sort of inside baseball are not necessarily something that I'm asked on the regular in our community.\n\nGREENE: Chrissy Houlahan is the Democratic candidate for Pennsylvania's 6th Congressional District. She'll be running this fall. Thanks so much for joining us.\n\nHOULAHAN: Thank you. I appreciate it very much.\n\nGREENE: Just want to bring in NPR congressional reporter Kelsey Snell who covered all of the races yesterday. Hi, Kelsey.\n\nKELSEY SNELL, BYLINE: Hi, there.\n\nGREENE: Lots of focus on Democrats in Pennsylvania. Interesting there to hear Chrissy Houlahan not give a clear answer about...\n\nSNELL: Yeah.\n\nGREENE: ...Nancy Pelosi, saying it doesn't really come up. But also, I mean, there were Republican races yesterday. If you were President Trump, do you like what you saw yesterday? Do you dislike it? How was he feeling this morning?\n\nSNELL: He's probably paying the most attention to Congressman Lou Barletta who won the primary to be the Republican candidate for Senate. Trump recorded a robocall for Barletta, and he's called him a good friend. And we kind of expect that Trump's going to come out to Pennsylvania and campaign for Barletta, which will bring up the question whether or not Republicans want to associate themselves with the president. It's going to be an ongoing question that happens throughout the state.\n\nGREENE: That's NPR congressional reporter Kelsey Snell. Kelsey, thanks.\n\nSNELL: Thank you.\n\nCopyright © 2018 NPR.

As Supreme Court Nears Solid Conservative Majority, GOP Reaps Reward From 'Long Game'\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images\n\nDemocrats are playing a very weak hand in the battle over Brett Kavanaugh's nomination to the Supreme Court. They're locked out of power in Washington, D.C, and can't block the nomination thanks to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's decision in 2017 to end the filibuster for Supreme Court nominations.\n\nBut Democrats' judicial problems started long before they lost the 2016 elections. Republicans have been working for decades to get to where they are now — on the cusp of cementing a conservative majority on the Supreme Court for a generation.\n\nHow did they get here?\n\nFor conservatives, there has to be a long game, says Leonard Leo, executive vice president of the Federalist Society, because a Supreme Court vacancy is about much more than just overturning Roe v. Wade. What is important for conservatives is a court that will respect and enforce all the limits on governmental power and control contained in the Constitution.\n\nLeo, an architect of conservatives' long game for the courts, says that's a big difference between the way the right and left have approached the courts: Liberals, Leo says, are outcome-oriented, while conservatives are more interested in the courts' role in society. For the right, outcomes, or a decision in a specific case, matter less than ensuring the next generation of judges shares a judicial philosophy, Leo also said.\n\nConservative concentration, liberal complacency\n\nBrian Fallon, who runs Demand Justice, a liberal group focused on the courts, says Republicans made it to this place by playing the long game.\n\nThis is the product of 40 years of Republicans stoking grievance about the sense that the courts were completely a runaway institution that was promoting liberal values, Fallon says.\n\nWhile conservatives were becoming aggrieved with the courts, says Fallon, liberals were getting complacent.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Shaun Tandon/AFP/Getty Images Shaun Tandon/AFP/Getty Images\n\nOn the progressive side of things, [we] think of the courts as an institution for good. We don't worry about it so much [because] we think that judges will naturally do the right thing because that's what history has shown us, he says.\n\nIndeed, for the last 40 years, liberals have had reason to feel confident in the Supreme Court.\n\nAfter all, civil rights, voting rights, abortion rights — even Obamacare to some degree — were all upheld. Same-sex marriage is the law of the land thanks to the Supreme Court.\n\nSo instead, liberals focused their efforts on specific advocacy issues rather than institutions.\n\nMeanwhile, conservatives made a reliably conservative Supreme Court their top priority.\n\nResources and infrastructure\n\nGuy Cecil, chairman of Priorities USA, a Democratic advocacy group, says Republicans have had the resources and capacity to build specific infrastructure around the courts to move them ideologically over time.\n\nDeep-pocketed donors like the Koch brothers have helped provide those resources — which essentially created a pipeline of young, conservative law clerks who would go on to become young conservative judges.\n\nYou have the Koch Brothers, who every two years announce they're going to fund $300 and $400 million operations, Cecil says. Those aren't just candidate operations, those are building policy infrastructure, legislative infrastructure, candidate infrastructure [and] when you are putting $400 million into this system, you get a say in who the nominee is. We can pretend that it's otherwise, but that is absolutely true.\n\nNan Aron, the president of the Alliance for Justice, an association of over 130 civil rights public interest organizations, also recognizes that conservative donors know how to play the long game.\n\nOver the years, big business, together with groups on the right, have amassed a huge war chest devoted specifically to remaking the courts in their image, she says. On the left, that war chest has not existed.\n\nNot because the left doesn't have their own billionaires — big Democratic donors like George Soros and Tom Steyer, for example, have not made the courts a priority. And there's another problem with resources on the left, says Guy Cecil, when donations do roll in from Democrats, he points out, they come too late.\n\nNot only is that war chest non-existent, when donations do roll in from Democrats, Cecil points out, they come too late.\n\nWhen [liberals] care about issues or candidates, [they] give when those issues or those candidates come, he says. Whereas the right, they fund these programs 365 days a year.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n\nActivated voters\n\nAlso helpful for the right has been the activist grassroots base of voters who deeply care about the courts because of their hopes to one day overturn Roe v. Wade and to shift the courts overall in a more conservative direction.\n\nConservative voters care more about the court than liberal voters do. In the 2016 election, twice as many people who said the courts were their number one issue voted for Trump than for Clinton.\n\nThen-candidate Donald Trump capitalized on that passion during the 2016 campaign and made appointing judges to the Supreme Court one of his talking points. It worked.\n\nI think it's one of the reasons I got elected. I think the people of this country did not want to see what was happening with the Supreme Court, said Trump, shortly before his inauguration in 2017.\n\nFallon says evangelical voters held their noses and voted for Trump despite [him not being] somebody that leads a Christian lifestyle.\n\nBut their support had to be earned. In order to prove to conservatives that he would follow through on his commitment to appoint judges they would like, Trump announced a list of judges from which he promised to pick his Supreme Court nominees.\n\nThe creators of that list were the Federalist Society and the Heritage Foundation — two of the most important organizations in the conservative political universe.\n\nAnd I wanted to put this list out because I wanted to quell any fears that people may have. I mean this is a list of people that I got them from people I most respect, said Trump in an interview with Fox News host Sean Hannity during the 2016 campaign.\n\nIntellectual framework\n\nBut the long game is more than just money, organization and activated voters, says Fallon.\n\nEqually as important for the right in the last several decades as their infrastructure building has been the sort of intellectual horsepower contributed by people like the late Antonin Scalia and framing their whole judicial philosophy around the principle of originalism, which has given, in my view, an intellectual hook to something that is really just a way of cloaking a conservative judicial philosophy, says Fallon.\n\nIn other words, creating a specific philosophy framed in academic terms has helped groom a new generation of conservatives lawyers with not just job prospects, but a legal worldview.\n\nLeo says that nurturing the right's judicial philosophy and view of the high court's role in society is an inter-generational challenge that requires a constant renewal, starting with law students. You're inculcating an underlying philosophical understanding about the nature of government and the courts. That's different than saying are you in favor of this right or that right, this outcome or that outcome.\n\nFor liberals, says Leo, When you get the outcomes you want, it's less of a long game about building infrastructure and inculcating values early on in one's legal education and career. It's more of a political game of getting people who will uphold gay marriage. Then you fall into a false sense of complacency.\n\nBrian Fallon of Demand Justice says the left needs to match that approach by developing and disseminating its own judicial worldview. He and other liberal activists expect the progressive base of the Democratic Party to coalesce over the next several years to prioritize building up institutions, education and outreach around the courts.\n\nBut that takes time.\n\nIt took conservatives nearly 45 years from being on the losing end of Roe to being on the verge of ensuring a durable, conservative majority on the high court.\n\nIt might take liberals just as long.
Red State Democrat Prepared To Work With Donald Trump On Trade\n\nNPR's Audie Cornish speaks with Indiana Sen. Joe Donnelly about the posture he and the Democratic Party plan to take toward the Trump administration.\n\nAUDIE CORNISH, HOST:\n\nRepublicans may control the White House, House and Senate next year. The last one, the Senate, could give them trouble. That's because they hold a 52-seat majority, the slimmest of leads. And for bills that need 60 votes to win, that means winning over the hearts and minds of key Democrats open to their agenda. Rust Belt and rural-state Democrats who are up for re-election in 2018 will be go-to swing votes. Democrat Joe Donnelly is one of them. He represents Indiana in the U.S. Senate. Welcome to the program.\n\nJOE DONNELLY: Thank you so much for having me with you today.\n\nCORNISH: Now, to start, we want to note that you had high praise for Donald Trump for doing the Carrier factory deal. That's the deal that preserved a little less than half of the factory jobs that this company planned to send to Mexico. But Democrats really hammered Trump about this deal. So are you at odds with the left wing of your party already?\n\nDONNELLY: Well, no. I think that the key to this is that we did have approximately 700 more folks be able to stay in their jobs. And that was a critical element of it. And what I've said is that I hope President-elect Trump will work with me and with the rest of the Senate to try to keep more jobs here in America. I mean, I want to make sure that everybody, when they get to the Christmas table, has a chance to tell their family, hey, I've been able to stay in my job. That's what the focus is. That's what we're trying to get Donald Trump to join in on.\n\nCORNISH: Now, Republicans, particularly Republicans in the Senate, decided early on to essentially stand fast against President Obama. And that worked pretty well for them. Should Democrats become the party of no during a Trump administration?\n\nDONNELLY: Well that seems pretty un-American to me - what they did. My job isn't to represent the Democrat Party or the Republican Party. It's to represent Hoosier families. I thought that was shameful behavior. And my job is to do what's right. And that's what I'm going to try and do.\n\nCORNISH: You talked about Hoosier families. But Trump won your state by nearly 20 percent. So does it sound like they agree with his agenda? And what does that leave for you, as a Democrat in the Senate?\n\nDONNELLY: Well, I think that the people in our state want to see more jobs, more opportunity. And they want to make sure that Washington listens to them. Look, I have an agricultural community that's second to none in the world. And every time they tried to move forward, it seemed the EPA was working against them in - turn after turn.\n\nAnd so they've always said, we want clean water. But we want to be part of the solution. And so I think that was a message that the folks not only in my state but around the country - want people to listen to them and know that they're here, know that they have a lot to contribute and make our country stronger.\n\nCORNISH: You mentioned concerns about the EPA, the Environmental Protection Agency. When you look at these cabinet choices by the incoming administration, which one are you worried about? Because there are Democrats who look at them and say, you've got picks who want to abolish the departments they may be leading, who want to roll back major Democrat-penned legislation like Obamacare. Which one do you think Democrats should challenge?\n\nDONNELLY: I'm very concerned about the Tom Price nomination because he talks about privatizing Medicare.\n\nCORNISH: This is for the Health and Human Services.\n\nDONNELLY: Health and Human Services, yes. He talks about privatizing Medicare. You know, our seniors shouldn't have to check their stock balance before they can get knee surgery. And we're going to stand up for our seniors on this issue. I'm also very concerned about the nominee named today, Rex Tillerson, for secretary of state. I'm very, very concerned about the Russian connections that we're seeing, the potential damage to our national security and the lack of experience. And so I'm concerned about both of those. I think that General Mattis is a good choice in Defense, though.\n\nCORNISH: You know, when you were first elected back when you're elected in the House, it was with Blue Dogs, right? There was, like, a whole coalition of red-state Democrats. That's been decimated.\n\nDONNELLY: I'm a proud Blue Dog, absolutely.\n\nCORNISH: Now you're here in the Senate with, again, just a handful of other Blue Dogs. This is not a group of Democrats that's growing. Can Democrats regain the ground that they've lost with voters in states like yours?\n\nDONNELLY: When we talk to them about issues of importance to them, when we talk to them about their family and making sure that we can have better skills training for their kids to get good jobs - that we can try to keep jobs here in America rather than seeing them go overseas - that we'll fight for our friends and neighbors. We'll fight for the people of Muncie and Richmond and Evansville. When they hear...\n\nCORNISH: But you don't think Democrats have been doing that up until this point?\n\nDONNELLY: Well, not when we've had trade deals that have ship jobs overseas, absolutely not. What we need to do is stand up and fight for our people in our states.\n\nCORNISH: Senator Joe Donnelly is a Democrat from Indiana. Thank you for speaking with us.\n\nDONNELLY: Thank you so much.\n\nCopyright © 2016 NPR. All rights reserved.

Repeal And Replace Slogan Fails To Deliver Vote On Obamacare Alternative\n\nSteve Inskeep talks to NPR's Susan Davis and Larry Leavitt, senior vice president of the Kaiser Family Foundation, about the collapse of the Republican health care bill in the Senate.\n\nDAVID GREENE, HOST:\n\nThe Republican health care bill met its demise last night. Senators Mike Lee and Jerry Moran simultaneously announce their opposition to the replacement for the Affordable Care Act. President Trump took to his own Twitter, saying, Republicans should just repeal failing Obamacare now and work on a new health care plan that will start from a clean slate. Dems will join in, end quote. NPR's Susan Davis has been covering every twist and turn in this. And she's in our studios. Hi, Sue.\n\nSUSAN DAVIS, BYLINE: Good morning, David.\n\nGREENE: So let's step back here. Republicans have been promising to repeal and replace for seven years. You'd think they've had some time to think about how best to do that. Why did this bill fall short?\n\nDAVIS: It fell short because they just could not simply find a consensus on what repeal and replace ultimately looked like. Repeal and replace was always a good slogan. And, you know, it did deliver victories. It helped win them control of the House and the Senate and, eventually, the White House. But when they had to put pen to paper and illuminate what a Republican vision of the individual market should look like, they just couldn't find consensus. And part of that is also the reality of having a very, very narrow majority in the United States Senate. There's only 52 Republican votes. They had very little room for error. And in the end, they just couldn't get there.\n\nGREENE: So what happens now? Mitch McConnell's talking about maybe the Republican leadership just repealing and then worrying about replacing later and then maybe working with Democrats. Is that - is that a realistic path?\n\nDAVIS: You know, I think Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, knows that he has to have a vote on this one way or another. He has said that, at some point to be determined - he hasn't said when - that there are going to, again, have a procedural vote just to get on the bill - just to say, hey, we're ready to start debating this issue. Huge question mark if they can even get those 50 votes. And then he has said, if they can get on it, the first vote will be repeal only - which is what the president is calling for.\n\nIn a way, he's sort of calling people's bluff. This was a strategy that a lot of Republicans had supported in the beginning of the year. They eventually decided that was not a good idea, to take away health care and not be able to illuminate what you would - could replace it with. I think it's more of a political move than a policy one. But it'll be interesting to see where the votes fall.\n\nGREENE: But that's important here. So you're saying there is even some uncertainty in that - that he could muster enough votes to just do a straight-up repeal.\n\nDAVIS: Absolutely because if you're saying, this is going to be the first vote we have, there's - remember, you know, that's a move to appeal to a lot of conservatives. But a lot of moderate Republicans, like Susan Collins of Maine, a senator we've heard a lot about in the recent weeks, are unlikely to get behind that strategy. So again, there is really no one plan that can get 50 senators on board.\n\nGREENE: How bad is this in terms of a setback for the entire Republican agenda?\n\nDAVIS: You know, we don't know for sure. But I can tell you what Republicans have told me repeatedly in recent weeks, that they saw failure here as potentially devastating to the rest of the Republican agenda in terms of getting tax reform done, which is arguably a bigger priority for many in the party than health care - in terms of getting an infrastructure bill done or moving any big legislative lifts.\n\nIf you can't do the one thing that, in theory, unified the entire party, how can you do even harder things? I think there's a fear that failure here will be sort of internally corrosive, will prompt some element of party infighting and that - I think it also shows there's still a lot of distance and potentially some distrust between Republicans in Congress and their president in the White House.\n\nGREENE: So let me ask - let me just ask you a broad question here. Matthew Continetti - he's a conservative writer, the editor of The Washington Free Beacon. He was on our show this morning. He said that health care is not the Republicans' issue. I asked him, do you mean that Americans shouldn't trust Republicans on health care? He said, no, no, no, just politically, it's a bad issue. Do you hear that from Republicans?\n\nDAVIS: You know, I do. I mean, health care is an issue I don't think is in the marrow of the Republican Party's bones in the same way it is for the Democratic Party. And also, you know, fundamentally, if you think of the way these debates were framed, the Affordable Care Act was about giving people something. And this Republican health care bill was about taking something away. And that's always going to be a more difficult sell to the American electorate when they perceive that their government is taking something from them.\n\nSTEVE INSKEEP, HOST:\n\nOK, so NPR's Susan Davis is here. And let's bring another voice into the conversation now to ask, in this intricate debate, what are some of the facts that are most relevant now. Larry Levitt joins us by Skype. He's senior vice president of the Kaiser Family Foundation, which studies health care and is separate, by the way, from the insurance company, Kaiser Permanente. Mr. Levitt, welcome to the program.\n\nLARRY LEVITT: Thanks, good morning.\n\nINSKEEP: So what does this latest collapse mean for the health care industry?\n\nLEVITT: Well, the health care industry, and particularly insurance companies, will be looking intently at how the Trump administration reacts to this. The Affordable Care Act is still the law of the land. Insurers have to set premiums for 2018 and decide whether they're going to participate in the insurance marketplaces. And they're looking and reading the tea leaves to see what the Trump administration is going to do following this failure.\n\nINSKEEP: OK. So before we even get to the longer term prospects for Obamacare, there's this real-time decision that insurance companies are making now about whether to participate in the health care market in - I don't know - Idaho, Kentucky. Pick your state.\n\nLEVITT: Absolutely. And there are two things in particular insurers are looking for. One is whether the administration will enforce the individual mandate. That's the stick that compels healthy and young people to sign up for insurance or pay a penalty. And then the second is whether the administration will pay what's known as cost-sharing subsidies. Insurers under the law have to provide lower deductibles to low-income consumers. And these subsidies compensate insurers for that cost.\n\nIn the past, the president has threatened to withhold those subsidies, which are the subject of a lawsuit, to try and bring insurers to the table to negotiate a bill. Well, there's not a bill to negotiate right now. And insurers, if they don't get that money, would have to raise premiums significantly, or might just pull out of the market altogether.\n\nINSKEEP: OK. So the administration can do things right now or not do things right now that could cause premiums to go up or could cause more or fewer choices for people in different insurance markets. You mentioned, though, that what the Trump administration does is being closely watched. There is something that the guy at the top of the Trump administration has already done. He has publicly said, as we heard David and Sue discuss - he's publicly said, go ahead with repeal. Just repeal it. Work on replacement later.\n\nAnd Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, has effectively said they're going to try that. They're going to attempt that. What are the implications for the insurance market if that worked - if there's a straight repeal, if there's no replacement and a two-year deadline and Congress says, we'll work something out over the next couple of years?\n\nLEVITT: There's an important fact to know about this repeal. It's not actually a full repeal because Republicans can't do that under the budget rules they're operating in for this debate. So...\n\nINSKEEP: Oh, this is just a partial repeal at best. OK.\n\nLEVITT: This is a partial repeal. It repeals the subsidies that help people buy insurance. It repeals the Medicaid expansion. It repeals all of the taxes. And it repeals the individual mandate, in fact, retroactively. What it doesn't do is repeal the requirement on insurers that they take everyone, including people with preexisting conditions.\n\nINSKEEP: Meaning that over the next couple of years, insurers would still have to take anybody.\n\nLEVITT: Exactly. Insurers would have to take anyone. People would not get subsidies to help them buy insurance. And there would be no individual mandate to compel healthy people to sign up. So what the Congressional Budget Office has said is that premiums would immediately go up 20 to 25 percent next year, and eventually double by 2026. And the number of people uninsured would rise by 18 million initially and eventually by 32 million.\n\nINSKEEP: Wait a minute. Wait a minute. We're talking about they'll repeal with a two-year delay. Are you saying even before the two-year period ended, that premiums would start soaring? That would be the practical effect here?\n\nLEVITT: Exactly - because the individual mandate would be repealed immediately. So insurers would have to take people with preexisting conditions. But the sense is healthy people without that mandate wouldn't sign up. So insurers, under that kind of uncertainty, would immediately raise premiums.\n\nINSKEEP: Stick with us for a moment, Larry Levitt, because I want to bring Susan Davis back into our conversation. She's been covering the politics of all this. And I'd like to know, Sue - Republicans have voted again and again and again for straight-up repeal - repeal of Obamacare. They did it just a couple of years ago. How eager, actually, are Republicans to just repeal Obamacare?\n\nDAVIS: Well, we may have - we may find out very soon. And it's not - I would not say it's the vast majority of Republicans. They like the idea of repeal. But the reason why they scuttled this original plan back in January is they realized it was tremendously risky to repeal legislation and not be able to tell the public what you're going to do with it. And remember, Congress does not do well when they say they're going to do things with big consequences.\n\nINSKEEP: (Laughter).\n\nDAVIS: The last time they did this, they tried to get a budget deal. And it resulted in painful budget cuts known as the sequester.\n\nINSKEEP: Which they've hated ever since. Larry Levitt is still on the line. And let me ask about another option here, which Mitch McConnell has discussed. Suppose, as McConnell once said, Republicans are finally forced to work with Democrats, come up with some kind of bipartisan plan. And then we're talking about options that improve choices for people in the health insurance market, hopefully lead to cheaper premiums. What bipartisan options are out there, potentially?\n\nLEVITT: Well, there are ideas that both Democrats and Republicans have talked about. One is providing insurance that these cost-sharing subsidies get paid to insurers. The other is pumping some money into the insurance market to help lower premiums and reduce the uncertainty insurers have in covering high-cost patients.\n\nINSKEEP: Wait a minute, paying more? Because Republicans are not going to like that.\n\nLEVITT: Well, you know, interestingly enough, all of the Republican bills included a substantial amount of money to funnel money to insurers to help bring premiums down. So there's at least some on-paper bipartisan support for that idea.\n\nINSKEEP: And then it just becomes a matter of getting the numbers - getting agreement on the numbers?\n\nLEVITT: Exactly, and figuring out what to do about this individual mandate because it's - you know, that's something Democrats are wedded to to stabilize the insurance system. And Republicans have been consistently opposed to that.\n\nINSKEEP: Larry Levitt, thanks very much. Really appreciate it.\n\nLEVITT: Thank you.\n\nLEVITT: He is senior vice president of the nonprofit Kaiser Family Foundation. He spoke with us by Skype from Oakland, Calif.

News Brief: Green New Deal, Va. Political Scandals, Wildfire's Toxic Effects\n\nFreshman Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is set to unveil her environmental plan. Multiple political scandals envelop Virginia. An update on the Camp Fire which destroyed the town of Paradise, Calif.\n\nSTEVE INSKEEP, HOST:\n\nToday, dozens of Democrats in the House of Representatives state their priorities in fighting climate change.\n\nDAVID GREENE, HOST:\n\nYeah. They're offering legislation that has been labeled a Green New Deal. And the lawmakers involved include one just arrived, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)\n\nALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ: Even the solutions that we have considered big and bold are nowhere near the scale of the actual problem that climate change presents to us, to our country and to the world.\n\nGREENE: Now, Ocasio-Cortez is a freshman, among the least-senior members of the House. But the self-described democratic socialist has received enormous attention since upsetting a senior New York lawmaker in a primary last year.\n\nWith dozens of co-sponsors, she presents a resolution today. It would promote wind and solar energy and call for the U.S. to have net-zero carbon emissions in 10 years. She talked about this in an NPR interview.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)\n\nOCASIO-CORTEZ: The thing about a Green New Deal is that it's not an outright ban on any source of energy. And that's my opinion, as one member of Congress. And one of the big goals that we have is that we're trying to just sketch out a blueprint and work with other members to get there.\n\nINSKEEP: NPR political editor Domenico Montanaro is here and has been reading an advance copy of that blueprint - that resolution. Hi there, Domenico.\n\nDOMENICO MONTANARO, BYLINE: Good morning, Steve.\n\nINSKEEP: So what's it say?\n\nMONTANARO: You know, this is a nonbinding resolution. And as we noted, some of what it does - you know, being carbon neutral by 2030 is one of those things that a lot of experts say is not only ambitious, but almost impossible to pull off. Experts shoot for more like 2050, and that's considered ambitious. It would also eliminate most, if not all, air travel, in fact, because of how it wants to restructure things like high-speed rail - so very ambitious - not a lot of specifics as far as how to get to those things, but certainly laying down a marker for where liberals want to go in addressing climate change.\n\nINSKEEP: Largely eliminate air travel, which is considered to be really bad for our planet - for carbon levels in the atmosphere, trying to get people in a different - in different direction. But you're saying it's - essentially, it's a set of notions or ideas. It would actually require big legislation later to enact these ideas.\n\nMONTANARO: Yeah, or small legislation, having to enact various numbers of these ideas to flesh this out. And it's going to be a really difficult thing to actually enact as far as getting it on the floor because getting it to a vote is not something that a lot of moderate Democrats are going to be wanting to, you know, have to walk the plank on, frankly.\n\nINSKEEP: Oh, well, let's talk about that. What would the reluctance be of Democratic leaders to buy into this Green New Deal notion?\n\nMONTANARO: Well, it's a plan that would cost trillions upon trillions of dollars, to be quite honest. And it's not something that would ever pass the Republican-controlled Senate. Now, you know, all of that is practical and looking at the actual politics of the day.\n\nOf course, liberals are going to say that this is, you know, a bold step forward that they can argue for and win people over on. And that very well may be the case. But Democrats in 2009 took a step with cap and trade, which was far less dramatic than this plan would be. It passed the House, didn't pass the Senate. And a lot of Democrats feel like they suffered some consequences along with the passage of Obamacare in the 2010 midterm elections.\n\nAnd let's remember the reason Democrats won in the 2018 midterms - while Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is able to get so much attention for herself and for her - the things that she wants to do, this election was really won on the backs of moderates.\n\nINSKEEP: Oh, moderates who were able to win in suburban areas that had been Republican before.\n\nMONTANARO: Right.\n\nINSKEEP: Domenico, thanks so much.\n\nMONTANARO: You're so welcome.\n\nINSKEEP: That's NPR's Domenico Montanaro.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)\n\nINSKEEP: All right. When President Trump delivered his State of the Union speech the other night, almost all members of Congress and almost all members of the Cabinet attended. One Cabinet member was the designated survivor - designated to stay away just in case of calamity.\n\nGREENE: Well, in the state of Virginia, if they were to take that precaution, it might need to designate one top official to hide out from scandal. The top three officials in that state are all facing serious questions now.\n\nGovernor Ralph Northam faces pressure to resign over an old racist photo. The lieutenant governor, Justin Fairfax, is publicly accused by a woman who says he sexually assaulted her in 2004. And now the state's third-ranking official, Attorney General Mark Herring, has admitted that he donned blackface at a college party in the '80s.\n\nINSKEEP: NPR's Sarah McCammon, a resident of Virginia, has been following all this and is in our studio. Sarah, good morning.\n\nSARAH MCCAMMON, BYLINE: Hi, Steve.\n\nINSKEEP: So Lieutenant Governor Fairfax has been fending off these allegations for a number of days, but now the woman who accused him has stepped forward with a written statement. What have you learned?\n\nMCCAMMON: Right. And her name is Vanessa Tyson. We had not been naming her until yesterday, when she came forward to tell her story. She's a politics professor at Scripps College in California and currently a fellow at Stanford. And in a detailed statement, she says, quote, what began as consensual kissing quickly turned into a sexual assault, she says, by Justin Fairfax. This was in 2004, she says, at the Democratic National Convention in Boston.\n\nINSKEEP: They were both working at the convention, right? They were staying in a hotel.\n\nMCCAMMON: They were both there. And they met there.\n\nAnd where the story gets more complicated is it initially surfaced on a conservative blog based on a private social media post that Tyson had made where she appeared to allude to this. And she also had told her story to The Washington Post over a year ago. They checked it out, said they couldn't corroborate either version of events and decided not to publish.\n\nBut now, she says this has all come out, and she wants to set the record straight. She says she's coming forward with tremendous anguish, though, to tell her story.\n\nINSKEEP: Fairfax originally said, when vaguer versions of this story were out there, this is a political smear. What is he saying now that more specific allegations are public?\n\nMCCAMMON: He's repeatedly denied this. And in a new statement yesterday, he says Tyson's allegations are surprising and hurtful, but he has to dispute her version of events. And he also said he wanted to emphasize how important it is to listen to women when they come forward.\n\nWe should also note he's retained a law firm - the same one that represented Brett Kavanaugh during his Senate confirmation hearings when he was accused of sexual assault. And now the National Organization for Women is calling for Fairfax to resign.\n\nINSKEEP: So the big picture here - we have a governor who's been accused involving this old racist photo. We have the lieutenant governor with the allegations we just discussed. The attorney general, who is No. 3 in the line of succession, has said he wore blackface at one time. Don't have any indications that any of these officials would resign. But what if? What if all three of them did have to resign?\n\nMCCAMMON: Well, we should say, Steve, they're all three Democrats. So this creates challenges for the Democratic Party on a number of levels, one of which is that the No. 4 in line is the House speaker, who is a Republican. His name is Kirk Cox.\n\nAnd you may remember that weird election about a year ago, where there was an undecided House race in Virginia that had to be decided by casting lots.\n\nINSKEEP: Oh, because they were so close.\n\nMCCAMMON: Because it was so close.\n\nINSKEEP: There was a drawing to decide the winner of that one legislative seat.\n\nMCCAMMON: That went to a Republican. Republicans stayed in control of the Virginia House of Delegates.\n\nINSKEEP: By that one seat.\n\nMCCAMMON: By that one seat. And now Kirk Cox, their speaker, is No. 4 in line for the governorship. So it is a mess in Virginia right now.\n\nINSKEEP: Wow. And we'll continue listening for your reporting on that mess. Sarah, thanks so much.\n\nMCCAMMON: Thank you.\n\nINSKEEP: That's NPR's Sarah McCammon.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)\n\nINSKEEP: It's been three months since the most destructive and deadliest fire in California history burned almost the entire town of Paradise.\n\nGREENE: Yeah. The Camp Fire also wiped out 15 percent of housing stock in a county overnight. Now, while some residents have left, others with less means have had no choice but to camp out on their properties. But here's the thing. The federal government says they won't pay for a cleanup if people are living there. You can imagine this is not very popular. The mayor of Paradise, Jody Jones, says there's no choice but to somehow take in federal aid.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nJODY JONES: If we don't do it, our town will look like a war zone for the next 20 years because we are broke.\n\nINSKEEP: NPR's Kirk Siegler has been traveling in Paradise. He joins us now. Hi, Kirk.\n\nKIRK SIEGLER, BYLINE: Hey, Steve.\n\nINSKEEP: What's the town look like?\n\nSIEGLER: Well, you know, when you heard the mayor there - Mayor Jones saying it's a war zone, that's not an exaggeration. I've been up there for about a month reporting a longer-term project. And every time I drive around the town, it's still just shocking to look at.\n\nIt's rubble. You know, it's billed as a town, but it was really a city of 25,000 people. The Safeway's gone. Whole neighborhoods are gone. Fast-food restaurants are still leveled. And they're still in that state three months on. There just really hasn't been a whole lot of recovery yet.\n\nAnd that burned area where people can't live on their burned-out properties was declared a public health disaster for a reason. You can't drink the water, still, in Paradise. The are - benzene's seeping into the water supply. There's other toxins in the ash when the wind blows up. It's - Sarah said mess. It's still a mess in Paradise.\n\nINSKEEP: Do you, nevertheless, run into residents from time to time as you move about town?\n\nSIEGLER: You do. And there was some sort of ruckus - public meetings this week over the proposals to ban camping again for residents, who had been told that they could move back, and now they can't. And this is a big source of tension, as you can imagine, because the town is basically a skeleton. And there was already a housing shortage before the fire, so if people are able to hang on and try to hold out and wait for the recovery, you know, it's not sure where they'll even live.\n\nI met Martha Bryant, who was born and raised in Paradise. And, you know, she called this week, you know, yet another setback. And she worries that more people will just give up and leave.\n\nMARTHA BRYANT: It's their property. They're adults. They know the risks. We don't need other people - the county and everybody else - telling us how we should live our lives.\n\nSIEGLER: And, Steve, you know, this was - this is a rural part of the country where there was a lot of mistrust of the government already before the fire. And when a disaster like this happens, you know, at least for now, places like this are basically wholly dependent on federal and state aid to even just recover.\n\nINSKEEP: What reassurances and plans are officials offering?\n\nSIEGLER: Well, just the toxic debris removal itself - the cleanup, they're saying, will hopefully just take a few months for some residents, but it could be a year or more. A lot of people I talked to expect it to be at least a year. You know, federal disaster officials say they have not seen a, you know, toxic debris removal like this in this country since 9/11.\n\nSo there's a whole lot of work to be done even before the town can start asking the bigger questions. Should it rebuild? And how should it rebuild in a high-risk zone like that?\n\nINSKEEP: Kirk, thanks very much for your reporting, and we look forward, also, to that long-term project when you're done.\n\nSIEGLER: Glad to do it. Thanks, Steve.\n\nINSKEEP: That's NPR's Kirk Siegler, who has been traveling in Paradise, Calif.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF TRISTEZA'S BALABARISTAS)\n\nCopyright © 2019 NPR. All rights reserved.

Paul Ryan's Plan to Change Medicare Looks A Lot Like Obamacare\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Mark Wilson/Getty Images Mark Wilson/Getty Images\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump and House Speaker Paul Ryan agree that repealing the Affordable Care Act and replacing it with some other health insurance system is a top priority.\n\n\n\nBut they disagree on whether overhauling Medicare should be part of that plan. Medicare is the government-run health system for people age 65 and older and the disabled.\n\n\n\nTrump said little about Medicare during his campaign, other than to promise that he wouldn't cut it.\n\nRyan, on the other hand, has Medicare in his sights.\n\nBecause of Obamacare, Medicare is going broke, Ryan said in an interview on Fox News on Nov. 10. So you have to deal with those issues if you're going to repeal and replace Obamacare.\n\nIn fact, the opposite appears to be true — Obamacare may actually have extended the life of Medicare.\n\n\n\nThis year's Medicare trustees report says the program would now be able to pay all its bills through 2028, a full 11 years longer than a 2009 forecast — an improvement Medicare's trustees attribute, in part, to changes in Medicare called for in the Affordable Care Act and other economic factors.\n\nAnd the irony of the Ryan Medicare plan, say some health policy analysts, is that it would turn the government program into something that looks very much like the structure created for insurance plans sold under the ACA.\n\nThe way it works is comparable to Obamacare, says physician and conservative policy analyst Avik Roy, founder of the Foundation for Research on Equal Opportunity.\n\nRyan's plan would set up Medicare exchanges where private insurance companies would compete with traditional government-run Medicare for customers. Obamacare exchanges sell only private insurance plans.\n\nPeople would get premium support from the government to pay for their insurance under the Ryan Medicare plan.\n\nThe subsidy would be tied to the price of a specific plan offered by an insurer on the exchange, much like the Affordable Care Act subsidy is tied to the second-cheapest silver plans.\n\nAnd the payment would be linked to a recipient's income, so lower-income people would get a bigger subsidy. The subsidy would rise as beneficiaries get sicker, to ensure access to insurance. As with Obamacare, people who choose plans that cost more than the government subsidy would have to pay the balance.\n\nInsurers would have to agree to issue policies to any Medicare beneficiary, to avoid cherry-picking, and to ensure that Medicare's sickest and highest-cost beneficiaries receive coverage.\n\nThe changes would start in 2024, when people who are now about 57 become Medicare eligible.\n\nRoy agrees with Ryan that Medicare is going broke and that a program structured in this way would save money through the magic of competition.\n\nIf you have 10 insurers competing for that business, you're going to negotiate a better deal, he said.\n\nMedicare is already a dual public-private program. Most seniors today are enrolled in what's known as traditional Medicare, where the government pays for medical appointments, tests and hospital stays on a fee-for-service basis.\n\nAlongside that program is Medicare Advantage, an insurance plan provided by a private insurer that may offer seniors additional services like dental care at the same price.\n\nThe government pays a fixed monthly fee to the insurer for each Medicare Advantage patient, rather than paying for every service separately, as it does in traditional Medicare.\n\nAbout half of Medicare's new enrollees choose Medicare Advantage plans, says Henry Aaron, a health care economist at the Brookings Institution.\n\nAaron says Ryan's proposal aims to move almost all seniors into Medicare Advantage-style insurance by making traditional Medicare too expensive for the consumer.\n\nBut, he says, there are risks to that approach.\n\nThe real question here is whether the requisite safeguards are in place to ensure that the elderly and people with disabilities would be able to maneuver in such a system, he says.\n\nThat's because the health care and health insurance systems are very complex. Doctors move in and out of networks, copayments can vary and plans can change.\n\nMillions of people on Medicare are also eligible for Medicaid, meaning they are poor and vulnerable, Aaron says. And at least 8 million Social Security beneficiaries have been declared financially incompetent and are assigned a representative to manage their money.\n\nWhat you've got here is a group of people who are very sick, poor, and often cognitively impaired one way or the other, Aaron says. Tossing people like that into a health care marketplace and saying, 'Here, go buy some insurance,' is a recipe for problems.\n\nSeniors may feel the same way. Researchers at Brown University last year found that as people get older and sicker, they tend to drop Medicare Advantage and opt for traditional Medicare.\n\nRyan has been working on his plan to change Medicare for many years. A version of his premium support plan was included in several budget proposals he put forth when he was chairman of the House Budget Committee.\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office says the proposals would reduce federal spending on Medicare.\n\nAt this point it's unclear whether Trump shares Ryan's ambitions to upend the current Medicare system. Trump didn't include Medicare reform on his campaign website. But since his election, modernize Medicare has been included on the list of health care priorities on his transition site.
GOP Bill Would Repeal Obamacare Taxes And Penalties, Keep Some Subsidies\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Allison Shelley/Getty Images Allison Shelley/Getty Images\n\nAfter years of waiting, it's finally here.\n\nThe Republican plan to reshape the Affordable Care Act — what they call repeal and replace — kills the requirement that everyone buy health insurance by eliminating the tax penalty for those who don't have coverage. It also makes significant changes in the financial assistance people can receive to buy a health plan.\n\nOur legislation transfers power from Washington back to the states, said House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady, in a statement. We dismantle Obamacare's damaging taxes and mandates so states can deliver quality affordable options.\n\nThe bill would offer tax credits, refundable in advance, to people with incomes below $75,000. But those credits will be lower in many cases than the subsidies now offered in the ACA.\n\nThe bill, which will go through many revisions and challenges, was released late Monday by two House committees, Ways and Means and Energy and Commerce. Members are expected to start voting on parts of the bill Wednesday.\n\nRep. Frank Pallone, D-N.J., and Richard Neal, D-Mass., the ranking Democrats on the Energy and Commerce and Ways and Means committee, issued a joint statement saying the bill would rip healthcare away from millions of Americans, ration care for working families and put insurance companies back in charge.\n\nThe legislation will ultimately need approval by the full House and the Senate before it goes to President Trump for his signature. Until then, most of what is known as Obamacare will stay in place.\n\nBut it's far from clear that Republicans in the House are unified in their support of the bill. Members of the far-right Freedom Caucus have said they oppose giving tax credits to people who don't pay any federal income tax.\n\nAnd with only a slim majority in the Senate, only a few Republican defections could defeat the bill there.\n\nFour Republican senators wrote a letter to Majority Leader Mitch McConnell saying they were concerned an early draft of the House plan would not adequately protect people who have insurance through Obamacare's Medicaid expansion. And Sen. Rand Paul was among three conservative Republicans who criticized an earlier version of the bill as Obamacare lite.\n\nUnder the proposed bill, tax credits would start at $2,000 a year for individuals under age 30, rising to $4,000 for those over 60. The proposal, first seen in a Feb. 10 draft of the bill, has been criticized as too meager to cover the full cost of a health insurance plan that provides full benefits.\n\nBut the proposed tax credits could potentially pay for insurance that protects only against a catastrophic health event.\n\nThey would begin to be phased out at incomes of $75,000 for individuals and $150,000 for families.\n\nTo encourage people to buy coverage, the plan allows insurers to charge a 30 percent penalty to people who let their insurance lapse and then try to buy a new policy.\n\nIn states that expanded Medicaid, people who are eligible can continue to enroll until Jan. 1, 2020, and those states would continue to benefit from the federal government paying a greater share of the health costs of those beneficiaries.\n\nThe bill includes a couple of provisions to please abortion rights opponents. Tax credits won't be available to pay for insurance policies if they include abortion coverage.\n\nAnd the bill defunds Planned Parenthood, meaning it bars Medicaid from paying for health services provided at the clinics. Medicaid is already barred by federal law from paying for abortions, and women's health advocates say the provision is likely to make it harder for low-income women to get birth control, screenings for cervical cancer and mammograms, which Planned Parenthood provides.\n\nSeveral taxes contained in the ACA would be repealed at the end of this year. These include taxes on health insurers, pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers and a tax on high-cost employer-sponsored group health plans (aka Cadillac plans).\n\nAn analysis by Avalere Health and McKinsey of an earlier draft of the bill, which contained many of the same provisions, concluded that it would lead to millions of people losing coverage.\n\nThe plan offered by the House Republicans falls short of the outright repeal that has been demanded by more conservative members, including those in the House Freedom Caucus.\n\nThat could be due to the shift in public attitudes toward the ACA in recent weeks.\n\nPublic opinion has grown more favorable as major changes appeared imminent. A Kaiser Family Foundation tracking poll in late February found 48 percent having a favorable opinion versus 42 percent viewing the law unfavorably. Kaiser says the shift is due largely to a change in the view of political independents, among which 50 percent now view the law favorably.\n\nWe will have more on this story as it develops.
Republican Governors Thrilled With Increased Influence In Washington\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption John Raoux/AP John Raoux/AP\n\nSouth Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley said Tuesday the fact that Republicans now control the White House, Congress and so many governors' mansions has left her giddy.\n\nHaley and the rest of the Republican Governors Association are meeting this week in Orlando, Fla., to discuss their party's victories last week and how they hope to work with President-elect Donald Trump.\n\nOn election night, Republicans picked up three states now governed by Democrats: Missouri, New Hampshire and Vermont. North Carolina's governor's race is still being contested. But even if Democrat Roy Cooper's lead holds and he defeats incumbent Pat McCrory, the GOP will hold governorships in 33 states, the most in nearly a century.\n\nThat's lent almost a party atmosphere to the conference proceedings, even for governors who had expressed reservations about Trump, like Haley and New Mexico's Susannah Martinez. During the campaign, Martinez said Trump's offensive rhetoric raised questions about his fitness to be president. Now she says she's confident Trump will deliver on campaign promises and his commitment to make sure that America is great again.\n\nHaley said she always supported him, despite concerns about his rhetoric. In Orlando, she said words matter and she was still watching Trump's statements. President-elect Trump has done well, Haley said. I hope he continues to do that. I hope he continues to be disciplined in his comments.\n\nWisconsin Gov. Scott Walker pointed out Republicans had also made significant gains in state legislatures. With a Republican Congress and president, Walker said, The sky's the limit. Top on his list is asking Trump and Republicans in Congress to return more federal money to the states in the form of block grants. Republican governors say block grants could work for Medicaid and for a Republican replacement for Obamacare.\n\nThe governors supported Trump's pledge to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. Florida Gov. Rick Scott warned it won't be easy. The empire will strike back, Scott said. The people that make money off the existing system, the people that don't want change, they're plotting every day to try to stop what we know we have to do to turn this country around.\n\nArkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson injected a note of political realism. We have to get it right, he said, because in 2018, I'm up for reelection again.\n\nThe Republican governors say they look forward to Trump's expected repeal of executive orders signed by President Obama, rolling back environmental and labor regulations. But Hutchinson says in Trump's first 100 days, He's got to give assurance to our allies and (build) confidence in his leadership.\n\nRepublican governors are especially upbeat now that one of their own, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence will be vice president and their liaison with the White House. Pence met with his colleagues in Orlando this week and reassured them their voices would be heard in the Trump administration.
Trump Administration Moves Forward In Attempt To Invalidate Affordable Care Act\n\nJustice Department files notice that it agrees with a federal judge's ruling that the ACA should be thrown out. The administration had previously said it wanted only parts of the law invalidated.\n\nDAVID GREENE, HOST:\n\nThe Trump administration is going forward with an attempt to invalidate the Affordable Care Act. The Justice Department filed a notice that it supports a federal judge's ruling that the entire law should be thrown out. And joining us to talk about this is NPR health correspondent Alison Kodjak.\n\nHi, Alison.\n\nALISON KODJAK, BYLINE: Hi, David.\n\nGREENE: OK. So what exactly is the Justice Department saying this morning?\n\nKODJAK: Well, the Justice Department filed this notice which basically says it agrees with the judge's opinion in this case, which was out of Texas. And it was a really expansive opinion that invalidated the entire Affordable Care Act, which is a huge law. Originally, the Justice Department had said it wanted parts of the law invalidated. And so this changes the Trump administration's position to sort of saying, this entire law has to go.\n\nGREENE: So the fact that the Justice Department is filing this notice with, you know - supporting one federal judge's ruling - does it change anything at this moment in terms of the law and in terms of people covered under it?\n\nKODJAK: No, it doesn't change anything immediately. Essentially, everybody who has insurance through the Affordable Care Act directly - which is about - well over 10 million people through Medicaid and another 10 or 11 million through the ACA exchanges - that all stays the same because this is a legal case that is going to wind its way through the courts and probably eventually get to the Supreme Court.\n\nSo there's a lot of still legal fighting going on. There is a group of state attorneys general, Republicans, who want the law repealed and overturned. And there is another group of state attorneys general from Democratic states who are fighting to keep the law in place.\n\nGREENE: OK. So this sets the stage, though, for what could be, I mean, a monumental decision about Obamacare in the Supreme Court once again. And I guess my question is - were they to side with the Trump administration, throw this entire law out - I mean, I know this is looking down the road a bit - but what could that mean for the health care system?\n\nKODJAK: You know, it's really amazing what that could mean 'cause the Affordable Care Act - most people think of it as these exchanges where people can buy insurance. Most people's objections to it had to do with the fact that there was this federal requirement that people buy health insurance, and they didn't like that.\n\nBut really, this law touches every part of the health care system. It determines how Medicare pays doctors. It creates this Medicaid expansion, which many states have taken on, which has covered millions of lower-income people. It determines things like whether restaurants have to post nutrition information. It really - it sets up different health care delivery systems for hospitals. It really touches everything. And if the law were repealed wholesale, it would change - hospitals would have to come up with new payment systems. An entire section of the insurance industry would go away. It's really pretty expansive.\n\nGREENE: Any idea why President Trump and his administration would decide to do this now?\n\nKODJAK: You know, I don't really know why they would do this now. What became clear during the midterms was that the Affordable Care Act became pretty popular among voters - and especially things like the protections for people with pre-existing conditions are very, very popular. So politically, trying to take this law away and really upend the whole health care system could be pretty tricky and dangerous politically for the Trump administration and for Republicans who support this legal case.\n\nGREENE: All right. That's NPR health correspondent Alison Kodjak joining us this morning.\n\nAlison, thanks. We appreciate it.\n\nKODJAK: Thank you, David.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)\n\nCopyright © 2019 NPR.

Trump's Supreme Court Pick Shrouded In Secrecy\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Carolyn Kaster/AP Carolyn Kaster/AP\n\nCandidates on the short list for a Supreme Court vacancy undergo intense vetting that typically culminates in a one-on-one interview with the president.\n\nThe process is shrouded in secrecy, but President Trump's flair for the dramatic has introduced a sense of showmanship to the highly choreographed rollout.\n\nIn January 2017, a journalist at CNN corralled federal appeals court Judge Thomas Hardiman as he stopped at a gas station in Pennsylvania to fill up his tank. The reporter asked whether Hardiman was on his way to Washington, D.C., for a ceremony to announce the replacement for the late Justice Antonin Scalia. The judge held up his hand to the camera, and rushed into his car without answering the question.\n\nHardiman, who earned money for law school by driving a taxicab, had been a favorite of the president's sister, Maryanne Trump Barry, who served alongside him on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. It later emerged that the White House secretly flew its pick for high court, Neil Gorsuch, to D.C. on a military jet, and that he stayed in the home of a friend to avoid detection before a prime-time announcement that featured Gorsuch walking down a red carpet.\n\nFor his next Supreme Court vacancy, the president spoke with a number of lawyers, including Amy Coney Barrett, a former Notre Dame law professor who now sits on the federal appeals court for the Seventh Circuit. Barrett has seven children, including two who were adopted from Haiti. Democratic senators have highlighted her conservative Catholic roots and warned she could offer a decisive vote to overturn the landmark abortion ruling Roe v. Wade.\n\nBarrett signed a public statement against the Affordable Care Act's birth-control benefit in 2012 and five years later, she wrote a paper in which she criticized John Roberts' decision to uphold the ACA's penalty as a tax, reasoning that the chief justice had pushed the law known as Obamacare beyond its plausible meaning to save the statute.\n\nThose writings drew criticism from Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer the last time Barrett made Trump's shortlist.\n\nBut after Barrett met with Trump in 2018, one news report suggested Trump had cut short the session, leading some court watchers to believe she had not made a good impression with the president. He ultimately chose Brett Kavanaugh to fill the seat made vacant by Justice Anthony Kennedy's retirement.\n\nTrump's advisers view his 200-plus appointments to lifetime seats on the federal bench as his most enduring legacy, and they have been adding to the list of Supreme Court candidates in recent weeks.\n\nOne new name on the list is Judge James Ho, of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. Ho, the son of immigrants from Taiwan, typifies the Trump judicial nominee: young, conservative and unafraid to court controversy.
The Baby-Less Recovery\n\nEnlarge this image CSA Images/Getty Images/Vetta CSA Images/Getty Images/Vetta\n\nNOTE: This is an excerpt of Planet Money's newsletter. You can sign up here.\n\nOver the last decade, the U.S. fertility rate has dipped to its lowest point in history. Economists expected a short decline in the number of births during the Great Recession, but they believed we would start making kids again once the economy recovered. That hasn't happened.\n\nInstead, we've seen what Kasey Buckles calls a baby-less recovery. Buckles is an economist at the University of Notre Dame who studies fertility. Usually the fertility rate bounces back quite quickly, she says. But not this time.\n\nBabies and refrigerators\n\nEconomists have long had an unconventional view of babies. The late University of Chicago economist Gary Becker, who won a Nobel Prize for his analyses of areas of human life once considered outside the domain of economics, argued that modern kids should be considered consumer durables, which puts them in the same category as cars, washing machines, and refrigerators.\n\nUsing terms like 'consumer durables' to describe children is the kind of thing that gives economists a bad name, Buckles says with a laugh. But it captures a really interesting idea.\n\nLike cars and refrigerators, kids cost a lot, last a long time, and we don't expect to make money from them. As we get richer, we don't necessarily want more of them, but we do spend more on them. For cars, that means a Tesla instead of a Toyota. For kids, that means private school, tutoring, and music lessons instead of public school.\n\nThis view of kids, Becker argued, is a modern development. In the old agricultural economy, parents viewed their babies as profitable investments that could help them out on the farm and care for them in old age. That, and the fact that raising kids was relatively cheap, was an incentive to have lots of them. When kids morphed from little servants into expensive luxuries, it made sense to have fewer of them. In the 1960s, birth control began empowering people to do this more effectively.\n\nBaby booms and baby busts\n\nBuckles and two other economists, Daniel Hungerman and Steven Lugauer, analyzed data from more than 100 million births in the U.S., and they tracked how conceptions responded to the market. When a recession hits, people scale back on babymaking just as they scale back spending on other consumer durables. Buckles, Hungerman and Lugauer argue that a decline in the conception rate is actually a leading indicator that a recession is about to kick in.\n\nLoading...\n\nDon't see the graphic above? Click here.\n\nBut sales of cars and refrigerators have rebounded with the latest recovery. Babies, meanwhile, seem to be left sitting on the store shelf.\n\nNetflix and no chill\n\nIn another new study, Buckles, along with Melanie Guldi and Lucie Schmidt, finds that married women and women over age 30 are actually having babies at a higher rate than before. It's young and unmarried women who are not having kids.\n\nWe're witnessing an astonishing demographic shift, Buckles says. For the first time in American history, women aged 30-34 have the highest fertility rate of all age brackets. Younger women are having far fewer unintended pregnancies, accounting for about a third of the overall decline in births since 2007. Buckles believes the remaining two-thirds of the decline is the product of a generation deciding they're not ready for marriage and kids.\n\nThe last decade delivered a double-whammy to babymaking. The 2008 recession scarred millennials. Burdened with student debt, dimmer job opportunities and skyrocketing housing costs, they are less interested in splurging on kids. Then came the Affordable Care Act — also known as Obamacare — which expanded access to contraception.\n\nTechnology could also be deterring pregnancy. Buckles—and she is not alone in this—speculates that young people are so preoccupied with smartphones, video games and social media that they're staying inside and out of trouble. It's Netflix and no chill, says Buckles.\n\nBuckles and her colleagues calculate that the huge decline in unintended births saves taxpayers at least $2.4 billion per year. But she believes the overall decline will continue and that's not a great thing. It will mean fewer workers supporting an aging populace, which is a recipe for stagnation.\n\nHappy Valentine's Day.\n\nDid you enjoy this newsletter? Well, it looks even better in your inbox!

FACT CHECK: Donald Trump's First 100 Days Action Plan\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Chelsea Beck/NPR Chelsea Beck/NPR\n\nIn late October, Donald Trump released an action plan for what he hopes to accomplish in his first 100 days in office. Below, NPR reporters and editors from the politics team and other coverage areas have annotated Trump's plan. We've added context on several of his proposals, including whether he can really repeal Obamacare and what a hiring freeze on the federal workforce would actually look like.

Libre Initiative Spreads Free Market Ideology To Latino Voters\n\nSome GOP donors, skeptical of Donald Trump, are focusing on Senate races. Steve Inskeep talks to Daniel Garza of the Libre Initiative, a group targeting Latino voters in Nevada and Florida.\n\nSTEVE INSKEEP, HOST:\n\nMany conservative groups have not embraced Republican Donald Trump for president, yet they are still working to influence the political landscape, and that includes a group linked with the billionaire Koch brothers. It's called The LIBRE Initiative. Libre is Spanish for free, and the group is dedicated to spreading free market ideology to Latino voters who have voted for Democrats overwhelmingly in recent years. Daniel Garza, the group's leader, says it's involved in Senate races such as Nevada and Florida but not involved in the presidential race.\n\nDANIEL GARZA: We have not been involved in the presidential race because we feel that there's just a lack of enthusiasm for both candidates. We don't feel they're - either one is strong on the direction that they're taking with respect to reining in irresponsible spending, reducing the tax burden on people, reducing the regulatory burden who are going to effectively address the issue of Obamacare, advance school choice...\n\nINSKEEP: Trump says he's going to do virtually all those things - sounds like you don't buy it.\n\nGARZA: You know, we feel that there is a question on the certainty of, you know, the results that are going to come from a Trump administration. But we feel even less of a certainty with a Clinton administration. We don't see it as an opportunity to leverage, I think, our agenda and drive a conversation around the presidential election.\n\nINSKEEP: You are involved in some Senate races. Tell me about Nevada, how the decision has come down there, because in Nevada, as some people will know, you're supporting Joe Heck, who's a Republican, against a Latina who wants to become the first Latina woman senator, if I'm not mistaken.\n\nGARZA: Yeah. Look, I have to confess, you know, if all things were equal and you had a Latina candidate going up against a non-Latino, you know, candidate - because of the lack of representation in the Senate, I would support the Latina, you know, for Senate. But in this case all things are not equal.\n\nINSKEEP: Catherine Cortez Masto, we should say her name.\n\nGARZA: Exactly. Cortez Masto is a typical liberal who we feel would expand the size and the scope of government by increasing the burden on taxes on Latinos by also heaping more regulations that would hinder business startups for Latinos. I mean, we're very entrepreneurial. And on the other side, you have Joe Heck who would reduce the tax burden, the regulatory burden, who would go - who would support a balanced budget amendment, who is supportive of school choice. So it's very clear, you know, whether you're Latino or not, at the end of the day, a big spending, big-government Latina is still a big spending, big-government liberal.\n\nINSKEEP: Is Joe Heck one of the Republicans who signed up for your version of immigration reform, one that includes a path to citizenship?\n\nGARZA: Yes. Joe Heck has expressed his support for immigration reform. Now, of course, what that immigration reform is going to look like, you know, obviously it has to be debated, but we feel very confident that that issue is mitigated because of the ideas that he's expressed in the past.\n\nINSKEEP: We've reported, I think, on some of your activities in Nevada to try to encourage more Latino support. What's the hardest question that you've been asked by Latino voters as you do this work that you're doing?\n\nGARZA: The hardest question - that's a hard question (laughter). You know, probably the notion that conservatives, Republicans, only care about the rich and that Democrats care about the poor - is that true? And nothing could be further from the truth. Look, I give Democrats the benefit of the doubt that they are working for a better society. And I wish that those on the other side would also give those on the conservative side the same benefit of the doubt.\n\nINSKEEP: Has anyone asked you in the Latino community how can you continue to be part of a party in which the largest number of primary voters thought Donald Trump was a pretty good candidate or a great candidate?\n\nGARZA: Yeah, I - yeah, maybe in one way or another I've been asked that. But, look, I'm not a conservative or a free market advocate or a Republican because, you know, I want people to like me. At the end of the day, it's because, you know, I feel a strong sense that the ideas work. On the issue of minimum wage, which is one that is always used as, you know, you don't care for decent wages, here is a case where you have Latino minorities who are at 20 percent unemployment and you want to double the cost to hire them by doubling the minimum wage. How is that going to help young Latinos?\n\nAll I'm saying is that we need to have an honest conversation about the policies that are generating opportunity and prosperity. And what are the policies that are generating barriers to opportunity?\n\nINSKEEP: Daniel Garza of The LIBRE Initiative.\n\nCopyright © 2016 NPR. All rights reserved.

Democrats Promise More Trump Investigations If They Win The House\n\nIf Democrats win control of the House, they'll have the power to investigate alleged misconduct of the Trump administration. They have a long list of misdeeds they want to look into.\n\nDAVID GREENE, HOST:\n\nIn the scandals of President Trump's administration, one thing has been missing - congressional oversight hearings. This is where we see lawmakers grill officials about alleged misdeeds. But if Democrats win control of the House, they are promising a new era of investigations. Here's NPR's Peter Overby.\n\nPETER OVERBY, BYLINE: Democrats would put Congressman Elijah Cummings of Maryland in charge of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. Cummings has plans for potential investigations - among them, the political ties that protected former EPA chief Scott Pruitt for so long, the security vetting done on Trump adviser and son-in-law Jared Kushner, the Justice Department and its record on voting rights. Cummings told Politico recently, he wants to work with committee Republicans.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nELIJAH CUMMINGS: Those are the kinds of things we're going to have to do. And it's not going to be very pleasant for them. It's not going to be very pleasant for me. But I signed up for this job, and this is what I'm supposed to do.\n\nOVERBY: That's how congressional oversight is supposed to work but hasn't - not with one party controlling Washington the past two years. Justin Rood is a former congressional investigator now with the nonprofit Project on Government Oversight.\n\nJUSTIN ROOD: What we've seen is not only a stretch of time when you have an executive branch that has been breaking norms but you have a Congress who's sat by without consequence and allowed that to happen without significant accountability.\n\nOVERBY: Democrats would face pressure from their base to impeach President Trump. House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi says she's against it. Here she is last week at Harvard's Institute of Politics.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nNANCY PELOSI: I think an impeachment, to use that word, is very divisive. That isn't a path that I would like to go down.\n\nOVERBY: Pelosi says Democrats should go after Trump's tax returns. He's refused to disclose them. Democrats would have the authority to get them. At the House Intelligence Committee, prospective chair Adam Schiff of California says he would probe allegations that Russia has financial leverage over Trump. The Trump administration has ignored virtually all information requests from congressional Democrats. But there's a workaround for that: get the documents from friendly nonprofit groups that get them through the Freedom of Information Act. Austin Evers is director of American Oversight, a progressive group that's now filing FOIA requests.\n\nAUSTIN EVERS: It's actually very difficult to enforce a congressional subpoena in court. In contrast, a Freedom of Information Act request, which we could file, we can go to court very easily and force agencies to be transparent.\n\nOVERBY: It's worth noting this FOIA strategy was honed by conservative groups in the Obama era. House Democrats plan to have all the committees doing oversight - investigating Cabinet secretaries who broke the rules, protecting Obamacare, finding out what went wrong with hurricane relief and tackling other issues that Republicans have brushed off. One master of oversight is former Congressman Henry Waxman. During 40 years in the House, he investigated everything from the tobacco industry to the Iraq War. Waxman listed three goals of good oversight - stop the waste of money, hold people accountable and make government work the way it should. His words of caution to House Democrats: don't do oversight the way the Republicans have recently.\n\nHENRY WAXMAN: The committees of Congress used their power, which is an incredible amount of power, and abused it for simply political points, simply to advance their election interests.\n\nOVERBY: Waxman said that's not what oversight should be about.\n\nPeter Overby, NPR News, Washington.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF TALL BLACK GUY'S FROM HOME, TO WORK, AND BACK...)\n\nCopyright © 2018 NPR.

Aetna Joins Other Major Insurers In Pulling Back From Obamacare\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Jessica Hill/AP Jessica Hill/AP\n\nInsurance giant Aetna will stop selling health insurance through most of the exchanges created by the Affordable Care Act in 2017 because the company said it is losing money in many of those markets.\n\nOn Monday, Aetna said it will sell individual insurance policies in only 242 counties in four states, down almost 70 percent from the 778 counties in 15 states where the company markets Obamacare plans this year.\n\nThe decision is a blow to President Obama's signature health care law. Most insurers selling plans through the exchanges have been losing money because the people getting insurance under Obamacare have been sicker than forecast.\n\nBut Aetna, which lost $430 million on the Obamacare plans in the first half of the year, said it may re-enter the markets in the future.\n\nWe will continue to evaluate our participation in individual public exchanges while gaining additional insight from the counties where we will maintain our presence, and may expand our footprint in the future should there be meaningful exchange-related policy improvements, CEO Mark Bertolini said in a statement.\n\nAetna, which covers about 900,000 people through the exchanges, is the third major insurer to pull back from the Obamacare marketplaces. UnitedHealth Group said in April it planned to pull out of ACA marketplaces in most states, and just last month Humana, which covers about 800,000 people, said it will cut back its offerings to just a handful of counties.\n\nAll the companies said they are losing money on the plans. The Department of Health and Human Services has argued that companies have themselves to blame because they set premiums too low. The companies will be able to adjust the premiums in the future.\n\nAetna's decision to alter its Marketplace participation does not change the fundamental fact that the Health Insurance Marketplace will continue to bring quality coverage to millions of Americans next year and every year after that, said Kevin Counihan, CEO of HealthCare.gov, the federal insurance exchange.\n\nIn all, about 11 million people have bought insurance through the exchanges.\n\nA spokesman for HHS said Aetna's decision was an about-face from its earlier statements about the Obamacare exchanges.\n\nIn April, Bertolini called the marketplace plans a good investment because it would have cost the company far more than $430 million to try to attract that many customers.\n\nIf we were to build out 15 markets, it would cost us somewhere between $600 million to $750 million to enter those markets and build out the capabilities necessary to grow that membership, he said on the company's April earnings conference call with analysts.\n\nAetna's announcement comes less than a month after the Justice Department sued to stop the company's planned merger with Humana, arguing that the combination would hurt competition. At the same time, the government also sued to block Anthem from purchasing Cigna.\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat, suggested Aetna's change of heart was in response to the Justice Department's action. In a post on her Facebook page last week, Warren questioned the company's motives after it first hinted that it was considering cutting its participation in Obamacare.\n\nThe health of the American people should not be used as a bargaining chip to force the government to bend to one giant company's will, she said.\n\nAetna spokesman T.J. Crawford didn't immediately respond to a request for comment on Warren's statement.\n\nHHS said last week that the per-member health care costs for people covered through the exchanges remained stable from 2014-2015. If that trend continues, insurers should be able to set premiums that better reflect the actual costs of covering people under Obamacare.\n\nThe next ACA open enrollment is key, tweeted Larry Levitt, a senior vice president at the Kaiser Family Foundation. If insurance sign-ups increase, then deeper concerns about Obamacare will fade. If not, expect a debate about fixes to the law, he wrote.
The Theory That Explains The Anger Of Our Political Moment\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Pacific Press/LightRocket via Getty Images Pacific Press/LightRocket via Getty Images\n\nSuddenly, people are more in favor of the Affordable Care Act than are against it. For the first time, more people believe Obamacare is a good idea than think it is a bad idea, as a recent NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll showed.\n\nAnother poll from Fox News shows a similar pattern, as the New York Times' Margot Sanger-Katz and Haeyoun Park pointed out in a story Wednesday. CNN/ORC Poll shows last-minute love for Obamacare, blared a CNN headline the day before Donald Trump's inauguration.\n\nThere are a few reasons the balance might be tipping: It may be that growing participation in Obamacare has slowly tipped polls. It may be that Democrats' messaging that millions might lose coverage is sinking in. But a particularly compelling theory could mix in with either or both of these: relative deprivation.\n\nRelative deprivation describes being deprived of something a person feels entitled to. For example, they used to have it, expected to have it, or see that others have it. The theory helps explain this political moment of anger in America — whether it's the rise in popularity of Obamacare (in part because many on the left who didn't think it went far enough see the law threatened), why people are marching in the streets to protest the new president and even why Trump won in the first place.\n\nRelative deprivation is the primary force driving political rebellion, as political scientist Theodore Gurr theorized in his 1970 book Why Men Rebel. That gap — between what people think they should get and what they think they will realistically get — creates discontent, he writes, and that discontent is the basic, instigating condition for participants in collective violence.\n\nWhen restaurant-employee advocate Saru Jayaraman told the Washington Post about the pain workers feel when they lose existing benefits, she was talking about this type of discontent.\n\nVery few restaurant workers before the ACA had anything at all, she says. When you have [insurance], then you start to deal and treat things that have been a problem for a very long time. When you cut it off, it's almost worse than never having insurance at all.\n\nThe newfound acceptance of Obamacare isn't quite collective violence, of course. But it is a remarkable change of heart around a much-maligned policy. The Times' Sanger-Katz and Park point out that the demographics of who, exactly, is upset about the potential for repeal say a lot about why they are upset.\n\nSupport for the law has grown across many subgroups, but the largest movements appear to be in Democratic-leaning groups. Those people may not have loved Obamacare, but they worry more about its repeal.\n\nSuddenly, the fear of losing Obamacare has grown big enough to trump ambivalence about the law.\n\nRelative deprivation was a major strategy for Trump\n\nIt's maybe not the most mind-blowing of theories — threaten to take something away from people that they think should be theirs, and they get mad.\n\nBut it is an elegant explanation for so much of the turmoil of the current political climate, when many groups seem to fear they could be losing out on what they once had.\n\nEmily Kalah Gade invoked the idea of relative deprivation this week at the Washington Post's Monkey Cage, explaining why she thinks the Women's March had such strong appeal:\n\nPeople took to the streets on Saturday not because of new issues, but because values and protections they thought they could safely rely upon were under threat.\n\nThe sense of impending loss of power has been simmering for years among particular demographics. For example, some white men — especially those who have lost economic clout — have felt this way for years, as sociologist Michael Kimmel observed in his 2013 book Angry White Men.\n\nRevolutions are made not by those with 'nothing left to lose,'... but precisely by those with something to lose — and a fear that they are, in fact, about to lose it, he wrote.\n\nAgain, that book was written in 2013, two years before Trump ran for the presidency. But Kimmel argues that idea plays a big part in explaining how Trump won the presidency in the first place. Trump again and again drew attention to disappearing goods-producing jobs in auto factories and coal mines, saying that with his help, America could regain those lost opportunities.\n\nThese guys, their fathers, their grandfathers, their great-grandfathers, they all made a bet. The bet was, 'If I take this job in heavy industry, in the steel mill, auto factory, I can buy a house; I can support a family,' Kimmel told NPR in late 2016.\n\nThese guys, they made the same bet that their fathers and grandfathers made, and they lost the bet, as they watched those mills and factories close, he continued.\n\nIndeed, Trump's entire campaign was about bringing back a theoretical, fading, great America.\n\nRelative deprivation is also behind the recent protests\n\nNow that Trump has won, entire other classes of people feel threatened and are taking to the streets, as Gade points out.\n\nMany at the Women's March, for example, voiced a fear that women might lose the ability to obtain abortions, as well as a more amorphous fear of losing respect and social standing they have gained over time. Many women felt a real threat in the fact that America chose a president who had, at one point, bragged about groping and kissing women.\n\nLikewise, many immigrants and Muslims are speaking out against Trump's executive action banning travel from seven Muslim-majority countries, and many also turned out at protests against the ban.\n\nThis is not to say that people protest only for their own personal good. It's entirely true that many, many people in the streets are protesting on behalf of others. Many non-Muslims and non-immigrants are out protesting the ban on travel from majority-Muslim countries, for example, and plenty of men showed up for women's marches worldwide — because their moral foundation of what they believe America is supposed to be is being threatened.\n\nIt's also worth observing that the protests aren't just about women and immigrants; many have also been about (large-D) Democratic politics. The recent protester cries of, Do your job! at Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi were the cries of liberals begging sympathetic legislators to seize whatever meager power they still have.\n\nThe left isn't 100 percent unified, but the power of relative deprivation has helped more or less bridge what was one of the bitterest political divides — between many Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton supporters. After Democrats lost a presidential election (plus some Senate and House races) that almost every forecaster saw as a likely win, the divided party suddenly seemed to come together, as one organizer of the women's march told CNN.\n\nWe have already proven that Hillary and Bernie Sanders supporters can work together against fascism, xenophobia and racism, said Linda Sarsour, executive director of the Arab American Association of New York.\n\nNothing unites, it seems, like the sense of vulnerability that comes from a blistering defeat.\n\nWho can wield it better?\n\nRelative deprivation is all about two things: expectations and whether they can be met. And all politicians play the expectations game — they make promises, then try to deliver on them. However, much of Trump's political success is arguably because he plays this game so well and so heavily. He continually tells people that they are unjustly ignored (America's forgotten men and women) or missing out on what they once had (All of the men, we're petrified to speak to women anymore).\n\nIt was a campaign built on the narrative of being an outsider, punching up at the people in power (nevermind that he's a billionaire himself).\n\nNow, he's in power, and the question is whether Trump can deliver on expectations. He has had an action-packed first two weeks with his travel ban, promise to build a wall and rollback of regulations. He even has made moves to show that he's bringing back a handful of those lost goods-producing jobs.\n\nBut four years is a long time. If some of those who supported him don't see their own personal economic prospects improve, they could jump ship.\n\nThe same goes for the suddenly more-popular Obamacare: Trump at one point raised expectations that he would make sure there was insurance for everybody (though his fellow Republicans worked to tamp that down afterward).\n\nNow, he and his party have to deliver, one way or another, or they could face the anger of a country whose expectations have changed since the law was passed.
How The Federal Shutdown Is Affecting Health Programs\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Jacquelyn Martin/AP Jacquelyn Martin/AP\n\nThere seems to be no end in sight for the current partial government shutdown, the third since the beginning of the Trump administration.\n\nFor the vast majority of the federal government's public health efforts, though, it's business as usual.\n\nThat's because Congress has already passed five of its major appropriations bills, funding about three-fourths of the federal government, including the Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Veterans Affairs.\n\nBut seven bills are outstanding — including those that fund the Interior, Agriculture and Justice departments — and that puts the squeeze on some important health-related initiatives.\n\nThe shutdown itself isn't about health policies. It's the result of differences of opinion between the administration and congressional Democrats regarding funding for President Trump's border wall. But it's far-reaching, nonetheless. Here's where things stand:\n\nFunding for big ticket health programs is already in place, alleviating much of the shutdown's immediate potential impact\n\nSince HHS funding is set through September, the flagship government health care programs — think Obamacare, Medicare and Medicaid — are insulated.\n\nThat's also true of public health surveillance, like tracking the flu virus, a responsibility of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The National Institutes of Health, which oversees major biomedical research, is also fine. It's a stark contrast to last January's shutdown, which sent home about half of HHS's staff.\n\nBut some other public health operations are vulnerable because of complicated funding streams\n\nAlthough the Food and Drug Administration falls under the HHS umbrella, it receives significant funding for its food safety operations through the spending bill for the Department of Agriculture, which is entirely caught up in the shutdown.\n\nLast year, that tallied an estimated $2.9 billion to support among other things these FDA oversight efforts, which involve everything from food recalls to routine facility inspections and cosmetics regulation. Not having those dollars now means, according to the FDA contingency plan, that about 40 percent of the agency — thousands of government workers — is furloughed.\n\nThe FDA will continue work that's critical to public health and safety. It will be able to respond to emergencies, like the flu and foodborne illnesses. It will continue recalls of any foods, drugs and medical devices that pose a high risk to human health.\n\nThe FDA's responsibilities for drug approval and oversight are funded by user fees and will continue product reviews where the fees have already been paid. Regulation of tobacco products is also continuing.\n\nHealth services for Native Americans are also on hold\n\nBecause Congress has yet to approve funding for the Indian Health Service, which is run by HHS but gets its money through the Department of the Interior, IHS feels the full weight of the shutdown. The only services that can continue are those that meet immediate needs of the patients, medical staff, and medical facilities, according to the shutdown contingency plan.\n\nThat includes IHS-run clinics, which provide direct health care to tribes around the country. These facilities are open, and many staffers are reporting to work because they are deemed excepted, said Jennifer Buschik, an agency spokeswoman. But they will not be paid until Congress and the administration reach a deal.\n\nOther IHS programs are taking a more direct hit. For example, the agency has suspended grants that support tribal health programs as well as preventive health clinics run by the Office of Urban Indian Health Programs.\n\nPublic health efforts by Homeland Security and the EPA face serious constraints\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security's Office of Health Affairs assesses threats posed by infectious diseases, pandemics and biological and chemical attacks. It is supposed to be scaling back, according to the department's shutdown contingency plan. This office is just one component of the 204-person Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction Office, which is retaining about 65 employees during the funding gap.\n\nOther DHS health workers are likely to work without pay — for instance, health inspectors at the border, said Peter Boogaard, who was an agency spokesman under the Obama administration. According to DHS's plan, the vast majority of Border Patrol employees will continue working through the shutdown.\n\nThe Environmental Protection Agency has also run out of funding. According to its contingency plan, it's keeping on more than 700 employees without pay, including those who work on Superfund sites or other activities where the threat to life or property is imminent. (More than 13,000 EPA workers have been furloughed.)\n\nThat limits the agency's capacity for activities including inspecting water that people drink and regulating pesticides.\n\nBut it's not just regulation. The public health stakes are visceral — and sometimes, frankly, pretty gross.\n\nJust look at the National Park Service, which has halted restroom maintenance and trash service for lack of funding. On Sunday, Yosemite National Park in California closed its campgrounds. On Wednesday, Joshua Tree National Park, also in California, did the same.\n\nWhy? Per a park service press release: The park is being forced to take this action for health and safety concerns as vault toilets reach capacity.\n\nKaiser Health News, a nonprofit news service covering health issues, is an editorially independent program of the Kaiser Family Foundation that is not affiliated with Kaiser Permanente.
Trump's Move To Give States More Flexibility Undercuts Obamacare, Critics Say\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Getty Images Getty Images\n\nOn his first day in office, as part of his mission to dismantle the Affordable Care Act, President Trump signed an order promising to give states flexibility to create a more free and open healthcare market.\n\nThe administration on Thursday released an official set of examples to help states flex these powers.\n\nIt is intended to roll back key elements of Obama-era requirements, which were designed to promote enrollment in ACA plans that cover a broad range of medical needs and meet uniform national standards.\n\nSeema Verma, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services administrator, said those strict rules were seen by many as burdensome, and virtually impossible for states to meet.\n\nInstead, the Trump administration wants states to innovate in ways that could produce more lower-cost options, even if those alternatives do not provide the same level of financial or medical coverage as an ACA plan.\n\nI'm confident states will come up with ideas that will work better, said Verma.\n\nStill, coupled with other ongoing efforts by the Trump administration to gut Obamacare, policy experts predict the ideas would further foster a parallel market of cheaper, less robust coverage that could draw younger or healthier consumers, but drive up premiums for those who remain in ACA market plans.\n\nInvariably, the coverage is going to be more expensive for people who really need comprehensive coverage, said Timothy Jost, a retired Washington and Lee University law professor who follows the ACA closely.\n\nStates could change who gets subsidies\n\nOne of the biggest changes signaled by the administration involves allowing states to revamp how federal subsidies are used. Currently, these subsidies are strictly targeted to lower-income Americans and are seen as key to bolstering enrollment in marketplace plans.\n\nThe Trump guidance would give states wider latitude to expand or narrow the income range eligible for subsidies, target them toward younger people or allow them to be used for less costly but skimpier types of insurance.\n\nThis would potentially upend the subsidy structure, said Sabrina Corlette, a research professor at Georgetown University's Health Policy Institute.\n\nAnother example would, for the first time, make federal subsidy money available to people who get job-based insurance, countering Obama-era rules that generally prohibited that. It would let states use federal dollars to fund accounts consumers could use to buy insurance or pay other health costs, such as deductibles or copayments. Employers or consumers could also add additional funds to these accounts.\n\nStill, managing those accounts would be a large administrative expense for a state to oversee, said Corlette. I don't understand why a state would want to set it up, she added.\n\nSupporters of Trump's plan say the examples unveiled Thursday would give consumers more control over how they choose to spend their health care dollars and the types of coverage they want to buy. They say it might also improve the markets, which are seeing declining enrollment as premiums rise.\n\nIf states can provide larger subsidies to younger individuals to attract them to enroll, that will improve the market overall, said Christopher Condeluci, a Washington, D.C., attorney who specializes in employee benefits and has served as the tax and benefits counsel to the U.S. Senate Finance Committee.\n\nHowever, if many states follow the administration's lead, critics say, it would bring back the days when insurance rules varied widely state by state. Consumers could end up buying skimpier plans that leave them vulnerable to high, unexpected medical bills.\n\nWhile not prescriptive, the examples are designed to encourage states to innovate and apply for permission to offer more choices for consumers, so long as the proposals don't cost taxpayers more and don't reduce access to ACA plans, said Verma.\n\nState proposals would still have to be affordable, comprehensive and not raise the federal deficit, she said. And CMS would pay particular attention to potential effects on low-income Americans, she added.\n\nReshaping the individual insurance market\n\nThe administration's examples focus on states' health marketplaces, where insurance plans are designed for small businesses and for individuals who don't get job-based coverage. An estimated 14 million people buy their own coverage through those markets or through brokers.\n\nPremiums in those markets have risen substantially since the law took effect in 2014, for a variety of reasons. Among those reasons are lower-than-expected enrollment by healthy people; actions taken by Congress and the Trump administration that removed the tax penalty for failing to have coverage; and other moves that eliminated some payments to insurers and loosened restrictions on alternative types of insurance plans.\n\nThe administration's examples add a new twist to a provision of the ACA that gave states the option of seeking a federal waiver to develop alternative marketplace proposals.\n\nTo get a waiver under Obamacare rules, however, states have to meet four guardrails established in 2015. These require states to ensure their proposals would provide equally comprehensive and affordable coverage; would not result in fewer people enrolling; and wouldn't increase costs for taxpayers.\n\nThe examples described Thursday — touted as waiver concepts by the Trump administration — build on the administration's guidance issued in late October to loosen those guardrails.\n\nThat October guidance, to take effect in 2020, says states have to provide access to affordable and comprehensive coverage, but will not be held to a strict tally of how many people actually enroll. So long as a state could show that equal numbers of people were buying some kind of coverage — either comprehensive ACA plans or less expensive but skimpier plans — the state's approach could pass the test.\n\nThat October announcement, and Thursday's concepts, drew immediate criticism from ACA supporters, who said it encourages the use of subsidies to buy short-term plans, which aren't as comprehensive as ACA coverage and can bar people who have preexisting conditions.\n\nCongressional Democrats sent a letter to top administration officials this week, saying the process by which the changes are being made is illegal, because the administration is not following a formal rule-making process.\n\nWe believe this sub-regulatory guidance exceeds the Secretaries' statutory authority, wrote Ways & Means ranking member Richard Neal, D-Mass., and Energy and Commerce ranking member Frank Pallone Jr., D-N.J. It appears to be part of the administration's ideologically motivated efforts to sabotage the ACA.\n\nThe Brookings Institution and other experts have raised similar questions and predicted a legal challenge.\n\nAs soon as any state proceeds to go somewhere with this, there will be legal challenges, said Jost.\n\nVerma pushed back against this warning, noting that the Obama administration also issued its guardrails as guidance, not a formal rule.\n\nVerma said she anticipated that critics would say the ideas would adversely affect people with preexisting medical conditions.\n\nThose critics argue that anything that draws younger and healthier people out of the market will drive up costs for those who remain in ACA plans — including those with medical conditions, who might be barred from buying an alternative policy, such as a short-term plan.\n\nBut Verma said that nothing in this guidance would take away protections from people with preexisting conditions.\n\nKaiser Health News, a nonprofit news service covering health issues, is an editorially independent program of the Kaiser Family Foundation that is not affiliated with Kaiser Permanente.
Amid Ethics Office Debacle, Googling Congress Members Spiked. Sort Of\n\nAmid this week's firestorm over Republicans' attempt to weaken the Office of Congressional Ethics (and subsequently, backpedal on that attempt), you may have seen this chart floating around the Internet. It depicts data from Google Trends about Americans' search interest in learning who their congressional representatives are, with a pronounced spike around 9 a.m. Tuesday.\n\nThe Hill reported this on Tuesday, with the The New York Times later referencing the trend. The conclusion some are drawing is that people looked up their representatives, then called them to complain about the ethics issue, and that the groundswell of support got Congress members' attention. And, indeed, some Congress members reported that these phone calls did influence them.\n\nBut there's a buyer-beware issue with this data, and with all Google Trends data — the problem of scale. While there's a spike here, there's no way to tell how big it is without comparing it to other popular — or unpopular — search terms. Depending on what you're comparing it to, that spike is little more than a speed bump.\n\nHere, for example, is the who is my representative search compared to searches for Obamacare in the U.S. over the past week.\n\nThe spike nearly disappears here — as of 9 a.m. Tuesday, who is my representative registered at 7 on this chart, compared to 60 for Obamacare.\n\nBut then, maybe that's not fair. Obamacare is a really big topic in the news right now. Let's try a Google search term that's still politics-related but with less mass appeal, like infrastructure.\n\nThe Congress-member-search spike is a bit more apparent here, but it's still dwarfed even by searches for the relatively nonsexy topic of infrastructure.\n\nThe really striking comparisons come when you compare this spike to searches for nonpolitics-related topics. How about a newly released, poorly reviewed movie?\n\nWhat about a certain pop superstar who recently gave a catastrophic performance on national TV?\n\nOK, so the spike for Mariah Carey happened a couple of days earlier, but you get the picture. It's true that Google Trends data can say something about what people care about, and that can be super-useful in a democracy where politicians are theoretically supposed to represent those cares. For example, researchers reported in October that Trump searches outstripped Hillary Clinton searches. They subsequently concluded that this could be evidence that Mr. Trump is doing better than the polls project.\n\nBut when that data is presented without a reference point, it can overstate the importance of a particular search trend. In fact, to get a term that has comparable volume to the Congress member search, you have to get creative and do a lot of random Googling. As it turns out, searches for who is my representative are roughly equal to searches for a 1990s trend that people have mostly forgotten.\n\nSo searches for who is my representative spiked, surpassing Beanie Baby searches for the first time in ... well, a long time.\n\nNone of this is to say that this spike didn't matter; lots more people than usual did Google their Congress members' offices, and anecdotal evidence suggests that there was an increase in people calling their Congress members.\n\nBut it is to say that Google data on only one search term can misrepresent the size of a phenomenon. Yes, plenty of people were Googling their Congress members this week. But plenty more were watching that Mariah video.
Could Trump 'Undermine The Legacy Of The Obama Presidency' With The Stroke Of A Pen?\n\nTERRY GROSS, HOST:\n\nThis is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. Now that Donald Trump is starting to put together his administration, Americans are wondering which of his provocative campaign proposals will he seriously pursue and which ones might he abandon or compromise on, how much of his agenda can he accomplish on his own without congressional action, and how quickly will he be able to have an impact in key policy areas?\n\nOur guest, Evan Osnos, addressed those questions several weeks ago in an article in The New Yorker called President Trump's First Term. Osnos interviewed a range of legal authorities and policy experts on what a Trump presidency might look like. Osnos is a staff writer for The New Yorker. Last year, he wrote an article for the magazine about Trump's white nationalist support.\n\nHe's reported from Iraq and spent many years in China where he shared a Pulitzer Prize for investigative reporting while he was the Beijing bureau chief for The Chicago Tribune. His book, Age Of Ambition: Chasing Fortune, Truth, And Faith In The New China, won the National Book Award. He spoke with FRESH AIR contributor Dave Davies.\n\nDAVE DAVIES, BYLINE: Well, Evan Osnos, welcome back to FRESH AIR. How reliable are campaign promises as a predictor of a president's agenda in office, and will Trump be different?\n\nEVAN OSNOS: I assumed that, like, I think like a lot of Americans, that campaign promises are not very valuable in terms of actually predicting the course of a presidency. We - you know, we tend to remember when campaigns say things that they don't then fulfill. But actually, the political science on this is pretty clear, and it tells a very different story, which is that if you go back over the history of the presidency, you find that presidents tend to achieve the majority - the overwhelming majority of the things that they set out to accomplish when they were candidates.\n\nSo the sort of classic study on this was by Michael Krukones who, in 1984, tabulated all of the campaign pledges of all of the presidents between Woodrow Wilson and Jimmy Carter, and what he found was that altogether they had accomplished 73 percent of the pledges that they said they would. This has been replicated in other studies all the way up to the present where PolitiFact, which is a nonpartisan fact-checking site, has evaluated the campaign pledges by Barack Obama and found that he has achieved at least 70 percent of them. And I think his opponents would agree with that number in the sense that it has been much to their consternation that he has been able to achieve the things he has.\n\nWhen candidates do not fulfill the things that they said they were going to, we remember. So, for instance, George H. W. Bush saying, read my lips, no new taxes, or Barack Obama saying that he would close Guantanamo. But those are really the exception and not the rule based on everything that scholars have learned about the presidency.\n\nDAVIES: Now, when people look at Donald Trump, some would say it's not clear that he has any deeply held political beliefs. I mean, he used to be pro-choice. He used to be a Democrat. He's kind of been all over the place over the course of his business career, and a lot of what he says seems kind of improvised, but we have some clues. I mean, there are two big appointments just announced. The Republican National Committee chairman, Reince Priebus, will be Trump's chief of staff, and at the same time, his campaign CEO, Steve Bannon, who is from the right wing Breitbart News, will be a senior adviser with equal status to Reince Priebus. What does this tell us about Trump's likely agenda?\n\nOSNOS: Right. Well, I think a lot of us were very wary of the idea that Trump as president would actually do a lot of the things that he said as a candidate partly because he was, you know, obviously from way outside the mainstream and - of previous presidents. So perhaps the political science was useless. But there are a couple of things that I think are important to keep in mind. One is that the appointment of Steve Bannon as chief strategist and a counselor to the president is an extension of something that was very clear when this piece was written, which was that Donald Trump will move around on a lot of issues. He's fluid, for instance, on what he would do on the technical basis of an H-1B visa, for instance, or whether or not he would allow school teachers to carry guns in the classroom.\n\nBut on three core ideas, he has stayed completely consistent. One of them is his belief that the United States is fundamentally being damaged by immigration. Number two is his belief that trade deals have done more damage to the United States than they have helped. And number three is his belief that the United States does too much for the world. As he said in 2015, I want to take back everything that the United States has given the world.\n\nSteve Bannon, in his career at Breitbart, really transformed that organization into the principal exponent of those three ideas. So what you see today is Donald Trump is trying to balance the strategic objectives that his campaign road to victory in the form of Steve Bannon with the practical necessity of how do you actually operate within Washington. And for that, Reince Priebus, the new chief of staff, is the ultimate Washington professional. He has been here for his professional life. He has really risen to the top ranks of the Republican establishment, and he's now in the position to be able to try to help Donald Trump achieve his objectives.\n\nDAVIES: You know, there's a point of view that says, yeah, ideologues can have their say, but it's the chief of staff who controls the president's schedule that really moves the levers of power. Do you have an opinion about whether one will be more important than the other?\n\nOSNOS: I think if you look at the way that those two roles have been used in recent history, you find that they are both important, and in many ways, that's the design here. Steve Bannon has called Breitbart, which was his media organization, quote, the platform of the alt right, unquote. And that is the previously fringe movement on the conservative far-right edge, which was founded by Richard Spencer who lives in Montana and believes in the separation of the races. And that has now moved sort of further into the mainstream as a result of Steve Bannon's rise within the Trump campaign and now his installation in the White House. But in order to get those ideas accomplished, you need somebody who really is just as skilled as anyone in sort of managing the levers of inside power in Washington, and that's where Reince Priebus comes in.\n\nDAVIES: OK, I want to talk about some of the areas of policy that will matter here. And we'll try and figure out, you know, what Trump has said, what he believes, what he is really committed to and what he can actually accomplish by himself and what he needs congressional action for. One thing that people have talked about is that President Obama has done a lot with executive orders because of the gridlock in Congress and that President Trump, once he is inaugurated, can immediately undo a bunch of stuff simply by signing executive orders, repealing President Obama's initiatives. Is that true?\n\nOSNOS: Yeah, that's true, and that's an explicit part of the incoming Trump administration's plan. Campaign advisers described it to me as a first-day project, by which they meant that on the first day or within a few days Donald Trump would seek to sign as many as 25 executive orders, or uses of executive power in other forms, that would, in the words of one adviser, erase the Obama presidency.\n\nI should point out that every president when they come in uses executive powers in one form or another. Barack Obama, for instance, signed nine executive orders in the first 10 days. Doing 25 would be ambitious. People who have been through transitions before tell me that's not realistic. But he could do several things that would significantly undermine the legacy of the Obama presidency. His team has talked about this since Election Day, that one of the things that's important to them is to restart exploration of the Keystone Pipeline.\n\nThey will significantly expand the pace and intensity of deportations. They will seek to, if not formally remove the United States from the Paris climate agreement, then they will be able to take steps that basically undermine it so they can make sure the United States is not enforcing restrictions on carbon output. They can restrict funding and so on. So they can do things right away with the stroke of a pen that would pretty significantly undermine the legacy of the Obama presidency.\n\nDAVIES: Is there some fine print here? I mean, I believe I've read that when some executive orders have gone past the rulemaking stage...\n\nOSNOS: That's right.\n\nDAVIES: ...There's a process. What does that mean?\n\nOSNOS: Yeah, that's right. The hyperbole in saying that they would undermine the Obama presidency is that once an executive order has gone beyond what's known as the rulemaking stage, then that means that in order to undo it there has to be, for instance, a period of public comment. There has to be other bureaucratic steps. And that can take as much as a year or more depending on how efficiently the bureaucracy goes about it. And that's meaningful because I think the question of how civil servants will interpret efforts to try to undermine previous initiatives matters. But the relevant point is that by issuing the executive order the clock on that process begins.\n\nDAVIES: OK. Well, let's look at some specific policy areas and figure out what might happen. Let's start with climate change. You just mentioned that. Do we - what do we know about his views on climate change and the extent to which he is committed to them based on his appointments so far?\n\nOSNOS: Well, as a candidate and before, Donald Trump has expressed a lot of skepticism about climate change. He's called it a hoax. At one point, he described it as a hoax that was perpetrated by the Chinese in order to try to undermine American competitiveness. He later said that was a joke. Since Election Day, some of the appointments that he's made have made clear that he's going to make good on his belief that American energy policy and attempts to combat climate change are going in the wrong direction. So, for instance, Donald Trump's transition team for the EPA, the Environmental Protection Agency is run by somebody named Myron Ebell who has been really one of the most outspoken skeptics of climate change, runs a program here called the Competitive Enterprise Institute, and it opposes regulation. It's not clear exactly who funds it, but in the past, it was funded by fossil fuel companies including Exxon Mobil and others.\n\nSo this would be, I think, safe to say a radical change in the way the United States has talked and thought about climate change. One of the people that he has also indicated could be powerful in terms of shaping energy policy is Harold Hamm who was a billionaire who founded the shale oil company Continental Resources. He's been a big contributor to the Koch brothers fundraising network, and there is so far no indication that Donald Trump did not mean what he said when he talked about climate change being a hoax that has damaged American competitiveness.\n\nDAVIES: Are there some specific things President Trump could do immediately to change the direction of climate policy?\n\nOSNOS: Yeah, he could. The Paris climate deal is a formal matter, requires four years to unwind. So in the interim, he could immediately suspend American payments to the deal in effect. These are the payments that the United States would make to U.N.-affiliated agencies that would be in charge of both implementing the deal and then also helping developing countries pay for making some of the concessions and transitions that are required in order to implement it.\n\nDAVIES: Evan Osnos is a staff writer for The New Yorker magazine. We'll continue our conversation in just a moment. This is FRESH AIR.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)\n\nDAVIES: This is FRESH AIR, and we're speaking with Evan Osnos. He is a staff writer for The New Yorker. A few weeks ago, he wrote a piece about what a Trump administration might look like, what powers it would have to act immediately on his policy initiatives. And we're consulting with him now to look ahead at what a Trump administration might look like.\n\nLet's talk about immigration. During the campaign talked about the wall at every rally building, a wall across the southern border. Often at times deporting up to 11 million undocumented workers, banning Muslims. Do we see movement on any of those positions?\n\nOSNOS: Well, he in his very first interview since Election Day on 60 Minutes, Donald Trump said that he would plan to go ahead with deporting what he described as criminal undocumented immigrants. On one level, this is familiar and on another level, this could be very radical. The familiar element of this is that the Obama administration's own policy has been that if you are in fact an undocumented immigrant who is found guilty of a crime, then you are in fact subject to deportation. People sometimes forget that the Obama administration was criticized by some advocates for immigration for being too quick to deport people.\n\nBut the difference here and the point at which it may depart significantly from precedent in American history is how he defines what are the crimes and the infractions that would constitute grounds for deportation. So, for instance, is it that if somebody is convicted of a crime and goes to jail then therefore they can be deported? That will be one thing. But if it's that somebody can be stopped for a traffic infraction, for instance, or caught up in a raid at a factory or caught up in a raid at a boarding house, well then that would significantly change the way in which we understand deportation and the risks associated with it. So at this point, it's not entirely clear. He's talked about 2 to 3 million. Independent estimates say that if he follows through on the plan, he's talking about that that would be 5 million in the sort of short and medium term and then ultimately has talked about trying to achieve the deportation of all 11.3 estimated undocumented immigrants. But to get to $5 million, he would have to expand to something else which he said clearly on the campaign trail which is that people who have overstayed their visas would then be subject to deportation that that represents a large part of the number.\n\nDAVIES: You talk to some experienced people in immigration for your piece in The New Yorker about what it would take to affirmatively go out and find millions of undocumented workers and get them out of the country. You want to share a bit of that with us?\n\nOSNOS: Yeah. I spoke to Julie Myers Wood, for instance, who was the head of Immigration Customs and Enforcement under George W. Bush, and she is opposed to Donald Trump-stated policies on immigration in many ways. But she also said that it's a big mistake to assume that his ideas are so radical as to therefore be impossible, and that was her major point to me was that there are tools that are at the disposal of a president that would allow them to do this dramatic escalation of deportations. For instance, a president could give the IRS files to ICE, to Immigrations Customs Enforcement. So IRS files are considered to be the most reliable source of home addresses because a lot of undocumented immigrants who pay taxes, for instance, put in a reliable home address so that they can receive their refund.\n\nIf the president allowed it, that would then make it much easier for enforcement agents to be able to go out and find people. Another thing that would be at the disposal of a President is what's known as 287-G of the Immigration Act which would allow the local and state agents, basically cops of one kind or another, to be enlisted in service of the deportation project. So that's how you begin to see, for instance, local police being brought in for the purposes of raiding farms or factories and beginning to achieve the deportation numbers that he's talked about.\n\nBut in order to do so, it would take a significant escalation of manpower and also of resources. But what came clear from my reporting on the subject was that it's a big mistake to assume that it's - this is binary that you either will have the system as it exists today or you would have some completely unimaginable system that Donald Trump has talked about. There is in fact a spectrum in between that Donald Trump could move fairly substantially down the road to achieving his objectives on immigration.\n\nDAVIES: And it would be very expensive to do that.\n\nOSNOS: It would be very, very expensive. Depending on what he does, it could cost hundreds of billions of dollars because, for instance, if they were going to hire the number of what's known in formal immigration literature as apprehension personnel, that would need 90,000 apprehension personnel. That's several times the size of the total number of special agents in the FBI. That's not realistic. So I think more likely they would invoke 287-G which would allow them to draw on other government agencies to do that.\n\nDAVIES: Do people think he'll really build the wall?\n\nOSNOS: Yeah. I think the wall is one of the easier things to - for him to accomplish because he can redefine what the wall is, and you've heard him just in the several days since his election talk about the idea that fencing might be a part of it. The most reliable independent estimates of what it would cost to build a wall are somewhere between 25 and $40 billion. Michael Chertoff who was secretary of Homeland Security under George W. Bush has been very opposed to Donald Trump's presidency said to me, look, I think the wall is a ridiculous idea, but it's not logistically impossible.\n\nAnd I think after talking to people on the Hill and talking to immigration experts and people who are involved in the actual construction of these sorts of large-scale infrastructure, what they say is that the most likely outcome here is that he will make a symbolic extension of what is already a federally financed border fence that has been in place for about a decade. And that that would allow him to satisfy his base and to say that he has gone ahead and built the, quote, unquote, wall. But as a practical matter, it wouldn't really transform the way that the border is policed.\n\nDAVIES: Let's talk about health care. I mean, he has - he and many others have promised to repeal and replace Obamacare. What do we know of his views since he was elected?\n\nOSNOS: Yeah, as a candidate, he and certainly everybody in his campaign that I spoke to described their intention to uproot Obamacare root and branch. They talked about the replacing it, though it's not clear what that would be. Since then, he has changed his view on that.\n\nHe talks about holding on to two important elements of Obamacare. One is the ability to insure that people with pre-existing conditions can still get insurance, cannot be discriminated against by insurance companies. And then the other is to allow people up to the age of 26 to continue receiving insurance from their parents' providers. It's not clear how Donald Trump would be able to preserve those two elements while undoing the rest of the law.\n\nHowever, there are some pieces of it that are vulnerable right away. For instance, Donald Trump and a Republican Congress could undermine the ability of the states to field health care exchanges. They could also remove federal funding for subsidies that help reduce the cost for individual policyholders.\n\nBut if he's going to try to do what he has talked about, which is to keep those two elements while getting rid of the rest of it, that's where you may begin to see that he starts running up against the edge of some of the internal dynamics in Congress because you have parts of, for instance, the Freedom Caucus, which is the far-right elements of the Republican House conference, 40 members or so, who would regard it as a concession, probably a compromise they couldn't accept if he decided to keep Obamacare and simply amended on its details. So that's where you may find that he runs up against that kind of opposition.\n\nI think this goes back to something we talked about earlier, Dave, that's important, which is will Donald Trump do the things that he says he did as a candidate - because part of the reason why presidents end up doing the things that they said they would is often not because they absolutely wanted to do those things. It's because the internal dynamics of the presidency are such that if they don't do the things they campaigned on, well, then they begin to lose credibility with Congress and with the public. And so they almost get driven into these policy cul-de-sacs where they have to go ahead with things. You know, they have to sort of achieve the thing that they said they would otherwise it hurts their ability to do other things.\n\nDAVIES: I mean, the tricky thing about saying that you're going to keep the provision which prohibits denial of coverage for pre-existing conditions and permits kids in their 20s to stay on their parents' policies is that if you do that but don't mandate everybody to get insurance, you know, it changes the economics because you don't have young healthy people paying in.\n\nOSNOS: Absolutely. I mean, there's a reason why this law took so long to craft and involved so many subtleties is because you had to balance the political objectives, the policy goals with the practical economic realities. And the simple fact is that if you change one of the elements of this very delicate process, well, then it becomes very hard to imagine how you're going to be able to pay for it at all. So this - you know, we're beginning to see the point at which some of these sort of abstract declarations that he would replace it with something terrific will become much more practical and tested over the course of the next few weeks and months.\n\nGROSS: We're listening to the interview FRESH AIR's Dave Davies recorded with The New Yorker staff writer Evan Osnos about his article President Trump's First Term. Let's talk about what changes Trump might make regarding tax cuts, the Iran nuclear agreement, trade and what the consequences might be if Trump starts a trade war with China after we take a short break. I'm Terry Gross, and this is FRESH AIR.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)\n\nGROSS: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. Let's get back to the interview FRESH AIR's Dave Davies recorded with New Yorker staff writer Evan Osnos about what it would take for President Donald Trump to fulfill the promises he made during the campaign and how much of his agenda he can accomplish on his own without congressional action.\n\nDAVIES: Let's talk about trade and the economy. You know, one of his core principles you said is the belief that trade deals have harmed America's economy and killed jobs. What authority would he have immediately to remake or undo American trade policy?\n\nOSNOS: The president has broad authority on trade. So, for instance, right away, the president could end American participation in the Trans-Pacific Partnership. I think it's fair to assume that the TPP as it's known is now dead. But beyond that, he could also force Canada and Mexico to renegotiate NAFTA or withdraw from it eventually.\n\nThere is a process in the case of NAFTA. He couldn't just do it immediately. But when it comes to slapping tariffs, for instance, on other countries, there's two ways to do it. One requires Congress and one doesn't. If he goes after specific categories of goods - so if he says, for instance, that, you know, Chinese exports of one specific type, let's call it, you know, chicken or tires or something like that, then he can use his own presidential power to do that sort of on an emergency basis. But if he's going to try to impose a broad-based tariff against a country, that would actually require the consent of Congress.\n\nBut I think the important point is that he has the ability to change the tenor of the trade relationship with a country by talking about it in other ways. And as we all know, you know, he talked about China in very harsh terms during this campaign. My own sense based on talking to his trade advisers and his China specialists was that that was a kind of theater. I don't believe that Donald Trump is prepared actually in any way to go to a trade war with China, I think, meaning that, you know, one of the things that his advisers said to me was that Donald Trump's persona that he - you know, he's confrontational, he says outrageous things, that that would have a chilling effect on the other side and that China would then fall in line. That's their theory. They're not actually prepared for the full economic consequences, which would be severe and profound, of a trade war with the world's second-largest economy.\n\nDAVIES: Well, this is an interesting and important question. And you can't predict the future, but if, in fact, one of his core beliefs is that this is a big problem, we have to fix this to rebuild the American economy, what do the economists you talk to expect to happen? Are we going to have a trade war? What would it do?\n\nOSNOS: A trade war could be a really dramatic turn in American economic history. If you talk to independent analysts, people who are not involved in either campaign, somebody - there's a guy, for instance, named Mark Zandi, who's an economist at Moody's Analytics. And he's worked for Republicans and he's worked for Democrats in the past. And what he says is that Trump's plan, if he actually did the things that he said he would and triggered a trade war with China that that would put probably somewhere around 4 million Americans out of work. And then over the ensuing recession that it would also cost the economy another 3 million jobs that would have been created otherwise.\n\nMost economists broadly agree that a trade war would be hugely damaging to the United States. It's worth pointing out that actually Trump's own trade advisers, somebody named Peter Navarro and Dan D'Amico, they disagree. They believe that in fact it could be beneficial to the United States.\n\nBut I think this is one of those examples that once he gets to Washington and begins to hear from a broader range of more mainstream economists that he will begin to see that, OK, you know, a trade war really is not his first priority. And this helps me kind of form a general theory of how Trump will or will not do the things that he says he would. And what I've come to believe based on a lot of these interviews over the course of the last several months with people in the campaign and outside is that on economic matters, on matters of sort of tax policy, for instance, and most trade elements, I think he will basically conform to a traditional conservative set of ideas. And by the end of the campaign, his tax policy, for instance, was a fairly conventional supply-side case. It really didn't depart substantially from what previous Republicans have run on.\n\nBut when it comes to these other issues like immigration and sort of what we might describe as sort of political culture issues, things like treatment of the press and also his dealings in foreign affairs, on those matters, that's, I think, where we should expect him to be more like the candidate Trump than like a traditional Republican president.\n\nDAVIES: One of the things he also says he wants to do is immediately cut the regulatory burdens on businesses on Wall Street. Can he do that himself?\n\nOSNOS: He can. The president has authority, ultimate authority over 15 executive agencies. And he would be able to direct them to change the pace and spirit in which they are issuing regulations. He has said - I'm not clear on whether this is legally possible - that he wants to do a version of what Vice President-elect Mike Pence did in Indiana.\n\nPence created an agency that was dedicated to suspending the creation of all new regulations except for public health and safety. And it was a sort of an independent agency of its own. He did that at the state level. At the federal level, my understanding based on everybody I've spoken to is that it's more likely that he will try to do this through personnel, so, for instance, by appointing people at the top of the agencies - that the people he puts there could have a pretty dramatic effect on slowing down or stalling the creation of new regulations or rolling back things that are already in place.\n\nDAVIES: He's promised big tax cuts. Will they really happen?\n\nOSNOS: That, I think, is one of his better bets. He's got a Republican Congress on his side. And at this point, it's hard to see them not doing it.\n\nDAVIES: And what kind of tax cuts are we talking about? I mean, for those of us who haven't carefully followed his campaign positions, are they upper income, middle income, everybody?\n\nOSNOS: They provide the greatest relief to the upper stratum of the tax base, so the highest earners will do best. There is also tax relief for the sort of upper-middle-class. Then corporate tax rates will be substantially relieved. This has been at the core of his plan. His economics team said to me that they want corporate tax relief, meaning changing the percentage that companies would have to pay to be their stimulus plan. They want to put more money in the hands of corporations so that that can then drive growth overall in the economy.\n\nDAVIES: If we're going to see big tax cuts and he still wants to spend a lot on rebuilding the military and some other areas, the wall and immigration enforcement, what's the fiscal impact in a world in which deficits are a serious concern?\n\nOSNOS: Some of the independent analyses of his tax proposal put the impact on deficits to be in a vast range between $4 trillion dollars and $10 trillion dollars. I should say the Trump administration opposed those estimates. They said that they were biased. They said that the economists who'd produced them were sort of - they tried to establish links between those economists and liberal funding sources. At this point, I think it's realistic to expect that if Donald Trump does the things that he has talked about even since Election Day, that those would impose enormous new costs on the federal government.\n\nAnd this is one of the ways in which he might find himself facing greater opposition than he expected from his own party because there are people in the House, certainly, and some also in the Senate who would be offended by the idea of introducing these enormous new costs. That's one of the things that I think is hard to anticipate at the outset, but he's almost likely - certainly likely to kick in after the honeymoon between, you know, the Republicans on the Hill and this new Republican White House is over.\n\nDAVIES: And his answer has always been jobs and growth will take care of all that, revenues will soar. It'll be fine.\n\nOSNOS: That's right. That's the - you know, typically that's the traditional answer when somebody is trying to introduce a major new spending initiative while also trying to cut taxes. But historically that has turned out not to be as reliable a formula as it's often described.\n\nDAVIES: We're speaking with Evan Osnos. He is a staff writer for The New Yorker who's written about what a Trump administration might look like. We'll talk more after a short break. This is FRESH AIR.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)\n\nDAVIES: This is FRESH AIR, and we're speaking with Evan Osnos. He is a staff writer for The New Yorker magazine. He's written about what a Trump administration might look like.\n\nLet's talk about foreign and military policy. He's criticized the deal with Iran. Can he scuttle that deal by himself?\n\nOSNOS: Yes, he can. What he has said he wants to do is renegotiate the deal with Iran, and renegotiate is a sort of a flexible word. It's not clear what he means entirely. But were he to try to reopen that deal, that could actually - that could really change the course of things more broadly beyond just the Iran deal because at that point what happens is that Iran - and Iran specialists told me as much months ago - would regard the United States seeking to renegotiate the deal as an abrogation of the deal.\n\nAt that point, they would say that the United States has basically not held up its end of the bargain, and they would have the right - the legal authority and the right - to restart the development of nuclear energy. So I think he's going to find once he begins to get into the details of this that by simply announcing that he's going to renegotiate that might not achieve the effect he has in mind. It might actually hasten the restart of the Iranian nuclear program.\n\nDAVIES: And so - well, this is confusing. There are other countries that are parties to the deal, right?\n\nOSNOS: That's right, yeah. The challenge here is that in order to achieve the Iran deal at all, you had to get this kind of perfect storm in the best sense where you had to get the European countries onboard at precisely the moment that you had the United States and Iran at the bargaining table. And by reopening negotiations at a point when it's not clear that the United States is actually going to hold up its end of the deal anymore, that will, I think - Iran specialists say as much - will have the effect of driving some of the Europeans away from the table.\n\nSo the chances of being able to renegotiate the deal while also preventing further development of the nuclear program are very small. And if I had to guess, I suspect that this is one of the issues that he might have an evolution in his thinking once he gets into the room with people who know the most about the status of the program now and what would happen if they restarted it.\n\nDAVIES: Gosh, it's hard to imagine after all of the harsh rhetoric about the Iran deal and what a terrible giveaway it was and all the money that he could back away from it.\n\nOSNOS: And that gets us back to this kind of the core discovery that surprised me most which is that even when candidates don't seek to do the things that they actually said they would on the stump that the internal momentum of politics ends up forcing them to do things that are more emphatic or more absolute than perhaps they might have originally imagined.\n\nDAVIES: When you wrote about Donald Trump and his policies towards the military and towards foreign affairs, the issue of temperament comes up. This is a loaded word. He hated being criticized for his temperament. But you have - you found a quote from his book Think Like A Billionaire. It can be smart to be shallow, that he has a penchant for making big decisions quickly, that he trusts his gut. Share what - some of what you learned about what that might mean from your conversations with military and intelligence officials.\n\nOSNOS: Yeah. When you talk to a broad range of people who have been involved in the most sensitive national security questions, you know - these are the people who've been in the Situation Room at crucial moments particularly from Republican administrations what they'll tell you is that the crucial ingredient is whether or not a president is impetuous, whether or not the president makes decisions before they have as much information and as many competing points of view as possible. And often as one - James Woolsey who is a former director of the CIA is now an adviser to the Trump administration - before he became an adviser to Trump, he said to me in an interview that very often the first information that a president receives is wrong. And we've seen that beginning all the way from Vietnam up to the present day. And part of the sort of crucial patience that's required is the ability to both wait until you have a fuller picture and then also be prepared to act. But if you act on the basis of limited information, history suggests to us that we would have made a lot of catastrophic choices.\n\nIf you look at Donald Trump's experience, he obviously does not have experience in government. He's never held public office or served in the military. What you find is that he prides himself - he's written about at several places - on his ability to make big decisions very fast. As he put it in his book he says, you know, I remember the day that I discovered that being shallow is a profound insight. And what he meant by that was that you don't want to get bogged down in overthinking things. You want to be able to be decisive.\n\nAnd, you know, in the course of the campaign, we saw moments when he would do things impulsively. He would say something in an interview on a subject that he didn't know very much about and would then find himself having to backpedal. So, for instance, when he talked about the idea of punishing women who get abortions and then was informed later that that was contrary to precedent and legal norms that he had to sort of walk that back. If you put that into a national security context, there's going to be enormous pressure on his staff to ensure that he does not do things which his authority allows him to do before he has all the information that's possible.\n\nDAVIES: And I guess that raises the question based on past experience and, you know, people who've been there, what constraints are there on a president who might make a rash and unwise decision?\n\nOSNOS: The presidency is a unique office, to state the obvious. There is nobody who has the power to overrule the president, for instance, on nuclear authority. There are others in the chain of command who, if the president was incapacitated or disabled in some way would be able to use the nuclear arsenal. But they would have to do it in cooperation with others.\n\nSo what we find when you look back over the course of national security history is that the people who have interfered with a president's ability to use nuclear weapons, it's been individuals. It's been people who essentially acted out of their own judgment or conscience to do so. There's a couple examples. You know, to give you one, under President Nixon, Nixon actually asked his secretary of defense at the time, Melvin Laird, to put the United States on nuclear high alert.\n\nNixon hoped that this would frighten the Soviet Union. It would make the Soviet Union think that he was irrational. This was known as the madman theory. And Mel Laird thought that this was a very, very dangerous thing to do. And so what he did is he dissembled. He told Nixon that actually this was a bad idea because they had a previously scheduled training exercise, and he hoped that Nixon would forget about it. Nixon still said no.\n\nAfter a couple days, he wanted him to go ahead with it, so they did. They put U.S. aircraft on course to fly towards the Soviet Union armed with nuclear weapons just as - essentially as a gesture. And there was an after action report later that described that exercise as a dangerous undertaking because there was an almost mid-air collision. So it does depend ultimately on the decisions of individuals but how they implement the president's will.\n\nDAVIES: You've said one of his core beliefs is that America tries to do too much in the world, and he's made some pretty remarkable statements about welcoming new nuclear powers in the Far East, like Korea and Japan, suggesting that we might not live up to NATO obligations unless some of the nations pay more for American troops. Do the experts that you spoke to think he will actually do that? And even if he doesn't, what is talking that way - what's the impact of saying those things?\n\nOSNOS: Well, if you take Asia for a second, in his - since Election Day, he has spoken to the South Korean president. And according to South Korean reports, he has indicated 100-percent support for that alliance. He has over the last few months disputed his own statements on the subject of whether or not he wants Korea and Japan to develop nuclear weapons. He said so clearly at one point, but he may have had a revision in his thinking.\n\nBut it's actually already had an effect on the way that nuclear weapons are understood in Korea. So, for instance, if you go to Korea today, you find that there are people in politics out on the edges of - particularly on the far right who are now talking about developing nuclear weapons in ways that they weren't before. And in effect, Donald Trump sort of gave them permission to do so.\n\nSo that's a demonstration, I think, of an important element here, which is that the words of a president are in their own way enormously powerful. You know, we talk about what he could sign, but really even before he signs something, just simply indicating something or saying something off hand can have a powerful effect. I think the best example of that based on the research for this piece was what he could do in Europe. Donald Trump as a candidate talked about the idea that he might not support NATO unconditionally. He was asked if a NATO member, for instance, was attacked, would you come to its defense. And he said I would first check to see if they'd fulfilled their financial obligations.\n\nThe Rand Corporation, which is a, you know, non-government research organization - over the years it's received four Nobel Prizes for its work on simulating conflict, on sort of gaming out future scenarios - and they had actually run a scenario just over the last couple of years that looked at exactly this question. What would happen if Russia was no longer deterred from attacking a NATO state? And what they discovered was that if they were no longer deterred that they could in fact achieve victory within 36 hours. They could be in the capital of Estonia, for instance.\n\nAnd at that point then, it would come down to the question of whether the United States would seek to try to salvage NATO and protect it or whether it would abandon it entirely, which if it did so would be the end of basically 70 years of American national security strategy in Europe.\n\nDAVIES: Evan Osnos is a staff writer for The New Yorker magazine. We will continue our conversation after a short break. This is FRESH AIR.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)\n\nDAVIES: This is FRESH AIR, and we're speaking with Evan Osnos. He is a staff writer for The New Yorker magazine. He's written about what a Trump administration may look like.\n\nYou know, there was reporting in the course of the campaign that suggests that Donald Trump doesn't have the patience to read long documents and burrow into policy detail. What's your sense of how he'll handle the demands of this, you know, huge waterfront of policy and decisions that you can't put on autopilot that the president needs to weigh in on?\n\nOSNOS: Well, Donald Trump has said himself that he doesn't like to read as a way of getting information. He trusts his - what he describes as his own common sense. That's the term he uses often. He relies on people that he trusts, people that are around him. He does not have a computer. He uses his mobile phone, obviously, for Twitter as we know. But this would be a profound departure from previous presidents in terms of how they get information. I think, you know, Donald Trump tends to want to govern from his gut.\n\nBut in the early days here since Election Day, we've received some indications that he has been surprised. The Wall Street Journal reported from inside the meeting with President Obama they received reports that Donald Trump seemed to be taken aback by the scope of responsibility that he would have as president, the sheer range of responsibilities that he would have on a daily basis. So, you know, I think what historians will tell you is that the office of the presidency has a dramatic effect on people, and the simple act of getting into the office suddenly conveys to them the solemnity of that responsibility and having 310 million souls on their watch.\n\nBut it's not clear. You know, Donald Trump really is so different than anybody that we've had before that for him to change now at the age of 70 and take on a whole new set of decision-making instincts and to begin to challenge his own assumptions and his own instincts to say, look, the things that got me here are not the things that will help me succeed. I find that hard to imagine.\n\nDAVIES: You know, last year, you wrote about white nationalist groups that have embraced Trump, and they feel he's expanded their reach, given them some legitimacy and, of course, since the election there have been some very troubling cases of swastikas, racist graffiti, some assaults racist hate speech. You know, some would see this as just a fringe that is an embarrassment to most Republicans and conservatives I'm wondering what you make of this and what the impact will be of Trump being in the White House?\n\nOSNOS: Well, in some ways, this was a storyline that I think people who generally covered politics didn't initially embrace, you know, the idea that somehow the alt-right or the white nationalist world would be even talked about in a discussion of an incoming presidential. It was so ludicrous that we didn't even really do it. And then it just became very clear early on in the Trump campaign that they were a part of this phenomenon. The neo-Nazi website endorsed him for president 12 days after he announced. And later you follow it all the way through 20 months later. He was endorsed by the newspaper the KKK. Steve Bannon has been - who is now chief strategist in the White House - has been really the sort of principal thinker in terms of how do you take ideas that exist way out on the far right and get them in front of people's eyes that are more conventional readers?\n\nAnd at Breitbart, that's really what he did. He sort of - it became the platform for the alt-right. When I spoke on Election Day to a white nationalist leader named Matthew Heimbach as the sort of results became clear, I said, you know, how are you feeling? And he said vindicated. And what he said was that this campaign and that the victory of Donald Trump has shown that there is an appetite out there for his ideas, even if people can't quite bring themselves to say so.\n\nYou know, I just have to say, I mean, this was so preposterous that we'd be talking about this a couple of years ago, that it's a reminder of how much politics have changed and been changed by the candidacy of Donald Trump. Now, look, how that actually translates into a White House, we don't yet know. But Steve Bannon is now a couple of steps from the Oval Office, and that's - we're in uncharted territory there.\n\nDAVIES: Evan Osnos, thanks so much for speaking with us.\n\nOSNOS: Thanks for having me, Dave.\n\nGROSS: Evan Osnos is a staff writer for The New Yorker.

Trump's Newest Supreme Court Shortlist Is Overtly More Political\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Evan Vucci/AP Evan Vucci/AP\n\nTrump's Newest Supreme Court Shortlist Is Overtly More Political Listen · 4:06 4:06\n\nPresident Trump has unveiled his latest list of potential Supreme Court nominees, reviving a tool that served him well in energizing the conservative base in the 2016 campaign. But this latest list, his fourth, is quite different from those in 2016 and 2017.\n\nAdministration insiders concede that this list is avowedly more political. While the previous three lists included just one elected politician and no administration officials, this list includes three U.S. senators — all fire-breathing conservative Republicans. They are Arkansas' Tom Cotton, Texas' Ted Cruz and Missouri's Josh Hawley.\n\nAll three have, directly or indirectly, criticized Chief Justice John Roberts for not being conservative enough, and all three have presidential ambitions. Indeed, Hawley tweeted that he is not really interested in a seat on the court.\n\nAlso on the list are a top Trump White House lawyer and two top officials from the Trump Justice Department, including former Solicitor General Noel Francisco, who have carried Trump's legal banner in the courts.\n\nPerhaps the most interesting name on the list is Paul Clement, who served as solicitor general in the George W. Bush administration and is considered perhaps the best legal advocate among the very able lawyers who practice regularly before the Supreme Court. Clement has some added assets: He has represented a variety of conservative interests before the court, including gun-rights advocates, religious groups and opponents of the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare.\n\nAs for the federal judges on the latest list, they are all Trump appointees with records hostile to abortion, voting-rights legislation, LGBTQ rights and regulation of business and the environment.\n\nAccording to sources involved in compiling the list, the White House counsel, as is usual, presided over the process, but White House chief of staff Mark Meadows was aggressively involved, and even the president's adviser and son-in-law, Jared Kushner, got into the act, as did some conservative senators, like Hawley. The latter pushed back against including U.S. Appeals Judge Neomi Rao, because of some of her writings prior to her becoming a judge. However, as a judge, Rao has written some of the lower court decisions most supportive of Trump. In one opinion, she argued that a president could not be investigated by Congress, except in an impeachment inquiry. The U.S. Supreme Court rejected that position by an overwhelming vote.\n\nWith the latest list of 20 new names now added to the 45 names on his previous lists, Trump on Wednesday blasted Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden for failing to release a comparable list and issued a dark warning about the future if Biden is elected and has an opportunity to pick one or more Supreme Court justices.\n\nRadical justices will erase the Second Amendment, silence political speech and require taxpayers to fund extreme late-term abortion, he said, adding that Supreme Court justices appointed by Biden would remove the words under God from the Pledge of Allegiance.\n\nTrump's unsupported assertions are contradicted by a variety of Supreme Court decisions. For instance, in 2004 the court unanimously dismissed a challenge to the words under God in the Pledge of Allegiance.\n\nAt his press conference Wednesday, Trump suggested that the next president could get to appoint as many as four or more justices. In fact, the court's five conservative justices all appear to be in good health. Two of the five, Trump appointees Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh, are the youngest members of the court at 53 and 55, respectively.\n\nThe only ailing justice is 87-year-old Ruth Bader Ginsburg, leader of the court's liberal wing, who is being treated for a fifth bout with cancer, her second cancer in less than two years.\n\nShould she leave the court before the election, or were she to leave the court after a Trump loss but before a Biden inauguration, Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell has said that the GOP would fill the seat right away.\n\nMcConnell has made the Republican position clear, even though four years ago, he refused for nearly a year to allow hearings on President Obama's nominee, Judge Merrick Garland, to fill the seat of Justice Antonin Scalia, who died unexpectedly in February 2016.\n\nMcConnell's justification for blocking the Garland nomination for nine months was that the voters had a right to make their views known in the presidential election, a rationale the GOP leader is not embracing this year.
Politics Chat: Trump's Response To COVID-19 Surge And Plans For Reelection\n\nWe take a look a the White House reponse to the surge of coronavirus infections in the U.S., as well as President Trump's agenda for his second term and his attempt to kill the Affordable Care Act.\n\nLULU GARCIA-NAVARRO, HOST:\n\nWhile in much of the developed world the pandemic is waning, here in the United States, it is surging. Florida, Texas and Arizona are among states seeing a staggering number of infections even as the White House tries to put a positive spin on its coronavirus response. Joining us this week, as she does most, is NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson. Good morning.\n\nMARA LIASSON, BYLINE: Hi, Lulu.\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: So before we get to the pandemic, I'd like to talk to you a little bit about this. The president retweeted a clip of his supporters this morning driving around in golf carts in this area of Florida called The Villages. They had Trump 2020 signs - one of them repeatedly chanting, white power. He deleted it 4 hours later after a huge outcry. You reached out to the White House about this. What did they say?\n\nLIASSON: The White House said that the president didn't hear the statement on the video. And I leave it to our listeners to go watch the video themselves and see how hard it would be to miss that. But that is what the White House said.\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: This, obviously, is very inflammatory at a time when we are seeing protests for racial justice all across the country, at a time when the polls say that most Americans see President Trump as divisive on the issue of race in this country.\n\nLIASSON: This is exactly the kind of thing that Trump supporters have been begging him to stop doing. Senator Tim Scott, who's the only African American Republican senator, said he thought the tweet was indefensible. He wanted it take down. Of course, later, the White House did take it down. This has become a real problem. The president's supporters would prefer that he focus on policy and Joe Biden, and he keeps on doing things like this.\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: After a couple of indoor rallies, these high rates of infection - what is the Trump administration saying about what they're going to do to curb this pandemic.\n\nLIASSON: They're not saying they're going to do anything differently to curb the pandemic, but they have made some adjustments. Vice President Pence, for example, is going to go to a campaign event in Texas this week, but he has canceled campaign events in Arizona and Florida. Instead, he's going to go down there and meet with the governors. The White House has been trying to put the best spin they can on these spikes in places like Florida and Arizona and Texas, saying, mostly, it's younger people getting infected. Their death rates tend to be lower. But, of course, younger people can infect older people.\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: So here we have a president who's grappling with a pandemic, who - supporters see him as divisive on race, which brings us to the future, beyond sort of the next fiscal quarter. What do we know about President Trump's plans for his second term, his agenda? What is he trying to tell the American people about why he should be reelected?\n\nLIASSON: We know very little about his agenda for a second term. He doesn't even appear to have one. He was asked by Sean Hannity, one of his biggest supporters, on Fox the other night, what are your top priorities for a second term? And here's what he said.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, one of the things that will be really great - you know, the word experience is still good. I always say talent is more important than experience. I've always said that. But the word experience is a very important word. It's an important meaning. I never did this before. I never slept over in Washington. I was in Washington, I think, 17 times. All of a sudden, I'm president of the United States. You know the story.\n\nLIASSON: And it went on and on. No plans for a second term - what even the president's allies have been urging him to do - lay out a positive vision. The Wall Street Journal editorial page, allies of his like Lindsey Graham - they want him to focus on concrete things that he wants to accomplish, not on personal grievances. But so far, that's not how the president wants to campaign.\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: Well, one plan that he has come up with is reengaging again with the Affordable Care Act in the middle of a pandemic. What's going on there?\n\nLIASSON: On Thursday night, the White House filed a brief in support of a bunch of Republican state attorneys general who are trying to get the Supreme Court to say the entire Affordable Care Act is unconstitutional - this at a time when millions of people are losing their health insurance 'cause they're losing their job - some of those people are infected with coronavirus - and also at a time when President Trump has still not managed to get Republicans to coalesce behind a single alternative. He keeps on promising he's going to come up with a better, cheaper alternative to the ACA or to Obamacare. But he hasn't done that yet. And, of course, Joe Biden is going to make the president's attacks on Obamacare one of his top issues because every month, the ACA gets more popular.\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: That's NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson. Thank you so much.\n\nLIASSON: Thank you.\n\nCopyright © 2020 NPR. All rights reserved.

Just 17 Percent Of Americans Approve Of Republican Senate Health Care Bill\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Alex Wong/Getty Images Alex Wong/Getty Images\n\nUpdated at 1:35 p.m. ET\n\nAmericans broadly disapprove of the Senate GOP's health care bill, and they're unhappy with how Republicans are handling the efforts to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, according to a new NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll.\n\nLoading...\n\nJust 17 percent of those surveyed say they approve of the Senate's health care plan, the Better Care Reconciliation Act. Fifty-five percent say they disapprove, while about a quarter said they hadn't heard enough about the proposal to have an opinion on it.\n\nWith mounting defections within the GOP caucus over the bill, leaders decided to delay a vote on the legislation until after Congress returns from next week's July Fourth recess.\n\nA Congressional Budget Office analysis released Monday found that if the bill were enacted, 22 million fewer people would have health insurance over the next decade due, in part, to the bill's rollback of Medicaid expansion.\n\nWith numbers like these, it's not surprising the Republican leadership in Congress is having a difficult time building consensus, said Lee Miringoff, the director of the Marist Institute for Public Opinion.\n\nLoading...\n\nWhile Democratic opposition to the bill, as expected, is high, GOP support for the Senate GOP's plan is very soft. Twenty-one percent of Republicans oppose the bill and just 35 percent support it. Sixty-eight percent of independents also oppose the proposed legislation.\n\nIn fact, while many Americans want changes to the ACA, also known as Obamacare, they want it to be more far-reaching. A 46 percent plurality say they want to see the ACA do more, while just 7 percent want it to do less. Keeping the ACA and having it do less is essentially what GOP congressional plans are doing.\n\nOnly 17 percent want the 2010 bill left intact and unchanged, while a quarter of Americans want it repealed completely — including just over half of Republicans.\n\nIf Congress doesn't go through with a repeal of the ACA, 37 percent of Americans said they would blame Republicans in Congress, while 23 percent would blame Democrats, and 15 percent would blame President Trump.\n\nAmong Republicans, Trump wouldn't bear the brunt of the blame if Congress is unable to repeal and replace Obamacare. Just 6 percent would blame him, and half said they would blame congressional Democrats. Another 20 percent said they would blame GOP lawmakers.\n\nThe NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll surveyed 1,205 adults from June 21-25, 2017, contacted by live interviewers using a mix of landline and mobile numbers. There is a ± 2.8 percentage points margin of error. A sub-sample of 995 registered voters were also surveyed, with a ± 3.1 percentage points margin of error. Questions relating to how congressional Republicans are handling the issue of health care, the plan proposed by Senate Republicans, and whom should be blamed if Congress does not repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act were fielded from June 22-25, 2017 with 939 adults and 769 registered voters. The margin of error is +/- 3.2 percentage points and +/- 3.5 percentage points, respectively.
Candidates Pile On Biden In Debate; Conservative Reaction\n\nWe have a look back at the debate on Wednesday and Steve Inskeep gets a conservative take from Matt Lewis of The Daily Beast.\n\nSTEVE INSKEEP, HOST:\n\nWalking onto last night's debate stage in Detroit, Joe Biden made the kind of remark you might hear in a boxing movie. He was shaking hands with Senator Kamala Harris, the rough equivalent of touching boxing gloves, and Biden said this.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nJOE BIDEN: Go easy on me, kid.\n\nINSKEEP: Go easy on me, kid, Biden said there. The internet leaped on that last word, calling a United States senator kid. And Biden's rivals showed little interest in going easy.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF MONTAGE)\n\nKAMALA HARRIS: Your plan does not cover everyone in America by your staff's and your own definition.\n\nBILL DE BLASIO: So did you say those deportations were a good idea, or did you go to the president and say this is a mistake, we shouldn't do it? Which one?\n\nCORY BOOKER: There are people right now in prison for life for drug offenses because you stood up and used that tough on crime, phony rhetoric that got a lot of people elected but destroyed communities like mine.\n\nINSKEEP: The voices of Senator Harris, Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York and Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey all criticizing Joe Biden, who has been leading the early polling on the Democratic side. NPR lead political editor Domenico Montanaro begins our coverage. He's in Detroit. Domenico, good morning.\n\nDOMENICO MONTANARO, BYLINE: Hey there, Steve.\n\nINSKEEP: What did the candidates reveal about different ways they would govern if elected?\n\nMONTANARO: I mean, obviously the way that the candidates piled on former Vice President Biden certainly shows just what kind of a threat he is in this campaign. And Biden himself, you know, there is a difference sort of in the way their governing styles would be because Biden is saying, you know, let's build on things like Obamacare, follow the existing laws but have a different policy that comes out of the White House for immigration as opposed to what President Trump is doing now.\n\nThat's very different than, say, Cory Booker from New Jersey, who would be much more liberal on something like criminal justice reform or immigration as well - and a host of other candidates who want big, bold change.\n\nINSKEEP: Well, let's listen to an example of that from the former vice president himself. Other candidates are talking about Medicare for All, ending private insurance. And in this bit of sound, Biden calls for just improving Obamacare, which already exists.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nBIDEN: The Republicans are trying to kill Obamacare. Obamacare took care of 20 million people right off the bat, 100 million people with pre-existing conditions. And in fact, what we got is a public option that, in fact, would allow anybody to buy in. No one has to keep their private insurance. They can buy into this plan.\n\nINSKEEP: Domenico, is there a significant political difference between saying I'm going to abolish a large part of the private insurance industry and saying I'm going to keep it but give you this option?\n\nMONTANARO: Well, the main political difference is whether or not it can pass, you know? And I think that's something that the Biden campaign is pretty focused on, saying what is actually pragmatic, what's practical, what can get done. And a lot...\n\nINSKEEP: Are they also asking what can get votes in a general election?\n\nMONTANARO: Well, they are asking that, actually. And you hear their pollster talk about how a lot of the things that Biden is putting forward are the kinds of things that are popular with the general election electorate, unlike some of the other things that candidates are putting forward.\n\nINSKEEP: There are some other conflicts from last night. Kamala Harris got criticized by Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, also really for being a little old style in Gabbard's telling.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nTULSI GABBARD: Senator Harris says she's proud of her record as a prosecutor and that she'll be a prosecutor president. But I'm deeply concerned about this record. There are too many examples to cite, but she put over 1,500 people in jail for marijuana violations and then laughed about it when she was asked if she ever smoked marijuana.\n\nINSKEEP: Domenico, is just part of the Democrats' dilemma - Kamala Harris is appealing, a strong candidate, because she was a tough prosecutor, but also vulnerable because she was a tough prosecutor?\n\nMONTANARO: You know, Harris' prosecutorial record is something that is going to get a lot more attention if she rises more in the polls because it's something that the progressive left has not been happy with since she jumped in.\n\nINSKEEP: Domenico, thanks so much for your work.\n\nMONTANARO: You're so welcome.\n\nINSKEEP: Long night for NPR's Domenico Montanaro in Detroit. Now how does all this look to someone who's on the other side of the ideological divide from the Democrats on stage last night? Matt Lewis is with us. He's a conservative political writer with The Daily Beast. Thanks for coming by.\n\nMATT LEWIS: Thank you.\n\nINSKEEP: What stood out for you?\n\nLEWIS: Well, look; I think - coming, in I had a question about Joe Biden's age. And I think that that's because Joe Biden stumbled during his first debate performance, and then actually on the heels of the Robert Mueller testimony, where it looked like you have a guy who maybe has lost a step.\n\nDemocrats, I think, were probably a little bit worried. Does Joe Biden have the energy? Is he sharp enough? I think Joe Biden answered that call. He is sharp enough. He has the energy. The question is, is he out of touch with a party that now views Barack Obama as being too conservative?\n\nINSKEEP: You know, you wrote an article about this in The Daily Beast. And you acknowledged that some people are going to hear this very question and consider it ageist to even raise it. But it sounds like you think it needs to be raised and faced.\n\nLEWIS: I think it's legitimate. Look; you know, Ronald Reagan was asked that same question in 1984. He rose to the occasion, and I think Joe Biden probably did as well.\n\nINSKEEP: Now Biden, I guess we would not say he is conservative on his policy stances. He's a Democrat. He describes himself as progressive as a matter of fact. But is there a certain kind of small-c conservatism in his approach to government, wanting to build on what's already there rather than break everything?\n\nLEWIS: Yeah. Look; I think that goes back to Edmund Burke, who himself was a reformer, but in many ways the father of conservatism. It's not about being hidebound or tied to the past. It's about slow evolution and change and not being crazy and radical.\n\nAnd I think look; if - the Democrats are going to have a real problem because if you give them any criticism, they call it a Republican talking point. I think Joe Biden is much more cautious and realistic than a lot of the other people on the stage.\n\nINSKEEP: Do you imagine, though, that there are voters out there in - I don't know, say, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin - who voted for Donald Trump and would say OK, that Joe Biden guy, he's interesting, I like that?\n\nLEWIS: Yeah, I think that that is the fundamental appeal of Joe Biden. It's that if you look at what this general election is about, it's about winning the Electoral College - and that probably means Pennsylvania and Michigan - and who is best positioned to win over not just the Democratic base - they're important, of course - but also working class white voters that Donald Trump won last time. Joe Biden could certainly compete this time.\n\nINSKEEP: But let me ask an alternative theory here, and maybe this is one of the theories that some Democrats are pursuing. If we look over the past ten or 12 years of American history, you went from President George W. Bush to a Democrat, the first black president, from that to Donald Trump, pretty radical change. And in and among those elections, the Congress flipped a couple of times. People seem to be going for something new again and again. Couldn't this possibly be a moment when voters are hungry for a big change again?\n\nLEWIS: It could be. Look; you go to people like Walter Mondale or Michael Dukakis, safe establishment choices who lost to incumbent presidents.\n\nINSKEEP: Hillary Clinton comes to mind...\n\nLEWIS: There you go. So that's...\n\nINSKEEP: ...Perhaps, although she won the popular vote. But go on. Go on.\n\nLEWIS: ...An argument against Biden. But I also think we've had a lot of change. Donald Trump, an extreme example of change. People may want a return to normalcy. And I'm not convinced after just redoing our entire health care system less than a decade ago, you know, that people are going to want to do it again. It sounds dangerous.\n\nI think when Joe Biden talks about let's keep Obamacare, that may be - when we talk about the Medicare for All and the disruption that could cause and taxes, it seems dangerous.\n\nINSKEEP: Matt Lewis, thanks so much for coming by.\n\nLEWIS: Thank you.\n\nINSKEEP: He's a writer for The Daily Beast.\n\nCopyright © 2019 NPR.

The Election And A Fresh Obamacare Challenge Loom Over New Supreme Court Term\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption J. Scott Applewhite/AP J. Scott Applewhite/AP\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court opens a new court term Monday, while across the street at the Capitol, Republicans are seeking to jam through, before the Nov. 3 election, President Trump's nomination of Amy Coney Barrett to the court.\n\nTrump offered Barrett the nomination just two days after Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg died. And since then, Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell has been leading the GOP charge to get Barrett confirmed before Election Day.\n\nIt's a race to the political finish line made more difficult by the fact that at least two members of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Utah Republican Mike Lee and North Carolina Republican Thom Tillis, have tested positive for the coronavirus and, on Saturday, McConnell said the committee will start the hearing as scheduled on Oct. 12.\n\nRegardless of what is happening in the Senate, the Supreme Court is carrying on in its usual stately fashion. The court is an institution built on tradition, and the traditional opening day of the term is the first Monday of October.\n\nThis time, however, there will be just eight justices, not the usual nine, and because of COVID-19, once again the justices will gather by telephone hookup to hear the lawyers make their arguments. Because they will not be together, there will be none of the usual freewheeling debate; instead, the justices will ask questions in order of seniority, with each justice limited to just a few minutes. And once again, the public will be able to listen in.\n\nA lot has changed since July, when the court concluded a tumultuous term, surprising observers with lopsided decisions favoring LGBT rights in one case and repudiating Trump's claim of total immunity in two others involving grand jury and congressional subpoenas.\n\nIn other more closely divided rulings, Chief Justice John Roberts, on some notable but rare occasions, broke with fellow conservatives to cast the deciding fifth vote with the court's liberals. His vote to strike down a Louisiana anti-abortion law infuriated some conservative politicians, but it was typical of Roberts. He wrote separately from the liberal justices, stressing that he had dissented when the court just four years earlier had struck down an identical law in Texas, but he said that 2016 decision was now binding precedent and he was obligated to uphold it.\n\nDespite that institutionalist streak, with Ginsburg's death and her replacement by the very conservative Barrett, Roberts may well have lost his leverage, observes University of Michigan law professor Nicholas Bagley.\n\nThe chief justice is no longer going to be the center vote, he notes. In short, the hard-line conservatives on the court can prevail without Roberts.\n\nObamacare on the chopping block again\n\nJust how far right the court will move could become apparent quickly in a case to be argued a week after the election. It is the third challenge to the Affordable Care Act, which in the past was upheld by votes of 5-4 and 6-3.\n\nThis time, the Trump administration and a coalition of red states are arguing that because the Republican Congress three years ago zeroed out the monetary penalty for those not covered by insurance (the so-called mandate), the whole law is now void.\n\nIf the administration were to prevail, there would no longer be protections for those with preexisting conditions; health insurance for some 22 million people under Obamacare would likewise be gone, and so too would be many other protections that people have gotten used to.\n\nTrump's newest supreme court nominee, Barrett, has been highly critical of Chief Justice Roberts' reasoning in the previous Obamacare cases.\n\nBut even Paul Clement, who argued on behalf of those challenging the law in the Supreme Court the first time, thinks this case is a stretch.\n\nIt's just hard for me to say that the mandate is central when it doesn't have any teeth, he says, noting that Congress has repeatedly refused to repeal the law in the wake of previous Supreme Court decisions and that the penalty no longer exists.\n\nThere is, he adds, an air of surreality around the current case. Indeed, sources say that top Justice Department officials tried and failed to talk Trump out of bringing the case.\n\nThe Obamacare case is just one of many controversies flashing red on the Supreme Court docket this term — many of them political.\n\nSome cases are already being expedited. One involves how many seats each state gets in the House of Representatives. The Constitution requires the whole number of persons in each state to be included for apportionment purposes. But Trump maintains he has discretion to determine the numbers and has said he intends to exclude noncitizens without legal status from the count. A three-judge federal court prevented him from doing that. Now the case is before the Supreme Court.\n\nAnother Bush v. Gore?\n\nIn addition, there are numerous cases directly involving the upcoming election, cases that are being teed up in the wings and that could determine who is the next president.\n\nLurking in the background is the possibility that this could become the most tumultuous and divisive term since the Supreme Court decided Bush v. Gore, says Irv Gornstein, director of the Supreme Court Institute at the Georgetown University Law Center.\n\nAnd that's just the beginning. Among the other controversies is a case testing whether a House committee conducting impeachment hearings is entitled to secret grand jury transcripts — a case that dates back to the Mueller investigation but has important implications for congressional powers in the future.\n\nThen, too, there is a case that pits the rights of religious groups against state and federal anti-discrimination laws. On one end is Catholic Social Services of Philadelphia, and on the other, the city, which contracts with a wide variety of groups that it pays to screen and certify couples for foster care.\n\nThe city cut off Catholic Social Services because the group refused, on religious grounds, to certify same-sex couples, and that violated the city's nondiscrimination law. The lower courts upheld the city's decision, citing the Supreme Court's 1990 decision declaring that religious groups are not entitled to exemptions from neutral, generally applicable laws. The decision was written by conservative icon Justice Antonin Scalia. Nonetheless, four of the court's current conservatives have expressed an interest in overturning that decision, and with the addition of Barrett, there may well be a majority.
Premium Hike Catapults Obamacare Into Election Spotlight\n\nHealth care has not been a major issue in this year's campaign. But both the major candidates have plans for how to deal with Obamacare. As part of our What's The Issue series, we look at the details.\n\nRENEE MONTAGNE, HOST:\n\nHealth care - and Obamacare in particular - has dominated the debate between Republicans and Democrats for years, until this year. Candidates had plenty to say in campaign 2016 but rarely touched on the issue of America's health care system. Over the past few weeks, MORNING EDITION has hosted a series of conversations called What's The Issue, asking you to tweet us your top election issues with the hashtag #DearWashington. Many of you brought up health care. Here's a sampling.\n\nJODY THERON: Dear Washington, everyone in family has asthma. We need daily prescriptions and rescue prescriptions at all times plus regular checkups.\n\nCOLBY KLAUSE: Dear Washington, I suffer from treatable mental health problems, but I can't afford the treatment. I just want medication to get me back to having a career.\n\nJIM FOTH: I can barely afford my health care premiums each month. It's roughly another car payment for me. It's depressing when I think about how good the rest of the world has it.\n\nMONTAGNE: How good - how good had the rest of the world has it. That was Jody Theron (ph), Colby Klause (ph) of Nebraska and Jim Foth (ph), just some of the people who reached out to us on how important the issue of health care was to them. With us now to talk about the two major candidates and what they're proposing is NPR health policy correspondent Alison Kodjak. Good morning.\n\nALISON KODJAK, BYLINE: Good morning, Renee.\n\nMONTAGNE: Now, health care has not come up, a bit surprisingly, that much in this campaign, but it did come up this week after the Obama administration announced the new rates for insurance plans for 2017. Recap the news for the coming year.\n\nKODJAK: The overall rates for insurance bought through the Obamacare exchanges are going to go up an average of 22 percent across the country. Some states, the increases will be bigger, some will be smaller. But for consumers who qualify for subsidies, which are most of them, they won't really see an increase because those subsidies increase along with the rates.\n\nMONTAGNE: OK, so not exactly 22 percent there, maybe, for most people. But Donald Trump did come out at a rally in Florida yesterday with a reaction to this news. Let's take a listen.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nDONALD TRUMP: Obamacare is just blowing up. And even the White House, our president, announced 25 or 26 percent. That number is so wrong. That is such a phony number. You're talking about 60, 70, 80 percent in increases, not 25 percent.\n\nMONTAGNE: Well, 60, 70, 80 - who's right here?\n\nKODJAK: Well, the 25 percent number that he's saying is basically the average increase for insurance policies sold on the federal exchange. There are also state exchanges. Their rates are going up a little less. So on average across the country, it's only 22 percent. However, on individual states, the increase could be much higher.\n\nIn Alabama, for example, it's showing an increase of 58 percent on average. And in Arizona, they're more than doubling. But again, it's state by state. In Indiana, rates are actually looking to go down. But still, for consumers, the subsidies are going to cover most of the increases that are showing on these numbers.\n\nMONTAGNE: So let's stay with Donald Trump. What is he proposing to do?\n\nKODJAK: Well, let's listen to a bit more about what he said at that rally.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nTRUMP: Obamacare has to be repealed and replaced, and it has to be replaced with something much less expensive for the people. And, otherwise, this country's in even bigger trouble than anybody thought.\n\nKODJAK: So Donald Trump has repeatedly called Obamacare a disaster. And he says, like many Republicans do, that he wants to repeal it and replace it. However, he hasn't offered a lot of details about what he's going to replace it with. So he has a couple of specific proposals. One is to expand what are called health savings accounts.\n\nAnd those allow people to save money, tax-free, and use that money to offset their health care costs. And a second proposal he has offered is to allow insurance companies to sell insurance across state lines. Right now, they have to get licensed in every state and sell within different states.\n\nHe says that by allowing them to sell insurance across state lines, it'll increase competition among insurers and therefore reduce the premiums that are sold. But he doesn't have a lot of details about what'll happen to that 20 million people who've gotten insurance so far under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nMONTAGNE: And Hillary Clinton, what is she saying?\n\nKODJAK: So Hillary Clinton has a much more detailed plan. Let's start by listening to what she said at the second debate.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE)\n\nHILLARY CLINTON: Now, with respect to the Affordable Care Act, I've been saying we've got to fix what's broken and keep what works. And that's exactly what we're going to do. I am committed to making sure that people retain coverage that they can afford. And that is going to require taking on premium cost and deductible cost and prescription drug cost.\n\nKODJAK: So what Clinton has said over and over again is that she wants to build on Obamacare - keep what works, get rid of what doesn't. And her central theme has been to figure out how to deal with the cost. Increasing health care costs are the major problem, so she's proposed putting a cap on what people's out of - out-of-pocket health costs can be, taking a look at a big insurance company mergers because she says that is reducing competition and also looking at increasing drug prices. It's been big in the news lately, and she wants to look at why drug companies are raising prices and whether those price increases are justified.\n\nMONTAGNE: So in a nutshell, Alison, what are the options that voters have here?\n\nKODJAK: Well, if Donald Trump has his way, he will repeal and replace Obamacare, and that will actually end up with 20 million people who have gotten insurance so far having to look for something new. And we don't really know what that something is going to be. If Hillary Clinton gets her way, there'll be a much bigger role of government in health care.\n\nShe's proposed a couple of other things, including allowing people who are 55 years and older to buy into Medicare earlier than they are currently eligible. And she's brought up the public option again. That's the option of having the government offer health insurance in competition with private companies on the exchanges.\n\nMONTAGNE: NPR health policy correspondent Allison Kodjak, thanks very much.\n\nKODJAK: My pleasure, Renee.\n\nCopyright © 2016 NPR.

Oops ... PAC Runs TV Ads Thanking Some Republicans For Repealing Obamacare\n\nAmerican Action Network ran ads Friday like this one thanking California's David Valadao, and others, for repealing Obamacare. YouTube\n\nSome basketball viewers on Friday night were subjected to television commercials that were guilty of peddling some alternative facts.\n\nThat's because in some markets with conservative-leaning districts, commercials aired praising some Republican House members for their efforts in repealing the Affordable Care Act, commonly called Obamacare.\n\nThe problem of course is that repeal effort, which many thought would be a slam dunk, was abandoned because the House Republicans didn't have enough support from within their own ranks.\n\nIn the generic ads, the American Action Network, a conservative-leaning advocacy group, urged viewers to call their member of Congress to thank them for keeping their promise and replacing the Affordable Care Act with a better health care you deserve.\n\nAccording to the sports and culture website Deadspin, at least four of these ads ran Friday thanking Reps. Barbara Comstock (R-VA), Will Hurd (R-TX), David Valadao (R-CA), David Young (R-IA).\n\nAs of Saturday, another eight ads were still on the American Action Network's YouTube page praising Brian Fitzpatrick (R-PA), Darrell Issa (R-CA), Rod Blum (R-IA), Gred Walden (R-OR), Don Bacon (R-NE), Kevin Brady (R-TX), Mike Coffman (R-CO) and Carlos Curbelo (R-FL).\n\nThe premature ad buy was supposed to coincide with the long-awaited victory lap Washington Republicans campaigned on – that once they controlled both houses of Congress and the White House, Obamacare would be tossed out.\n\nInstead, in the midst of March Madness yet another upset took place. This one took place in the halls of Congress, when Speaker Ryan told reporters Friday:\n\nI don't know what else to say other than Obamacare is the law of the land. It's going to remain the law of the land.\n\nAs NPR has reported, Speaker Ryan called the defeat a learning experience.\n\nPresident Trump and House Republicans are now expected to turn their attention to another difficult overhaul – taxes.
What Biden's Election Means For U.S. Health Care And Public Health\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Paul Sancya/AP Paul Sancya/AP\n\nAs of Jan. 20, 2021 — Inauguration Day — the federal government is about to get much more involved in health care and the COVID-19 pandemic response. Exactly how much more involved, now that Joe Biden is president-elect, depends on whether Republicans keep control of the Senate. And that likely won't be determined until early January, when Georgia's two Senate run-off races are held.\n\nTrump's nearly four years as president have been marked by a scaled-back federal investment and involvement in health care in a range of ways — giving states more authority to run their own health insurance markets, for example, and leaving them to come up with their own strategies for COVID-19 testing, contact tracing and more.\n\nBiden's pledge during the campaign was to reverse that trend. He wants to double-down and invest in the changes the Affordable Care Act made to the country's health care system, he says. He wants to pour trillions into a unified coronavirus strategy. And he wants to work with Congress to create a Medicare-like public insurance plan that anyone can buy into — what he's called the public option.\n\nHere's a guide to his policy platforms and promises related to health care. Again, how much he's able to deliver on will in some cases depend on what happens in the Senate.\n\nISSUE: The Affordable Care Act\n\nStarting Tuesday, long before Biden is inaugurated in January, the Supreme Court will hear arguments about the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. The court's decision likely won't come until spring, and in the meantime, the Biden administration could try to make the case against the law moot.\n\nThere are a couple of things Congress could do to make it so there's actually no nothing to litigate — so the Supreme Court wouldn't have to decide this case, it would just go away, says Sabrina Corlette, co-director of the Center on Health Insurance Reforms at Georgetown University. Even if Republicans control the Senate, she says, it still might be possible for Congress and the White House to find a compromise. I don't think the litigation is a win for Republicans politically, and so they may just be perfectly happy to work out a deal.\n\nIf the Supreme Court does overturn the law next spring and Congress fails to make that deal, President Biden and Congress would have to work quickly to come up with another way to address the possibility of tens of millions of people becoming uninsured amid a pandemic.\n\nI think it would be savvy for the Biden administration to use the pandemic as a vehicle for making forward progress with respect to health care.\n\nAssuming the ACA does survive this latest Supreme Court challenge, Biden has said he wants to build on the law. For example, he wants to address complaints that ACA premiums are unaffordable — the current law only provides federal premium subsidies for households that make up to 400% of the federal poverty level. Biden's plan would expand these subsidies to include people who make more money than that. He would also reverse some of the ways the Trump administration has tried to undercut the exchanges; Biden says he would restore funding for ACA consumer outreach and for help with ACA sign-ups.\n\nThe most significant change he would like to make to the ACA is creating a Medicare-like program that would be a public option — a health insurance program administered by the federal government, just as Medicare is, but available to people of any age — that could compete against private insurance plans in the marketplace. This idea was part of the original ACA but did not make it into the final law.\n\nA Medicare-like public option would likely be substantially less expensive than current private insurance plans, explains Larry Levitt, executive vice president for health policy at the Kaiser Family Foundation. That's because of the leverage the government would have to drive down the prices of doctor visits and hospital care.\n\nOne example of how this works is in payment rates for doctors and other providers: Medicare pays hospitals about half of what private insurance companies pay, so a Medicare-like public option at Medicare prices would be much less expensive than private insurance plans, Levitt says. Plus, he says, the government-sponsored insurance plan also wouldn't have a profit margin like private insurers have, which would also help lower premiums.\n\nBut, Levitt says, the public option is one of many health care ideas Biden campaigned on that are likely dead in the water if Republicans keep control of the Senate.\n\nDouglas Holtz-Eakin, president of the conservative American Action Forum, agrees: I don't see any of that being easy for Republicans in the Senate to tolerate.\n\nISSUE: COVID-19 Pandemic\n\nEarly Monday morning, Biden announced a COVID-19 advisory board to, as he said in his victory speech, help take the Biden-Harris COVID plan and convert it into an action blueprint that will start on January 20, 2021.\n\nAlso Monday, Pfizer announced that its vaccine candidate appears to be working, at least in preliminary evidence from tests in people. Biden released a statement calling the news excellent but warned that widespread vaccination is many months away and that Americans will have to rely on masking, distancing, contact tracing, hand washing, and other measures to keep themselves safe well into next year.\n\nBiden will be taking office with the coronavirus blazing through the country — new records of cases and deaths are becoming routine, and more than 237,500 Americans have already died from COVID-19.\n\nAmong health care issues, there's no question the pandemic is top of the list right now, notes Levitt. The pandemic will still be with us for quite some time and will likely dominate the next presidential term.\n\nBiden has remarked often that he would listen to science in his approach to stopping the pandemic, whereas Trump has repeatedly contradicted his own top health officials. Biden has pledged to put the federal government in charge of a nationally coordinated COVID-19 response, once he has the presidential reigns in January, and to use the Defense Production Act to ramp up production of masks, face shields, and other personal protective equipment.\n\nWhile Trump has deferred to the states to come up with and implement testing strategies, Biden wants to establish a Pandemic Testing Board that would coordinate a nationwide response. Among other goals the board would increase drive-by testing twofold and push for the creation of at-home tests and instant tests.\n\nLike Trump, Biden has pledged to guarantee free coronavirus testing regardless of a person's insurance status. He also has said he would subsidize health insurance coverage for people who are relying on COBRA health insurance because of a job-loss during the COVID-19 emergency.\n\nContact tracing has also been left to the states until now, though few states have enough contact tracers to help keep the spread of the virus at bay. An NPR survey estimates there are 53,000 contact tracers across the country — Biden would like to create a U.S. Public Health Jobs Corps to mobilize 100,000 contact tracers. Similar ideas have been floated already by Democrats in Congress, although — again — whether such a plan could be passed into law depends in part on which party controls the Senate.\n\nAnd while the Trump administration invested around $12 billion in the development of potential vaccines to fight COVID-19, negotiations between the White House and Congress over a new COVID-19 relief bill that would include money to distribute those vaccines along with other stimulus measures, have stalled. There does seem to be bipartisan support for this funding, but it's unclear if a new relief bill can happen before inauguration day. Biden will likely push hard for this and other vaccine-related funding: His platform calls for an investment of $25 billion in vaccine manufacturing and distribution.\n\nI think it would be savvy for the Biden administration to use the pandemic as a vehicle for making forward progress with respect to health care, says Jamila Michener, co-director of the Center for Health Equity at Cornell University. The pandemic gives you an opening to, for example, rebuild and further build the public health workforce. Michener says Biden could also support federal health agencies such as the Center for Disease Control and Prevention — agencies that the Biden administration has immediate and influence over, that [under Trump] have very much been eroded and are just kind of flailing in the wind.\n\nISSUE: Medicare & Medicaid\n\nWhen it comes to Medicare and Medicaid, the federal health programs that together provide coverage to 115 million people, Biden has signaled he wants to expand eligibility for these programs.\n\nFor Medicare, the federal program for people over 65, and certain younger people with disabilities. Biden has said he would like to allow people to enroll as early as age 60 and make dental, vision and hearing coverage standard issue in traditional Medicare. Currently, most Medicare beneficiaries have to buy a supplemental policy to add on those benefits.\n\nIn a divided Congress, these changes to Medicare that would cost taxpayers more money aren't likely to make it into law. I've never seen any appetite on the Republican side of the aisle for something that would have greater Medicare spending, says Holtz-Eakin. That's not the way they typically run.\n\nIn terms of Medicaid, the state-run program for low-income adults, children, pregnant women and people with disabilities, we shouldn't underestimate the powers that lie in the executive branch, Michener says. States and the federal government jointly fund Medicaid.\n\nTrump's administration has been creative in how it encouraged states to change the program, she explains, like allowing for eligibility and enrollment restrictions, restricting benefits, increasing co-pays, increasing or requiring premiums, [and] implementing work reporting requirements.\n\nThere's no reason why the Biden administration couldn't do the same, although to very different policy ends. More progressive or liberal states might ask the federal government to be able to use Medicaid funding for housing costs, for instance, Michener says.\n\nBecause the notion is that housing is health, she explains. So if we can support people in keeping them housed in a variety of ways, whether it's paying for legal services for people who are being potentially evicted, or what have you, then that might be part of how we think about what a program like Medicaid can do to maintain health outside of the narrow confines of hospitals or doctors offices.\n\nBiden has also talked about Medicaid expansion, a key part of the ACA that expanded coverage to more than 12 million people. Only about a dozen states have declined to adopt expansion of the program. Biden campaigned on the idea that the new public option could help fill the need for low-income people who don't qualify for Medicaid in those states that haven't expanded eligibility. If the public option can't get through Congress, though, it's unclear how the Biden administration might address this issue.\n\nBiden may also move to reverse the executive actions Trump took to limit health care options for immigrants, which is another one of the areas where Biden could do a lot administratively without Congress, Levitt says. That may include reversing the public charge rule, which aimed to deny green cards to some immigrants who use food stamps or other public benefits. (On Nov. 2, a federal judge blocked enforcement of Trump's public charge rule.) Biden has also said he wants to expand ACA coverage to DACA recipients, and allow undocumented immigrants to purchase plans in the ACA marketplaces, although without federal subsidies.\n\nISSUE: Drug & Health Care Costs\n\nThis is the area in health policy where Biden's policies might be most like President Trump's. Both of them have said they want to end surprise medical billing and bring down prescription drug prices, and they even agree on some ideas about how to do that.\n\nA key way in which Biden differs from Trump in his favored way to lower drug prices is Biden's support for allowing the federal government to negotiate drug prices on behalf of Medicare beneficiaries. This was an important part of the drug pricing law the House of Representatives passed in 2019, but was a nonstarter for the Senate led by Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. If Republicans maintain control of the Senate and McConnell remains majority leader, this is very unlikely to get through Congress.\n\nBut there is the potential for bipartisan agreement on other measures to bring down drug costs, and to help remedy the problem of sky-high medical bills. I could see surprise medical bills being dealt with in the next administration, Holtz-Eakin says.\n\nThe practice of surprise billing — when, for example, a patient goes to an in-network hospital but is treated by out-of-network providers who then bill the patient directly — is a particular problem that Congress has tried to address. Out-of-network surgical assistants (health care providers the patient never met) have become an increasing problem in this regard, policy analysts say, and surprise hospital facility fees are another problem. Surprise bills and skimpy, or high deductible-insurance plans have forced many Americans into medical bankruptcy.\n\nTrump pushed hard on Congress to deal with surprise billing from out-of-network health care providers, and lawmakers got close last December, but ultimately failed to come to an agreement about how to get it done. Biden has also said he would like to end the practice, but hasn't explained which approach he would support.\n\nISSUE: Other Key Health Issues\n\nBeyond the big ticket health policy items of the Affordable Care Act and the pandemic, there are a whole host of health care issues where I would expect a Biden administration to move to reverse much of what President Trump has done, says Levitt.\n\nFor example, in reproductive health, President Trump has restricted federal funding for agencies that provide abortion counseling like Planned Parenthood, Levitt says. Biden has opposed that and I would expect him to reverse those restrictions.\n\nNot only does Biden support Roe v. Wade, he has said he wants to codify its protections in law. His administration would likely make moves to allow more federal funding for abortion and to ensure no-cost contraception coverage for more employees.\n\nTrump put some effort into the opioid crisis — he declared in a public health emergency and created a plan to address it, though the Government Accountability Office and other opioid policy experts say the implementation of that policy has fallen flat. Biden has said he wants to increase access to treatment services for opioid use disorder, curb opioid prescriptions and prosecute pharmaceutical companies that helped feed the nation's addiction problems.\n\nThen there are the significant racial health disparities laid bare by the pandemic. Some of the bigger picture health policy pieces that the Biden administration is going to pursue are going to be kind of disproportionately beneficial for people of color, Michener says. She's also heard the Biden campaign pledge to address racial disparities more head on, for instance by addressing maternal mortality.\n\nThe Trump administration also has been criticized for not doing enough to address the significant racial disparities in the COVID-19 pandemic, including by not releasing demographic data that demonstrated how communities of color were significantly harder hit in terms of cases of the illness and deaths.\n\nBetter access and analysis of data around racial health outcomes for COVID-19, Michener says, is the low-hanging fruit that will easily be plucked by the Biden administration.
Transition Process Begins: Trump To Meet With Obama At The White House\n\nThe meeting is one of the first steps in the transition process. At the same time, there is a lot happening in the political parties after the seismic presidential election.\n\nRENEE MONTAGNE, HOST:\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump goes to the White House today to meet with President Obama. It's the first step in a transition process that goes from now through January, when he is inaugurated. Joining us now to talk about what's happening in the political parties after this seismic election is NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson.\n\nGood morning.\n\nMARA LIASSON, BYLINE: Hi, Renee.\n\nMONTAGNE: Now, we saw a lot of resistance to embracing Trump among establishment Republicans during his campaign. But yesterday morning, Speaker of the House Paul Ryan was out early talking about one party. Is that a portent of what's to come?\n\nLIASSON: Yes, I think Republicans are unifying behind Donald Trump. There were predictions, of course, of a Republican civil war if Trump had lost. But now that he won, I think any remaining resistance to him in the Republican Party seems to have disappeared. Only conservative intellectuals are left in the opposition. When you listened to Speaker Ryan yesterday, you heard him full of awe and admiration for the decisive win Trump had and the fact that he had coattails. He helped Republicans keep their losses in the House to single digits - only two losses in the Senate.\n\nSo I think, yes, it is a Trump party now. He's remade the Republican Party in a populist, more isolationist, nativist direction. And we'll see how that plays out since his views on so many things, like trade and immigration and foreign policy and small government, are so different from those that the congressional Republican leadership used to have.\n\nMONTAGNE: Well, Trump did say - had a list of what he would do on day one. But what is likely to be his first legislative action?\n\nLIASSON: Well, I think he'll be looking for the low-hanging fruit. First, on his own, he can reverse all those executive actions President Obama made on the environment or on immigration. Then, in terms of legislation, I think repealing Obamacare is probably the easiest and first order of business now that Republicans have total control of Congress and the White House. I think he'll want to appoint a ninth Supreme Court justice. Other things - he'll want to cut taxes and regulations. He's promised to enact term limits. That might be tough because it's opposed by Mitch McConnell. Then he's talked about infrastructure investment, which is something that actually could get bipartisan support.\n\nMONTAGNE: And what are you - speaking of bipartisan, what are you hearing from Democrats about how they're dealing with these results?\n\nLIASSON: Democrats are still absorbing the magnitude and the shock, really, of now being completely shut out of power. They're trying to figure out what happened. There's lots of soul searching and some scapegoating. Democrats are angry at James Comey and Anthony Weiner. And also, they're talking about Hillary Clinton herself and what a weak candidate she was. She was a status quo candidate who ran a status quo campaign in a change year. And I've heard Democrats wonder if Joe Biden or any male candidate could have done better with the white working-class areas of the country where Donald Trump really built his victory.\n\nHillary Clinton outperformed President Obama in cities and suburbs, but she really didn't get out the Obama coalition. And she underperformed him with white working-class voters. And the interesting thing now is we've had three elections where, without Obama on the ballot, the Obama coalition has not turned out in full force - in the midterm elections of 2010 and 2014 and now this election.\n\nThe other thing Democrats are dealing with is they need a leader at a time when their party's bench is very thin. And for a party that has strong support among young people, they have a very old set of leaders.\n\nThey're also looking at that map. Donald Trump seems to have blown it up and remade it. Maybe the industrial Midwest, the Rust Belt, the kind of older, whiter, less-college-educated areas are now Republican states. Democrats are looking to the more diverse parts of the country in the upper South and the West.\n\nThere's a lot of soul searching. There also is probably going to be more tension in the party between the centrist-wing, kind of Chuck Schumer Democrats and the left-wing Elizabeth Warren Democrats.\n\nMONTAGNE: But it also has to be said that Hillary Clinton did win the popular vote. Now, of course, Donald Trump won the electoral vote, so he will be the president. But does he have a mandate?\n\nLIASSON: Well, that's a really good question. She won the popular vote. A mandate is always in the eye of the beholder, and it's often overestimated by the winner. He didn't really run on specific policy issues. He just promised to blow up the system and drain the swamp. And also, the majority of the country has different views than Donald Trump and the Republicans on immigration, global warming and even health care. So I think a mandate might be pretty elusive.\n\nMONTAGNE: Mara, thanks very much.\n\nLIASSON: Thank you.\n\nMONTAGNE: That's NPR's national political correspondent Mara Liasson.\n\nCopyright © 2016 NPR.

NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist Poll: Biden, Sanders Lead 2020 Democratic Race\n\ntoggle caption Alex Wong/Getty Images\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders lead the crowded Democratic field, pulling in together about half of the support of Democratic voters and Democratic-leaning independents, according to the latest NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist Poll.\n\nBiden leads with 24%, followed closely by Sanders at 22%. Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren is third with 17%, followed by South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg at 13%, all together making up a clear top tier of four candidates.\n\nEntrepreneur Andrew Yang is fifth with 5%; former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar and New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker all pull in 4%.\n\nClustered together with just 1% support are former Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Julián Castro, Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard and Colorado Sen. Michael Bennet. Former Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick, billionaire Tom Steyer, spiritualist and author Marianne Williamson and former Rep. John Delaney all get less than 1%.\n\nThe poll comes ahead of the next Democratic debate, this Thursday in Los Angeles and sponsored by the PBS NewsHour and Politico.\n\nImportantly, while two-thirds of Democratic voters and Democratic-leaning independents say they are satisfied with the Democratic field, three-quarters (76%) say they could change their minds on whom they currently support.\n\nSo this is potentially a very fluid race, and it is why, despite Biden leading consistently in national polls, there has been so much movement in early-state polls.\n\nWhile Biden continues to lead in national polling, when it comes to all-important state polls, Buttigieg has seen a surge of late. He narrowly leads Sanders in Iowa and narrowly trails him in New Hampshire, with Biden and Warren not far behind, according to RealClearPolitics' average of the polls.\n\nWe're looking for late action, because it's so fluid, Lee Miringoff, director of the Marist Institute for Public Opinion, which conducted the poll, said of potential change before the first nominating states cast votes. I think we're looking at the last surge for who could win.\n\nDifferent coalitions for the Democratic candidates\n\nThe top candidates draw support from different parts of the Democratic Party, the poll shows.\n\nBiden does best with white women without a college degree (34%), older voters over 45 (33%), moderates (31%), those making less than $50,000 a year (30%) and voters in the South (31%), where many of the Democratic primary voters are African American.\n\nNotably, though, Sanders is the candidate who narrowly leads with nonwhite voters, 29% to 26%, over Biden. This might be because of Sanders' strength with younger voters of color and Latinos. But the margins of error with these subgroups are too high to draw any definitive conclusions.\n\nSanders also leads with younger voters under 45 (37%), progressives (29%), people who live in big cities (28%), voters in the Northeast (27%) and men (27%). Warren is second with progressives (23%).\n\nButtigieg leads with whites with a college degree (23%), including women. Again, Warren is a close second with these groups. So Warren is competing on two separate fronts for support — with the progressives who might be inclined to the policies of Sanders and with Buttigieg for college-educated whites.\n\nLoading...\n\nDon't see the graphic above? Click here.\n\nBy a 54% to 44% margin, Democratic voters think it's more important to have a nominee who has the best chance of beating Trump than someone who shares their position on most issues.\n\nAnd by a 49% to 42% margin, they say it's more important to have a nominee who will move in a different direction from former President Obama's policies. Among those who think it's more important to move past Obama's policies, Sanders leads the field with 28%, followed by Biden at 17%, Warren at 16% and Buttigieg at 9%.\n\nBut Biden leads handily when it comes to those who say it's more important to continue Obama's policies — 34% to Buttigieg's 19%, Warren's 17% and Sanders' 14%.\n\nOn the issues\n\nOverall, Americans rated the economy (27%) as the most important issue to them, followed by health care (23%), climate change (16%), education (13%), immigration (10%) and gun policy (9%).\n\nBut, predictably, Democrats and Republicans believe very different things are important.\n\nFor Democrats, the poll found the top issues are health care (30%), climate change (29%), the economy (13%) and education (12%).\n\nFor Republicans, it's overwhelmingly the economy (41%), followed much further back by immigration (17%), health care (16%) and gun policy (10%).\n\nDemocrats have put forward a host of policy positions. Some — like Medicare for All as a replacement for private health insurance, decriminalizing illegal border crossings and a universal basic income of $1,000 a month — provide warnings for the party, as none is able to win support from a majority of the overall electorate.\n\nBut Democrats are on solid ground when talking about stricter background checks for gun purchases, stricter regulation of prescription drug prices, a pathway to citizenship for immigrants in the U.S. illegally, a Green New Deal that addresses climate change by investing in green jobs and energy-efficient infrastructure, and legalizing marijuana.\n\nAll are supported by 60% or more of Americans.\n\nThere is also majority support for forgiving student loan debt for lower-income people, a wealth tax on wealth above $1 million, keeping but making changes to Obamacare, a public option for health care, a ban on semiautomatic assault-style weapons, a national minimum wage of $15 an hour, taxing carbon emissions and offering free tuition at public colleges and universities.\n\nBut Republicans give majority support only for gun background checks and stricter prescription drug regulations.\n\nLoading...\n\nDon't see the graphic above? Click here.\n\nThe survey of 1,744 adults was conducted between Dec. 9 and 11 by the Marist Poll using live telephone callers via cell phone and landline and has a margin of error of +/- 3.5 percentage points. There were 1,508 registered voters surveyed, and where they are referenced, the poll has a margin of error of +/- 3.7 percentage points. There were 704 Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents surveyed, and where they are referenced, results have a +/- 5.4 percentage point margin of error.
Minnesota Republican Rep. Tom Emmer On Trump, Russia And Obamacare Repeal\n\nRep. Tom Emmer of Minnesota was an early supporter of Donald Trump. He talks with Lulu Garcia-Navarro about contact between a Trump adviser and the Russian ambassador, and Obamacare repeal plans.\n\nLOURDES GARCIA-NAVARRO, HOST:\n\nThis week, Donald Trump will become the nation's 45th president. The transition has been rife with controversy over conflicts of interest, ties with Russia and other issues. To hear one view from Capitol Hill, we reached Congressman Tom Emmer. He's a Republican from Minnesota, and he was an early supporter of Donald Trump's.\n\nCongressman Emmer, thank you so much for coming onto the program.\n\nTOM EMMER: Good morning, Lulu.\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: Good morning. Let's start with the Affordable Care Act. This week, the House and the Senate took an important first step towards dismantling the health care law. How long do you think it'll take for you and your colleagues to come up with an alternative?\n\nEMMER: Well, the incoming administration and the president-elect have committed to unwind this law, this very unsuccessful law within the first 100 days, Lulu. And it's especially important in my state of Minnesota where people have seen an increase in premiums just this year of somewhere between 50 and 67 percent. We are the fourth-highest premium increase state in the country. And it's costing people the opportunity to gain access to the best health care in the world.\n\nSo they've committed that within the first hundred days, we're going to unwind this law and start to give Americans - return the decision-making authority back to the states and give Americans the ability to make the choices that they need and access the health care that they need.\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: Are you willing, though, to repeal it without a replacement, leaving millions of people potentially uninsured?\n\nEMMER: Well, I think what we're on our way to doing - people are making a big deal out of words. I think we're going to repeal and restore. And that will happen almost simultaneously. We're going to repeal this failed law, this misguided law. And we're going to restore the ability of states to craft the solutions that are most important to their populations.\n\nAnd how can that happen? Well, the incoming Health and Human Services secretary - my state is requesting waivers to be able to design the products necessary to service our population. And once we have the administration in place and the new secretary and those waivers can be granted, we can do these things simultaneously.\n\nAs for the federal policy, you know, Minnesota was a leader, Lulu, before this law was enacted. We had 94 percent of our citizens who were insured. And those who didn't have insurance had access if they chose, the vast majority of them, under an available program. We had a pre-existing pool called MCHA, so if you had been denied because of a pre-existing condition, there was a option for you. We need to be able to go back and do those things. And the - as we move forward, I think, for the rest of the states, the federal solution might be just laying out criteria that the states must meet for their populations. They can...\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: But sir, there seems to be...\n\nEMMER: ...Design the program but lay out the criteria.\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: Sorry to interrupt - but there seems to be a lack of a clear plan, a clear way forward. The Democrats are saying - why completely scrap something that you don't have a plan to replace it with?\n\nEMMER: To the contrary, Lulu - I think that's the media's interpretation of the Democrats' agenda. I mean, this thing is a complete failure. It's denying Americans access to the health care that they need. What we're going to do is repeal this failed law and restore the decision-making authority to the states simultaneously through these waivers that will allow the states to do what they need to do to service their population.\n\nAnd then for the long term, you need to get Democrats and Republicans on board together to pass policies that will set criteria for the states that they must meet, whether that's a pre-existing pool or allowing your adult children to remain on your policy or other things. But you got to stop this one-size, top-down, fits-all solution from Washington, D.C., because it doesn't work.\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: Just briefly, sir - we only have a few seconds left - are you willing to work with the Democrats, though, to come up with a comprehensive plan?\n\nEMMER: Oh, absolutely. I mean, we aren't going to do this the way the Democrats did it - with no Republican input, with no Republican votes. You can't get something that lasts. You're going to have to have both Republicans and Democrats and everybody across this country finding solutions that work for the vast majority - for everyone in the country. And...\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: Congressman Tom Emmer of Minnesota, that's all we have time for. Thank you so much.\n\nCopyright © 2017 NPR. All rights reserved.

NAACP Plans To Push Back Against Trump's Racist Tweets\n\nThe NAACP convention in Detroit is creating strategies to make black votes count at a time when President Trump sends racist Tweets. Convention delegates are aiming the pitch to younger voters.\n\nNOEL KING, HOST:\n\nThe NAACP is holding its national convention in Detroit today. It's going to host some of the Democratic presidential candidates. Leaders of that group have called for President Trump to be impeached. They say they're going to push back hard against a president who tweets racist remarks. From member station WDET, Quinn Klinefelter has the story.\n\nQUINN KLINEFELTER, BYLINE: It's a morning session here at the NAACP Convention, and a series of speakers are pushing unity. And though this group bills itself as nonpartisan, speakers like Michigan Congresswoman Brenda Lawrence tell the overwhelmingly African-American crowd that President Trump's tweets telling her colleagues of color to go back home crossed a line.\n\nBRENDA LAWRENCE: Sitting on the sideline, having a cup of coffee - those days has passed. This is a time where every black person in America has to know this is bigger than today. If we allow what's happening now to continue, all of the progress that we've made will be rolled back. And we'll be back to square one.\n\nKLINEFELTER: In the vast hallway outside the convention stage area, attendees are planning their strategy to try to defeat the 45th president of the United States. Delegate Claude Cummings Jr. says his Texas branch already has a plan to turn solidly red areas blue near his hometown of Houston. He says it's all about staying in close touch.\n\nCLAUDE CUMMINGS JR: We just didn't leave them alone after the last election cycle, after the presidential election. We kept talking with them about issues that were important to them. And it wouldn't - it hadn't been difficult with what 45 has been talking about to get people excited about going back to the polls again.\n\nKLINEFELTER: Further down the hallway, Delegate Diana Robertson says her branch near Philadelphia is already flooding voters with information about Republicans' opposition to Obamacare and raising the minimum wage. Robertson says they're especially targeting young, black voters.\n\nDIANA ROBERTSON: Because they're not always the generation who also listens to the news and all that. But they do do the tweeting. They see these things going on, and they are hearing about it. And think the more we just keep them informed, they'll be the energizers.\n\nKLINEFELTER: Across downtown Detroit in a hotel ballroom, that information campaign is well underway.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED PERSON: NAACP Youth and College Division, if you ready to fight, say yeah.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED CROWD: Yeah.\n\nKLINEFELTER: Hundreds of young people are watching huge video screens with topics like recognizing the signs of voter suppression. Outside the meeting, 21-year-old Armonee Jackson is compiling the information to share with students on the Arizona State campus.\n\nARMONEE JACKSON: When they hear these things and it's coming from one of their peers, it has a different effect than when they're hearing it from the media. So if there's more people like me who are talking to their friends and having these conversations with their friends, their friends are more likely to vote.\n\nKLINEFELTER: But nearby, 17-year-old Amari Brantley says his friends in Connecticut, who are preparing to become first-time voters, have a lot to think about.\n\nAMARI BRANTLEY: When you're thinking about who you want to vote for and why you want to vote for them, that kind of can take a toll on your life.\n\nKLINEFELTER: Looking at the president's tweets, Brantley understands why some of his friends are a bit frightened.\n\nBRANTLEY: He should be a role model. Nowadays, when you ask a child what they want to be when they grow up, you barely hear them say president anymore due to the fact of everything that he's done.\n\nKLINEFELTER: NAACP officials say that can change if a new occupant lives in the White House. And many of those attending this convention pledged to try to help make that happen. For NPR News, I'm Quinn Klinefelter in Detroit.\n\nCopyright © 2019 NPR. All rights reserved.

Republican Lawmakers Brace For Impact Of Renewed Push To Repeal Obamacare\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Andrew Harnik/AP Andrew Harnik/AP\n\nUpdated at 2:32 p.m. ET\n\nPresident Trump's decision to kick off a renewed battle to dismantle President Barack Obama's health care law stunned lawmakers on Capitol Hill, who will face the reckoning from voters if the administration's efforts to overturn the law succeed this time around.\n\nDemocrats overwhelmingly support the Affordable Care Act and introduced legislation this week to strengthen it, so the administration's decision to try to repeal it entirely was a political gift for a party eager to go on offense after the conclusion of special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation.\n\nSignaling a reversal of its earlier legal strategy, which was focused on only fighting parts of the health care statute, the Department of Justice late Monday filed a two-sentence letter in a pending federal case that now argued the entire law should be struck down.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., announced plans Wednesday to try to force a vote on an amendment to a disaster aid bill, under debate in the Senate this week, that would block funding for the Justice Department's work on that lawsuit aimed at dismantling the ACA. Let's see how our Republican colleagues will vote on this, he said.\n\nHealth care was the No. 1 motivating issue in the 2018 midterm elections that delivered Democrats a House majority. According to a Washington Post analysis of exit poll data from 69 battleground districts, health care emerged as the top issue for voters — besting Trump, the economy and immigration as priorities.\n\nFor Republicans, the renewed effort threatened to pick the scab of old political wounds. Maine Sen. Susan Collins, who is up for re-election in 2020, was one of the three Republican senators who helped defeat a last-ditch GOP effort in 2017 to repeal Obamacare. Collins told reporters Wednesday that she is vehemently opposed to the administration's decision. A spokeswoman said Collins is drafting a letter to Attorney General William Barr to voice her opposition to the effort.\n\nWhile Republicans and Trump campaigned for the better part of a decade against the health care law — the signature domestic achievement of the Obama presidency — the party never coalesced around an alternative policy that would provide insurance coverage to more Americans and protect coverage for those with pre-existing conditions.\n\nThe president continues to pick a fight on Twitter and at political rallies with the late Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., for his role in derailing the GOP's repeal effort, but his attacks do not accurately reflect the reality that there was never an alternative health care bill to vote on that could have passed Congress. McCain, Collins and Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, were all deeply skeptical of a strategy that threatened to negatively affect health care for millions of Americans without a clear plan to fix the damage uprooting the law would cause in practical terms.\n\nHealth care is an issue the president still wants to pursue. Trump huddled privately with Senate Republicans this week and told them it's an area in which the party has fallen short and he wants a win. The Republican Party will soon be known as the party of health care, Trump told reporters on Capitol Hill on Tuesday.\n\nOn Wednesday the president repeated his prediction that the GOP would be the party of great health care. He slammed the current law as a disaster and referred to the court case underway in federal court. He asserted that the case would do very well in the Supreme Court. And if the high court scrapped the law, he vowed, we will have a plan that's far better than Obamacare.\n\nSome GOP political strategists are skeptical. Dear GOP: When Democrats are setting themselves ablaze by advocating for the destruction of American health care, try to resist the temptation of asking them to pass the kerosene, tweeted Josh Holmes, a former chief of staff to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who is advising GOP campaigns in the 2020 elections.\n\nIt is a top-of-mind issue for voters; and for Republicans, having a health care plan is very important. I'm not sure that this was the right move to win back suburban voters who are obviously very concerned about pre-existing conditions, and what does that mean for them. But if this lights a fire under us to have a really good health care plan, maybe that's the silver lining here, another veteran Republican campaign strategist told NPR.\n\nWhit Ayres, a GOP pollster, maintained that the 2018 midterm results were driven more by demographic trends than by the health care issue.\n\nDemocrats had made it clear that they wanted to make health care a major issue in the 2020 election and this decision helps them in that effort. We will see how successful they are in absence of a court ruling. But it does help to shine a spotlight back for an issue that they believe will be helpful to them.\n\nNPR's Jessica Taylor contributed to this story.
Republicans Withdraw Graham-Cassidy Bill To Repeal Obamacare\n\nRepublican senators conceded Tuesday that their latest effort to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act does not have the votes. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's job may be in jeopardy after several failed attempts on health care.\n\nAILSA CHANG, HOST:\n\nThe Republicans' struggle to repeal the Affordable Care Act is over at least for this year. Senate Republicans now say they will not vote this week on their latest proposal to dismantle Obamacare. The bill was sponsored by Senators Lindsey Graham and Bill Cassidy, and it was the party's last hope ahead of a September 30 deadline. That's when Senate rules change, and Republicans will need more than 50 votes to pass health care legislation.\n\nNow Republicans will turn their attention to tax legislation. To explain what happens next on health care, NPR congressional correspondent Susan Davis joins us now. Hi, Sue.\n\nSUSAN DAVIS, BYLINE: Hey, Ailsa.\n\nCHANG: So Senate Republicans have tried and failed to pass four different proposals to end Obamacare. And yet one of the sponsors of this bill, Senator Lindsey Graham, says they are going to try again next year. How does he see that happening?\n\nDAVIS: So Graham's argument is not that their bill failed on the policy. It's that it failed on the process. He simply just didn't have enough time to get the votes ahead of that September 30 deadline. So his plan now is, he says, while Republicans pivot the rest of the year to tax legislation, he and Senator Cassidy and the White House are going to keep pushing the case for their bill. Not only does he want to try again next spring. Today he made the promise that it will pass in this Congress. Here's what he had to say.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nLINDSEY GRAHAM: We're going to get there. To my Republican colleagues, we're going to fulfill our promise to repeal and replace. To the American people, we're going to improve health care for you 'cause at the end of the day, that's the only promise that matters.\n\nDAVIS: You know, of course this fight does not get easier next year when it's an election year.\n\nCHANG: Right.\n\nDAVIS: I think despite that rosy outlook, the bottom line is, for Republicans today - was a bad day and potentially the last day of their effort to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act.\n\nCHANG: OK, now, Congress may still need to act on health care legislation this year to stabilize the insurance market. And there had been a bipartisan effort underway before Republicans made this last-ditch push for the Graham-Cassidy bill. Where does that bipartisan effort stand?\n\nDAVIS: That effort was being led by Senators Lamar Alexander of Tennessee and Patty Murray, Democrat of Washington. They were making progress, but those negotiations essentially stalled when they tried to pass the Graham-Cassidy bill. Murray today told reporters she wants to reignite those negotiations.\n\nBut the policy here isn't as much the problem as the politics. For a lot of Republicans to go immediately from trying to repeal Obamacare to an effort that essentially says that Obamacare is the law of the land is just not a vote that a lot of Republicans are interested in taking right now.\n\nCHANG: Right. President Trump has after past health care failures privately and publicly criticized Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. Do Senate Republicans feel the same way about McConnell?\n\nDAVIS: The short answer is no. It's obvious that the president does not have a great relationship with Mitch McConnell.\n\nCHANG: Right.\n\nDAVIS: That might get even worse today depending on what happens in an Alabama Senate race where McConnell and the president have endorsed a candidate, Senator Luther Strange, who might lose. I asked another senator, Senator John Kennedy of Louisiana, about how Republicans feel about Mitch McConnell. This is what he said.\n\nJOHN KENNEDY: No, this isn't Mitch's fault. This is the - the fault we got here is we've got too many people running around like a bunch of free-range chickens. That's the fault here. It's not Mitch's fault. This is the Senate. Every senator's an island unto himself or herself.\n\nDAVIS: And the math is that of those 51 islands - those being his Republican colleagues - they all have the support behind Mitch McConnell.\n\nCHANG: That's NPR's Sue Davis. Thanks, Sue.\n\nDAVIS: You bet.\n\nCopyright © 2017 NPR. All rights reserved.

I'll Work With The Other Side When It Makes Sense, Hagedorn Says\n\nSteve Inskeep talks to Representative-elect Jim Hagedorn of southern Minnesota about what he hopes to see from his first term in Congress. Hagedorn, a Republican, capture a Democratic seat.\n\nSTEVE INSKEEP, HOST:\n\nThe House of Representatives operates under a basic reality of power. The rules ensure that the majority party, if it is unified, has almost all the power. The minority has almost no power unless the majority is divided. For eight years, House Republicans had the majority. They passed dozens of repeals of Obamacare, which never became law, along with tax cuts and many other measures that did. Now they prepare for that minority role just in time for Jim Hagedorn to join them. In a big Democratic year, the Republican captured a Democratic seat in southern Minnesota, and he's in our studios. Congressman-elect, welcome.\n\nJIM HAGEDORN: It's great to be here. Thank you.\n\nINSKEEP: How do you see your role in the minority?\n\nHAGEDORN: Well, you're going to go out and stand for what you believe and try to reflect the views and values of the people of southern Minnesota. That's what I'm sent out here to do. We'll have ideas that might conflict with what the majority believes. But, you know, the House is going to be Democrat. The Senate is Republican. The president is going to negotiate with both. There'll be compromise back and forth. We'll see how it goes.\n\nINSKEEP: You said representing the views and values of Minnesota. That's interesting because while you represent a mostly rural district that was clearly conservative enough to elect you, it was represented by a Democrat up to now, and it's a blue state. Do you think that your constituents expect you to work with the other side?\n\nHAGEDORN: When it makes sense, sure. I mean, if somebody has a good idea, I'll support it. But, you know, we want to come out here and make sure the country is strong with secure borders. My goal is to continue to try to make reforms in government so the economy can expand - reforms with regulations, taxes, energy, welfare and then health care - and then finally protect the God-given rights - the right to life, right to keep and bear arms, right to religious freedom...\n\nINSKEEP: You just...\n\nHAGEDORN: ...And lastly a sustained agriculture in our rural (ph) way of life.\n\nINSKEEP: You just said taxes. I saw a note the other day that the federal budget deficit is on its way up to something like $1.38 trillion or pretty close to that. Is this a circumstance where you'd want to be lowering taxes?\n\nHAGEDORN: Well, I'd want to make sure we have individual tax reform so the code is fairer, simpler and flatter for all, make sure that people can save, spend, hold, invest their own money the way they see fit. We'll see what proposals the Democrats have on taxes. And as far as the debt, we need to reform every agency of government. That's kind of my background. I was here for a time, and we've reformed a Treasury agency and saved a couple billion dollars. We need to do that across the board.\n\nINSKEEP: But I'm thinking, you know, in the '80s, Ronald Reagan cut taxes and realized the deficit had gone way out of control and signed a tax increase. Do you think you might have to do that?\n\nHAGEDORN: Well, you know, if you look back in the '80s, the deficit did go up, but revenues were at record as well. The problem was spending followed and then some. So in this case, we're seeing record revenues. The government needs to spend within its means. We're going to have to make reforms across the board and try to contain that spending.\n\nINSKEEP: So let's be real about the politics of this situation.\n\nHAGEDORN: Sure.\n\nINSKEEP: Republicans were knocked out of power. They would like to be back in power. They would like to support President Trump - most of them would. Chris Collins, one of your new colleagues - he's a veteran congressman - was speaking to CNN the other day, and he said, quote, when you're in the minority, your job is just to vote no to what goes on.\n\nHAGEDORN: (Laughter).\n\nINSKEEP: Is that your job?\n\nHAGEDORN: Well, I'd probably - you know, we have two world views right now, the Republicans and the Democrats. And the Democrats are far left, and Republicans are conservative, to be quite honest. So they're probably going to propose a lot of ideas that we will fundamentally disagree with. And we'll voice our displeasure and offer motions to recommit and things like that. But like I said, the House is Democrat. The Senate's Republican. The president's going to negotiate with both. I think there'll be some back and forth.\n\nINSKEEP: We should note also the group of incoming freshmen. There are dozens of you. It's a really, really diverse group overall - but almost entirely diverse on the Democratic side, lots of women, lots of people of color. And now on the Republican side, you may end up with Young Kim, a Korean-American. Her election is not quite decided yet. But when you look at the picture, it's way less diverse - overwhelmingly white, one woman so far. How do you address that?\n\nHAGEDORN: Yeah. Well, there's lots of ladies, for instance, that ran for election, unfortunately didn't win. You know, when it came to the general election, some of them lost in primaries. This is just the way it is. I mean, in our race, we had a state senator who happened to be female run against me in the primary. But we have been pretty established, and we won it quite handily. I think it's - those things go in cycles. Hopefully, the best people will step up and keep running and fighting for what we believe in.\n\nINSKEEP: Do you need, in some way, to reach out to people who are different than what your group of freshmen mostly is?\n\nHAGEDORN: Well, I think you're out here to represent all of America and all of your district. And so as long as you're true to your beliefs and true to what you told the voters you're going to do, that's the most important thing.\n\nINSKEEP: I have to note something because, as you know, the Internet is forever. And when you've run for office, you've sometimes been criticized for remarks you made in blogs years ago that appear to be very critical of women in public office. You referred to two U.S. senators as undeserving bimbos in tennis shoes. You referred to the Supreme Court nominee Harriet Miers with a phrase that seemed to suggest she was only nominated for being a woman. Do you think a lot of women are promoted in politics just for their gender?\n\nHAGEDORN: No, I think they stand up for what they believe in. You know, people vote for them on the merits.\n\nINSKEEP: Do you stand by those remarks in the past?\n\nHAGEDORN: No. I talked about that, you know, four years ago. They brought this up 2008, '10, '12, whatever...\n\nINSKEEP: Oh, because you've run for offices in the past, sure, yeah. And what did you say then?\n\nHAGEDORN: Well, in 2014, we just addressed it and said I understand it's political satire, and, you know, some of it's taken a little bit out of context and twisted, you know, so I said apologize for it.\n\nINSKEEP: But it's an interesting - it's an interesting moment now because you will enter this body - this national body - as a full member and the speaker is a woman. It's an interesting situation to be in.\n\nHAGEDORN: I saw her last night.\n\nINSKEEP: Oh, yeah?\n\nHAGEDORN: I congratulated her, yeah.\n\nINSKEEP: What do you think of Nancy Pelosi?\n\nHAGEDORN: Well, she's very liberal.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nHAGEDORN: So on most of the ideas, we disagree.\n\nINSKEEP: Can you envision a crisis where you could imagine members of this House of Representatives getting together and saying, you know, something is important going on in the country here, we need to vote the same way, we need to set aside some of our differences?\n\nHAGEDORN: I hope that will be the case on a number of issues, transportation issues and other things. And we should be addressing the debt, but we'll have to see. Like you said, the House of Representatives is a body that's controlled by one vote more than half. And right now, the Democrats have the power. We'll see how they exercise it.\n\nINSKEEP: Well, Congressman-elect, thanks for coming by, really appreciate you taking the time to talk.\n\nHAGEDORN: Appreciate your time.\n\nINSKEEP: Jim Hagedorn is the representative-elect from a district in southern Minnesota and one of the incoming House freshmen.\n\nCopyright © 2018 NPR.

Supreme Court Upholds Travel Ban\n\nBy a 5 to 4 majority, the Supreme Court upheld a modified version of President Trump's travel ban. This was the third version of the ban; Trump narrowed its scope and added non-Muslim countries.\n\nSTEVE INSKEEP, HOST:\n\nA signature part of President Trump's campaign and a signature moment of his first days in office has now received validation from the U.S. Supreme Court. By a 5-4 majority, the court upheld a modified version of the president's travel ban, which stops most travel from several countries. This was the third version of the ban twice struck down by courts as the president narrowed its scope and added a non-Muslim country. He had originally called for an end to Muslim travel to the United States. NPR White House correspondent Scott Horsley is going to begin our coverage. Hey there, Scott.\n\nSCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: Good to be with you, Steve.\n\nINSKEEP: So how did John Roberts, the chief justice, justify the ruling in favor of the travel ban?\n\nHORSLEY: Well, he said that the Immigration and Naturalization Act exudes deference to the president. You might remember that in - when the first version of the travel ban was put forward, the Trump administration was making that argument, that decisions that the president made concerning who could come into the country were not even subject to judicial review. John Roberts does not go that far, but he does say that this is an area where the president has broad authority that's been delegated to him by Congress, and that in exercising version three of the travel ban, the president was acting within that authority.\n\nINSKEEP: You know, two things occur to me as you're talking, Scott, and one is that John Roberts, the chief justice, has made a pattern of exercising deference to whoever is president. He, at one point, upheld Obamacare, and it appeared to be a key factor there, was letting the president do what he wants to do. And Congress, since World War II especially, has given tons of authority to the president in national security situations. And that's what the court found this was, was a national security judgment.\n\nHORSLEY: That's right. And again, this was version 3.0 of the travel ban, the version that the administration adopted last September. And as you point out, they did add two non-Muslim countries to the list - North Korea and Venezuela. Justice Roberts actually sidestepped the question about whether this was largely motivated by anti-Muslim animus as telegraphed by the president during his campaign when he called for an outright ban on Muslim...\n\nINSKEEP: Total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States is the way the president phrased it then.\n\nHORSLEY: That's right. What John Roberts said was is the issue before us is not whether to denounce those statements by the president but the significance of those statements in reviewing a presidential directive that he called neutral on its face. So this travel ban, by the third version, they had neutralized any anti-Muslim animus. And so in the majority decision, the five-person majority decision, they didn't even really address the question of whether there was a religious establishment issue here - very different in the twin dissents, which came down in a different place on that question.\n\nCopyright © 2018 NPR.

Republican Hard-Liners Oppose Health Care Plan Led By Paul Ryan\n\nSome conservative members of Congress and activists who bedeviled GOP leadership during the Obama administration are back again in opposition to the health care plan led by House Speaker Paul Ryan.\n\nAUDIE CORNISH, HOST:\n\nNow to Congress where a group of conservatives is trying to block the Republican leaders' plan to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. Now, this right-wing block has challenged party leadership before, frequently. These days, though, it risks crossing the president. As NPR congressional correspondent Susan Davis reports, this familiar confrontation could derail his attempts to deliver on a signature campaign pledge.\n\nSUSAN DAVIS, BYLINE: House Speaker Paul Ryan sounded a little annoyed today at the suggestion that some of his Republican colleagues don't like their emerging health care plan. There's no surprises here, Ryan says. It's exactly what Republicans campaigned on.\n\nPAUL RYAN: We told America, here's our vision for how we replace Obamacare after we repeal Obamacare. That's the bill we're working on right now. That's the bill we're working on with the Trump administration.\n\nDAVIS: Republicans have not released a bill, but the core of the proposal under discussion would repeal the individual mandate and replace it with a refundable tax credit for individuals to buy insurance. And that's where the problems start.\n\nRAND PAUL: Conservatives aren't voting for that. So I think we should just brush that off the table. The whole thing coming out of the House - just completely start over.\n\nDAVIS: That's Kentucky Republican Senator Rand Paul. He's part of a trio of senators that includes Ted Cruz of Texas and Mike Lee of Utah who are threatening to take down the legislation in the Senate unless major changes are made. They argue that refundable tax credits are just another entitlement program. That means more federal spending. For Ted Cruz, it's a nonstarter.\n\nTED CRUZ: We should not focus on ideas that divide us and pull us apart. We don't have a big enough majority to be divided. We have to be united.\n\nDAVIS: Paul and South Carolina Congressman Mark Sanford have a competing health care proposal that also includes a tax credit, but it's not refundable. Their plan would let individuals pay less in taxes but not get any additional money back from the government. It may sound like a small difference but not to conservatives like Sanford.\n\nMARK SANFORD: And there is a world of divide, and I think this is a divide that's strong within the conference.\n\nDAVIS: Sanford's a member of the House Freedom Caucus, that same group of conservatives that has repeatedly clashed with party leaders over the agenda. With narrow GOP majorities in both chambers, these conservatives have the power to block a health care bill if they hold together. The speaker's office says the White House is on their side, and most Republicans believe the party will ultimately rally behind whatever President Trump supports. Here's Georgia Senator David Perdue.\n\nDAVID PERDUE: We're going to have a position, but you know, we're going to have a position that the White House will sign. And when that's - when they - when the White House weighs in on that, I think you'll see us all line up because we know how important this is to get this fixed.\n\nDAVIS: Republicans like North Carolina congressman Mark Walker say conservatives are confronting the new reality of governing. It's a lot harder to oppose a Republican president.\n\nMARK WALKER: That with a Republican administration, there has to be some consideration that there is some leniency as far as, ultimately, how do we partner; how do we move forward as opposed to just putting up a roadblock?\n\nDAVIS: But conservative activists don't see it that way. Adam Brandon is the president of FreedomWorks, a tea party-aligned group that wants to see Congress pass a bill more closely aligned with Rand Paul than Paul Ryan. FreedomWorks is preparing a lobbying push this month to try to move Congress in their direction. Brandon believes conservatives will oppose a health care plan if it's not conservative enough even if Trump supports it.\n\nADAM BRANDON: So most of these folks that I just mentioned in the House Freedom Caucus would rather lose if - than vote for a brand new entitlement that in their heart of hearts is not the answer.\n\nDAVIS: House leaders are moving forward, which means conservatives have a decision to make. Here's Mark Walker again.\n\nWALKER: I think it's really coming down to the next 10 to 14 days to be able to say, OK, either you're in or you're out.\n\nDAVIS: A bill could be unveiled as soon as next week.

Koch Brothers, Behind Tea Party Wave, Face Democrats' Rising Tide In 2018\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n\nEight years ago, the Koch brothers' network spent millions to help boost the Tea Party wave.\n\nIn 2010, the right benefited from historical trends: Midterm elections are traditionally disastrous for the president's party. Close to a decade later, the wave is rolling back in.\n\nYou're just going against the tide. You're going against history, which makes it a little tough, quipped network official Tim Phillips, president of the grassroots organization Americans For Prosperity.\n\nThe topic of how to defend the conservative majority was all the buzz over the past few days as some 550 well-heeled donors gathered at the palatial Renaissance Esmeralda near Palm Springs, Calif.\n\nThe energy that you saw [on the right in 2010] is on the left right now and the prospects are scary, donor Christopher Wright, the CEO of Liberty Oilfield Services, told NPR. We moved the freedom ball forward a fair bit in 2017, but that could come nearly to an end if Democrats take control of the House and/or the Senate. Very real chance that happens.\n\nThe network, which includes 700 high-dollar donors who contribute at least $100,000 annually, is a powerful force in the American political landscape promoting libertarian economic and social policies. And they're gearing up to spend big money — scowling in the face of what could be an electoral tsunami if history is a guide.\n\nFacing this challenging midterm environment, the Koch network will spend nearly $400 million over the 2018 cycle to defend conservative policy gains from last year. This is 60 percent higher than they spent in the 2016 election cycle, which included a presidential campaign.\n\nThis commitment is also an order of magnitude higher than what their network of conservative and libertarian donors contributed in the 2010 election — a campaign during which billionaire brothers Charles and David Koch burst into the national consciousness as villains for the left, due to their millions in funding for free market causes.\n\nIt all seems so quaint now. During the 2010 cycle, the Koch network spent a comparatively meager $125 million to influence American policy and politics.\n\nCautiously at first, the Koch network eventually embraced the Tea Party movement during its ascendence.\n\nThere was massive, massive opposition to Obamacare as it was in the works [in 2009 and 2010]... that definitely got the conservative grassroots really amped up and energized to knock on doors to get the message out, and ultimately to hold elected officials accountable for a poor decision, said Koch network spokesman James Davis. Now is a very different environment. But there's still enthusiasm [on the right], I don't want to overlook that.\n\nTheir plan this year is to drive the right's enthusiasm up by highlighting the GOP-controlled Congress' only major legislative achievement — a massive tax cut bill, which also zeroed out Obamacare's individual mandate.\n\nIn [the Obama] years, we were really explaining just how terrible Obamacare was... our job [now] is to explain why these tax reforms are benefitting a lot of people, why getting good judges through helps the quality of life in America, why veterans administration reforms protects one of our most precious assets, Phillips said, regarding the about-face change in circumstances.\n\nThe Koch network plans to spend at least $20 million on telling voters about the benefits of Congress' tax legislation through paid television advertisements, digital efforts and town halls. And that's on top of the $20 million they already spent advocating for the tax efforts to pass.\n\nThe Tea Party protests in 2010 were driven by anger at government spending and the perceived flaws of the health care law. But with Republicans in power, the energy has diminished from that movement's heyday. Gone are the raucous rallies, and in many places Tea Party marches have been replaced by events like the Women's March.\n\nThere's this emotional component [to supporting tax reform] there that's every bit as emotional, every bit as powerful as the emotions around why Obamacare was so bad for people, Phillips insists. There's emotion on both sides, and our job is to make sure we drive that.\n\nBut the political right may soon confront, electorally, how much harder it is to take credit than it is to cast blame.\n\nIt's a more sophisticated sell, which means it's a harder sell, Wright said.\n\nThere's no denying that the momentum is with the other party — and they don't deny it.\n\nWe acknowledge the left is energized right now. There's no question about that. It's not just marches and such that they're doing. It's showing in some of the recent elections, Phillips said.\n\nAnd if they get swept away by a Democratic wave this November? The Koch network's spokesman argues that it is still worth spending hundreds of millions to blunt the left's momentum.\n\nWe're focused on the long term. A political committee or candidate might take that approach, of not spending money because they're inevitably going to lose, Davis said. Even in ads that we would run or efforts that we'd be making in the field today for a candidate, they're going to be around particular issues. So we're still educating, in that process, educating the American people on the principles and the values of how that particular public policy change will help improve their lives.\n\nIn opposition, the conservative movement was unified in its criticism of Obamacare. But the details of governing have highlighted fault lines that were less evident during the Obama administration.\n\nFree trade, once an orthodoxy on the right, is now in question. Comprehensive immigration reform, around which a large number of business-minded Republicans agreed was necessary, now seems like a distant memory.\n\nAnd then, of course, there is the matter of Trump.\n\nTrump gives [the left] plenty of fodder to oppose, and to arouse people's emotions, and to energize people. They probably have an easier sell this year than Republicans or 'Team Freedom' does. Wright said.\n\nIn tone and in policy, the Koch network draws a contrast with the Trump administration. And it is keeping with the network's early roots in the 2000s as a free-market voice challenging the Bush administration from the right, for what some conservatives saw as out-of-control government spending.\n\nThe president and the libertarian-leaning Koch network diverge on a number of areas, and the contrast is clear at the conference.\n\nThe Koch network preaches openness on immigration (immigrants are essential to the success of our country, said one official); a respect for the press (essential for a free and open society, another official preached to the hundreds of assembled activists); and a second chance for felons (the criminal justice system is morally indefensible, constitutionally dubious and fiscally ruinous, according to a top Koch network lawyer).\n\nBut network officials don't much want to directly discuss the president. They shake off questions about Trump's rhetoric and popularity; and pivot to talking about, well, tax cuts.\n\nWe don't get involved in personalities, and all the other stuff. That's just not what we do as a network. We focus on explaining to you the problems with certain policies... or we focus on, 'Hey these are good policies, and here's why they're good,' Phillips said.\n\nEditor's note: Nine years ago, this reporter received a ten-week fellowship with what was then a Koch-affiliated organization, the Institute for Humane Studies at George Mason University.
The Man Who Argued Health Care For Obama Looks Back As He Steps Down\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Evan Vucci/AP Evan Vucci/AP\n\nAs the U.S. Supreme Court heads into the homestretch of its current term, Donald Verrilli, the federal government's chief advocate, will not be there.\n\nAfter five years as solicitor general, he is turning over the reins to his successor, leaving a job he describes as reaching the mountaintop of American law.\n\nThe day after Verrilli announced his resignation, he sat down with me in his office for what amounted to an exit interview. It's a relatively small and unillustrious office, with boring government furniture, but its view straight down Pennsylvania Avenue to the Capitol is one of the most spectacular in Washington.\n\nDuring his tenure, the seventh longest in U.S. history, Verrilli has had a particularly difficult task: Representing a liberal Democratic administration before a Supreme Court dominated by a conservative, sometimes openly hostile, majority.\n\nLooking back, he concedes that in the beginning he was perhaps too deferential to the Court.\n\nWhat I decided over time, however, was that I could be respectful of the justices... and still be more aggressive, he said. I think I turned the dial about a quarter of the way.\n\nAnd sometimes more than that. At one point during a recent argument, Verrilli found himself shaking a finger at one of the justices in frustration. Recognizing the tell-tale body language, he quickly curled the finger under.\n\nHis worst moment before the Court was on the second day of a three-day oral argument over the constitutionality of Obamacare. He had completed seven practice sessions in the run-up to the argument. It was now day two on the actual hot seat and his voice was all but shot.\n\nHe was less than a minute into his opening when his voice failed him. He coughed, paused to take a drink of water, and stopped, as an awkward silence washed over the courtroom, followed by a soft, Excuse me.\n\nListen To Verrilli's Obamacare Moment 1:48\n\nVerrilli remembers this as an excruciating moment.\n\nMy throat kinda seized up a bit, so I took a sip of water, and it went down the wrong way, and I just literally couldn't get words out for a little bit, he remembers. And not surprisingly, I guess, my attention sort of wavered. I lost my focus.\n\nBy the end of nearly an hour fielding questions from the justices, Verrilli thought he had clawed his way back into the driver's seat.\n\nBut once I got back after the argument, he said, the roof basically was caving in around me.\n\nHe was hurled into the center of a media firestorm. CNN's Jeffrey Toobin called Verrilli's performance a train wreck for the Obama administration. Fox News reported that the solicitor general was under fire, stammering and coughing his way through oral arguments Tuesday. And Mother Jones called it a spectacular flameout.\n\nThe Republican National Committee even produced a commercial, featuring edited audio of Verrilli's pauses and stutters. The ad concluded, ObamaCare: It's a Tough Sell.\n\nIt was rough to go through that, Verrilli says now. But a couple of good things came out of that for me. You know, one was recognizing that at the end of the day, you can't have your sense of self-worth depend on what people outside are saying. I probably would have been better off had I learned that lesson earlier in life, but at least I got to learn it.\n\nIn the end, he was vindicated, and in more ways than most people knew. Not only did the Court uphold the health care law; it did so with Verrilli's reasoning. The decisive fifth vote came from Chief Justice John Roberts, who concluded that ultimately Obamacare was not a mandate, but a tax on those who don't get insurance.\n\nVerrilli had insisted on including that argument in the Government's legal brief, and he fought some on the White House staff who didn't want to characterize the law as a tax. White House officials ultimately bowed to his view, in large part because they had come to respect his judgment.\n\nI think it's a little ironic but I do think my ability to have that independence came from the fact that I worked there before I came over here.\n\nVerrilli entered the administration in 2009 as an official in the Justice Department, but he was soon snapped up by the White House to serve as deputy counsel to the president. His White House connection prompted some concern among Republicans when he was named solicitor general, concern that Verrilli would be too political in the post. In fact, Verrilli says now that the effect was exactly the opposite, because the White House politicos knew and trusted him.\n\nThey largely left me alone and let me run the office in the way I thought best, to exercise the authority of the office the way that I thought best for the United States, he recalls. I think it's a little ironic but I do think my ability to have that independence came from the fact that I worked there before I came over here.\n\nThe job of solicitor general is not all guts and glory. Among other things, even though the government wins far more cases than it loses in the trial courts, it still loses about 2,000 cases a year. The SG, as he is known, must look at each one of those to determine which losses will be appealed.\n\nIf you do the math, if I work 300 days a year, I'm looking at six or seven of these every single day, and we make very careful judgments about that, he said.\n\nThese and other duties made it impossible for Verrilli to do what he did in private practice — set aside two or three whole weeks to prepare for a Supreme Court argument. But there were offsetting advantages, he observed.\n\nFor example, in 2013, he argued a case testing whether a company that isolates a gene can patent it. This was a case of enormous importance in law and medicine, since it meant that if the company won, it would remain the only company able to make and sell a test for a particular cancer gene, and other companies would rush to patent other genes.\n\nAt the heart of the case was a question of genetics and biochemistry, which, as Verrilli puts it, was not so good for me because the last science class I took, I was a junior in high school.\n\nWhat he could do, though, was call up Francis Collins, the director of the National Institutes of Health, and formerly the head of the Human Genome Project.\n\nCollins came to all of Verrilli's practice sessions in preparation for the argument, and offered reinforcements.\n\nHe sent a team of three genius scientists down here to this office with a whiteboard, and they sat here for three hours and they gave me a tutorial on genetics and biochemistry, Verrilli remembers. And darned if at the end of that three hours I didn't understand the issue, and I could go in there and make an effective argument.\n\nAnd darned if the Supreme Court didn't side with the federal government, and adopt the very position Verrilli put forth.\n\nVerrilli won't be in court for the last day of the term to hear how the final momentous cases he argued will turn out. He's headed for a vacation in — where else for a Verrilli — Italy.\n\nAs to the opinions constituting the denouement of the Supreme Court term? He says he looks forward to reading them. In Tuscany.
Politics In Real Life: Rising Health Care Costs Weigh On Voters\n\ntoggle caption Courtesy of Renee Powell\n\nWhen the health insurance premiums got to the point that they were higher than her mortgage, Renee Powell started to become cynical.\n\nThere was something in me that just kind of switched, said the mother of two from Bartlesville, Okla. I was OK with paying $750, but when it became about $100 more than my housing costs, it upset me.\n\nPowell is an epidemiologist and used to work for the state in Oklahoma City. She had affordable insurance through that job.\n\nBut when her husband graduated from dental school, she stopped working, and the family moved to their current home, about 10 miles from the Kansas border.\n\nShe shopped for insurance through the Obamacare exchange and learned that rates in her new area were much higher than they had been in Oklahoma City. She bought a health plan from Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Oklahoma for $750 a month with a manageable deductible.\n\nThen last year Blue Cross eliminated that plan — which is pretty common as insurers adjust to the Obamacare markets — and Powell was forced to buy the more expensive policy with a deductible of $3,000 for each person in her family. The insurance pays for checkups and prescriptions, but if anyone gets sick, Powell has to pay the full doctor bill until the deductibles are met.\n\nInsurance Just Isn't Enough\n\nWhile the Affordable Care Act managed to bring basic health insurance to almost everyone in the country — about 90 percent of Americans are covered — for many people it's not enough.\n\nRising deductibles and copayments can mean people don't get much benefit from paying monthly premiums. A recent study from the Kaiser Family Foundation shows deductibles rose about eight times faster than wages in the past 10 years.\n\nThat's taking a toll on people like Powell, even though they have insurance.\n\nThe nature of insurance has been changing over the last decade, to the point where people's out-of-pocket costs are becoming a real struggle, said Larry Levitt of the Kaiser Family Foundation. More people are insured, but in many ways people are not insured enough.\n\nHigh-deductible plans like Powell's, he said, are now the norm.\n\nPowell has spent about $4,400 so far this year in premiums for that Blue Cross policy, and she said the plan has only paid a few dollars for antibiotics one of her boys needed when he was sick.\n\nI felt like we were paying money to the insurance company so that they could just sit on it and put it in stock, she said.\n\nNow she and her husband are planning to buy insurance through his dental business, which is over the border in Kansas, where, for some reason, policies are much cheaper.\n\nSurprise Costs\n\nIt's not just individual policies that are getting costly.\n\nMelody Simon, a biomedical research project manager who lives in Detroit, is struggling to pay her bills, even though she has insurance through her work.\n\nSimon was born with a birth defect that has required her to undergo seven surgeries. She needs medication and physical therapy.\n\nHer insurance seems generous on its face — moderate copays and a $1,000 deductible for in-network care.\n\n\n\nBut her costs are also shooting skyward, in part because she moved last year to Detroit from Austin, Texas, and her insurance plan isn't as popular in her new city.\n\nIt takes hours to find a provider that's not an hour away, that accepts my insurance and can also see me for my particular condition, she said.\n\nShe found a good doctor — in network — who performed her most recent surgery in December. But when she went back to see him at a different hospital for a cortisone shot to ease the pain in her arthritic foot — something she'd done many times back in Texas for about $40 — she was in for a surprise.\n\ntoggle caption Courtesy of Melody Simon\n\nIt was like I was going into surgery. They brought me into the operating room and everything. And of course in my mind I'm like, 'What is all this pomp and circumstance for an injection?'  she recalled. Of course, I should have known it was going to cost something ... and it did.\n\nIt cost her $832.96.\n\nSimon's recovery from her December surgery has not gone well, and she's out of work on disability — which means she's only getting about 60 percent of her former salary. She's become totally dependent on her partner to get to physical therapy appointments and pay her bills.\n\nNow they've decided to get married, just so Simon can get on her partner's health insurance, which is more generous than her own.\n\nShe said she hates the fact that they've made such a big decision for financial reasons.\n\nI don't think marriage should be an economic choice, she said. It's pretty exciting, but I just wish this wasn't the circumstance that brought it about.\n\nA recent poll from NPR, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and Harvard's T.H. Chan School of Public Health showed that 26 percent of people say health care costs are still a very or somewhat serious problem for them or their families.\n\nThose rising costs are not providing people with a sense of better care. According to that same poll, 45 percent say the cost of their health insurance premium has increased and 35 percent say their copays and deductibles have risen in the past two years, even though just 16 percent say their benefits have improved during that same time.\n\nAnd voters are concerned as well. Almost 20 percent of Democrats and 12 percent of Republicans ranked health care as one of their top two concerns in the upcoming presidential election, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. The economy and jobs were the top issue in both parties.\n\nThe candidates for the White House have an array of ideas to deal with the issue:\n\nDemocrats\n\nBernie Sanders has proposed Medicare for All, which would give everyone free access to health care — meaning out-of-pocket costs would disappear altogether.\n\nBut that would come with a price tag: tax increases of 2.2 percent for individuals and 6.2 percent for employers. The Sanders campaign says that would save most people a lot of money in the end, while shifting the burden of health costs to wealthy taxpayers.\n\nBut some critics — even many left-leaning economists — say his numbers don't add up and that the tax increases would have to be much higher.\n\nHillary Clinton's proposal builds on Obamacare, and some provisions attack out-of-pocket costs directly. Most significantly, she's proposing a refundable tax credit to cover costs that exceed 5 percent of a person's income. That could potentially help people like Renee Powell.\n\nClinton also proposes capping costs for prescriptions, trying to limit how much premiums can rise and protecting people from surprise bills like Melody Simon got after her cortisone injection.\n\nRepublicans\n\nAll three Republican candidates want to repeal Obamacare.\n\n\n\nDonald Trump says he'll cut people's costs by allowing them to deduct the cost of insurance premiums from their taxes and to put more money in a tax-deferred health savings account to pay for health care expenses.\n\nHe also wants to allow insurers to sell policies in any state, rather than only in those states where they are licensed.\n\nTed Cruz is also a proponent of this idea.\n\n\n\nBoth candidates say the increased competition will reduce insurance premiums so people can afford better policies. But some say this could lead to lower-quality insurance because some states have lower standards than others.\n\nJohn Kasich is proposing ways to cut overall health spending, which, he says, will lower costs for everyone. He's pointing to initiatives in Ohio where the state is changing the entire payment system — rather than paying for each service separately, the state is putting a single price on all the care needed for an illness. That means doctors and hospitals don't have any incentive to order excessive tests or medications.\n\nPowell and Simon both said they don't expect much from these candidates.\n\nI think it would help for them to know just how much this costs and what families are going through, Powell said. I'm slightly disillusioned with pretty much everybody in the race.\n\nEditor's Note: Politics in Real Life is a new NPR series looking at issues impacting people's lives and how they match up with rhetoric on the campaign trial.

A Recap Of A Busy Week For President Trump\n\nWe go over the stories of the week in politics, from Attorney General Jeff Sessions' recusal to President Trump's joint address, and look ahead to a revised travel ban and Obamacare repeal efforts.\n\nSCOTT SIMON, HOST:\n\nPresident Trump is in Florida again this weekend. He has stood by his attorney general, Jeff Sessions, over allegations Mr. Sessions deceived a Senate committee when he denied meeting with any Russian official during last year's campaign, although he met with Russia's ambassador to the United States. And early this morning, the president posted tweets that accuse the Obama administration of wiretapping his phones in Trump Tower during last year's election. There is no evidence of this. NPR's Ron Elving joins us. Ron, thanks so much for being with us.\n\nRON ELVING, BYLINE: Good morning, Scott.\n\nSIMON: What do we know about these tweets today? By the way, we noticed tap is spelled with two Ps.\n\nELVING: Yes, in at least one instance. We know these are coming from the president. It's a series of tweets from the president's Twitter account at dawn this morning, and there's no reason to doubt it is coming from the president himself, who is in Florida at Mar-a-Lago. It is not clear, however, where the president is getting this notion, but he says, he, quote, just found out, unquote.\n\nAnd we don't know yet quite where it's coming from, but it appears perhaps to be a response to a narrative that's been in breitbart.com, the right-wing website that was previously published by Steve Bannon, the president's senior adviser. And there you will find a narrative about how the Obama administration was so intent on thwarting Donald Trump last fall that they had much of the intelligence community doing everything it could to gather skullduggery information about Donald Trump and that that would have included, according to Donald Trump, wiretapping his phones. But there does not seem to be any direct evidence of that, as you said.\n\nSIMON: Well, let's go on to other events of the week. Jeff Sessions, the attorney general, announced he'll recuse himself from, quote, any existing or future investigations of any matter relating in any way to the campaigns for president of the United States. He also said he'll answer questions from Senate Democrats in writings - writing, rather - about his meetings with the Russian ambassador. Will that put this to rest?\n\nELVING: No, this will not be put to rest any time soon. Those written questions from the committee are going to have to be answered and going to have to be parsed. And, of course, now we have taken all of this to another level because of the president accusing his predecessor of conducting some sort of campaign against him, which is clearly in response to the whole Sessions matter and previous to that, of course, the Michael Flynn matter. He was the national security adviser who was forced to resign by the president after it was revealed that he had had contacts with the Russian ambassador that he had mischaracterized.\n\nSo it's not going to go away as a larger issue - the whole Russia connection. And, clearly, it's bothering the president because last night he tweeted out a bunch of pictures of Chuck Schumer meeting Vladimir Putin and Nancy Pelosi at a meeting with a bunch of Russians and, you know, saying that these people are hypocrites and that they had contacts with the Russians. So it's not going away.\n\nBut there is a moment of relief that at least Jeff Sessions has recused himself from, in some sense or another, overseeing the investigation into all of this by the Department of Justice, by the FBI, if there is going to be such an investigation. So now that'll be conducted by a deputy of his who's coming up for a confirmation hearing this very week on Tuesday. His name is Rod Rosenstein, and he is a longtime U.S. attorney. And he is a respected figure and perhaps the best man for this job. We'll see how things go on Tuesday.\n\nSIMON: We should explain. Both Senator Schumer and Representative Pelosi said there's nothing secret about those meetings. That's why there were pictures.\n\nELVING: That's why there are pictures of them all laughing and that sort of thing.\n\nSIMON: President got good reviews for his remarks on Tuesday. Political analysts, who can sound like theater critics, said that he looked presidential. Does any jump he'd get in the polls get undone when the president undertakes one of these tweets storms?\n\nELVING: It's conceivable. It's hard to know exactly what makes the polls go up and down. And, of course, we've all learned to take the grain - take the polls with a grain or two of salt. And we know, however, that this is a barometer of a president's power. So members of Congress who are waiting for instructions on a lot of issues from the president are watching those polls, as well. He did get a little boost from this, but not as much as he would have gotten if it could have remained the focus of the news for the rest of the week, which, of course, it did not.\n\nSIMON: I - do you expect a re-drafted travel ban to be issued this week?\n\nELVING: Yes. And I think they want to hang tough on what they had ordered before, and they want to accomplish what they were trying to accomplish before and really block refugees. But they're also going to be a little more careful this time around with how they treat green card holders - that's legal permanent residents - so that they don't get hung up. And they may also be a little more inclined to give warnings to the enforcement people so that they know what's coming. So all of this will probably be handled a good deal better, and that will probably fly with the federal courts. We'll see what's in the order, and we'll see how the courts respond.\n\nSIMON: NPR's Ron Elving - thanks so much for being with us, Ron.\n\nELVING: Thank you, Scott.\n\nCopyright © 2017 NPR.

Biden Agenda To Face The Challenges Of A Closely Divided Congress\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Carolyn Kaster/AP Carolyn Kaster/AP\n\nPresident-elect Joe Biden said Friday, as ballots were still being tabulated in states across the country, that voters had spoken loudly to embrace the policies and principles he campaigned on.\n\nThey have given us a mandate for action on COVID and the economy and climate change and systemic racism, Biden said in a late-night speech in Wilmington, Del. They made it clear they want the country to come together — not pull apart.\n\nBiden followed Saturday night by calling on Democrats and Republicans to come together after the election and pledged to join them.\n\nAnd I believe that this is part of the mandate from the American people. They want us to cooperate, Biden said. That's the choice I'll make. And I call on the Congress — Democrats and Republicans alike — to make that choice with me.\n\nLoading...\n\nBut Biden, who secured enough votes to win the Electoral College on Saturday morning, will face a narrowly divided Congress when he takes office in January. Biden's significant lead in the popular vote did not translate to a Democratic wave in the House and Senate, leaving Biden without the votes necessary to pursue an aggressive legislative agenda in Congress.\n\nDemocrats maintained control of the House of Representatives but the GOP made gains, picking up at least five seats in the election. Control of the Senate will remain undecided until early January following a pair of runoff elections in Georgia.\n\nRepublican reaction to Biden's victory has been muted as focus shifts to GOP efforts to defend incumbent Sens. Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue in those Georgia seats. So far, most Republican senators, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., have not congratulated Biden or acknowledged his victory.\n\nBut Democrats are already calling those races the linchpin that determines the success of Biden's agenda. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., used Biden's victory as a call to arms in the Georgia races.\n\nA Democratic majority in the U.S. Senate would be the biggest difference maker to help President-elect Biden deliver for working families across the country and in Georgia where, for too long, they have been denied the help they need by President Trump, Mitch McConnell and a Republican-led Senate, Schumer said in a statement. The best way to ensure that positive agenda can be carried out and deliver help to working families in Georgia and across the country is to elect Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff to the Senate.\n\nRepublicans, like Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, began framing a GOP Senate as a key check on progressive policies well before the final ballots were cast — a message that will likely be central in the campaigns in Georgia.\n\nDemocrats couldn't eliminate the filibuster and, you know, make D.C. a state — or Puerto Rico, Cornyn told NPR days before the election. So it would force the White House and the Senate to compromise and negotiate.\n\nRegardless of the outcome in Georgia, the victors will have a narrow majority in the Senate. And Democrats will be forced to contend with divisions within their own party on some of the biggest policy items on Biden's list.\n\nAmong the most controversial is a plan to combat climate change. Democrats themselves are not fully unified on how to approach the issue. Divisions over how quickly and aggressively to move to limit carbon emissions have simmered within the party since progressive lawmakers like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., introduced the Green New Deal — a plan to eliminate the carbon footprint by 2030 — back in 2019.\n\nBiden has proposed a $2 trillion plan to fight global warming that includes a vast expansion of solar and wind energy, a network of electric vehicle charging stations and a plan to reach zero net-emissions by 2050. But many moderate Democrats are skeptical of those plans and Republicans have mocked the proposal and successfully ran against the proposal in states like Texas and South Dakota.\n\nRepublican Sen. Mike Rounds, who was reelected this week in South Dakota, echoed a message that will likely dominate GOP pushback to many Biden proposals.\n\nWhen you think about what they're suggesting, with tax hikes and changes in our economy, they're talking about changes with regard to our energy activity, Rounds said late last month. They're talking about a 'Green New Deal,' which would cost $90 trillion over 10 years. We can't afford that. And most of us don't think that a President Biden could ever stop the far left from pushing that.\n\nPassing such a massive climate overhaul would require the kind of months- or years-long political investment that consumed Washington during former President Barack Obama's push to pass the Affordable Care Act in 2009. Such an effort is politically risky with full control of Washington and could be impossible if Republicans control the Senate.\n\nProgressive activists are also calling for Biden to move on another issue that divides the party, Medicare for All. Biden and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., both oppose the plan and instead want Obamacare expanded with a public option. But progressives argue that the party has shifted to embrace widespread government-sponsored health care.\n\nOcasio-Cortez tweeted shortly after Biden's victory was announced that every House Democrat who embraced the progressive health plan was reelected or is on track to be reelected.\n\nLike climate change, Medicare for All would be an all-consuming political effort in a time when the country is still struggling with a deadly pandemic.\n\nAnd Biden himself has promised to make COVID relief his first priority.\n\nI want everyone to know that on Day One, we are going to put our plan to control this virus into action, Biden said Friday. That can't save any of the lives that have been lost, but it will save a lot of lives in the months ahead.\n\nBiden has consistently promised that one of his top priorities will be to take immediate steps to combat and control the spread of the coronavirus, which has surged in recent weeks. His plan includes investing in expanded testing with a Pandemic Testing Board and a vast Public Health Jobs Corps as well as better tracing capacity and greater production and distribution of personal protective equipment. His plan also includes a plan to boost jobs to aid in economic recovery.\n\nIn his speech on Saturday, Biden said his administration's work would begin with managing the pandemic and pledged to begin the work as early as next week.\n\nOn Monday, I will name a group of leading scientists and experts as transition advisers to help take the Biden-Harris COVID plan and convert it into an action blueprint that starts on Jan. 20, 2021, Biden said. That plan will be built on a bedrock of science. It will be constructed out of compassion, empathy and concern.\n\nHis proposal is in line with policies included in several bills Democrats passed in the House. But Republicans have rejected two comprehensive coronavirus packages passed by the House.\n\nMcConnell has said strong jobs numbers released this month bolster his belief that any COVID-related legislation should be dramatically pared back from Democrats' plans.\n\nI think it reinforces the argument that I've been making for the last few months that something smaller — rather than throwing another $3 trillion at this issue — is more appropriate, McConnell told reporters this week in Kentucky. With it highly targeted towards things that are directly related to the coronavirus, which we all know is not going away until we get a vaccine.\n\nCongressional leaders say they hope to pass some COVID relief before the end of this year but Democrats have long insisted that they expect the economy will need further support in 2021.
Former President Obama Tells His Story His Way — And Makes His Case For History\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Crown Crown\n\nIn the spring of 2004, a young state legislator was driving home from a campaign event in rural Illinois when he got a phone call from Washington. A voice asked if he would be interested in giving the keynote address at the Democratic National Convention that summer in Boston.\n\nThat I felt neither giddy nor nervous said something about the sheer improbability of the year I'd just had, that legislator now recalls in his new memoir, A Promised Land.\n\nBack in 2004, Barack Obama took that opportunity to speak to the convention. Let's face it, he began. My presence on this stage tonight is pretty unlikely.\n\nAn improbable year? An unlikely presence? Obama was only beginning his high-speed elevator ride to the world stage. That night in Boston his voice, then still unfamiliar, was soon rising and ringing through the arena:\n\nThere are those who are preparing to divide us, the spin masters and negative ad peddlers who embrace the politics of anything goes. Well, I say to them tonight, there's not a liberal America and a conservative America — there's the United States of America.\n\nThereafter, Obama was the guy who gave that speech. He got elected to the U.S. Senate that fall and people in Washington were asking when he would run for president.\n\nHe tells us in this memoir that he has only watched the video of that night in Boston once, and he points out flaws in his performance. That will impress some as stunning humility and strike others as humble bragging or downright disingenuousness.\n\nThe 44th president of the United States has always prompted extremes of reaction. Though his nature may be to seek consensus, he has tended to inspire partisan aspiration for some and equally intense resentment for others. His ascent thrilled millions but also stirred a countermovement that is still on the march.\n\nOne wellspring of that movement, of course, was electing Obama's successor. The publishers of A Promised Land surely knew they were launching this sure-to-be blockbuster in the month when President Trump would either be reelected or rejected by the voters. They knew the mountain of memories compiled in these 700 pages would appear in a certain light, or shadow, depending on the voters' verdict.\n\nBut this is more than Obama's answer to four years of Trump's rhetorical assaults and policy reversals. It is a continuation of the story that the skinny kid with a funny name had begun to tell well before the world was listening.\n\nThe man and the memoirist\n\nObama began his literary career a quarter century ago, recalling the struggles of his youth while still in his early 30s in Dreams From My Father. A second volume discussed his rising political ambitions a dozen years later when The Audacity of Hope presaged his first run for the White House.\n\nNow, in A Promised Land, the man is approaching 60, recalling how his audacious dreams came true in 2008 and detailing the first 30 momentous months thereafter.\n\nTo a remarkable degree, the style of this latest retelling reflects the man we have seen over these years: Orderly, cautious, self-examining — yet eloquent in flashes so vivid that the world was immediately able to share something of his vision.\n\nOr at least much of the world was able to. Reliving this history through Obama's eyes reminds us how differently others reacted to his rise — how offended they were when he drew vast crowds in Europe while still a candidate for president — collecting the Nobel Peace Prize just for getting elected.\n\nWhatever one's feelings about this man, they are likely to be brought to the surface by this book. We hear his voice in every sentence, almost as if he were physically present and reading the book aloud.\n\nFor those who did not leap aboard the Obama bandwagon, much of his memoir will put them in mind of what put them off. To be sure, there were countless issues of policy on which to differ with the 44th president and many elements of his personality to judge for oneself. There were also, as he puts it, plenty of people who never got past being spooked by a Black man in the White House.\n\nBut for those who felt the magnetism and power of the first African American president, at any point in his career, this book should rekindle some of that feeling of discovery. For the truly faithful, some of these pages may have to be read through tears.\n\nReviewing the history\n\nObama begins this account by briefly revisiting his rather aimless adolescence, but he moves swiftly on from college identity crises to community organizing in Chicago to Harvard Law School. Soon he is back in Chicago, meeting Michelle Robinson at a law firm, working and making a life in the boom years of the 1990s.\n\nEmbedded throughout this dense text are frequent valentines addressed to Michelle. We see her as a smart young lawyer, assessing the trainee who will become her husband. They are soon involved, friends as well as co-workers, then lovers as well as spouses. They marry and have two careers and two daughters but also work at remaining a romantic couple.\n\nHe runs for office, aiming too high the first time and losing. He meets David Axelrod (who will be Axe the rest of the way), a former newspaper reporter who has become a political consultant and understands Chicago's complex racial politics. Obama wins a seat in Springfield, then an improbable promotion to Washington.\n\nMuch of the first 200 pages suggests a Hollywood biopic, with a lot of soft focus and camaraderie and heart-warming music. We meet the campaign's inner circle — Axe, campaign manager David Plouffe, Memo Master Pete Rouse, spokesman Robert Gibbs and aide de camp Reggie Love — and all the other buddies who keep the candidate loose and focused, like the crew Shakespeare sketched around Prince Hal.\n\nAt one point, Obama retells how his innermost circle thrashed out the decision to run for president in 2008. Michelle makes no secret of her reluctance. She finally asks him why he has to run when Hillary Clinton and so many other Democrats are running who are better known and more experienced.\n\nI know, her husband replies, that the day I raise my right hand and take the oath to be the president of the United States, the world will start looking at America differently. I know that kids all around this country — Black kids, Hispanic kids, kids who don't fit in — they'll see themselves differently too. ... And that alone ... that would be worth it.\n\nMichelle relents with: Well honey, that was a pretty good answer. It is only one of many times in the book that her devotion to her husband overcomes her deep aversion to politics. She appears often, not just to take a bow but to add her perspective and reveal what keeps her husband centered.\n\nHe also takes frequent opportunity to mention and share credit with the man he made his running mate back in the summer of 2008. From first reference forward, Joseph R. Biden Jr. is just Joe.\n\nObama writes: If I was seen as temperamentally cool and collected, measured in how I used my words, Joe was all warmth, a man without inhibitions, happy to share whatever popped into his head.\n\nBiden reappears at crucial moments in the narrative, helping to sell the Senate on the Recovery Act and also on what swiftly came to be called Obamacare. He is there in foreign policy debates as well, often as a contrarian.\n\nGoverning as grinding\n\nThe campaign story has a happy ending. The rest of the book does not really have an ending at all. The author relives the first part of his presidency, recounting not so much a rise and fall as a battle against the unexpected and a struggle for equilibrium.\n\nAfter the uplift of the throngs on Inauguration Day, we settle into the rhythm that will govern the bulk of the book — the relentless beat of governing. Much has to be done, many people must be met and accommodated. Meetings segue into more meetings. Nothing is ever easy, or really finished or quite what it seems.\n\nAs a writer, Obama manages to convey the grinding work of his first years in office without losing forward momentum. First, we see endless negotiations pull the economy back from the brink of a crash in early 2009, but it's a slog for the reader as it was for the policymakers. Then it's on to the Herculean efforts needed to haul the Affordable Care Act across the finish line in March 2010.\n\nAlong the way, Obama encounters united resistance from Republicans and dissatisfaction among Democrats. The economy survives the mortgage security and credit crisis, but big Wall Street banks and bankers are seen getting off easy. Health insurance is expanded, but without a single payer government system or a public option to choose one.\n\nObama gets to know the players in Congress, starting with the gruff and rough-edged Harry Reid of Nevada, the Senate Democratic leader who urges his young star to run for president in 2008.\n\nThe cast of Obama intimates keeps expanding, including chiefs of staff Rahm Emanuel (later mayor of Chicago) and then William Daley (brother and son of Chicago mayors). There are Republican leaders in Congress such as John Boehner in the House and Mitch McConnell in the Senate, the latter looming up again and again for his strategies and tactics against nearly all Obama's initiatives and appointments.\n\nBut the principal irritants who get perhaps more attention than necessary are the stars of the conservative media subculture, such as Rush Limbaugh and Glenn Beck and the prime-time stars of Fox News. Obama also contemplates the swelling power of populist sentiment on the right, from Sarah Palin as the vice presidential nominee in 2008 (Obama says that she had no idea what the hell she was talking about) to the nascent Tea Party the following year and the surge of its acolytes in Congress after the midterms of 2010. Of Palin, Obama says: Hers was a biography tailor made for working-class white voters who hated Washington and harbored the not entirely unjustified suspicion that big-city elites — whether in business, politics, or the media — looked down on their way of life.\n\nThe bulk of the book is a crisis-by-crisis recounting of Obama's first two years in office. He does not spare us, or himself, the controversies that studded those years. Some involve longstanding issues such as immigration, gay rights and abortion. Some involve Supreme Court decisions such as Citizens United, which pared back a century of campaign finance laws. We see Obama delight in appointing two Supreme Court justices, Elena Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor.\n\nWe also visit the valleys between the peaks, spending somewhat less time there, as one might expect. Some seem relatively minor now, such as the firestorm over bringing Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and four other conspirators from the Sept. 11 attacks to New York for trial. We may have forgotten the fracas over the building of an Islamic community center and mosque near what was known as ground zero, the former site of the World Trade Center towers destroyed in those attacks. But these incidents still rankle Obama, who tells Emanuel: If we can't speak out on something this basic, then I don't know what the point is of us being here.\n\nTo which Emanuel replies: At the rate we're going, we may not be.\n\nWhich segues to the harsh dose of political reality Obama received in the midterm elections. The Democrats lost 63 seats in the House — their worst drubbing in 72 years. Obama devotes the ensuing chapter (In the Barrel) to the travails of the lowest days of his first term.\n\nThey are all part of the catalog Obama seems to be keeping, like a scrapbook in his head.\n\nEnding in suspense\n\nObama ends this volume (a second is in the works) with what might be called his greatest hit. The last chapter is about the hunt for Osama bin Laden that culminated in the raid that killed him in May 2011. We sit in on the tense hours as Obama and his national security team await word of the mission's fate. Here, as elsewhere, Obama shares credit with his people, in particular Adm. William McRaven, a former Navy SEAL who planned and conducted the strike.\n\nWe watch with the president and his national security team as live video shows the raid in real time. We hear McRaven and Defense Secretary Leon Panetta speaking in code: Geronimo EKIA. Enemy killed in action.\n\nEven as the final hours tick away before the mission launches, we see Obama put on his tux and attend the White House Correspondents' Association annual dinner, which he could not duck without raising suspicions.\n\nAt this late moment in the memoir, a character previously glimpsed in the shadows offstage is suddenly in the spotlight. It is Trump, the real estate man and reality TV star. Obama has mentioned him before, holding him responsible for stoking years of assault on his native-born American citizenship, the imaginary conspiracy of the birthers.\n\nOn this night in 2011, with Trump a highly visible guest, Obama mocked the birther conspiracies and skewered a recent plotline from The Celebrity Apprentice. Cameras caught Trump barely cracking a smile amid the roars of laughter. It has been suggested since that Trump has not forgotten that night.\n\nIn truth, Obama was often lacerating in his humor at such dinners, ribbing his rivals at times but often finding the jugular as well. In this case, the target found a way to fire back.\n\nThe voice lingers\n\nIf you remember enjoying just listening to Obama talk, the cadences and content of what he said, you are likely to keep this volume handy for a long time. If you tend to tire of his lecturing style (he calls it his droning on), or his tendency to share what he knows with an air of knowing it's a lot, then you will find it easier to put down.\n\nIn his early months as president, there were certainly admirers who hung on his every word. But not a few White House correspondents squinted and squirmed through his early news conferences as his answers to questions became lectures.\n\nYet all presidential memoirs have value, even if they are far less candid than this one. They offer a unique view from the presidential mind and suggest at least some of the conflicts and contradictions that contend within that mind.\n\nEven if what is revealed is only what the author wishes to reveal, it is an invaluable piece of the puzzle historians will struggle to put together from here forward. If it takes time and effort to take it all in, it's worth it.\n\nNPR's Michel Martin will interview former President Barack Obama to air on Monday.
10 Democratic Presidential Candidates Debate, 10 More To Go\n\nMillions of television viewers are getting their first extended look at the sprawling Democratic primary field over two nights in Miami this week. How did candidates do on the first night of debate?\n\nSTEVE INSKEEP, HOST:\n\nA Democratic presidential debate last night offered a chance to move beyond slogans that are short enough to fit on a hat. You know, Donald Trump had Make America Great Again. Before that, Barack Obama had a single word on a poster - Hope.\n\nThe slogans matter. Any winning candidate will have one. But governing is done by details, which candidates discussed on some issues last night. You would need a rather large poster or hat if you wanted to include a key phrase from last night's debate - Section 1325 of the United States code regarding improper entry into the United States.\n\nNPR political correspondent Scott Detrow is here to tell us what that means and what it's about.\n\nHi there, Scott.\n\nSCOTT DETROW, BYLINE: Hey. Good morning.\n\nINSKEEP: I guess there's a real substantive difference here - right? - that arguably affects a lot of people's lives at the border. What is it?\n\nDETROW: Absolutely. This is something that Julian Castro has been talking about since the early days of his presidential campaign. You've had other candidates start to talk about it lately, as well, and it is what to do with people who cross the border illegally. Do you treat it as a criminal penalty, or do you treat it as a civil penalty? Castro and his fellow Texan Beto O'Rourke got way into this last night in a lengthy exchange.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nJULIAN CASTRO: Let's be very clear. The reason that they're separating these little children from their families is that they're using Section 1325 of that act, which criminalizes coming across the border, to incarcerate the parents and then separate them. Some of us on this stage have called to end that section, to terminate it. Some, like Congressman O'Rourke, have not. And I want to challenge all of the candidates to do that.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nBETO O'ROURKE: In fact...\n\nCASTRO: I just think it's a mistake, Beto. I think it's a mistake. And I think that if you truly want to change the system, then we got to repeal that section. If not...\n\nJOSE DIAZ-BALART: Thank you.\n\nCASTRO: ...Then it might as well be the same policy.\n\nO'ROURKE: Let me respond to this very briefly. Actually, as a member of Congress, I helped to introduce legislation that would ensure that we don't criminalize those who are seeking asylum and refuge in this country.\n\nCASTRO: I'm not talking about...\n\nO'ROURKE: If you're fleeing...\n\nCASTRO: I'm not talking about the ones that are seeking asylum.\n\nO'ROURKE: If you're fleeing desperation, then I want to make sure...\n\nCASTRO: I'm talking about everybody else.\n\nO'ROURKE: ...That you're treated with respect.\n\nCASTRO: I'm still talking about everybody else.\n\nO'ROURKE: But you're looking at just one small part of this. I'm talking about a comprehensive rewrite of our immigration laws.\n\nCASTRO: That's not true.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nO'ROURKE: And if we do that, I don't think it's asking too much for...\n\nCASTRO: That's not - that's actually not true.\n\nINSKEEP: OK. So Julian Castro, Beto O'Rourke among the candidates onstage last night. And - so criminal versus civil - this is, like, effectively, jail time versus a traffic ticket. That's the question here, right?\n\nDETROW: Yeah, and that obviously makes a big difference to somebody in that position. It makes a big difference to how the United States treats large-scale people coming across the country illegally. For the most part, you know, Castro has talked about this. Like I said, Elizabeth Warren has come out with a plan. But for the most part, a lot of the Democrats in the field have struggled to define a comprehensive immigration policy, other than to say they vehemently disagree with everything the Trump administration is doing right now with families trying to come to the United States.\n\nINSKEEP: OK, so we don't know all the answers, but we do have that one difference of views among the candidates. Let's hear another one now. The Democrats were asked about health care, Scott Detrow. What was revealed?\n\nDETROW: Yeah, this was really interesting. You know, Elizabeth Warren has really staked out the progressive edge, the progressive lane on so many issues. Health care has not been one of those. Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders has led the call for a Medicare for All single-payer health care system. A lot of candidates have joined him with the same general idea of that, but Bernie Sanders has said he wants no role for private health insurance in the system he wants to create, other than, you know, supplemental plans for things like plastic surgery - is the example he gives a lot.\n\nElizabeth Warren has said she is on board with the idea of Medicare for All, but when asked, what about private health insurance, she hasn't really given a clear answer up until this point. You can do this over time. You can have an opt-in for Medicare for All. People can keep their plans at first that they want it. And over time, it would be a gradual shift.\n\nSo last night, one of the moderators said, raise your hand if you want to get rid of your private health insurance as part of your health care plan. Elizabeth Warren's hand went up. Here's what she said.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nELIZABETH WARREN: Medicare for All solves that problem. And I understand. There are a lot of politicians who say, oh, it's just not possible. We just can't do it. It's - have a lot of political reasons for this. What they're really telling you is they just won't fight for it.\n\nINSKEEP: OK. So she changed her position or added to it, modified it.\n\nDETROW: Yeah, I think she changed the way that she frames her argument. And I think that does really matter politically because this is something that really gets Democratic base voters excited. Progressives feel like there is an appetite for this, even if it would be a big dismantling of the current health care system. I mean, think back to the fights over Obamacare and how big of a drastic change that was and how long it took for voters to warm to it. This would be so much bigger.\n\nBut to come out clearly and say, yeah, I'm in favor of getting rid of private health insurance - I think that's important because President Trump and Republicans are going to define the nominee's health care plan as a government takeover - you know, like, you're going to have to go to the DMV to get your health care-type framing of this issue. So the fact that Warren has no problem with that, I think, says a lot about the political climate of the Democratic Party right now.\n\nINSKEEP: Yeah, and so we have these two big-ish differences on issues that affect real people - immigration and health care. And also, the larger question for Democratic voters - do they want more of a centrist or more of a progressive to challenge the president in the fall?\n\nDETROW: Yeah, and they will get that contrast tonight in the second night of this debate, with Vice President Joe Biden in that centrist role and Bernie Sanders in that progressive role. We expect them to air their differences on policy tonight.\n\nINSKEEP: Scott, thanks so much.\n\nDETROW: Thank you.\n\nINSKEEP: NPR's Scott Detrow.\n\nCopyright © 2019 NPR. All rights reserved.

A Raise Can Wreak Havoc With Your Health Insurance Subsidy\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Guido Mieth/Getty Images Guido Mieth/Getty Images\n\nMarketplace officials calculate a customer's subsidy, so why is the customer held responsible for repayments? Why are so many of my prescriptions held up for authorization by my Medicare drug plan? Here are answers to some recent questions from readers.\n\nWhen I applied on the exchange for health insurance I had to predict my income. I submitted four paycheck stubs so they could figure out how much premium tax credit I qualified for. But they figured it incorrectly, and now I have to repay $8,000 to the Internal Revenue Service. It was their error, but I'm told they're not responsible. Is that legal?\n\nIt is. When you apply for a marketplace plan, your premium tax credit is based on your own and the marketplace's best estimate of your income for the upcoming year, using tax records and other available electronic data, or sometimes pay stubs as in your case.\n\nEspecially for people who have multiple sources of income or whose income is variable, the projections are difficult and verifying them can be tricky for the marketplace, said Tara Straw, a senior policy analyst at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.\n\nEven so, it's your responsibility to keep the marketplace informed if during the year your income is higher than expected so that the tax credit you're receiving can be adjusted downward and you don't get blindsided with a big bill at tax time. For most people who receive too much in subsidies, repayment is capped between $300 and $2,500, depending on the person's income and tax filing status. However, there's no repayment cap for people whose income is above 400 percent of the federal poverty level (about $47,000). Unfortunately, it appears you fall into this category.\n\nI have a Medicare prescription drug plan with a $300 deductible. I don't need many prescriptions, but the drugs I do need require prior authorization, meaning they make you wait three days after the doctor calls in the prescription to decide if they are going to cover it. This is true even for my routine drugs. My pharmacist says insurers are doing this more and more. Is that true?\n\nYour pharmacist's impression is correct. The number of drugs for which insurers require prior authorization in Medicare stand-alone drug plans has been inching up for years, according to the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission. In 2016, 26 percent of the drugs that were listed in Medicare drug plan formularies, or preferred lists, required the insurer's OK before they could be dispensed, up from 23 percent the year before.\n\nInsurers use other strategies to control drug spending as well, but prior authorization is the most prevalent. They may limit the number of doses of a drug that can be provided over a set period of time, for example, or require patients to try a cheaper drug in the same category before approving a more expensive one. Overall, the number of drugs that have some sort of utilization management requirement, as it's called, has more than doubled since 2007, to 41 percent.\n\nI plan to get married in June. I am currently enrolled in an Obamacare plan. Can I switch to my husband's employer coverage right away after the wedding or do I have to wait until the next open enrollment period in the fall?\n\nYou can switch right after the wedding. Marriage is one of several life-changing events that creates a window of opportunity for people to change health plans, whether they're covered on the health insurance exchange or by an employer. Other events include divorce and the birth or adoption of a child.\n\nIt's a good idea for your fiancé to notify his employer about the impending change before the wedding so the company can process it and you can avoid a gap in coverage, said Tracy Watts, a senior partner at benefits consultant Mercer. That way, your new coverage can start on the first day of the month following your wedding date. You'll need to inform your current plan that you're dropping that coverage on a certain date as well, of course.\n\nKaiser Health News is an editorially independent news service that is part of the nonpartisan Henry J.

Where Coal Was King, Pa. Voters Hope Trump Rejuvenates Their Economy\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Ashley Westerman/NPR Ashley Westerman/NPR\n\nOn Election Day, Donald Trump swept many traditionally Democratic Rust Belt states. One of those was Pennsylvania.\n\nFor the first time in more than two decades the Keystone State went red. The Democrats' upset in a once-reliable blue state was fueled by working-class voters who have seen their communities hit hard over the decades-long decline of coal, steel and manufacturing in their areas.\n\nRural Fayette County is an hour south of Pittsburgh and one of the poorest counties in the state. Though registered Democrats outnumber Republicans almost 3 to 1, unofficial county election results show Trump trounced Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton by almost 30 points.\n\nIn Uniontown, the seat of Fayette County, Main Street is lined with decaying brick buildings. Several store fronts stand empty and many of the sidewalks are in need of repair. Area residents tell NPR that downtown used to be bustling and full of life, but the decline of king coal hit hard southwest Pennsylvania hard.\n\nWatching his community decline is one reason lifetime Democrat and retired coal miner Walter Pleban voted for Donald Trump. Pleban hails from a long line of miners and even in retirement still supports the United Mine Workers of America.\n\nAnd what we'd like to see, they do something with the coal again because so many people in this area, in our area around here, worked in the mine, Pleban says. And now there's a lot of mines closed and there's a lot of fellows without jobs.\n\nAround the Nation Trump's Victory Elevates Hopes For People In Coal Country Trump's Victory Elevates Hopes For People In Coal Country Listen · 3:04 3:04\n\nPleban hopes Trump will bring back jobs to Fayette County, though he wouldn't say how long he'd give the real estate mogul to make that happen.\n\nWe'll see what happens, he says.\n\nTina Allen is also a lifelong Democrat who crossed the aisle to vote for Trump. Her husband is a coal miner.\n\nIf he's unemployed, where is he going to go? He's almost 60 years old, Allen says.\n\nAllen hopes with a President Donald Trump, her husband's mine will be able to stay open and maybe even hire more people. But her main concern is the Affordable Care Act and the high cost of health insurance. Allen says her daughter has high insurance premiums, though she's unsure if that insurance is through the ACA.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Ashley Westerman/NPR Ashley Westerman/NPR\n\nEveryone I talked to that's on Obamacare, it has almost doubled, Allen says. So something needs done.\n\nAllen says she got in fights with her mother, a strict Democrat, over her choice to vote for Trump.\n\nWe didn't speak for days. I was told if my grandfather was living, he would disown me, Allen says. I says, 'Mom, I've got to do what I have to do.'\n\nShe and her mother have since made amends, Allen says – and right in time for the holidays.\n\nAllen says Uniontown is also ready to put aside the politics and come together to celebrate the season. She's the lead organizer for the Uniontown's annual Home for the Holidays parade and light-up night. Allen helped transform downtown into small-town holiday fever on Thursday.\n\nPeople lined the sidewalk of Main St. to see the parade, which included everything from the local high school marching band to dancers and costumed characters. The historic State Theatre was turned into a marketplace for homemade cookies sold for charity, and the mayor lit a Christmas tree in Storey Square to the sound of holiday music and the excited gasps of adults and giggles of children.\n\nCommunity members of all political persuasions came out for the event including Fayette County Democratic Party Chairman Jim Davis.\n\nIn the spring, Davis was trying to raise alarm bells to his party. He told NPR that he was concerned about the large Republican turnout in the Pennsylvania primary and he that he was seeing Democrats in his country switch their party registration so they could vote for Trump in the general election.\n\nThe writing was on the wall.\n\nWe didn't want to see it, Davis says. We didn't want to accept it but ... it was obvious.\n\nDavid doesn't square lay blame on Clinton. Instead, he says it was the system that allows people to think they have a right to run for a certain office is what failed the Democrats.\n\nYou should earn it, and competition is better, Davis says.\n\nI think a lot of good candidates assumed she would be the candidate, she would be the next president and they stepped out, he says.\n\nDavis believes the Democratic Party has to reinvent what they stand for in order to win back blue-collar voters and stop putting social issues at the forefront of the party. Democrats, he says, have to start talking about things like how to bring decent jobs into places like Fayette County.\n\nNot a job that pays $8 an hour with no benefits, but a job that can pay a reasonable wage with benefits that a man can raise his family, can hopefully buy a house and send his children off to college, maybe state school, but college, Davis says. That's the kind of thing we've got to start talking about.
Employers Fear GOP Health Overhaul Could Damage Job-Based Insurance\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Bastiaan Slabbers/NurPhoto via Getty Images Bastiaan Slabbers/NurPhoto via Getty Images\n\nThrough years of acrimony over the relative merits of Obamacare, one kind of health insurance has remained steady, widespread and relatively affordable: Employer-sponsored plans.\n\nJob-based medical plans still cover more Americans than any other type, typically with greater benefits and lower out-of-pocket expense. Recent cost increases for this sort of coverage have been a tiny fraction of those for Obamacare plans for individuals.\n\nNow, as President Donald Trump promises a replacement for the Affordable Care Act that will provide insurance for everybody, employers worry Republican attempts to redo other parts of the insurance market could harm their much larger one.\n\nWe're deeply embedded in the health law, said Neil Trautwein, vice president of health care policy for the National Retail Federation, a trade group. Pick your analogy — it's like being tied to the railroad tracks or having a bomb strapped across your chest. It's tough to disarm these things.\n\nBusinesses dislike many parts of the ACA, including its substantial paperwork, the mandate to offer coverage and the Cadillac tax on high-benefit plans (which is set to take effect in 2020). But large companies in particular — those that have always offered job-based insurance — say a poorly thought-out replacement might turn out to be worse for them and their workers.\n\nWhatever the Republicans are going to do, they've got to make it look as different from the ACA as they can for political reasons, said Edward Fensholt, a senior benefits lawyer at Lockton Companies, a large insurance broker. There are some pieces that aren't broken, and the more you ... make something different from the ACA, the more you risk screwing up things that look OK.\n\nAny new health law would need substantial revenue to replace the Cadillac tax and the other ACA taxes on health insurers, medical devices and high-income households that paid for care expansion — assuming those measures are repealed. Otherwise, a replacement plan risks stranding the millions who are now getting government-subsidized Obamacare coverage.\n\nLeaders in big business worry that Republicans may be tempted to limit the exemption from income and payroll taxes that job-based coverage has enjoyed for decades. Taxing workers and employers for health benefits could raise billions to pay for a replacement plan.\n\nSuch a measure has occasionally been floated by Republicans since the days of President Ronald Reagan, often under the argument of leveling the field between employer plans and other coverage that the tax code treats far less generously.\n\nRepublicans still don't agree on what a replacement for Obamacare should look like.\n\nBut capping the tax exclusion for employer plans is in replacement legislation introduced by Rep. Tom Price, the Georgia Republican poised to become secretary of Health and Human Services. It's also in House Speaker Paul Ryan's Better Way plan. A third proposal would keep the ACA taxes.\n\nDepending on how it's structured, limiting the employer-plan loophole could add hundreds of dollars to workers' tax bills as a portion of their expensive health insurance is counted as taxable income.\n\nI can't understand why nobody has asked the president about this, said James Gelfand, the top health policy official at ERIC, a lobbying group of very large employers focused on benefits and pay. Taxing employer insurance to subsidize non-employer insurance, he said, is a 100 percent redistribution of wealth.\n\nBig business has a vested interest in that argument. A tax on health benefits would be a pay cut for its workers. Corporate payroll taxes would also rise if the value of worker health benefits counted toward required employer contributions to Social Security and Medicare.\n\nBut other, independent health policy analysts share the concern.\n\nTaxing medical benefits could spur employers to erode or drop those benefits and make workers less likely to accept them, said Larry Levitt, a senior vice president with the Kaiser Family Foundation. (Kaiser Health News is an editorially independent program of the foundation.)\n\nMore concerning, Levitt said, are proposals such as Price's that could give workers who now rely on company health plans the option of instead using tax credits to buy individual coverage outside their company's plan. While offering workers more choice — a Republican goal — it would also erode the ACA's firewall that protects employer coverage from market turbulence.\n\nThere could be much more movement from employer coverage to individual plans, especially among younger and healthier workers, Levitt said.\n\nThat could, Fensholt said, leave company plans with the same adverse selection problem experienced by many individual plans now sold via Obamacare's online marketplaces — too high a percentage of members who are older, sicker and more expensive.\n\nWhat the administration and Congress must do immediately is stabilize the individual insurance marketplace and not destabilize the employer marketplace, said James Klein, president of the American Benefits Council, which advocates for large companies.\n\nJob-based coverage has remained stable even as annual increases in insurance premiums for individual plans reached double-digit percentages and enrollments missed expectations, pressuring the health insurance market despite the support of government subsidies.\n\nEmployer health plans cover some 150 million people, while last year individual plans covered about 20 million, according to Mark Farrah Associates, a data firm. That included some 10 million who bought coverage through the health law's subsidized exchanges.\n\nThe portion of non-elderly Americans covered by employer-sponsored plans has stayed almost unchanged since the health law was passed.\n\nRecent premium increases for job-based plans have been below 5 percent on average, less than the historical trend and far lower on average than premium hikes for individual insurance. Employers still pay most of the premium.\n\nOne way companies have contained premiums is by shifting to high-deductible plans, in which the insurance covers little until workers have incurred thousands in medical bills. Even so, benefits in employer plans are generally richer than those in the average individual plan, say health policy analysts.\n\nIn the contentious political climate, executives at individual companies were reluctant to be interviewed for this story. More than a half dozen employers declined to comment.\n\nBut there is enormous interest and concern, among business executives who specialize in health benefits, in what a Republican plan might look like. A post-election session on repeal and replacement aimed at these executives drew the biggest webinar audience ever for the National Business Group on Health, said Steve Wojcik, the advocacy and research group's vice president of public policy.\n\nIf the executives attending that webinar were anything like the benefits analysts at the American Staffing Association, a trade group that advocates for temp and recruiting firms, they had some catching up to do.\n\nEdward Lenz, senior counsel for the ASA, said that before Donald Trump's election, we ignored lots of the talk of the Republicans about repeal. First of all there was no chance of that happening with the president [Obama] in the White House. And frankly no one here counted on President Trump's victory.\n\nKaiser Health News is a national health policy news service that is part of the nonpartisan Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation.

Where The Senate Health Care Defeat Leaves Trump, GOP\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Alex Brandon/AP Alex Brandon/AP\n\nUpdated at 2:20 p.m. ET\n\nThe defeat of the GOP Senate health care bill is a major blow to all Republicans involved.\n\nPresident Trump, whose approval rating is lower than any recent president this early in his term, is now staring at an agenda imperiled. Despite his boasts, he has achieved little of significance through Congress. That failure is compounded by the fact that his party controls both chambers.\n\nThe position of Republican Senate leader Mitch McConnell, hailed for all of his senatorial maneuverability, does not appear so enviable Tuesday morning. He showed he could gum up the system and manipulate the rules to deny a president of a different party, but he has not shown the ability to control his caucus in order to govern — the way past great Senate leaders have.\n\nThe goal, after all, of any truly great legislator has always been to see problems and come up with constructive solutions. Instead, the GOP continues to have growing pains in overcoming its image as the party of no in the Obama years. Unfortunately for Republicans, now they're saying no to themselves.\n\nIt raises a host of questions about the status of the Republican Party, which is led in the White House by a right-wing nationalist outsider who ran against the establishment and exploited a culture seething at Washington, and in Congress by those very Washington insider establishmentarians. Who is in control?\n\nThe conservatives from within, though, are not necessarily aligned with Trump. In fact, they have shown they are not afraid of either Trump or McConnell. That could mean big problems ahead for what Republicans can get done. Tax reform is a priority for McConnell and Trump. Trump also said he wants to address the nation's aging, crumbling and, in places, dangerous infrastructure and has talked about doing so with a mix of public and private funding intended to generate $1 trillion in infrastructure spending.\n\nBut there is a reason a tax overhaul hasn't happened for more than 30 years. And infrastructure went nowhere in the Obama years after the stimulus plan — despite an economic collapse and a willingness on both sides to do it. It failed because Democrats and Republicans couldn't agree on how to pay for it.\n\nThis health care bill failure makes it all the more difficult, not just for momentum — and that's no small thing — but because of the hundreds of millions (originally $1 trillion) in tax cuts that the health care bill would have provided. That would have been a big head start on tax cuts.\n\nMcConnell had already delayed the bill's vote after Arizona Sen. John McCain was hospitalized because of a serious surgery to remove a blood clot in his head. Now, with the loss of support from two more senators — conservatives Mike Lee of Utah and Jerry Moran of Kansas on Monday night — the bill is effectively dead.\n\nTrump offered plenty of advice: advocating full repeal and then building another plan. He even declared that Democrats would jump on board.\n\nMcConnell put out his own statement and seemed to agree. He wants senators to vote to put the House health care bill on the floor and allow a vote to repeal major pieces of the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare.\n\nRegretfully, it is now apparent that the effort to repeal and immediately replace the failure of Obamacare will not be successful, McConnell said. So, in the coming days, the Senate will vote to take up the House bill with the first amendment in order being what a majority of the Senate has already supported in 2015 and that was vetoed by then-President Obama: a repeal of Obamacare with a two-year delay to provide for a stable transition period to a patient-centered health care system that gives Americans access to quality, affordable care.\n\nThere were, however, obvious fissures about how to proceed, and they proved impossible to overcome. Less than 14 hours after McConnell announced the path forward, it was again blocked when three Republicans announced their opposition.\n\nAt the White House, Trump said he was disappointed and cast a wide net of blame for everyone but himself and his White House.\n\nFor seven years, I've been hearing repeal and replace from Congress, Trump said of congressional Republicans. I've been hearing it loud and strong, and when we finally get a chance to repeal and replace, they don't take advantage of it.\n\nHe also called Democrats obstructionists who have no ideas and no thought process.\n\nBut on whether he bears any blame, Trump said, We're not going to own it; I'm not going to own it.\n\nThe episode raises questions about the Republican brand. After Democrat Jimmy Carter left the White House, the GOP branded itself the party of management, the small-government alternative to what it lampooned as a Democratic Party that believed in bloated government.\n\nThat is what helped Newt Gingrich's rise to power as speaker of the House with his Contract with America and the 1994 Republican Revolution. That sweeping election gave Republicans control of the House for the first time since the 1950s.\n\nSince the 1994 takeover, Democrats have controlled the House in just two sessions of Congress, from 2007 to 2011. That was when the Iraq War was raging and the economy collapsed under a Republican president and then in the first two years of the historic Obama presidency.\n\nOn the heels of outrage over the Affordable Care Act, the Tea Party wave pushed Republicans back into power. And the GOP is fundamentally changed. This is not the same Republican Party that relented power a decade ago.\n\nFactionalization, led by ideologues, prevented deals from being struck between Speaker John Boehner and Democratic President Barack Obama. It led to the downfall of Boehner, who was never able to control his rowdy conference flush with hard-line newbies.\n\nBack in May 2012, six months before Obama would be re-elected, Boehner famously said, It's hard to keep 218 frogs in a wheelbarrow long enough to get a bill passed.\n\nCurrent House Speaker Paul Ryan has faced the same problems in the early months of the Trump presidency. His hard-right faction initially prevented the passage of the House health care bill. That led Ryan to declare that Obamacare is the law of the land.\n\nBoehner had more to say after his frogs in a wheelbarrow line. He added, I want to do more, too. But Republicans are still a minority here in Washington. Democrats control the Senate, we've got a Democrat in the White House, and our members are pretty frustrated.\n\nThat reason has expired. Republicans are in the majority, and yet they are still running into the same problems. The inability of leaders in both parties to broker deals and work constructively across party lines has meant the general public is looking at a Congress legislating in the same-old, same-partisan ways.\n\nSome prominent Republican senators want the caucus to try to legitimately work with Democrats. McConnell attempted to use that very threat — working with Democrats — as a cudgel to get conservatives to vote for it. Apparently, that was a bluff, as he intends to see how far he can push governing along party lines.\n\nBut to what end? There aren't much more than two options when it comes to overhauling health care — government-run single-payer or a market-based hybrid system similar to the Affordable Care Act.\n\nAnd Republicans are the ones who came up with the market-based system as an alternative to HillaryCare, the health care plan Hillary Clinton was working on as first lady in the 1990s.\n\nAfraid of upsetting their base, though, Republicans have refused to work with Democrats on health care in any serious way.\n\nAnd they don't look ready to do so any time soon, especially with Obama still attached to the law's name.
Among False Claims, Trump Attacked McCain For Failing Veterans\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Michael Conroy/AP Michael Conroy/AP\n\nAt a speech in Lima, Ohio, on Wednesday, President Trump went off script into a five minute, ad-libbed attack on the late Sen. John McCain, a celebrated Vietnam War veteran and a former prisoner of war. Lost amid the unusual verbal attack on a deceased war hero by a sitting president was an inaccurate claim about veterans' issues.\n\nPresident Trump slammed McCain for failing to pass a bill to expand VA services — a bill which in fact was originally sponsored by Sen. McCain.\n\nIt's not the first time the president has picked a fight with John McCain. It was the first major fight, though, since John McCain died of brain cancer seven months ago. Trump called the dead senator ungrateful and claimed, falsely, to have approved McCain's funeral at the National Cathedral.\n\nI gave him the kind of funeral that he wanted — which, as President, I had to approve. I don't care about this. I didn't get 'thank you.' That's okay. We sent him on the way. But I wasn't a fan of John McCain, Trump said in Ohio.\n\nIt is actually Congress that approved most of the funeral arrangements, though the White House did allow government transport of McCain's body.\n\nAt the Ohio speech, Trump also criticized McCain's support for wars in the Middle East, and the Arizona senator's decisive vote in 2017 against repealing Obamacare. And he also repeated a false claim about McCain's role in failing to pass a bill that would have expanded VA services.\n\nMcCain didn't get the job done for our great vets and the VA, and they knew it, Trump said, That's why, when I had my dispute with him, I had such incredible support from the vets and from the military. The vets were on my side because I got the job done. I got Choice and I got accountability. Accountability meaning, if somebody mistreats our vets — for 45 years they were trying.\n\nThe president did get strong support at the ballot box from the military community. And he did sign, last year, a major Veterans Affairs bill. But the law was not 45 years in the making, and is named the John S. McCain III, Daniel K. Akaka, and Samuel R. Johnson VA Maintaining Internal Systems and Strengthening Integrated Outside Networks Act of 2018, in honor of McCain and two other veterans who served in Congress. This was an expansion of the original Veterans Choice law, to increase access to private care, which was co-sponsored by McCain five years ago, not 45 years ago.\n\nI fear that some [veterans] may be asking themselves, if John McCain's service has come into question, does that mean that the president doesn't appreciate their service and some of the sacrifices that they've made for this country?\n\nVeterans respond\n\nVeterans groups have been largely quiet about the president's most recent broadside against the one of the most prominent veterans to serve in congress.\n\nOur membership is varied, says Lindsay Rodman with Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America (IAVA), We have many members who are strong President Trump supporters and we have some who oppose him.\n\nWhile she said IAVA wouldn't directly criticize the president, she added, John McCain's service was so extraordinary and exemplary. Being a POW for as many years as he was in Vietnam is the type of trial and tribulation that very few of our veterans may have experienced and.....I fear that some of them may be asking themselves, if John McCain's service has come into question, does that mean that the president doesn't appreciate their service and some of the sacrifices that they've made for this country?\n\nThe veterans group AMVETS said in a statement, AMVETS is, and always will be, disheartened when an attempt is made to tarnish the legacy of an honorable veteran, notably a prisoner of war. Veterans who serve their country selflessly, honorably, and with pride deserve our utmost respect, regardless of bias or political affiliation.\n\nOther major veterans organizations declined to comment. That was also true of many Republicans in congress — the most notable exception was Georgia's Johnny Isakson, chairman of the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee.\n\nIt's deplorable what he said — it will be deplorable seven months from now, if he says it again, and I will continue to speak out, Isakson told Georgia Public Broadcasting, We're all Americans. there aren't Democratic casualties and Republican casualties on the battle field there are American casualties and we should never reduce the service that people give to this country.\n\nMany Democrats and left-leaning vets took to social media with critical memes and rants, perhaps hoping to bait the president into another round of tweets about the late senator, which even Trump's allies have said probably do not help him.\n\nDemocratic Senate leader Chuck Schumer said he would reintroduce a proposal to rename the Senate Russell Office Building after John McCain.
Takeaways From Amy Coney Barrett's Judiciary Confirmation Hearings\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Susan Walsh/AP Susan Walsh/AP\n\nUpdated at 11:30 a.m. ET\n\nAmy Coney Barrett, President Trump's nominee to the Supreme Court, sat for nearly 20 hours of questioning by 22 members of the Senate Judiciary Committee over two days. At the outset of the process, Judiciary Chairman Lindsey Graham acknowledged that her confirmation by the panel was all but guaranteed.\n\nThis is probably not about persuading each other unless something really dramatic happens. All Republicans will vote yes and all Democrats will vote no and that will be the way the breakout of the vote, Graham said. But he added that the hearings give the American people the chance to find out about Judge Barrett.\n\nOn Thursday, the panel, along party lines, set Oct. 22 as the date for its vote on Barrett's nomination. The full Senate will vote after that.\n\nThe hearings revealed little about Barrett's views on major legal issues like health care, abortion rights, voting rights or gun rights. Instead, those watching learned about her overarching approach to the law as an originalist who believes the role of a justice is to adhere to the text of statutes rather than interpret or make policy from the bench.\n\nShe skillfully parried back and forth with Democrats who were frustrated she wouldn't be pinned down and kept a cool, calm demeanor — even as many warned that her addition to the court could adversely affect millions of Americans.\n\nAt one point, Texas GOP Sen. John Cornyn asked her to show what notes she was using to prep for answers and she held up a blank notepad, demonstrating that she was capable of talking for hours on end about a broad range of legal issues without any notes.\n\nWith a nationally televised audience and wall-to-wall news coverage, members on both sides of the dais used their time to make political arguments. The election loomed large over the proceedings. Several GOP senators, including Graham, are in increasingly tight reelection bids, and the prospects for Democrats to retake control of the chamber increased, even over the course of the hearings.\n\nThe incentive to wrap up the confirmation review and get the Barrett vote to the Senate floor before Nov. 3 was palpable, as two GOP members of the panel who had tested positive for the coronavirus after attending an event unveiling Barrett's nomination released letters clearing them to participate in person without posing any health risks to others.\n\nBarrett declined to answer many questions, citing precedent of earlier nominees\n\nNominees for the high court in modern times have deliberately avoided directly responding to questions. They point out that judicial ethics rules require that judges should not weigh in on any issue that could come before them.\n\nBarrett cited the woman whose seat she would take — the late Ruth Bader Ginsburg — who established what became known as Ginsburg rule. At several points Barrett reiterated that this meant no hints, no previews, no forecasts.\n\nDemocrats were, not surprisingly, not satisfied with that response, or Barrett's stream of non-answers on a range of issues. They said that President Trump publicly vowed to appoint judges who would overturn Obamacare and that recently he pushed for speedy confirmation of his nominee to the high court in the event that the 2020 election results ended up before the court. GOP senators argued that they were making leaps and suggesting some kind of backroom deal.\n\nRead the tweets! Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin said about the president's regular statements on these issues.\n\nBarrett also refused to say whether she believed climate change was a threat, or whether the administration's policy on separating children from their parents at the southwest border was appropriate, saying she would not opine on contentious public policy issues.\n\nAs soon as Barrett was nominated, the president and others portrayed her as a female version of her mentor, the late Justice Antonin Scalia, for whom she clerked. Democrats reminded the audience of that, but Barrett made a point of downplaying the comparison and insisting she would chart her own path.\n\nIf I were confirmed, you'd be getting Justice Barrett, not Justice Scalia, she said.\n\nDemocrats zeroed in on health care\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Tyrone Turner/WAMU Tyrone Turner/WAMU\n\nThe Supreme Court is slated to hear a case involving the Affordable Care Act just a week after the November election. Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden's strategy over the past several months has been to run against the president's handling of the coronavirus pandemic and to tie that to his pledge to undo Obamacare.\n\nFor the most part, Democrats tried to turn the hearings into a forum on the health care law. During their opening statements, many sat next to large posters of constituents who they said were struggling with severe health issues and worried about their coverage. They argued that Barrett's writings and selection by the president could mean she would be a vote on the court to dismantle the law.\n\nOver and over Barrett said she had no agenda and that she never made any deal or discussed the issue with the president before her nomination.\n\nShe was pressed multiple times by Democrats about a January 2017 law journal article in which she critiqued Chief Justice John Roberts' reasoning for upholding the law in a key decision.\n\nBut she maintained, I'm not here on a mission to destroy the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe pending case has to do with the issue of severability, whether a key provision of the law — the individual mandate requiring insurance — is legally sound, and whether pulling it out would undermine the entire law. GOP briefs filed by the administration argue for invalidating the statute. But Barrett, under questioning, said the presumption is always in favor of severability.\n\nPressed by Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar about her writings, Barrett insisted there was no deliberate pitch to show she was open to GOP attempts to legally take down the law that they have been unable to do with legislation. I have no animus or agenda for the Affordable Care Act.\n\nBut Durbin again reminded those watching that the president who appointed her was clear on the issue and that was the orange cloud over her nomination.\n\nAbortion and debate over super-precedents\n\nThe issue of abortion rights is always a flashpoint in Supreme Court confirmation hearings. Democrats repeatedly attempted to pin Barrett down on whether she viewed the landmark case providing protections for women who elect to have abortions, Roe v. Wade, as settled law, but she sidestepped the issue. She maintained that if she signaled one way or another it would invite litigants to frame legal strategies around her comments.\n\nBut in an exchange with Klobuchar, Barrett stated that she viewed a half a dozen cases as super-precedents — cases that could not be overturned because they are established law.\n\nShe pointed to a case outlawing school segregation but did not include Roe in that group, explaining that there continues to be litigation on the issue.\n\nRoe is not a super-precedent because calls for its overruling have never ceased, but that doesn't mean that Roe should be overruled. That led Klobuchar and other Democrats to conclude that she was open to considering a challenge to abortion laws. Klobuchar lamented that without answers one was left to follow the tracks based on Barrett's writings.\n\nElection results disputes and presidential pardons\n\nWith the presidential election mere weeks away and concerns about close contests or legal challenges, Barrett was asked if she would recuse herself if such a case came before the high court. She assured the committee she would go through the traditional process justices use to determine whether it's appropriate for them to rule on a case.\n\nBut she also pushed back at the notion that she was being rushed onto the court to tip the scales. I certainly hope that all members of the committee have more confidence in my integrity than to think I would allow myself to be used as a pawn to decide this election for the American people.\n\nDemocrats also tried to get her to explain what should happen if the president fails to accept a ruling. Barrett said no person was above the law, but also said the Supreme Court can't control whether or not the president obeys.\n\nBarrett also said she can't answer a question about whether the president has an absolute right to pardon himself because it hasn't been tested in court and is a question that calls for legal analysis.\n\nRepublicans defended Barrett, argued judges are not policymakers\n\nGOP senators chided Democrats for playing politics with the hearing. One after another they praised Barrett's ability to balance a large family with seven children and a successful legal career.\n\nIowa Sen. Joni Ernst, one of two female Republicans on the committee, touted the historic moment of adding a woman to the court in the same year women are marking 100 years of getting the right to vote.\n\nRepublicans also went into the hearings spoiling for a fight with Democrats over Barrett's religious views, but that didn't materialize.\n\nDuring Barrett's 2017 confirmation hearing for her current circuit court post, the top Democrat on the panel, Sen. Dianne Feinstein, remarked about Barrett's Catholic faith: The dogma lives loudly within you. Republicans accused Democrats of an anti-religious bias and some used their opening statements to chastise any who would suggest that Barrett's religious views would interfere with her job as a judge.\n\nErnst told Barrett that opponents were attacking your faith and your precious family ... attacking you as a mom and a woman of faith. But Democrats, disciplined on keeping the focus on health care, largely steered clear of raising the issue. Some outside liberal groups did contend that some conservative tenets of Catholicism would have an impact on cases. But when Democrats raised questions about contraception or abortion, they worked to keep the questioning lines to writings or speeches by Barrett, not any commentary on her faith.\n\nStill, Republicans periodically argued that the Democrats' line of questioning was unfair or condescending toward the accomplished jurist. Tennessee Republican Sen. Marsha Blackburn said Democrats were using the hearings to spread some fear and misinformation about health care. She complained that they were trying to paint Barrett as a monster with an agenda.\n\nDebate mostly civil, confirmation on track\n\nTechnical issues periodically interrupted the hearings and the coronavirus pandemic made some senators decide to participate remotely. But the hearings overall were far more civil than the raucous and testy exchanges witnessed during the committee's consideration of Brett Kavanaugh's nomination in 2018.\n\nGraham admitted he was worried, given the unpredictable nature of 2020, that things could go awry. Closing out the questioning period he concluded that while the hearings didn't change anyone's minds, they showed that the committee could function. He also said that Kavanaugh's confirmation forever changed the ability to garner large bipartisan votes on nominees to the high court.\n\nIn another time, in another place, you would get everybody's vote, Graham told Barrett.\n\nBarrett's ability to maneuver through complicated legal questions and not raise any vetting issues ensured that the process would move forward at a quick pace, despite the controversy over whether it should be happening at all when 40 states are already voting in the presidential election.\n\nGraham celebrated Barrett's place in history on Wednesday, saying, This is the first time in American history that we've nominated a woman who is unashamedly pro-life and embraces her faith without apology, and she is going to the court.\n\nThe committee is hearing from an outside panel of supporters and opponents of Barrett's nomination on Thursday and is expected to approve her nomination on a party line on Oct. 22. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., is expected to move for a full Senate vote the week before the election.
GOP Rep. Tom Reed Weighs In On Trump's Move To Invalidate The Affordable Care Act\n\nNPR's Audie Cornish speaks with Rep. Tom Reed, R-N.Y., and co-chair of the Problem Solvers Caucus, about the Trump administration's move to strike the Affordable Care Act in its entirety.\n\nAUDIE CORNISH, HOST:\n\nPresident Trump says he's going to make the GOP the party of health care, but he's told his Justice Department to support a legal effort to cancel the Affordable Care Act known as Obamacare. This is a reversal from the administration's previous position to let the popular parts of the law stand - for instance, the law barring insurers from charging people more for pre-existing conditions.\n\nThe threat to Obamacare was a winning campaign issue for House Democrats, and it's been a source of frustration for Republicans who have tried and failed to repeal it many times. To talk more about this, we have Representative Tom Reed of New York. He's a Republican co-chair of the House Problem Solvers Caucus. Welcome to ALL THINGS CONSIDERED.\n\nTOM REED: It's great to be with you. Thank you for having me on.\n\nCORNISH: So just so everyone's clear about what we're talking about, the administration is backing a lower court ruling that says the Obamacare system should be wiped out because the tax plan that you all passed last year took away the penalty for not having health insurance.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: And if the Supreme Court rules that Obamacare is out, we will have a plan that's far better than Obamacare.\n\nCORNISH: So as this makes its way through the courts, does the party have any kind of alternative to Obamacare right now?\n\nREED: Well, you know, I believe we do in the sense of our solutions being based on bringing market pressure to bear into the health care arena to drive these costs down. However...\n\nCORNISH: I guess I mean one with the votes - right? - (laughter) 'cause that's been the problem.\n\nREED: Yeah, exactly.\n\nCORNISH: You definitely can repeal it. You just can't seem to come up with an alternative.\n\nREED: And that's exactly the issue. And that's one of the reasons I disagree with the position of repealing the entire law through the judicial system, through the court system. I'm a Republican who believes that, you know, what we should do is proactively address the problems of health care and leave the provisions that we agree with - the pre-existing condition protection, for example. Allow that to remain as the law of the land, and move forward. And I think that's going to be the case regardless of what happens in the court system.\n\nCORNISH: You've called this a poor political move.\n\nREED: I did. You know, not only substantively does it put millions of Americans in harm's way if the court agrees with the Justice Department that the whole law needs to be ruled unconstitutional. I think politically, you know, to not have a concrete proposal, a concrete plan on the Republican side that we could roll out with the votes, with Democrat, Republican support to get to the president's desk and signed into law is risky. It puts a lot of people, rightfully so, in an anxious position. And politically that causes us to probably be in a weaker position in my political opinion. Now, that's just my opinion. But, you know, that's why I disagree with this both on political and substantive basis.\n\nCORNISH: You've said anxious position. Do you feel that Republicans won't be known as the party of health care - right? - that they'll somehow be the party against health care?\n\nREED: Well, I think we're going to be a party that's going to offer solutions. And I just hope, you know, that what we can do as we have that debate is bring Democrats to the table that want to be practical, that want to actually solve this problem of health care costs ever-increasing. Love or hate the Affordable Care Act, it is not doing what they promised it would do, and that's bring health care costs down. And what we should be doing as Republicans and Democrats - finding ways to lower drug prices for folks, seniors in particular, lower access costs to health care overall and show these benefits in patients' pockets as opposed to negotiated between carriers and administrators.\n\nCORNISH: So far, the Problem Solvers Caucus has not solved any problems, right? I think there's been one major piece of legislation you guys have sponsored related to opioid abuse, which was fairly popular. I mean, what's your response to the criticism that this group gives the appearance of compromise but doesn't have action, especially on an issue like health care?\n\nREED: Well, fundamentally, I - I fundamentally and vigorously - I disagree with your assessment we haven't solved any problems. That's just false. What we have done is we got prison reform, criminal justice reform - we were the voice in the House that got that through the House, Senate and to the president's desk, signed into law. We have changed the House rules as the Problem Solvers Caucus members uniting together to empower members to bring legislation to the floor. Changing the rules of the House of Representatives is a generational, institutional reform that - the magnitude of that impact cannot be discounted.\n\nSo we are moving forward with solutions on many issues. And we're not - we're the first ones to tell you, you know, we're not looking to solve the issues with our proposals one way or the highway - it's our way or the highway. We take in, but we try to influence the agenda in a positive way. And if a piece of it gets to the finish line, we're good with that, too. It's not all about our ideas. It's about solving problems for the people back home.\n\nCORNISH: That's Tom Reed of New York, Republican Congressman. Thank you for speaking with us.\n\nREED: All right, thanks for having me on.\n\nCopyright © 2019 NPR. All rights reserved.

Trump Says African-American Communities In 'Worst Shape' Ever; Data Disagree\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Evan Vucci/AP Evan Vucci/AP\n\nAttempting to court black voters over the last two months, Donald Trump has painted a pretty dire picture of their lives. You're living in poverty, he said in late August. Your schools are no good. You have no jobs. Fifty-eight percent of your youth is unemployed. What the hell do you have to lose?\n\nOn Tuesday Trump took this rhetoric one step further, telling a North Carolina audience that our African-American communities are absolutely in the worst shape they've ever been in before. Ever, ever ever.\n\nOf course, Trump's statement ignores large, critically important eras in American history: slavery, and the Jim Crow laws that lingered for more than a century after the practice was abolished.\n\nBut what about in more recent years? A look at major indicators like employment and health suggests that while African-Americans lag behind the rest of the country in many key areas, they've also experienced steady economic and socioeconomic gains.\n\nLet's start with unemployment. The black unemployment rate is more than 8 percent – that's more than three points higher than the national average. But it's halved from the recent post-recession high of 16.6 percent.\n\nBlack America is like a caboose on a train, said National Urban League president Marc Morial recently told NPR's Scott Horsley. When the train speeds up, the caboose speeds up. But it's still the caboose.\n\nBlack household income rose 4 percent last year, Horsley also reported.\n\nTrump repeatedly cites that 58 – sometimes he says 59 — percent unemployment rate among black youth. The actual figure is still quite high – about 27 percent – but nowhere near the six-in-ten number that Trump cites during his stump speech.\n\nThe National Urban League puts out an annual report on the State of Black America. Its most recent survey shows educational progress over the last 40 years. Eighty-six percent of African Americans are high school completers, the share with a bachelor's degree or more has more than tripled (from 6.6 percent to 22.2 percent) and roughly one-third of 18-24-year-olds are enrolled in college, the study finds. While whites have increased college enrollment faster than Blacks between 1976 and 2014, the college completion gap has narrowed 20 percentage points over this time.\n\nEarlier this year, the New York Times examined health trends:\n\nA recent trove of federal data offered some good news. The suicide rate for black men declined from 1999 to 2014, making them the only racial group to experience a drop. Infant mortality is down by more than a fifth among blacks since the late 1990s, double the decline for whites. Births to teenage mothers, which tend to have higher infant mortality rates, have dropped by 64 percent among blacks since 1995, faster than for whites. Blacks are still at a major health disadvantage compared with whites. But evidence of black gains has been building and has helped push up the ultimate measure — life expectancy. The gap between blacks and whites was seven years in 1990. By 2014, the most recent year on record, it had shrunk to 3.4 years, the smallest in history, with life expectancy at 75.6 years for blacks and 79 years for whites.\n\nAnd, primarily because of the Obamacare that Trump is vowing to begin repealing on his first day in office, the number of uninsured African-Americans dropped by nearly 10 points over the last three years.\n\nTrump's black outreach has been hit-or-miss. He's been criticized for primarily speaking to mostly-white campaign rallies, rather than directly addressing black voters.\n\nTrump's recent visit to a black church in Detroit went smoothly, but last week he picked a fight with an African-American pastor after a rocky visit to her Flint, Mich. church.\n\nTrump hit another stumble Tuesday, when boxing promoter Don King joined him at an Ohio campaign event, and accidentally said the N-word while making a point about how no matter how much money a black person earns, in King's mind, he'll still be a rich negro.\n\nIf you are talented and intellectual, you are an intellectual negro, King said. If you are a dancing and sliding and gliding n***** — I mean negro — you are a dancing and sliding and grinding negro.\n\nKing, a Cleveland native, attended the Republican National Convention. Trump had indicated King would address the gathering, but RNC officials reportedly nixed that idea, due to King's manslaughter conviction.
KELLY MCEVERS, HOST:\n\nHey. I'm Kelly McEvers, and this is EMBEDDED from NPR.\n\nDecember 30, 2012 - the United States was about to go over this thing called the fiscal cliff. And without going into too much boring budgetary detail, what that meant was if Congress didn't do something before midnight on New Year's Eve, there would be these massive tax increases and spending cuts all at the same time, which could put the country into a recession. Democrats wanted to tax anyone who made over $250,000 a year. Republicans wouldn't allow a tax increase even on people who made more than a million a year. Negotiations stopped.\n\nMitch McConnell was the ranking Republican in the Senate at the time, and he picked up the phone and called the one person he thought could help, someone he had worked with in the Senate - Joe Biden, who was flying on Air Force Two. So McConnell left Biden a voicemail.\n\nJANET HOOK: The voicemail - according to Mitch McConnell, the voicemail said, is there anyone over there who knows how to make a deal?\n\nMCEVERS: Over there meaning the White House. This is Janet Hook, national political reporter at the LA Times. She's covered Congress since the '80s.\n\nHOOK: What I like particularly is the kind of bossy rest of the message. This is McConnell to Biden - I need you to get up to speed on this, Joe. Get off the plane. Think about things and call me in an hour. This is vice president of the United States.\n\nMCEVERS: Wow.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)\n\nHOOK: And then McConnell - after placing that call, McConnell goes to the Senate floor and announces that he's trying to break the logjam and that he called Joe Biden.\n\nMCEVERS: What happened next is something people are talking about a lot these days. Joe Biden and Mitch McConnell got together and negotiated a last-minute deal to keep the U.S. from falling off the fiscal cliff. In the end, the tax increases were for anyone who made over $400,000 a year.\n\nPeople are talking about it these days, of course, because Biden is now president-elect, and Mitch McConnell is poised to remain the Senate majority leader if Republicans keep control of the Senate. That could change if Democrats win two Senate seats in Georgia in January. We'll talk more about that later. But the idea is that if these guys were able to negotiate back then, maybe they'll be able to work together now. Biden even campaigned on the idea this year.\n\nJanet and her colleague Jackie Calmes, an editor in the Washington bureau of the LA Times who's also covered Congress since the '80s, say it's not exactly like that. You can see it in the way McConnell kind of summoned Biden on that voicemail.\n\nJACKIE CALMES: McConnell, you know, was not impressed with Joe Biden's new title - that he was no longer a senator; he was vice president of the United States. There was still - you know, McConnell, as Janet said, was being the bossy one.\n\nMCEVERS: Thing is, a lot of people say Biden gave away too much in those negotiations. Still, there's the sense that these guys are friends. And because of that, things are going to go back to an earlier time when these negotiations were more civil, a time when politicians from two different parties could actually work together.\n\nYou know, there's this sense that these two are buddies. Is that actually true? Are they friends?\n\nHOOK: Oh, no. No. I would not describe their relationship as friendship.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)\n\nHOOK: They have worked together on a lot of hard things. There have been personal touches in their relationship. But I don't think that means that they are friends in any way that would be recognizable to the rest of us.\n\nMCEVERS: So, OK, not a friendship - a decent working relationship. Either way, it's a relationship that could affect our lives a lot in the coming years. If McConnell does keep control of the Senate and if there is an uncontested, peaceful transfer of power from President Donald Trump to President-elect Joe Biden, how Biden and McConnell continue to work together will be really important. One recent article even called Biden and McConnell Washington's new power couple.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)\n\nMCEVERS: If you listened to the show last year, you know we did a whole series on Mitch McConnell - how he rose to power, what he did once he got it. Now that it looks like he'll be the most powerful Republican in Washington, we figured it's time to talk about him again. We're also updating the series. We'll be publishing it every week through the end of the year. And on today's show, Janet and Jackie are going to look back on the relationship between McConnell and Biden and help us understand what it could mean for the next few years. That's after this break.\n\nOK. We are back, and we're going to spend some time walking through Joe Biden and Mitch McConnell's relationship over the years. Again, they were in the Senate together for decades, back when the Senate was a more chummy place. But still, Jackie Calmes and Janet Hook of the LA Times say the two men just didn't spend that much time together - until later.\n\nCALMES: There is one funny story that McConnell tells in his memoir about dealing with Biden. In 2008, after Jesse Helms, the former senator from North Carolina, died, they flew down to North Carolina together on a private plane. And McConnell mentions in his biography in the lead-in to the story...\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF AUDIOBOOK, THE LONG GAME: A MEMOIR)\n\nMITCH MCCONNELL: (Reading) As my dad would've said about the vice president if they'd ever met, if you ask him what time it is, he'll tell you how to make a watch.\n\nMCEVERS: This is McConnell reading the passage from the audio version of his autobiography.\n\nCALMES: Referring to Biden's long-windedness. So he describes how on the flight down to North Carolina...\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF AUDIOBOOK, THE LONG GAME: A MEMOIR)\n\nMCCONNELL: (Reading) Well, Joe started talking the minute we got on the plane, and he didn't stop until the moment we landed. I think this quality of Joe's is endearing.\n\nCALMES: It was all kind of in the spirit of, he's a good guy. I like him very much, but let me tell you this thing about him, as if nobody knows that Biden was famously long-winded. And McConnell went on from telling that anecdote to write in his memoir that...\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF AUDIOBOOK, THE LONG GAME: A MEMOIR)\n\nMCCONNELL: (Reading) Not only did I like Joe, but I also learned that he didn't only talk; he also listened. He was, therefore, someone I could work with.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)\n\nMCEVERS: So, yeah, Joe Biden and Mitch McConnell don't have this 25-year history of working together in the Senate, getting in the weeds, writing legislation. It turns out Biden and McConnell actually got closer because of Barack Obama. Remember; when Obama was elected president in 2008, he was elected with this pretty big mandate. Democrats controlled the House and Senate, eventually passed a big signature bill, Obamacare, which, by the way, no Republicans voted for. Then in the 2010 midterms, Republicans got control of the House, which meant that to get anything done, the two sides would have to compromise.\n\nJanet and Jackie say McConnell, the ranking Republican in the Senate, just did not like to negotiate with Obama. For one thing, they say he thought Obama's almost four years in the Senate before becoming president wasn't enough time.\n\nCALMES: And one thing that Mitch McConnell respects is time in the institution. But I think also, temperamentally, President Obama had not yet developed that senatorial way of deal-making. McConnell thought that Obama was very preachy and arrogant, and his nickname for him was Professor Obama. He just thought that Biden knew how to listen as well as talk.\n\nMCEVERS: So the job of negotiating with Republicans fell to Biden. He'd go to Capitol Hill, spend time in the vice president's office there, walk around, talk to people in ways that Obama just didn't do.\n\nCALMES: And one thing that Mitch McConnell really appreciates is somebody like Biden, who - I think he believed that Biden was good at seeing the political imperative that the other side faces and being willing to be practical about that and say, OK, Mitch McConnell is a Republican, he can't go past this line; I am a Democrat, can't go past this line, and that that was not in Obama's skill set.\n\nHOOK: Right. And then when it came to an issue, one thing McConnell really hated is if he was talking to President Obama, the president would talk about the issue as if he were trying to convince Mitch McConnell to change his mind. So let's say estate taxes. You know, he might talk to Mitch McConnell about how, well, Republicans can say all they want about how this is for farmers and ranchers, but really, you know, it's negligible the number of farmers and ranchers who really benefit from this. This is the richest of the rich that benefit.\n\nNow, Biden wouldn't even go there. He would just think, OK, the Republicans got to have their repeal of the estate tax, so we got to just see how we can work it to limit it and get something in return. And he was not going to sit there and talk about the pros and cons of the issue and take up time doing that.\n\nMCEVERS: Interesting. Right. Mitch McConnell is like, yeah, we're not here to, like, make grand speeches about our feelings.\n\nHOOK: Right. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. This isn't - his perspective was, this isn't a debating society. This is a deal-cutting exercise.\n\nCALMES: Yeah.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)\n\nMCEVERS: Coming up, the personal moments in the relationship - after this break.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)\n\nMCEVERS: OK. We are back, and we're talking to Jackie Calmes and Janet Hook, longtime political reporters who now work at the LA Times, about the relationship between Joe Biden and Mitch McConnell.\n\nSo a few years after all this deal-making went down between Biden and McConnell, Joe Biden's son, Beau Biden, who had also been the attorney general of Delaware, died of brain cancer. It was an incredibly painful time for his father. McConnell was the only Republican senator to attend the funeral. The following year, Biden was presiding over the Senate in his role as vice president, and McConnell announced he was renaming a bill to fund cancer research.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nMCCONNELL: I think it's fitting to dedicate this bill's critical cancer initiatives in honor of someone who'd be proud of the presiding officer today, and that's his son, Beau. And in just a moment, that's exactly what the Senate will do, renaming the NIH's cancer initiatives in this bill after Beau Biden.\n\nMCEVERS: It was 2016. Donald Trump had recently won the presidency. And the day after this, Biden was presiding over the Senate for the last time as vice president. McConnell gave Biden a tribute speech. He told that joke about how much Biden likes to talk and referenced their deal-making days.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nMCCONNELL: Obviously, I don't always agree with him, but I do trust him implicitly. He doesn't break his word. He doesn't waste time telling me why I'm wrong. He gets down to brass tacks. And he keeps in sight the stakes. There's a reason, get Joe on the phone, is shorthand for, time to get serious, in my office.\n\nMCEVERS: And I was watching that on C-SPAN, and I was thinking, wow, he's being so funny and so warm. You know, it's just a side of McConnell that people don't often see or hear. And I looked at the date, and I was like, oh, it's December 2016. Like, in his mind, this is his farewell. You know, he's like, I'm never going to have to deal with this guy again 'cause I've - you know, we've won the White House. We've won the Senate.\n\nCALMES: Right.\n\nMCEVERS: And now I can say all the nice things. And I just wonder - yeah, I can't - I wonder if he could ever have imagined, you know, this moment.\n\nCALMES: I don't think he could. I mean, a lot of people couldn't. Who would've imagined that at 77, Joe Biden would, after passing on the run for president in the 2016 cycle, would come back and win it all in 2020? I think, like, the speech you mentioned, it was very nice of McConnell to say that to Joe Biden. And in the past, Mitch McConnell has loved to compliment Joe Biden as a deal-maker when he was vice president to Barack Obama.\n\nBut knowing Mitch McConnell, you have to remember that he gets a little bit of a fiendish pleasure out of praising Joe Biden because he knows it drives the base of the Democratic Party crazy. And it's not a big help to Joe Biden to be...\n\nMCEVERS: Praised by Mitch McConnell.\n\nCALMES: ...To get praise from Mitch McConnell.\n\nMCEVERS: Oh, my God. Of course.\n\nCALMES: That's going to be doubly true going forward.\n\nMCEVERS: That's totally it. So it's like a bit of a troll.\n\nCALMES: Yeah.\n\nMCEVERS: Like, it's like...\n\nCALMES: Exactly. Do you think so, Janet - that there's, like, a bit of, like, McConnell just loves the fact that he can - it's like owning the libs.\n\nHOOK: Absolutely. I think there's no question about that.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)\n\nMCEVERS: So what does all this stuff that happened in Biden and McConnell's relationship during the eight years that Biden was vice president tell us about what might happen when he's president? There's already been quite a bit of reporting on what a Biden presidency and a McConnell Senate look like. One thing that could be affected are Biden's Cabinet nominations. The Senate has to approve those nominations. So we're already seeing progressive names that some observers say won't be on the list. Some say that actually could help Biden stave off criticism from the progressive base of his party. Like, McConnell made me do it. I had no choice. I talked about that with Jackie and Janet.\n\nSo the big question hanging over all of this - right? - is, like, how reasonable is - are they going to be, right? How beholden is each one to the base that's further to the right or left than they are, right? How is each one going to respond to the new reality? Like, and are they going to go sort of back to the time before - right? - like the foggy old days of 2010, 2011, 2012?\n\nHOOK: Oh, I think we know they're not going to go back to the old days. There is no going back. This really is terra incognita, though. Especially with the Senate, McConnell will be important and powerful no matter which side of the majority he's on. The best - at this point, the best Democrats can hope for is a 50-50 tie that's broken by the vice president.\n\nMCEVERS: And this, again, let's just make sure - just for people who don't know, this is only if Democrats win both the Senate seats in Georgia in the runoffs in January. That would mean the Senate is 50-50 and that Kamala Harris, the Democrat, vice president, would be the tie-breaking vote.\n\nHOOK: If the Democrats have a 50-50 tie broken by the vice president, they have control over what bills come to the floor. They have control over bringing up a nomination.\n\nMCEVERS: Right.\n\nHOOK: They have the chairmanships of all of the committees. It really makes a huge difference in the functioning of the Senate.\n\nMCEVERS: When Janet says we are now in terra incognita, she's talking about how McConnell has, some would say, bent the rules and the norms of the Senate to his political advantage, namely not allowing a vote on Merrick Garland, President Obama's pick for the Supreme Court, during an election year, but pushing through President Trump's pick, Amy Coney Barrett, just before an election. McConnell says he was not breaking norms, that the Democrats had their own dirty tricks with Supreme Court nominations.\n\nStill, I asked Janet and Jackie if they think, despite this good working relationship between McConnell and Biden that we've talked about, would McConnell block Biden's judicial nominees? Their answer - he will certainly try.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)\n\nMCEVERS: As far as what legislation they might agree on, it's pretty well understood that some kind of COVID relief package will happen not long after the inauguration. After that, infrastructure, climate change. Jackie and Janet say getting bipartisan agreement, even on stuff that's seen as moderate, could be far-fetched. A third of the Senate is up for reelection in two years. That could motivate senators to do something or to do nothing.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)\n\nMCEVERS: We hear a good bit about how, you know, the left base of the party, the progressive wing in the party will, you know, push Biden and, you know, to do certain things. I mean, McConnell has his own sort of right wing to deal with in the Senate as well. I mean, one of the things that makes the Senate a different place is, you know, he has members now who are much less likely to be compromisers, also. Is that part of the issue, too, for him going forward?\n\nHOOK: Yes, for sure. There are a lot of senators who never lived in the world that - of bipartisanship that Biden and McConnell can remember - that they've never served in a Senate where consensus was easy and a regular part of the legislative process. So in one sense, Biden will have to give a tutorial in how to approach bipartisanship to a lot of people, and that includes Democrats as well.\n\nCALMES: Right. And...\n\nHOOK: The other dynamic on the Republican side is that there are several Republicans in the Senate who might think that they will be running for president and defining themselves in terms of the parameter of, how Trumpy do I want to be? How do I make my mark? And, probably, negotiating with the Democrats isn't a great way to get started on your campaign for president.\n\nMCEVERS: Is not a thing you want on your report card.\n\nCALMES: Right.\n\nMCEVERS: Still, even if Trumpiness matters to Republican voters, I wondered if a post-Trump world could actually be better for Mitch McConnell.\n\nDo you think he himself is a little bit - is there a part of him that's probably kind of glad that it's going to go back a little bit to the way things were?\n\nCALMES: Oh, absolutely. I think he's the happiest person in Washington that Trump lost.\n\nMCEVERS: Really?\n\nCALMES: At least McConnell can say he got everything he could've hoped for and then some...\n\nMCEVERS: Right.\n\nCALMES: ...Out of Trump in the four years.\n\nMCEVERS: He confirmed more than 200 conservative judges to the federal bench, three Supreme Court justices. And Jackie says he no longer has to worry about coming to work at the Senate and getting asked about a controversial presidential tweet.\n\nHOOK: I would put it more succinctly and say that if Mitch McConnell's main goals are keeping the Senate in Republican hands and packing all of the country's courts, federal courts with conservative judges, he could look back at Election Day and say, my work is done.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)\n\nMCEVERS: But, of course, Mitch McConnell's work is not done. He just won reelection. He's got six more years in the Senate. He's just been renamed the Republican leader. A colleague called him the apex predator of the Senate. And as of today, Tuesday, November 10, 2020, McConnell has not acknowledged that Joe Biden won the presidency, and he says President Donald Trump is 100% within his rights to challenge the outcome of the election.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)\n\nMCEVERS: This episode was produced by Rhaina Cohen and edited by Jenny Schmidt, with editing help from Chris Benderev and Deirdre Walsh. Our supervising producer is Nicole Beemsterboer. Some music by Blue Dot Sessions. We had fact-checking help from the wonderful RAD team at NPR.\n\nLike I said, we will be airing our series that takes a deep look at Mitch McConnell's rise to power, his career in the Senate and how he confirmed more than 200 conservative judges to the federal bench starting a week from today, every week through the end of the year.

From The Start, Obama Struggled With Fallout From A Kind Of Fake News\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Mandel Ngan/AFP/Getty Images Mandel Ngan/AFP/Getty Images\n\nOne of the most fragile pieces of President Obama's legacy in the aftermath of the 2016 election is the Affordable Care Act.\n\nRepublicans ran on their long-standing pledge to repeal it, and we'll know soon whether — as promised — they make it their top priority in the new Congress, even without having released details on what would replace it.\n\nThe history of the Affordable Care Act also provides a window into the earliest years of the Obama presidency.\n\nFierce opposition from the GOP was there even before work on the legislation began, and that battle featured an early form of fake news — a tactic that became a prominent part of the 2016 election.\n\nRemember the death panels?\n\nIn 2009, when the health care law was still being written, Sarah Palin coined the phrase death panel in a widely shared Facebook post. The headline of her post was innocuous enough, Statement on the Current Health Care Debate.\n\nBut that Aug. 7, 2009, social media post from the former Alaska governor and GOP vice presidential candidate included a dire warning:\n\nThe America I know and love is not one in which my parents or my baby with Down Syndrome will have to stand in front of Obama's 'death panel' so his bureaucrats can decide, based on a subjective judgment of their 'level of productivity in society.' \n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Kris Connor/Getty Images Kris Connor/Getty Images\n\nConservative op-ed pages were on board. Talk radio, too. On his syndicated national radio program, Rush Limbaugh said of Palin, She's dead right.\n\nThe specter of death panels became an instant rallying cry for the still-new Tea Party movement, whose supporters crowded into town hall meetings that summer and shouted down Democratic lawmakers considering support for the Affordable Care Act.\n\nRepublican members of Congress tapped into that anger. U.S. Sen. Chuck Grassley told a crowd back home in Iowa, We should not have a government program that determines you're gonna pull the plug on Grandma.\n\nSimply dishonest\n\nAs the summer of 2009 wore on, the president stayed above the fray. Anita Dunn, who was the White House communications director at the time, told NPR in a recent interview that the team didn't take the attacks seriously at first, simply because they did seem so crazy.\n\nBut the president himself would need to directly respond. He went on the road, first to a mid-August town hall in Portsmouth, N.H., where he said that this is how politics works sometimes, that people who want to keep things the way they are will try to scare the heck out of folks, and they'll create boogeymen out there that just aren't real.\n\nDays later, in Grand Junction, Colo., Obama kept at it.\n\nThe notion that somehow I ran for public office or members of Congress are in this so that they can go around pulling the plug on Grandma? I mean when you start making arguments like that, that's simply dishonest, the president said.\n\nUltimately, the Affordable Care Act was approved by the then-Democratic-controlled Congress. The president signed it in the spring of 2010. Meanwhile, the allegations regarding death panels would be Lie of the Year by the fact-checking organization PolitiFact.\n\nThe message that stuck\n\nDunn, currently a managing director at the D.C. firm SKDKnickerbocker, says that the early disinformation campaign had a lasting negative effect nonetheless.\n\nOne of the hallmarks of the Affordable Care Act is that people don't know what is in the bill, or realize the benefits they've gotten, Dunn says, adding, a huge part of that is how it was defined early by the opposition.\n\nShe says the White House communications team learned from the experience. Rapid response became more of a priority. But Ruy Teixeira, a senior analyst with the Center for American Progress, says there's another lesson from those early Obamacare battles that the administration — and Democrats — have been slow to learn: how to talk to white voters who do not have a college education. Those voters were once a key piece of the Democratic base, but Teixeira says they are now too often driven by a core belief that the government is up to no good.\n\nThe idea of death panels fit right into that narrative. But Teixeira says you can apply it to other issues as well.\n\nYou've got to convince them you take their concerns seriously, you're on their side, he says, and the other people are not, and here's exactly why.\n\nThat was a major weakness of Democrats in the 2016 election. Non-college-educated white voters rallied around Trump and his message that he — not the Democrats — is on their side. All along, Democrats considered such a claim by the billionaire businessman turned politician a kind of a fake news story of its own. But they still need to figure out how to counter it.

Ex-New York Rep. Grimm Aims To Resurrect His Political Career\n\nAfter serving time in federal prison for tax evasion, former Republican Rep. Michael Grimm of Staten Island wants a comeback. The first step is trying to unseat his successor, Dan Donovan.\n\nRACHEL MARTIN, HOST:\n\nRepublican Michael Grimm had a colorful history when he first served in Congress. At one point, he threatened to throw a reporter off a balcony in the Capitol building. The former New York City Congressman later went to federal prison for tax evasion. Now he is fighting to win the seat back. From member station WNYC, Fred Mogul reports.\n\nFRED MOGUL, BYLINE: There's a lot of forgiveness for Michael Grimm on Staten Island. Take retired firefighter Tony Zambito down at Great Kills Beach...\n\nTONY ZAMBITO: He did a couple of things wrong, but he paid his dues.\n\nMOGUL: ...Or sunbather Deanna Immitt, who admires Grimm for being a fighter.\n\nDEANNA IMMITT: Anyone could've done it. Anyone could have made the same mistake.\n\nMOGUL: Or surfer, minister and retired sanitation worker Christopher Fedele. He says Grimm's dedication to helping the district after Superstorm Sandy is what counts.\n\nCHRISTOPHER FEDELE: A lot of politicians, their hands are dirty. So I think it sort of goes with the territory.\n\nMOGUL: Grimm failed to report almost $1 million of cash receipts at Healthalicious, the restaurant he owned in between working as a white-collar crime investigator for the FBI and representing New York's 11th Congressional District. In his guilty plea, Grimm admitted to lying to federal investigators. But here's how he described his criminal conviction in a recent primary debate hosted by WABC.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nMICHAEL GRIMM: I had three delivery boys and a dishwasher off the books, and I've never hid from that. It was a civil offense.\n\nMOGUL: Echoing President Trump, Grimm says he was the victim of a political witch hunt by the Obama administration Justice Department. He served seven months in federal prison and since then has been trying to resurrect his political career. The first step would be unseating his successor Dan Donovan. Donovan has been pounding Grimm's criminal record.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nDAN DONOVAN: In November of 2014, he asked us to vote for him. He said that he was innocent of the charges against him. We believed him. Our community voted for him. A week later, he pled guilty, using our election as a bargaining chip with the Justice Department.\n\nMOGUL: Grimm claims Donovan promised to seek a pardon for him from President Trump if he'd stay out of the race, something Donovan denies. The two men are also arguing over who's the fiercer warrior for the Trump agenda.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nGRIMM: My opponent, he voted against getting rid of Obamacare, repealing it. He voted against that. He voted against banning sanctuary cities. And then he voted against the tax reform bill. Those are three signature issues that our president actually ran on.\n\nMOGUL: Donovan said there were good reasons for voting the way he did. And he played his trump card, the president's endorsement.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nDONOVAN: He has said that I am the one that's good on border security and crime, good on veterans, good on tax cuts - 'cause I voted for $6 billion worth of tax cuts.\n\nMOGUL: Trump tweeted that Donovan, quote, will win for the Republicans in November, and his opponent will not. Remember Alabama. That's a reference to the Republicans' ill-fated nomination of Roy Moore for U.S. Senate. But many people in the district, Trump supporters though they are, are ignoring the warning and posting multiple yard signs for Grimm, often festooned with American flags. Mary Purdy thinks her neighbors are crazy for supporting him.\n\nMARY PURDY: He really thinks he's, like, the Teflon Don, that nothing's going to stick. And he's wrong. The Democrats are out to kill. He's going to get crucified.\n\nMOGUL: In the parking lot at a Staten Island Costco, she and her husband, Bill Purdy, load paper towels and porch furniture into their SUV. They've met Donovan personally before, and they say he helped out when a family member had criminal problems related to opioid addiction.\n\nBILL PURDY: As far as integrity, ethics and results, I'm going to vote for Dan Donovan.\n\nMOGUL: Up in the Brooklyn part of the district, at pizza landmark Spumoni Gardens, stock trader Nick Prendergast (ph) says he's not a political activist, but if the GOP nominates Grimm, he'll volunteer for whoever opposes him in November.\n\nNICK PRENDERGAST: I don't want to see him achieve his goal. I just don't think he deserves the right to represent anyone.\n\nMOGUL: This isn't exactly a purple congressional district. It's sent a single Democrat to Congress in the past 35 years, and he's served a single term. Still, Democrats sense a vulnerability this year in the only district in New York City that voted for Trump in 2016. The leading Democratic candidate already has almost twice as much money in the bank as Grimm and Donovan combined.\n\nFor NPR News in New York, I'm Fred Mogul.\n\nCopyright © 2018 NPR.

Analyzing Trump's Patterns Of Tweeting\n\nPresident Trump is ubiquitous on Twitter. And as we get close to 100 days, we've learned about patterns, including what time of day he usually tweets and how often he makes negative statements.\n\nSTEVE INSKEEP, HOST:\n\nA careful study of President Trump's tweets reveals something about the man who's writing them. NPR's Danielle Kurtzleben has been running the president's words through computer analysis and has learned something about how he might be feeling this very week. Hi, Danielle.\n\nDANIELLE KURTZLEBEN, BYLINE: Hi, how are you?\n\nINSKEEP: So what is it you're learning?\n\nKURTZLEBEN: Well, based on his tweets from this week, it seems like he's in a worse mood than he has been lately.\n\nINSKEEP: How would you analyze a person's mood from their tweets?\n\nKURTZLEBEN: Well, we ran what's called sentiment analysis. Basically, we run his tweets through a computer program. It scores them based on how positive or negative they are. When he uses great, good, happy or whatever, then it's more positive. When he uses words like sad or failing, such as the failing New York Times, then it's more negative.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nINSKEEP: Sentiment analysis is what...\n\nKURTZLEBEN: Right.\n\nINSKEEP: ...This is called. So when you do this analysis on the first hundred days of this presidency, what do you find?\n\nKURTZLEBEN: Yeah, so I ran the numbers with my colleague, David Eads. He's on the NPR Visuals team. And this is what we found. This week was his first negative week in quite a while. He had a really long stretch of positivity in the last couple of months. But this week, he suddenly seems to have - his tweets have turned sour, you could say.\n\nINSKEEP: Just as the hundred days are ending with, as many people have noted, not so many accomplishments compared to what he was hoping for in the first hundred days.\n\nKURTZLEBEN: Absolutely. And he sure is trying to cram a lot into this last week - right? - especially, you know, tax reform, talking about health care, talking about the wall, talking about all the things, at the very least, that he eventually wants to get done.\n\nINSKEEP: So is it possible to rank his different weeks as good weeks, better weeks, worst weeks?\n\nKURTZLEBEN: It very much is. Right around his second week in office, right after he signed that executive order banning people from various Muslim countries from coming into the U.S., that was his most negative week. A lot of stuff happened that week. There was that. He insulted Arnold Schwarzenegger about his performance on The Apprentice. He put Iran, quote, unquote on notice on Twitter. He had a lot to say that week, and it was often quite negative.\n\nINSKEEP: I'm thinking about the analysis of these tweets a little bit more. It could be that you're in a sour mood, and so you say negative things. But you also wonder if the president of the United States might feel a little bit better after he gets a few hard-edged tweets off his chest.\n\nKURTZLEBEN: That's quite possible. And, you know, what's really kind of fascinating about this - very fascinating, is this - is that this is only our second president on Twitter, right? We only have President Obama to compare him to. Now think about this. His tweets were very often neutral or maybe positive. They were very often, you know, hey, everybody, sign up for Obamacare. That is not memorable.\n\nIf you can think about this from an even broader perspective, we've gone from fireside chats to televised addresses to YouTube videos to this now. And now we have a window, potentially, into a president's head. We have never had that kind of real-time look before. And it's really stunning what he's doing here.\n\nINSKEEP: Danielle, thanks very much.\n\nKURTZLEBEN: Of course.\n\nINSKEEP: That's NPR's Danielle Kurtzleben, who, with a colleague, has completed an analysis of President Trump's tweets. Hoping you don't target my Twitter account next.\n\nKURTZLEBEN: I will.\n\nCopyright © 2017 NPR. All rights reserved.

The Clinton Health Rumors Aren't Going Away Anytime Soon. Here's Why\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Alex Wong/Getty Images Alex Wong/Getty Images\n\nRecently, I wrote about why many believe Hillary Clinton is in poor health. As a result, readers sent me tweets providing more evidence — this time, that her eyes point in different directions.\n\nTo be clear, there is no evidence that Clinton is in failing health. But this belief in entirely unfounded narratives isn't new; American politics has spawned a variety of out-there theories adopted by people on both sides of the aisle — that Sept. 11 was an inside job, for example, or that President Obama was born in Kenya.\n\nThere's no hard evidence for these stories, but sizable shares of the American public have believed them. It turns out that it's really hard to change people's minds once they believe a piece of misinformation — even when there's better, contradictory data. In fact — and troublingly for those of us who write about these things — even refuting these rumors in a news story (yes, like we have done) can backfire and make people believe them more.\n\nIn addition, political science research has found that some of the most immovable forces in American politics — polarization, low trust and opportunistic politicians — seem destined to keep these evidence-free ideas in Americans' heads.\n\nHow misinformation gets lodged in our brains\n\nTo understand why it's so hard to get our minds to unlatch from some of these ideas, it helps to know why people latch on in the first place. Here's a quick rundown of the possibilities that political science and psychological research have uncovered:\n\nLow trust. Here's a factor that makes obvious sense. Various studies have shown that a lack of trust, whether in other people or governmental figures, is associated with a willingness to believe conspiracy theories, as Slate outlined in 2013. In a 2015 study, researchers from the University of Minnesota and Colorado State University likewise found that low trust in a variety of areas (in government, the media, law enforcement, and other people) is correlated with a person's willingness to believe conspiracy theories — and in particular, theories that make the other party look bad.\n\nIt's not hard to see how people who don't trust the government also buy into theories about cover-ups and shadowy plots: if they believe the world is a trustworthy place, they are less able to convince themselves that political rivals are engaging in nefarious, secretive plots, the authors of that 2015 study wrote.\n\n(However, the causality may flow in both directions here; another recent study from researchers at Boston University showed that exposure to conspiracy theories made people more likely to distrust the government.)\n\nMotivated reasoning. This is a bit of jargon for the idea that people will interpret new information in a way that confirms their existing worldviews and identities — even when that information contradicts how they think. For example, when a new study shows evidence of climate change, a climate change skeptic might shrug it off as a bad study, a fluke or a hoax.\n\nSo it's not terribly surprising that if you identify strongly as a Democrat, you'd be more likely to believe misinformation that paints Republicans in a bad light, and vice versa. This is also tied to low trust — if you firmly believe the government is untrustworthy, you might be more willing to believe that it faked a moon landing, for example, even if evidence says otherwise.\n\nDuring the George W. Bush presidency, far more Democrats than Republicans believed that the U.S. government was covering up information about the Sept. 11 attacks. Likewise, surveys have shown that a large share of Republicans believe President Obama is Muslim — in one 2015 survey, it was 43 percent, compared with 15 percent of Democrats.\n\nEven worse, the trend of increased political polarization — like the U.S. has been experiencing for decades — may further boost the motivated reasoning effect, according to a 2013 study.\n\nAs people dig in to their positions and identify thoroughly with a particular side, that can make changing misguided beliefs all the harder; our beliefs become linked to who we think we are. As Dartmouth political scientist Brendan Nyhan — one of the foremost researchers in the field of why people believe misinformation — put it in a 2016 paper, beliefs seem to be closely linked to people's worldviews and may be accordingly difficult to dislodge without threatening their identity or sense of self.\n\nParty identification. Low trust is associated with a readiness to believe conspiracy theories with Democrats and Republicans alike, but the same may not be true for political knowledge. The 2015 study that found that low trust is associated with belief in misinformation also found that high-knowledge conservatives were more likely to believe unfounded theories, while the same wasn't true of liberals.\n\nIf that's true, then it means that conservative politicians and pundits can more readily rely on conspiracies as an effective means to activate their base than liberals, the authors wrote.\n\nImportantly, however, this may be a function of current politics — that is, at a time when a Democratic president has been in office for nearly eight years. Right now, in particular, Republicans far more than Democrats believe they are the losers in politics, as Kyle Saunders, one of the study's authors, pointed out in an email.\n\nThat may be one reason for the discrepancy in their willingness to believe in conspiracy theories about Democrats — after all, people who believe their team is losing are also more likely to feel angry and frustrated at the government, as the Pew Research Center has found. And, likewise, it might square with the fact that conspiracy theories against Republicans were common while Bush was in office.\n\nRepetition. Simply talking about a rumor — even when you're correcting it — can make people believe it more. In one study last year, MIT political science professor Adam Berinsky presented subjects with news stories about Obamacare death panels and the idea that elderly patients would be forced to discuss euthanasia with their doctors.\n\nThe stories came in a few different types: Some simply mentioned the rumor, but others mentioned the rumor along with refutations from a nonpartisan source like the American Medical Association or a Democratic or Republican politician.\n\nHe found that GOP refutations were the most effective — a Republican senator saying, No, there is no euthanasia clause in the ACA would seem to change people's minds more than the American Medical Association. Meanwhile, hearing the rumors alongside a correction from a nonpartisan or Democratic source may have even raised the number of people who accepted the rumors.\n\nNot only that, but he also found that asking people to recall the entire articles weeks later — even articles containing refutations — made them more likely to believe the rumors than if they were asked to recall a minor detail from the articles. That is evidence of what psychologists call fluency — the notion that people will find a more familiar idea more believable.\n\n(This means covering particularly loud rumors becomes a dilemma for journalists: Covering it could spread misinformation, but not covering it means not explaining a story to your audience. The best answer, Nyhan wrote in the Columbia Journalism Review, is to label conspiracy theories for what they are, and not give them more room than necessary.)\n\nSo how do you get misinformation out of people's heads?\n\nThe above list provides a few clues to how people's false beliefs could be reversed ... and it isn't promising. For his part, Berinsky says that he feels he has been largely unsuccessful in figuring out how to get people to give up their unfounded beliefs.\n\nOne less-than-encouraging trend: Trust in government — as well as a variety of institutions, and even in other people — has plummeted in recent decades. Reversing that kind of a seismic shift in the national psyche could be next to impossible.\n\nLikewise, if polarization does make motivated reasoning worse, that's another big problem. Polarization among congressional members is at its highest point since at least the late 19th century, and polarization among Americans has also grown drastically, a result of an array of factors that seem difficult, if not impossible to reverse: self-sorting; segmented media; the political issues that are important; and the party realignments of the 1960s and '70s.\n\nHowever, there are a few lessons here: For example, getting the right person to do the fact-checking can make all the difference. Berinsky pointed to McDonalds' decision years ago to get rid of Super Size fries, amid widespread demand for more healthful fast-food options.\n\nIf a business is selling french fries and they're telling you french fries aren't good for you, that's a really credible source, Berinsky said.\n\nThat means a Democrat denouncing Sept. 11 truthers or John McCain telling a town hall attendee that Obama is not a Muslim would probably be more effective corrections than if a nonpartisan source had made them.\n\nSo when former Speaker of the House (and Trump supporter) Newt Gingrich warned Fox & Friends hosts against trusting TV-doctor diagnoses ...\n\nYouTube\n\n... that might have served to shake a few #HillaryHealth believers.\n\nJournalists can also learn a few useful things from these studies. Repeating a rumor too much can make it stick, for example. Furthermore, using graphics in a fact check seems to make it stick more easily, as Nyhan has found.\n\nThe broader picture\n\nPolitical conspiracy theories are nothing new in the U.S. — just look to Richard Hofstadter's classic 1964 essay on the paranoid style in American politics for proof. He lists our country's long history of believing in shadowy forces — in the 1700s and 1800s, conspiracy theories about Masons and the Illuminati were common, for example.\n\nStill, there's some evidence — if anecdotal — that the problem is getting worse. In a December article on conspiracy theories, Vox's Dave Roberts pointed to a quote from Republican Rep. Devin Nunes, as reported by Ryan Lizza:\n\nThe overwhelming majority of [Rep. Nunes's] constituent mail is now about the far-out ideas, and only a small portion is 'based on something that is mostly true.' He added, 'It's dramatically changed politics and politicians, and what they're doing.' \n\nBelief in rumors and conspiracy theories appears shallow, but widespread — it's not that there are a lot of Americans who fear chemtrails, wear tinfoil hats, and believe that mysterious cigarette-smoking men are hiding the truth about UFOs. In that 2015 paper, Berinsky presented subjects with seven rumors, and found that only 5 percent of subjects believed all seven. However, each subject believed 1.8 on average.\n\nIt's not that there are some people who believe a lot of crazy things, Berinsky has said. There are a lot of people who believe some crazy things.\n\nAll this means politicians can usually rely on at least some people to believe and spread misinformation. That means some exploit that power (and will continue to do so). Reversing all this misinformation? That ... well, that could take a while.\n\nAll in all, this would appear to be a difficult cycle to break as identities have become even more hardened over time, Saunders said. Things can change, and the feedback loop can be escaped, but it will be a long, slow process unless dramatic change occurs on the American political landscape.
Democratic Debate Exposes Deep Divides Among Candidates Over Health Care\n\ntoggle caption Win McNamee/Getty Images\n\nOnce again, health care took up a large chunk of a Democratic primary debate. Once again, there were fights over costs, coverage and whether the party is growing too extreme.\n\nBut this time, all of the front-runners were onstage together, providing the first opportunity for all of them to take direct aim at each other and their vastly differing health care plans. It made for some heated exchanges, putting Medicare for All supporters on defense. But it also showed clearly that some candidates are cautious not to criticize others' proposals too harshly.\n\nThursday night's debate featured two stalwart supporters of the single-payer Medicare for All health care plan: Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who introduced the bill, and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, one of the bill's co-sponsors. And from the start, former Vice President Joe Biden came out swinging at them.\n\nHow are we going to pay for it? I want to hear tonight how that's happening, he said, making the case that his public option proposal would cost less.\n\nOne of the main arguments against Medicare for All is that it would mean much higher government spending. Supporters counter that it would lead to overall less health care spending than the current system. (Studies have been mixed on this question of whether costs would be higher or lower.)\n\nWhat would change, they argue, is that the spending would be done by the government, with taxpayer dollars, rather than via copays and premiums, for example.\n\nWarren drove at this point when moderator George Stephanopoulos asked about the potential for higher taxes for everyday Americans. In her answer, she did not give a flat yes or no — and avoided giving an endlessly sound-bite-able answer about the potential for higher taxes for everyday Americans.\n\nInstead of paying premiums into insurance companies and then having insurance companies build their profits by saying no to coverage, we are going to do this by saying everyone is covered by 'Medicare for All,' every health care provider is covered, she said. And the only question here in terms of difference is where to send the bill.\n\nThere are also many Democrats, such as Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, who stress that Medicare for All would virtually eliminate private insurance.\n\nWhile Bernie wrote the bill, I read the bill, she said. And on Page 8 of the bill, it says that we will no longer have private insurance as we know it. And that means that 149 million Americans will no longer be able to have their current insurance in four years.\n\nPolling has shown that many Americans don't understand that private insurance would largely disappear under Medicare for All; polling has also shown that the idea of eliminating private insurance makes the plan much less popular.\n\nAltogether, eight candidates on Thursday's stage support either a public option or some other sort of overhaul that would still maintain a substantial role for private insurance.\n\nPolling shows that a public option is far more popular than single-payer health care. A July NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll found that 90% of Democrats, as well as 70% of all adults, support a public option. Meanwhile, 64% of Democrats (and 41% of all adults) support Medicare for All.\n\nThat's less support, but still a majority of Democrats support Sanders' single-payer plan, some of them passionately.\n\nPerhaps with that in mind, even candidates who support other plans refrained from attacking the proposal — or its author — too hard.\n\nFor example, while Klobuchar slammed Medicare for All, she made sure to praise Sanders himself for working with her on trying to bring down prescription drug prices.\n\nCalifornia Sen. Kamala Harris, who co-sponsored Sanders' bill, sold her plan as a  'Medicare for All' plan, though it is substantially different from what Sanders has proposed. (It would, for example, retain a significant role for private insurance.) She also took care to praise Sanders, even while she supports a different plan.\n\nI want to give credit to Bernie, she said. Take credit, Bernie. You know, you brought us this far in 'Medicare for All.' \n\nNew Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, who also co-sponsored Sanders' plan, said Thursday, I believe in 'Medicare for All,'  but he also proposed a more incremental approach. Indeed, in past debates, when asked, he did not indicate that he would be willing to get rid of private insurance, which Sanders' bill would largely do.\n\nIn responding to Biden's attacks, Warren made sure to praise former President Barack Obama, saying, We all owe huge debt to President Obama for the Affordable Care Act. Likewise, Biden hugged Obama tightly in promoting his own plan, saying that it would build on Obamacare.\n\nObamacare is popular among Democrats — 84% have a favorable view of it — and it has grown in popularity among all Americans since Donald Trump's election. However, all Democrats in this field agree that it needs an overhaul. The balancing act that many are trying to do is pushing their own plans without slamming others' too hard.
Fact Check: Donald Trump's Speech On Immigration\n\nPBS NewsHour YouTube\n\nAfter more than a week of seeming to change direction on immigration policy, and then apparently turning back to his original plan, Donald Trump delivered a speech on the issue Wednesday night in Phoenix.\n\nTrump painted a grim picture of immigrants in the U.S. illegally. He brought up families of victims of crimes committed by immigrants in the U.S. illegally. But who is he appealing to with this message? It's more of a primary crowd than a general-election one.\n\nGallup, which has tracked public opinion on this issue, found that 65 percent of Americans favor a path for immigrants who are living illegally in the U.S. to remain in the country and become citizens if they meet certain requirements over time. That's essentially reflected in the vote margin of the 2013 Senate bill — 68 U.S. senators voted in favor of comprehensive immigration reform that included only a path to citizenship after immigrants pay fines and wait more than a decade without committing a crime.\n\nWho does agree with Trump? At least half of Republicans — 31 percent of them want all immigrants in the U.S. illegally deported. An even higher percentage of Americans (72 percent) favor some path to legal status after a period of time, according to the Pew Research Center, including 56 percent of Republicans. During the 2013 immigration debate, House Republicans pushed legalization but not citizenship. After two weeks of flirting with possibly coming around to that House GOP position, Trump is now firmly to their right in a country that is growing decreasingly white and increasingly Latino.\n\nNPR's politics team annotated Trump's speech below. Portions we commented on are highlighted, followed by analysis, context and fact check in italics.\n\nWhat a crowd, what a beautiful crowd. Thank you, thank you. Wow. That's a lot of people, Phoenix, that's a lot of people. Thank you very much. Thank you.\n\nThank you, Phoenix. I am so glad to be back in Arizona. A state that has a very, very special place in my heart. I love the people of Arizona, and together we are going to win the White House in November. Now, you know, this is where it all began for me. Remember that massive crowd also. So I said let's go have some fun tonight; we're going to Arizona.\n\nThis will be a little bit different; this won't be a rally speech per se.\n\nInstead, I'm going to deliver a detailed policy address on one of the greatest challenges facing our country today, illegal immigration.\n\nI've just landed, having returned from a very important and special meeting with the president of Mexico. A man I like and respect very much and a man who truly loves his country, Mexico.\n\nAnd by the way, just like I am a man who loves my country, the United States.\n\nWe agreed on the importance of ending the illegal flow of drugs, cash, guns and people across our border and to put the cartels out of business.\n\nWe also discussed the great contributions of Mexican American citizens to our two countries, my love for the people of Mexico and the leadership and friendship that we have between Mexico and the United States. It was a thoughtful and substantive conversation, and it will go on for a while, and in the end we're all going to win. Both countries. We're all going to win.\n\nThis is the first of what I expect will be many, many conversations, and in a Trump administration we're going to go about creating a new relationship between our two countries. But it's going to be a fair relationship; we want fairness.\n\nBut to fix our immigration system, we must change our leadership in Washington and we must change it quickly. Sadly, sadly, there is no other way. The truth is our immigration system is worse than anybody ever realized. But the facts aren't known because the media won't report on them, the politicians won't talk about them, and the special interests spend a lot of money trying to cover them up because they are making an absolute fortune. That's the way it is.\n\nToday, on a very complicated and very difficult subject, you will get the truth. The fundamental problem with the immigration system in our country is it serves the needs of wealthy donors, political activists and powerful, powerful politicians. It's all you can do, thank you, thank you.\n\nLet me tell you who it does not serve. It does not serve you, the American people. Doesn't serve you.\n\nWhen politicians talk about immigration reform, they usually mean the following: amnesty, open borders, lower wages.\n\n[The bipartisan immigration reform bill (the Gang of Eight bill) the Senate passed in 2013 would not have meant open borders — it would have increased border security, for example, and included an employer verification system, as Politico reported at the time. — Danielle Kurtzleben]\n\nImmigration reform should mean something else entirely. It should mean improvements to our laws and policies to make life better for American citizens.\n\nBut if we're going to make our immigration system work, then we have to be prepared to talk honestly and without fear about these important and very sensitive issues. For instance, we have to listen to the concerns that working people — our forgotten working people — have over the record pace of immigration and its impact on their jobs, wages, housing, schools, tax bills and general living conditions.\n\n[Trump lamented the record pace of immigration, but between 2009 and 2014, the U.S. has actually seen more Mexican immigrants LEAVING the U.S. than coming in, a net loss of 140,000 immigrants. — Domenico Montanaro]\n\nThese are valid concerns expressed by decent and patriotic citizens from all backgrounds all over. We also have to be honest about the fact that not everyone who seeks to join our country will be able to successfully assimilate. Sometimes it's just not going to work out.\n\nIt's our right as a sovereign nation to choose immigrants that we think are the likeliest to thrive and flourish and love us.\n\nThen there's the issue of security. Countless innocent American lives have been stolen because our politicians have failed in their duty to secure our borders and enforce our laws like they have to be enforced. I have met with many of the great parents who lost their children to sanctuary cities and open borders. So many people. So many, many people. So sad. They will be joining me on the stage in a little while, and I look forward to introducing — these are amazing, amazing people.\n\nCountless Americans who have died in recent years would be alive today if not for the open border policies of this administration and the administration that causes this horrible, horrible thought process. It's called Hillary Clinton. This includes incredible Americans like 21-year-old Sarah Root. The man who killed her arrived at the border, entered federal custody and then was released into the U.S. — think of it — into the U.S. community under the policies of the White House, Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. Weak, weak, weak policies. Weak and foolish policies. He was released again after the crime, and now he's out there at large. Sarah had graduated from college with a 4.0, top student in her class, one day before her death. Also among the victims of the Obama-Clinton open border policy was Grant Ronnebeck, a 21-year-old convenience store clerk and a really good guy from Mesa, Ariz. A lot of you have known about Grant. He was murdered by an illegal immigrant gang member previously convicted of burglary who had also been released from federal custody. And they knew it was going to happen again.\n\nAnother victim is Kate Steinle, gunned down in the sanctuary of San Francisco by an illegal immigrant deported five previous times. And they knew he was no good. Then there's the case of 90-year-old Earl Olander, who was brutally beaten and left to bleed to death. Ninety-years-old and defenseless. The perpetrators were illegal immigrants with criminal records a mile long who did not meet Obama administration standards for removal. And they knew it was going to happen.\n\nIn California, a 64-year-old Air Force veteran, a great woman according to everybody that knew her, Marilyn Pharis was sexually assaulted and beaten to death with a hammer. Her killer had been arrested on multiple occasions but was never, ever deported despite the fact that everybody wanted him out.\n\n[Trump cited multiple cases of people who had crimes committed against them, sometimes violent crimes. He noted the case of Marilyn Pharis of California. CBS News reported she was killed in a violent assault. One suspect was in the U.S. illegally and had been arrested two weeks earlier for meth possession. The Santa Maria, Calif., police chief lambasted the system. You know what we had to do? We had to cite him out, that's the problem with this system, this is not just in Santa Maria, this is all over the state of California and all over the United States. ... I am not remiss to say that from Washington, D.C., to Sacramento there's a blood trail leading to the bedroom of Marilyn Pharis. — Domenico Montanaro]\n\nA 2011 report from the Government Accountability Office found that illegal immigrants and other non-citizens in our prisons and jails together had around 25,000 homicide arrests to their names. 25,000. On top of that, illegal immigration costs our country more than $113 billion a year, and this is what we get.\n\nFor the money we are going to spend on illegal immigration over the next 10 years, we could provide one million at-risk students with a school voucher, which so many people are wanting.\n\nWhile there are many illegal immigrants in our country who are good people, many, many, this doesn't change the fact that most illegal immigrants are lower-skilled workers with less education who compete directly against vulnerable American workers and that these illegal workers draw much more out from the system than they can ever possibly pay back. And they're hurting a lot of our people that cannot get jobs under any circumstances.\n\nBut these facts are never reported. Instead the media, and my opponent, discuss one thing and only one thing: The needs of people living here illegally. In many cases, by the way, they're treated better than our vets. Not going to happen anymore, folks, Nov. 8. Not going to happen anymore.\n\nThe truth is the central issue is not the needs of the 11 million illegal immigrants or however many there may be — and honestly we've been hearing that number for years. It's always 11 million. Our government has no idea. It could be 3 million, it could be 30 million, they have no idea what the number is.\n\n[The count of immigrants in the country illegally is an estimate, but several estimates put it in the same ballpark — and it's the 11 million ballpark, nowhere near 30 million. The Pew Research Center puts it at 11.3 million (a number that has held relatively steady for years, by its estimate, and is down by nearly 1 million from a recent peak in 2007). As of January 2012, the Department of Homeland Security put the count at 11.4 million. Trump has in fact made the 30 million claim before, and PolitiFact shot him down, labeling it pants on fire, finding other independent estimates that were in the 11 to 12 million range. — Danielle Kurtzleben]\n\nFrankly, our government has no idea what they're doing on many, many fronts, folks. But whatever the number, that's never really been the central issue. It will never be a central issue. It doesn't matter from that standpoint.\n\nAnyone who tells you the core issue is the needs of those living here illegally has simply spent too much time in Washington.\n\nOnly the out-of-touch media elites think the biggest problem facing American — you know this, you know this, this is what they talk about — facing American society today is that there are 11 million illegal immigrants who don't have legal status. And they also think the biggest thing — and you know this — is not nuclear, it's not ISIS, it's not Russia, it's not China, it's global warming.\n\nTo all politicians, donors and special interests, hear these words from me and all of you today. There is only one core issue in the immigration debate, and that issue is the well-being of the American people. Nothing even comes a close second. Hillary Clinton, for instance, talks constantly about her fears that families will be separated. But she's not talking about the American families who have been permanently separated from their loved ones because of a preventable homicide, because of a preventable death, because of murder. No, she's only talking about families who come here in violation of the law. We will treat everyone living or residing in our country with great dignity, so important. We will be fair, just and compassionate to all. But our greatest compassion must be for our American citizens.\n\n[Trump has made crime committed by immigrants in the U.S. illegally a major theme of his campaign. While he has spotlighted several real cases of murders committed by people in the country illegally, the context here is important. Multiple analyses have found that immigrants commit violent crime at a lower rate than those born in the United States. — Sarah McCammon]\n\nThank you, thank you.\n\nPresident Obama and Hillary Clinton have engaged in gross dereliction of duty by surrendering the safety of the American people to open borders, and you know it better than anybody right here in Arizona, you know it. President Obama and Hillary Clinton support sanctuary cities. They support catch and release on the border. They support visa overstays. They support the release of dangerous, dangerous, dangerous criminals from detention. And they support unconstitutional, executive amnesty.\n\nHillary Clinton has pledged amnesty in her first 100 days, and her plan will provide Obamacare, Social Security and Medicare for illegal immigrants breaking the federal budget. On top of that, she promises uncontrolled, low-skilled immigration that continues to reduce jobs and wages for American workers and especially for African-American and Hispanic workers within our country, our citizens.\n\nMost incredibly, because to me this is unbelievable, we have no idea who these people are, where these people are. I always say Trojan horse — watch what's going to happen, folks, it's not going to be pretty. This includes her plan to bring in 620,000 new refugees from Syria and that region over a short period of time. And even yesterday when you were watching the news, you saw thousands and thousands of people coming in from Syria. What is wrong with our politicians, our leaders, if we can call them that. What the hell are we doing?\n\nHard to believe, hard to believe.\n\nNow that you've heard about Hillary Clinton's plan, about which she has not answered a single question, let me tell you about my plan.\n\n[Agree with Clinton's immigration policies or not, it's impossible to argue she has not answered a single question about them. She recently answered questions about immigration at a conference of black and Hispanic journalists, for example, and she has addressed questions about it in other interviews as well. — Danielle Kurtzleben]\n\nAnd you notice all the time for weeks and weeks, they're debating my plan, debating it, talking about it, what about this, what about that? They never even mention her plan on immigration because she doesn't want to get into the quagmire, it's a tough one. She doesn't know what she's doing except open borders and let everybody come in and destroy our country, by the way.\n\nWhile Hillary Clinton meets only with donors and lobbyists, my plan was crafted with the input from federal immigration officers, very great people, among the top immigration experts anywhere in this country, who represent workers, not corporations. Very important to us.\n\nI also worked with lawmakers who've led on this issue on behalf of American citizens for many years. And, most importantly, I've met with the people directly impacted by these policies. So important.\n\nNumber one. Are you ready? Are you ready? We will build a great wall along the southern border. And Mexico will pay for the wall. 100 percent. They don't know it yet, but they're going to pay for the wall. And they're great people, and great leaders, but they're going to pay for the wall.\n\n[The cost estimates for a wall along the border vary widely. Trump has put the cost at $8 billion to $12 billion, but other estimates have run as high as $25 billion, according to PolitiFact. — Sarah McCammon [After his meeting with Donald Trump today, Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto reiterated his insistence that Mexico would not pay for construction of a border wall. Peña Nieto said he made that clear to Trump during their meeting, although Trump told reporters that the issue of payment was not discussed. — Scott Horsley]\n\nOn day one, we will begin working on an impenetrable, physical, tall, powerful, beautiful southern border wall. We will use the best technology, including above- and below-ground sensors, that's the tunnels. Remember that, above and below. Above and below ground sensors. Towers, aerial surveillance and manpower to supplement the wall, find and dislocate tunnels, and keep out criminal cartels, and Mexico, you know that, will work with us. Mexico will work with us, I absolutely believe it. And especially after meeting with their wonderful, wonderful president today, I really believe they want to solve this problem along with us, and I'm sure they will.\n\n[Trump told reporters after meeting with Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto in Mexico City that they had discussed the wall but not who would pay for it. Peña Nieto says he made it clear Mexico will not pay, and Mexico's foreign minister says this position is nonnegotiable. — Sarah McCammon]\n\nNumber two, we are going to end catch and release.\n\nUnder my administration, anyone who illegally crosses the border will be detained until they are removed out of our country and back to the country from which they came. And they'll be brought great distances; we're not dropping them right across. They learned that, President Eisenhower, they dropped them across, right across, and they'd come back. Then when they flew them to a long distance, all of a sudden that was the end. We will take them great distances, but we will take them to the country where they came from. OK?\n\n[Trump cited President Eisenhower, referencing his Operation Wetback, the program undertaken by Eisenhower to deport immigrants in the U.S. illegally. FactCheck.org notes that he deported some 2.1 million, a figure that is criticized as inflated by guesswork. More have been deported during President Obama's time in office. No one has deported as many as 11 million who are currently within the U.S. — Domenico Montanaro]\n\nNumber three, number three. This is the one I think this it's so great, it's hard to believe people don't even talk about it. Zero tolerance for criminal aliens. Zero. Zero. Zero. They don't come in here, they don't come in here.\n\nAccording to federal data, there are at least 2 million, 2 million, think of it, criminal aliens now inside of our country. Two million people, criminal aliens. We will begin moving them out, day one, as soon as I take office, day one, in joint operation with local, state and federal law enforcement.\n\nNow, just so you understand, the police, who we all respect. Say hello to the police. Boy, they don't get the credit they deserve, I can tell you. They're great people. But the police and law enforcement, they know who these people are. They live with these people. They get mocked by these people. They can't do anything about these people, and they want to. They know who these people are.\n\nDay one, my first hour in office, those people are gone. And you can call it deported if you want — the press doesn't like that term. You can call it whatever the hell you want, they're gone.\n\nBeyond the 2 million, and there are vast numbers of additional criminal illegal immigrants who have fled. But their days have run out in this country. The crime will stop. They're going to be gone. It will be over.\n\nThey're going out, they're going out fast.\n\nMoving forward, we will issue detainers for all illegal immigrants who are arrested for any crime whatsoever, and they will be placed into immediate removal proceedings if we even have to do that. We will terminate the Obama administration's deadly non-enforcement policies that allow thousands of criminal aliens to freely roam our streets, walk around, do whatever they want to do. Crime all over the place. That's over, that's over folks. That's over.\n\nSince 2013 alone, the Obama administration has allowed 300,000 criminal aliens to return back into United States communities — these are individuals encountered or identified by ICE but who are not detained or processed for deportation because it wouldn't have been politically correct.\n\nMy plan also includes cooperating closely with local jurisdictions to remove criminal aliens immediately. We will restore the highly successful Secure Communities program, good program. We will expand and revitalize the popular 287(g) partnerships, which will help to identify hundreds of thousands of deportable aliens in local jails that we don't even know about. Both of these programs have been recklessly gutted by this administration. And those were programs that worked. This is yet one more area where we are headed in a totally opposite direction.\n\nThere's no common sense, there's no brain power in our administration by our leader or our leaders. None, none, none.\n\nOn my first day in office, I am also going to ask Congress to pass Kate's Law — named for Kate Steinle — to ensure that criminal aliens convicted of illegal re-entry receive strong mandatory minimum sentences. Strong, and then we get 'em out.\n\nAnother reform I am proposing is the passage of legislation named for Detective Michael Davis and Deputy Sheriff Danny Oliver, two law enforcement officers recently killed by a previously deported illegal immigrant. The Davis-Oliver bill will enhance cooperation with state and local authorities to ensure that criminal immigrants and terrorists are swiftly, really swiftly, identified and removed. And they're going to go fast, believe me, they're going to go fast.\n\nWe are going to triple the number of ICE deportation officers. Within ICE, I am going to create a new special Deportation Task Force, focused on identifying and quickly removing the most dangerous criminal illegal immigrants in America who have evaded justice. Just like Hillary Clinton has evaded justice, OK? Maybe they'll be able to deport her.\n\nThe local police know who every one of these criminals and they know each and every one, by name, by crime, they will work so fast, and our local police will be so happy that they don't have to be abused by these thugs anymore. There's no great mystery to it; they've put up with it for years.\n\nAnd now, finally, we will turn the tables, and law enforcement and our police will be allowed to clear up this dangerous and threatening mess.\n\nWe're also going to hire 5,000 more Border Patrol agents, who gave me their endorsement, 16,500 gave me their endorsement, and put more of them on the border, instead of behind desks, which is good. We will expand the number of Border Patrol stations significantly.\n\n[Trump makes no mention of the potential cost of hiring 5,000 more Border Patrol agents. According to Politico and USA Today, there are currently about 21,000 Border Patrol agents. Trump proposes an increase of about 25 percent. [Nowhere in Trump's speech does he acknowledge that apprehensions of Mexicans attempting to cross the Southern border are decreasing, according to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection Report for 2015. — Richard Gonzales]\n\nI've had a chance to spend time with these incredible law enforcement officers, and I want to take a moment to thank them. What they do is incredible. And getting their endorsement means so much to me, more to me really than I can really say. It means so much — first time they've ever endorsed a presidential candidate.\n\n\n\n[Trump noted that the Border Patrol endorsed him. It's true that the National Border Patrol Council, the union of U.S. Border Patrol agents, endorsed him during the primary, calling Trump the only candidate who actually threatens the established powers that have betrayed this country. But it hasn't been without controversy. The Los Angeles Times noted that the rank-and-file seem as polarized about Trump as the rest of the nation, with some going so far as to challenge their union leaders' decision. — Domenico Montanaro]\n\nNumber four: Block funding for sanctuary cities. We block the funding, no more funding.\n\nWe will end the sanctuary cities that have resulted in so many needless deaths. Cities that refuse to cooperate with federal authorities will not receive taxpayer dollars, and we will work with Congress to pass legislation to protect those jurisdictions that do assist federal authorities.\n\nNumber five: Cancel unconstitutional executive orders and enforce all immigration laws.\n\nWe will immediately terminate President Obama's two illegal executive amnesties, in which he defied federal law and the Constitution to give amnesty to approximately 5 million illegal immigrants. 5 million. And how about all of the millions who are waiting on line going through the process legally? So unfair.\n\n[In 2012, President Obama granted a temporary reprieve from deportation to certain immigrants who were brought to the country illegally as children. Upwards of 600,000 young people took advantage of that offer, which also made them eligible for work permits. In 2014, Obama tried to expand his deportation reprieve to millions of additional immigrants, most of whom had children who are U.S. citizens or were Green Card holders. Texas and other states challenged that action, and a federal judge in Texas put the president's executive order on hold. That stay remains in place, after a shorthanded Supreme Court deadlocked 4-4 earlier this year. — Scott Horsley]\n\nHillary Clinton has pledged to keep both of these illegal amnesty programs — including the 2014 amnesty, which has been blocked by the United States Supreme Court. Great. Clinton has also pledged to add a third executive amnesty. And by the way, folks, she will be a disaster for our country. A disaster. In so many other ways. And don't forget the Supreme Court of the United States, don't forget that. When you go to vote Nov. 8. And don't forget your Second Amendment and don't forget the repeal and replacement of Obamacare. And don't forget building up our depleted military. And don't forget taking care of our vets. Don't forget our vets, they've been forgotten.\n\nClinton's plan would trigger a constitutional crisis unlike almost anything we have ever seen before. In effect, she would be abolishing the lawmaking powers of Congress in order to write her own laws from the Oval Office. And you see what bad judgment she has. She has seriously bad judgment.\n\nIn a Trump administration, all immigration laws will be enforced. Will be enforced.\n\nAs with any law enforcement activity, we will set priorities.\n\nBut, unlike this administration, no one will be immune or exempt from enforcement — and ICE and Border Patrol officers will be allowed to do their jobs the way their jobs are supposed to be done. Anyone who has entered the United States illegally is subject to deportation — that is what it means to have laws and to have a country. Otherwise we don't have a country.\n\nOur enforcement priorities will include removing criminals, gang members, security threats, visa overstays, public charges — that is, those relying on public welfare or straining the safety net, along with millions of recent illegal arrivals and overstays who've come here under the current administration.\n\n[By prioritizing removal of immigrants who commit crimes, threaten security and who have arrived recently, Trump is essentially mirroring the enforcement priorities of the Obama administration. — Scott Horsley]\n\nNumber six, we are going to suspend the issuance of visas to any place where adequate screening cannot occur.\n\n[Trump's position on which potential immigrants to keep out of the country because of terrorism fears has shifted multiple times throughout his campaign. Late last year, following a mass shooting in San Bernardino, Calif., Trump began with a call to ban all Muslims from entering the United States. In June, after a gunman who had pledged loyalty to ISIS shot and killed 50 people, including himself, at an Orlando nightclub, Trump called for banning refugees from countries with a terrorist presence, even though the shooter was born in the United States. In his acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention, Trump repeated a similar position and also talked about countries where thorough vetting is difficult. He's also recently called for what he describes as extreme vetting based on ideology. — Sarah McCammon]\n\nAccording to data provided to the Senate Subcommittee on Immigration and the National Interest, between 9/11 and the end of 2014, at least 380 foreign-born individuals were convicted in terror cases inside the United States. And even right now, the largest number of people are under investigation for exactly this, that we've ever had in the history of our country. Our country is a mess. We don't even know what to look for anymore, folks. Our country has to straighten out, and we have to straighten out fast.\n\nThe number is likely higher, but the administration refuses to provide this information to Congress.\n\nAs soon as I enter office, I am going to ask the Department of State, which has been brutalized by Hillary Clinton, brutalized, Homeland Security and the Department of Justice to begin a comprehensive review of these cases in order to develop a list of regions and countries from which immigration must be suspended until proven and effective vetting mechanisms can be put into place. I call it extreme vetting, right? I want extreme, it's going to be so tough, and if somebody comes in, that's fine, but they're going to be good. It's extreme. And if people don't like it, we gotta have a country, folks. Gotta have a country.\n\n[It's true that Obama administration officials have expressed concerns about how to screen refugees from war-torn regions with little documentation. But the White House also says refugees undergo the most rigorous vetting process of any category of immigrants entering the United States. — Sarah McCammon]\n\nCountries from which immigration will be suspended would include places like Syria and Libya. And we are going to stop the tens of thousands of people coming in from Syria.\n\nWe have no idea who they are, where they come from, there's no documentation, there's no paperwork. It's going to end badly, folks, it's going to end very, very badly.\n\n[Trump claimed there's no paperwork. But that's not true. Lots is known about them, and they already undergo rigorous screening. NPR's Brian Naylor has reported that refugees are currently screened by several different agencies, and fingerprints are taken, biographical information is collected. They are then each individually interviewed by U.S. officials trained to verify that they are bona fide refugees. Refugees from Syria are then subject to additional screening that looks at where they came from and what caused them to flee their home. And all that takes an average of a year and a half to two years. — Domenico Montanaro]\n\nFor the price of resettling one refugee in the United States, 12 could be resettled in a safe zone in their home region, which I agree with 100 percent. We have to build safe zones, and we'll get the money from the gulf states. We don't want to put up the money; we owe almost $20 trillion. Double since Obama took office. Our national debt. But we will get the money from gulf states and others. We'll supervise it, we'll build safe zones, which is something I think all of us want to see.\n\nAnother reform involves new screening tests for all applicants that include — and this is so important, especially if you get the right people, and we will get the right people — an ideological certification to make sure that those we are admitting to our country share our values and love our people.\n\nThank you, we're very proud of our country aren't we? With all it's going through, we're very proud of our country.\n\nFor instance, in the last five years, we've admitted nearly 100,000 immigrants from Iraq and Afghanistan — in these two countries, according to Pew research, a majority of residents say that the barbaric practice of honor killings against women are often or sometimes justified, that's what they say. That's what they say, they're justified. And we're admitting them through our country.\n\nApplicants will be asked for their views about honor killings, about respect for women and gays and minorities, attitudes on radical Islam, which our president refuses to say, and many other topics as part of the vetting procedure. And if we have the right people doing it, believe me, very few people will slip through the cracks. Hopefully none.\n\nNumber seven: We will ensure that other countries take their people back when we order them deported.\n\nThere are at least 23 countries that refuse to take their people back after they have been ordered to leave the United States, including large numbers of violent criminals. They won't take 'em back. So we say, OK, we'll keep 'em.\n\n[According to a recent New York Times article, 23 countries are considered largely uncooperative in taking back their citizens. The U.S. has released 8,000 immigrants with criminal convictions (both with legal status and those who are in the country illegally) since 2013. The issue, the Times explained, is that some countries won't take these people back, but the Supreme Court has also ruled that the U.S. can't detain these people indefinitely. — Danielle Kurtzleben]\n\nNot going to happen with me, folks, not going to happen. Due to a Supreme Court decision, if these violent offenders cannot be sent home, our law enforcement officers have to release them into your communities. And by the way, the results are horrific, horrific. There are often terrible consequences, such as Casey Chadwick's tragic death in Connecticut just last year. Yet, despite the existence of a law that commands the secretary of state to stop issuing visas to these countries, Secretary Hillary Clinton ignored this law and refused to use this powerful tool to bring nations into compliance. And they would comply if we would act properly. In other words, if we had leaders who knew what they were doing, which we don't.\n\nThe result of her misconduct was the release of thousands and thousands of dangerous criminal aliens who should have been sent home to their countries. Instead, we have 'em all over the place. Probably a couple in this room, as a matter of fact. But I hope not.\n\nAccording to a report from the Boston Globe, from the year 2008 through 2014, nearly 13,000 criminal aliens were released back into U.S. communities because their home countries would not under any circumstances take them back. Hard to believe with the power that we have. We're like the big bully that keeps getting beat up, that keep getting beat up. These 13,000 releases occurred on Hillary Clinton's watch — she had the power and the duty to stop it cold, and she decided she would not do it. And Arizona knows better than most exactly what I'm talking about.\n\n[Trump appears to be referring to this Boston Globe article in which ICE told the Globe that 12,941 were released from 2008 to 2014. The numbers were actually higher, over 86,000, the Globe notes, between 2013 and 2015 alone. The 12,941 figure was a number that the Supreme Court forced ICE to release, according to the Globe. Not all were violent criminals, and some 140 countries would not cooperate with deportations. It's not clear, however, what specifically Donald Trump is suggesting Hillary Clinton could have done about that. — Domenico Montanaro]\n\nThose released include individuals convicted of killings, sexual assault and some of the most heinous crimes imaginable. The Boston Globe writes that a Globe review of 323 criminals released in New England from 2008 to 2012 found that as many as 30 percent committed new offenses, including rape, attempted murder and child molestation. We take 'em, we take 'em.\n\nNumber eight, we will finally complete the biometric entry-exit visa tracking system, which we need desperately.\n\nFor years, Congress has required biometric entry-exit visa tracking systems, but it has never been completed. The politicians are all talk, no action. Never happens, never happens. Hillary Clinton, all talk — unfortunately, when there is action, it's always the wrong decision, do you ever notice?\n\nIn my administration, we will ensure that this system is in place — and I will tell you, it will be on land, it will be on sea, it will be in air. We will have a proper tracking system. Approximately half of new illegal immigrants came on temporary visas and then never, ever left. Why should they? Nobody's telling them to leave. Stay as long as you want, we'll take care of you. Beyond violating our laws, visa overstays — and they really are a big problem — pose a substantial threat to national security. The 9/11 Commission said that this tracking system should be a high priority and would have assisted law enforcement and intelligence officials in August and September 2001 in conducting a search for two of the 9/11 hijackers that were in the U.S. on expired visas. And you know what that would have meant, what that could have meant. Wouldn't that have been wonderful? What that would have meant.\n\nLast year alone, nearly a half a million individuals overstayed their temporary visas. Removing visa overstays will be a top priority of my administration.\n\n[A substantial number of people in the U.S. illegally entered the country legally, but have overstayed visas. Last year, when Marco Rubio said 40 percent of people in the nation illegally have overstayed visas, PolitiFact rated it mostly true. Fresh estimates of the figure aren't available, the site wrote, but the 40 percent figure seemed to be a fairly good estimate. — Danielle Kurtzleben]\n\nIf people around the world believe they can just come on a temporary visa and never ever leave — the Obama-Clinton policy, that's what it is — then we have a completely open border and we no longer have a country. We must send the message that visa expiration dates will be strongly enforced.\n\nNumber nine, we will turn off the jobs and benefits magnet.\n\nWe will ensure that E-Verify is used to the fullest extent possible under existing law, and will work with Congress to strengthen and expand its use across the country.\n\n[E-Verify is an online system that allows employers to check whether job applicants are authorized to work in this country. It's used by less than 10 percent of employers today, but expanding the system was an important component of the bipartisan immigration bill passed by the Senate in 2013. (It died in the House.) E-Verify faces lingering challenges, including false negatives when people who should be allowed to work are shown to be ineligible, and privacy concerns. — Scott Horsley]\n\nImmigration law doesn't exist just for the purpose of keeping out criminals. It exists to protect all aspects of American life — the worksite, the welfare office, the education system and everything else. That is why immigration limits are established in the first place. If we only enforce the laws against crime, then we have an open border to the entire world.\n\nWe will enforce all of our immigration laws.\n\nThe same goes for government benefits. The Center for Immigration Studies estimates that 62 percent of households headed by illegal immigrants used some form of cash or non-cash welfare programs, like food stamps or housing assistance. Tremendous costs, by the way, to our country. Tremendous costs. This directly violates the federal public charge law designed to protect the U.S. Treasury.\n\nThose who abuse our welfare system will be priorities for immediate removal.\n\nNumber 10, we will reform legal immigration to serve the best interests of America and its workers. The forgotten people, workers. We're going to take care of our workers. And by the way, we're going to make great trade deals. We're going to negotiate trade deals, we're going to be bring our jobs back home, we're going to bring our jobs back home. We have the most incompetently worked trade deals ever negotiated probably in the history of the world, and that starts with NAFTA. And now they want to go TPP, one of the great disasters. And if countries want to leave Arizona, and if they want to leave other states, there's going to be a lot of trouble for them, it's not going to be so easy. There will be consequence, remember that. There will be consequence. They're not going to be leaving, go to another country, make the product, sell it to the United States, and all we end up with is no taxes and total unemployment. It's not going to happen; there will be consequences.\n\nWe've admitted 59 million immigrants to the United States between 1965 and 2015.\n\nMany of these arrivals have greatly enriched our country, so true. But we now have an obligation to them, and to their children, to control future immigration — as we have following, if you think, previous immigration waves, we've had some big waves, and tremendously positive things have happened, incredible things have happened — to ensure assimilation, we want to ensure that it works. Assimilation, an important word, integration and upward mobility.\n\nWithin just a few years, immigration as a share of national population is set to break all historical records.\n\nThe time has come for a new immigration commission to develop a new set of reforms to our legal immigration system in order to achieve the following goals:\n\nTo keep immigration levels, measured by population share, within historical norms\n\nTo select immigrants based on their likelihood of success in U.S. society, and their ability to be financially self-sufficient. We take anybody, come on in, just anybody. Not anymore. You know, folks, it's called a two-way street. It's a two-way street.\n\nWe need a system that serves our needs, not the needs of others — remember, under a Trump administration it's called America First.\n\nTo choose immigrants based on merit, merit, skill and proficiency. Doesn't that sound nice?\n\nAnd to establish new immigration controls to boost wages and to ensure that open jobs are offered to American workers first. And that, in particular, African-American and Latino workers who are being shut out in this process so unfairly. And Hillary Clinton is going to do nothing for the African-American worker, the Latino worker, she's going to do nothing. Give me your vote, she says, on Nov. 8, and then she'll say so long, see you in four years. That's what it is. She's going to do nothing. Just look at the past — she's done nothing, she's been there for 35 years, she's done nothing. And I say, what do you have to lose? Choose me, watch how good we're going to do together, watch. You watch.\n\nWe want people to come into our country, but they have to come into our country legally and properly vetted, and in a manner that serves the national interest.\n\nWe've been living under outdated immigration rules from decades ago. They're decades and decades old. To avoid this happening in the future, I believe we should sunset our visa laws so that Congress is forced to periodically revise and revisit them. They're archaic, they're ancient. We wouldn't put our entire federal budget on autopilot for decades, so why should we do the same for the very, very complex subject of immigration?\n\nSo let's now talk about the big picture.\n\nThese 10 steps, if rigorously followed and enforced, will accomplish more in a matter of months than our politicians have accomplished on this issue in the last 50 years. It's what's going to happen, folks.\n\nBecause I am proudly not a politician, because I am not beholden to any special interest, I've spent a lot of money on my campaign, I'll tell you, I write those checks. Nobody owns Trump. I will get this done for you and your family. You'll be proud of our country again. We'll do it right.\n\nWe will accomplish all of the steps outlined above, and when we do, peace and law and justice and prosperity will prevail. Crime will go down, border crossings will plummet, gangs will disappear, and the gangs are all over the place, and welfare use will decrease.\n\n[Trump said welfare use will decrease when he's president. But it is a myth that immigrants in the U.S. illegally qualify for those subsidies. As CNN noted in 2014: Undocumented immigrants do not qualify for welfare, food stamps, Medicaid, and most other public benefits. Most of these programs require proof of legal immigration status and under the 1996 welfare law, even legal immigrants cannot receive these benefits until they have been in the United States for more than five years. Still, some households of immigrants in the U.S. illegally do receive some form of subsidies because of children born in the U.S. who qualify. A right-leaning immigration think tank did an analysis showing immigrant households receive more on average than nonimmigrant households that also receive benefits. But that study has been criticized as fatally flawed. — Domenico Montanaro]\n\nWe will have a peace dividend to spend on rebuilding America, beginning with our American inner cities. We're going to rebuild them for once and for all.\n\nFor those here illegally today who are seeking legal status, they will have one route and only one route: to return home and apply for re-entry like everybody else under the rules of the new legal immigration system that I have outlined above. Those who have left to seek entry under this new system, and it will be an efficient system, will not be awarded surplus visas, but will have to enter under the immigration caps or limits that will be established in the future.\n\n[Here Trump endorses the notion that people will be forced, or will choose to return home, and then get in line to come here legally. According to the State Department, there are currently 1.3 million Mexicans who are waiting in line for a visa. Only a small fraction have any realistic hope of seeing a visa anytime soon. Trump is talking about establishing new visa caps or limits under rules that haven't been determined. — Richard Gonzales]\n\nWe will break the cycle of amnesty and illegal immigration. There will be no amnesty.\n\nOur message to the world will be this: you cannot obtain legal status, or become a citizen of the United States, by illegally entering our country.\n\nThis declaration alone will help stop the crisis of illegal crossings and illegal overstays, very importantly. People will know that you can't just smuggle in, hunker down, and wait to be legalized. It's not going to work that way. Those days are over.\n\nImportantly, in several years, when we have accomplished all of our enforcement goals – and truly ended illegal immigration for good, including the construction of a great wall, which we will have built in record time and at a reasonable cost, which you never hear from the government and the establishment of our new lawful immigration system — then and only then will we be in a position to consider the appropriate disposition of those who remain. That discussion can only take place in an atmosphere in which illegal immigration is a memory of the past, no longer with us, allowing us to weigh the different options available based on the new circumstances at the time.\n\n[This was the big question mark coming into tonight's speech. Trump has sent mixed signals in recent days over how he would handle the millions of immigrants who are living in the country illegally but whose only crime was crossing the border without authorization. Trump made it clear tonight that there will be no path to legalization for these immigrants, short of returning to their home country and reapplying. But he left open the question of whether broader deportations would be necessary. — Scott Horsley]\n\nRight now, however, we are in the middle of a jobs crisis, a border crisis, and a terrorism crisis like never before.\n\n[It's hard to characterize the current job market as being in crisis, especially considering where it has been. Unemployment is at 4.9 percent, down from a post-recession high of 10 percent. There are still some signs of problems left over from the recession — the length of unemployment still hasn't quite recovered to prerecession levels, for example. However, the economy is looking solid enough that chatter is building about the Fed raising interest rates soon — Federal Reserve Vice Chair Stanley Fischer recently said that the U.S. is very close to full employment. — Danielle Kurtzleben]\n\nAll energies of the federal government and the legislative process must now be focused on immigration security. That is the only conversation we should be having at this time. Immigration security, cut it off.\n\nWhether it's dangerous materials being smuggled across the border, terrorists entering on visas, or Americans losing their jobs to foreign workers, these are the problems we must now focus on fixing — and the media needs to begin demanding to hear Hillary Clinton's answer on how her policies will affect Americans and their security.\n\nThese are matters of life-and-death for our country and its people, and we deserve answers from Hillary Clinton. And you notice? She doesn't answer. She didn't go to Louisiana, she didn't go to Mexico, she was invited, she doesn't have the strength or the stamina to make America great again, believe me.\n\nWhat we do know, despite the lack of media curiosity, is that Hillary Clinton promises a radical amnesty combined with a radical reduction in immigration enforcement. Just ask the Border Patrol about Hillary Clinton. You won't like what you're hearing. The result will be millions more illegal immigrants, thousands more violent horrible crimes, and total chaos and lawlessness. That's what's going to happen, as sure as you're standing there.\n\nThis election is our last chance — and I believe this — to secure the border, stop illegal immigration, and reform our laws to make your life better. I really believe this is it. This is our last time. Nov. 8, Nov. 8. You gotta get out and vote Nov. 8. It's our last chance, it's our last chance. And that includes Supreme Court justices and Second Amendment, remember that.\n\nSo I want to remind everyone what we are fighting for — and who we are fighting for.\n\nSo I am going to ask — these are really special people that I've gotten to know — all the Angel Moms to come join me on the stage right now. These are amazing women.\n\n[The family of Kate Steinle did not appear onstage with Trump. It has a federal lawsuit pending against the former sheriff of San Francisco and two federal agencies, blaming them for Kate Steinle's death. — Richard Gonzales]\n\nI've become friends with so many:\n\n{PAUSE FOR ANGEL MOMS — EACH SAYS THE NAME OF THEIR CHILD OR FAMILY MEMBER AND EXPRESSES SUPPORT FOR TRUMP INTO THE MICROPHONE}\n\nThat is tough stuff, I will tell you. Incredible people. Now is the time for these voices to be heard.\n\nNow is the time for the media to begin asking questions on their behalf.\n\nNow is the time for all of us, as one country, Democrat and Republican, liberal and conservative, to band together to deliver justice and safety and security for all Americans.\n\nLet's fix this horrible, horrible problem. It can be fixed quickly.\n\nLet's secure our border.\n\nLet's stop the drugs and the crime.\n\nLet's protect our Social Security and Medicare.\n\nAnd let's get unemployed Americans off of welfare and back to work in their own country. This has been an incredible evening. We're going to remember this evening. Nov. 8, we have to get everybody — this is such an important state, we have to get everybody to go out and vote. We're going to bring, thank you, thank you.\n\nWe're going to take our country back, folks. This is a movement. We're going to take our country back. Thank you, thank you. This is an incredible movement. The world is talking about it. The world is talking about it. And by the way, if you haven't been looking at what's been happening with the polls in the last 3-4 days, you should start looking.\n\nTogether, we can save American lives, American jobs, and American futures.\n\nTogether, we can save America itself.\n\nJoin me in this mission, we're going to Make America Great Again.\n\nThank you, I love you, thank you, God bless you, everybody!
Stakes High For Democrats And Republicans In Bid To Rush ACA To Supreme Court\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Jacquelyn Martin/AP Jacquelyn Martin/AP\n\nYou're forgiven if in the holiday blur you missed that a federal appeals court in New Orleans has once again put the future of the Affordable Care Act in doubt. Or if you missed the news last week that a group of Democratic state attorneys general has asked the Supreme Court to hear the case in this term — which ends in June. That would mean a decision could come right in the middle of the 2020 presidential and congressional campaigns.\n\nIt is not at all clear that the high court will take the case at this point (although it is seeking a response from Republican attorneys general, the plaintiffs in the case, by this Friday).\n\nThe court does not generally accept cases that come to it before lower-court rulings are complete.\n\nHowever, writing recently in the New England Journal of Medicine, Nicholas Bagley, a University of Michigan law professor, suggests that the four liberals on the court may opt to roll the dice and vote to take the case because they can probably count on Chief Justice John Roberts, who has twice turned back more substantial challenges to the law and is unlikely to embrace a lawsuit as weak as this one.\n\nStill, while it takes only four votes for the court to hear a case, it takes five to hear it on an expedited basis. That would mean the liberal justices would have to entice Roberts or another conservative to hear it this term.\n\nThe stakes could not be higher. Republicans, who originally rode their spirited criticism of President Barack Obama's signature health law to take control of Congress, suffered serious election defeats in 2018. Democrats that year won the day by raising fears that people with chronic medical issues might not be able to get health insurance if Republicans prevailed or that patients who gained Medicaid eligibility through the ACA could lose their Medicaid coverage.\n\nRepublicans are unlikely to want another fight about preexisting conditions and other popular provisions of the health law, just weeks before the next election. Recent polling shows that some of the major provisions of the law are highly popular, even among Republicans.\n\nBut for Democrats there are pitfalls in pushing for a court decision this term. They risk the court overturning the law or their creating the impression that they are trying to gin up a campaign issue.\n\nWhat happens next will affect both politics and policy in a major way.\n\nDemocrats seem confident they want the case heard now. Every day that Republicans' anti-health care lawsuit is allowed to endure is a day that American families will be forced to live in uncertainty and fear, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi noted in a statement released last week. Unless the Supreme Court acts, families will continue to face needless disruption in their coverage and premiums, states will be unable to plan for the future and protections for people with pre-existing conditions will remain in peril.\n\nAnd Republicans are content with the appeals court decision. The individual mandate is the centerpiece of Obamacare, and I am glad the Fifth Circuit recognized that it is unlawful, said Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, when the 5th Circuit decision came down before Christmas. Finally being rid of this law will be a victory for all Americans, Paxton said.\n\nBut let's back up a minute. How can the ACA once again come before the Supreme Court? Didn't the court uphold it in 2012? And again in 2015?\n\nYes and yes. Yet that didn't stop Republicans from campaigning to disable the law.\n\nIn 2017, after Republicans had captured the House, Senate and White House, Congress rather famously failed to repeal and replace Obama's signature health law. But Congress did, as part of the year-end tax bill, abolish the ACA's tax penalty for not having health insurance.\n\nEarly in 2018, a group of Republican state attorneys general got an idea, in the words of one of them, to rev up the base for that year's midterm elections. If the 2012 Supreme Court ruling upholding the law found it constitutional because the provision requiring people to have coverage was based on Congress' ability to impose a tax penalty, then wouldn't eliminating the penalty render the entire rest of the law unconstitutional?\n\nThe Republican argument was dismissed by many legal scholars. But U.S. District Judge Reed O'Connor in Fort Worth, Texas, shocked legal and health policy circles in December 2018 when he ruled that the entire law should be struck down. He said zeroing out the penalty rendered unconstitutional the provisions most closely related to the penalty — those requiring insurers to sell policies to everyone at the same price, even if they had preexisting health conditions.\n\nThe Democratic attorneys general appealed (joined by the now Democratic-led House of Representatives).\n\nAnd the Trump administration changed its position. Originally it argued that eliminating the penalty should invalidate only the preexisting condition provisions. But last March, the Justice Department announced it was advocating for the entire law to be struck down.\n\nThe three-judge appeals court panel heard the case in July.\n\nWhen the panel's decision was released in December, two judges agreed that, without the penalty, the remaining individual mandate was unconstitutional. But rather than explicitly agree or disagree with the lower-court ruling about the fate of the remainder of the enormous health law, the majority opted to send the case back to the lower court to employ a finer-toothed comb regarding which parts of the law should be allowed to continue and which would need to go.\n\nThat, of course, could take at least another year, possibly more. So, the Democrats defending the law decided to seek Supreme Court review now.\n\nWe're asking the Supreme Court to swiftly resolve this repeal lawsuit for the sake of saving lives and ending uncertainty in our health care system, said a statement from California Attorney General Xavier Becerra, who is leading the coalition.\n\nIn the meantime, the issue of health care, already top of mind for many voters, could become bigger regardless of what happens. The irony is that the best-case scenario for each party, at least politically, is the one it doesn't actually want — because the loser in major court cases often gets the biggest political bounce by energizing an angry base. For the Democrats, that would likely occur if the health law were struck down, while the Republicans could benefit if the law were upheld.\n\nThe Supreme Court's decision on whether to take the case this term could come in the next few weeks.\n\nKaiser Health News is an editorially independent program of the Kaiser Family Foundation.

Clashes Intensify During Democratic Presidential Debate\n\nDemocratic presidential candidates Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders and Martin O'Malley took the stage in Sunday's debate in Charleston, S.C. It was the final debate before the Iowa caucuses.\n\nRENEE MONTAGNE, HOST:\n\nAnd when it comes to American politics, Democratic presidential candidates Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders and Martin O'Malley clashed last night. This time in an NBC News debate in Charleston, S.C. As Mara Liasson reports, the exchanges were sharper and more intense because the race has changed.\n\nMARA LIASSON, BYLINE: In the first three debates Hillary Clinton practically ignored Bernie Sanders. But she threw that approach out the window last night in an effort to stop his momentum. Sanders is threatening to erase Clinton's lead in key early states, a fact he was happy to point out when asked by the NBC moderators why he's still trailed Clinton by 2 to 1 among African-American voters.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE)\n\nBERNIE SANDERS: As Sec. Clinton well knows, when this campaign began she was 50 points ahead of me. We were all of three percentage points. Guess what? In Iowa, New Hampshire, the race is very, very close. Maybe we're ahead in New Hampshire.\n\nLIASSON: And Sanders said he's even beating Donald Trump in some of the hypothetical general election polls.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE)\n\nSANDERS: To answer your question, when the African-American community becomes familiar with my Congressional record and with our agenda and with our views on the economy and criminal justice, just as the general population has become more supportive, so will the African-American community, so will the Latino community.\n\nLIASSON: Not if Hillary Clinton can help it. She was on offense last night tearing into Sanders on health care, taxes and guns. The debate was just a few blocks from the church where a mass shooting last year left nine worshipers dead.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE)\n\nHILLARY CLINTON: I have made it clear, based on Sen. Sanders' own record, that he has voted with the NRA, with the gun lobby numerous, times. He voted against the Brady Bill five times. He voted for what we call the Charleston loophole. He voted for immunity from gun makers and sellers, which the NRA said was the most important piece of gun legislation in 20 years.\n\nLIASSON: Sanders defended himself but never explained why just this week he reversed himself on immunity for gun makers.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE)\n\nSANDERS: Well, I think Sec. Clinton knows that what she says is very disingenuous. I have a D-minus voting record from the NRA.\n\nLIASSON: The Clinton campaign had tried all week to put Sanders on the defensive for not explaining how he would pay for the single-payer health care plan he wants to put in place of Obamacare. Two hours before the debate last night, Sanders' campaign released some details - new taxes on employers, households and a hike in income taxes. Sanders admitted some middle-class families would be paying slightly more in taxes, but...\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE)\n\nSANDERS: It's one thing to say I'm raising taxes. It's another thing to say that we are doing away with private health insurance premiums. So if I save you $10,000 in private health insurance and you pay a little bit more in taxes, in total, there are huge savings in what your family is spending.\n\nLIASSON: A single-payer-Medicare-for-all plan is still very popular with the Democratic base. But Clinton pointed out that Sanders' plan couldn't get support in a Democratic Congress.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE)\n\nCLINTON: And even during the Affordable Care Act debate, there was an opportunity to vote for what was called the public option. In other words, people could buy in to Medicare. And even when the Democrats were in charge of the Congress, we couldn't get the votes for that. So what I'm saying is really simple. This has been the fight of the Democratic Party for decades. We have the Affordable Care Act. Let's make it work.\n\nLIASSON: For his part, Sanders stuck to his stump speech attacks on billionaires, big banks and the campaign-finance system. He repeatedly called for a political revolution. And with some backup from Martin O'Malley, who also took part in the debate, Sanders portrayed Clinton as part of the system he wants to overthrow. He attacked her for taking $600,000 in speaking fees from Goldman Sachs. Clinton defended herself by invoking Obama, who is very popular with Democrats and nowhere more so than in South Carolina, where the majority of Democratic primary voters are African-American.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE)\n\nCLINTON: He has criticized President Obama for taking donations from Wall Street. And President Obama has led our country out of the great recession. Sen. Sanders called him weak, disappointing. He even, in 2011, publicly sought someone to run in a primary against President Obama. So I'm going to defend President Obama for taking on Wall Street.\n\nLIASSON: Democratic voters are attracted to Sanders' passionate calls to change the status quo. But Clinton is hoping they also care about preserving President Obama's legacy and that she is the candidate tough enough and pragmatic enough to do that. This was the Democrats' last debate before voters go to the polls in Iowa and New Hampshire. A Sanders victory in both states could change the dynamic of the race in other places where Clinton currently has a big lead, like South Carolina.

6 Takeaways From The 6th Democratic Debate\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Justin Sullivan/Getty Images Justin Sullivan/Getty Images\n\nListen to The NPR Politics Podcast here.\n\nThe impeachment of President Trump has dominated the news this week. But the political focus shifted to the Democratic presidential candidates Thursday night for their sixth debate, this one in Los Angeles and hosted by the PBS NewsHour and Politico.\n\nThe first subject to come up? Impeachment. But there are no real cleavages between the candidates on that subject. After all, each of the candidates thinks he shouldn't be in office. That's why they're running against him.\n\nThere was a notable moment when former Vice President Joe Biden defended his continued regard for bipartisanship despite him and his family coming under attack from Republicans in the Ukraine saga.\n\nIf anyone has reason to be angry with the Republicans and not want to cooperate, it's me, Biden said, adding, I have no love. But the fact is, we have to be able to get things done. And when we can't convince them, we go out and beat them like we did in the 2018 election in red states and in purple states.\n\n1. Biden was steady\n\nBiden was crisper than in most of the other debates, and, unlike those other debates, his steadiness lasted mostly all the way through. He sidestepped a question, about whether he would run for a second term if elected, given his age — 77. And he was, at times, tougher with his opponents. For example, telling Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont to put his hand down while Biden was finishing an answer.\n\nBiden didn't dominate the debate, and, at times, he faded from view, but that's something of a win for him. The steadier he is, the fewer of Biden's supporters — and potential supporters — will be wringing their hands.\n\n2. Buttigieg came under attack\n\nIt took awhile for it to happen, but, as expected, South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg faced some pointed attacks. Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts went after him on fundraising (yes, in a wine cave) and Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota on his experience.\n\nThe mayor just recently had a fundraiser that was held in a wine cave full of crystals and served $900-a-bottle wine, Warren said. Think about who comes to that.\n\nI have not denigrated your experience as a local official, Klobuchar said, pointedly contrasting Buttigieg's municipal job with hers in Congress.\n\nButtigieg parried the attacks with some skill, especially toward Warren on fundraising. I am literally the only person on this stage who is not a millionaire or a billionaire, he said, adding, This is the problem with issuing purity tests you cannot yourself pass.\n\nButtigieg also hit back at Klobuchar, noting that he had won the 2015 South Bend mayor's race with 80% of the vote as a gay dude in Mike Pence's Indiana.\n\nBut Klobuchar got the last word, noting he had lost the 2010 race for Indiana state treasurer by 20 points. I'm sorry. That's just the math. (It was 25 points.)\n\nButtigieg has been surging in Iowa and New Hampshire, and both Warren and Klobuchar see him as an obstacle to their candidacies. He leads with college-educated whites, a group Warren is second with, according to the latest NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll. And for Klobuchar to have a chance at the nomination, she has to do well in Iowa, as she's from a neighboring state.\n\n3. Money remains a key divide — and potential problem for Democrats\n\nThe exchange between Warren and Buttigieg on fundraising highlighted an important split in the Democratic Party — how to raise money.\n\nBut it also highlighted another reality — money is important in politics.\n\nPolling shows Democratic primary voters want to get money out of politics, but running presidential campaigns costs billions of dollars. Literally, billions.\n\nAnd here's the reality: President Trump doesn't care where the money comes from, and, so far, is raking in far more than any of the Democratic candidates.\n\nIt's not an easy decision, especially because I support a robust system of public financing of elections, Barack Obama said in 2008 of his decision to forgo public financing. But the public financing of presidential elections, as it exists today, is broken and we face opponents who've become masters of gaming this broken system.\n\nDemocrats will have a lot of catching up to do on the fundraising front once a nominee is named. It's one reason incumbent presidents have such an advantage.\n\n4. Some issues came up that hadn't and others got attention in different ways\n\nClimate change was a focus earlier than in past debates.\n\nAnd other topics, which have received little-to-no attention, also came up — everything from trade and China to Muslim Uighurs and Israel and the Palestinian territories.\n\nIt's a reminder that there are lots of things a president has to deal with — and often has more control over — than many of the topics that dominate presidential campaigns.\n\n5. Health care didn't come up until late\n\nOne topic that came up later than usual (10:06 p.m. ET, more than two hours into the debate) was health care. The candidates have debated health care ad nauseam in prior debates, but Thursday night's had a new wrinkle – whether the candidates calling for big change would be in favor of less sweeping measures if Medicare for All failed to pass Congress as a replacement for private health insurance .\n\nThe question was directed to Sanders, and he wouldn't say. We're going to have the American people behind us; we will have the Congress behind us, Sanders insisted.\n\nBiden said he didn't think that was realistic. And that highlights the real fracture in the Democratic Party primary — the purists versus the pragmatists.\n\nKlobuchar chimed in to defend both Biden and herself. I think you can be progressive and practical at the same time, she said, adding that Sanders' fight wasn't really with her or Biden, but with new House members from moderate districts and with Andy Beshear, the new Democratic governor of conservative Kentucky, who wants to build on Obamacare.\n\nIf you want to cross a river over some troubled waters, Klobuchar said, you build a bridge, you don't blow one up.\n\nNotably, the other candidate in favor of Medicare for All stayed silent for most of the exchange. When Warren did speak up, she answered the moderator's original question and noted some less-sweeping health care measures she supports and believes could pass Congress.\n\nLast month, Warren walked back her full-throated support of Medicare for All, endorsing an interim step – a Medicare for All option. It's a critical change for Warren. It makes her look more practical, and the move represents a pivot and admission that her full and uncompromising support of Medicare for All was hurting her presidential bid. After all, Medicare for All as a full replacement of private health insurance is much less popular than if presented as an option.\n\n6. Democrats had to deal with a less-diverse stage\n\nWith Sen. Kamala Harris of California dropping out of the race and Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey and former Obama housing secretary Julián Castro not qualifying for the debate, this was not only the smallest number of candidates on a Democratic stage this cycle, but it was also the least diverse.\n\nIt's both an honor and disappointment to be the lone candidate of color on the stage tonight, entrepreneur Andrew Yang said, adding that while he was called names for being Asian growing up, blacks and Latinos have something much more powerful working against them than words. They have numbers.\n\nYang noted that African Americans and Latinos have only a fraction of whites' net worth. These are the numbers that define race in this country, he said. And the question is, 'Why am I the lone candidate of color on this stage?' Fewer than 5% of Americans donate to political campaigns. You know what you need to donate to political campaigns? Disposable income.\n\nThe other candidates on stage tried to point out, in different ways, their own claims to diversity. Buttigieg noted that he is the son of an immigrant father and at least twice made reference to being gay.\n\nWarren and Klobuchar highlighted, in sometimes humorous ways, that they were the only women on stage. Warren, 70, was asked about the fact that if elected, she would be the oldest person to take office as president (a distinction currently held by Trump; Biden and Sanders would be older still).\n\nI'd also be the youngest woman ever inaugurated, she quipped.\n\nAnd Klobuchar said she once pointed out to Trevor Noah of The Daily Show, in the history of the Senate, there was something like 2,000 men and only 50 women in the whole history. (The numbers are 1,926 and 56, according to Senate and House historians.)\n\nNoah's response, Klobuchar said:  'If a nightclub had numbers that bad, they would shut it down.' 
Despite Challenges To ACA, Florida Enrollment Rises\n\nThe annual enrollment period for health plans under the Affordable Care Act is underway and Florida is expected to lead the nation in signups. Despite legal challenges to the law, it remains popular.\n\nMICHEL MARTIN, HOST:\n\nAcross the country, it's the time of year when people sign up for health care plans under the Affordable Care Act. Although lawsuits and politics have raised questions about the program's future, the ACA - or Obamacare, as it's been known - is doing OK. NPR's Greg Allen reports that's especially true in Florida, which leads the nation in ACA enrollments.\n\nGREG ALLEN, BYLINE: Donna Shalala knows a lot about health care. A former secretary of Health and Human Services in the Clinton administration, she's now a Democratic congresswoman representing a Miami district that leads the nation in enrollments under the Affordable Care Act. She says there's a reason for that.\n\nDONNA SHALALA: We don't have a lot of big industry. There are a lot of people that are working part-time, have one or two part-time jobs that are low-income workers for whom the Affordable Care Act has been a lifesaver.\n\nALLEN: The Affordable Care Act has faced significant pushback since it was adopted in 2010, first from Republicans in Congress, and since 2016, from the Trump administration. The administration has slashed funds for marketing and outreach, which could be one reason enrollment dropped last year nationally. Jodi Ray, who directs a program that helps people enroll in ACA plans, says that's not the case in Florida.\n\nJODI RAY: Florida somehow continues to remain an anomaly, and our enrollment numbers continue to go up. So basically, the Affordable Care Act is working in Florida.\n\nALLEN: Ray's program, Florida Covering Kids and Families, used to have 152 so-called navigators working all year to help people sign up for ACA plans. Those funds have been cut by more than 80%. But as funding has been cut for outreach, in Miami, private insurance brokers have picked up some of the slack. At a mall in Miami, Sunshine Life and Health Advisors has a kiosk with signs prominently advertising it as the place to get Obamacare. Otto Hernandez is one of the managers.\n\nOTTO HERNANDEZ: We started with Affordable Care Act. We tried our translation in Spanish, and people had no idea what we were talking about. So most people know it by the nickname Obamacare.\n\nALLEN: Odalys Arevalo started the company with a partner in 2012, uncertain about how profitable it would be to enroll people in ACA plans. She's been pleasantly surprised.\n\nODALYS AREVALO: In the last six years, we've enrolled about 500,000 people.\n\nALLEN: From her kiosk at a Miami mall, her company has expanded, with locations now in Tampa, Orlando and West Palm Beach, plus hundreds of agents in Texas, Utah and other states.\n\nMARIO SUAREZ: You know why I'm calling, right? It's that time of year again.\n\nALLEN: At the company's call center, Mario Suarez says many of his clients are checking in to renew their coverage. Arevalo says after several years of turmoil, the market for ACA plans has stabilized. Premiums have dropped for the second year in a row, down an average of 4% nationally. In Florida, more companies are offering ACA plans. They're all signs, she believes, that the Affordable Care Act is here to stay.\n\nAREVALO: Now the insurance carriers are coming back into the market. I think that now carriers know that there is money to make and know how to make it. So now there's quite a different outlook on what the future of ACA is.\n\nALLEN: At a recent House hearing, the head of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid credited Trump administration policies for stabilizing the market and lowering premiums. That angered some ACA advocates, but not Democratic Congresswoman Donna Shalala.\n\nSHALALA: I'm happy they're taking credit. I want them to buy into this program.\n\nALLEN: In addition to cutting funds for outreach and enrollment efforts, Shalala points out that the Trump administration is supporting a federal lawsuit, now on appeal, that seeks to kill the law entirely.\n\nSHALALA: On one hand, they're doing everything they can to destroy the program. And on the other hand, they want to take some credit for the fact that health care costs have gone down.\n\nALLEN: Trump administration officials are downplaying the possibility that a court ruling could suddenly leave millions of people without health care. If the ACA is struck down, they maintain, they'll have a replacement plan ready. They just won't say what it is.\n\nGreg Allen, NPR News, Miami.\n\nCopyright © 2019 NPR. All rights reserved.

Time Running Short For Congress To Stabilize Individual Insurance Market\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption J. Scott Applewhite/AP J. Scott Applewhite/AP\n\nA bipartisan group of senators and House members has been working since last summer toward measures to keep prices from rising out of control and undermining the individual market—the market that serves people who don't get insurance through work or through the government. Members hope to attach a package of fixes to what should be the year's final temporary spending bill, due late this month.\n\nThe lawmakers are up against both a legislative clock and the insurance companies' timeline. Insurers have until summer to decide if they want to continue to sell policies on the ACA marketplaces, but many start making preliminary decisions as early as April. Without action, insurers say premiums will go up in 2019 due to the uncertainty. Consumers and the government would share those costs.\n\nIt is by no means clear whether any package could gain the votes needed in the House and Senate. Most Republicans are loath to be seen fixing Obamacare, although opinion polls clearly show they will be blamed for problems with the law going forward.\n\nPressure to improve the situation is being felt beyond Capitol Hill. Last week five governors (three Democrats, one Republican and one Independent) released a blueprint for a health system overhaul that includes several of the stabilization ideas under consideration in Congress.\n\nLawmakers in D.C. are looking at two primary fixes, although they could be combined.\n\nReinsurance\n\nOne, pushed by Sens. Susan Collins (R-Maine) and Bill Nelson (D-Fla.), is called reinsurance. This is a fund that would help insurers pay for the sickest patients and would guarantee the insurance companies do not face large losses. The idea is that if insurers don't have to worry about covering the expenses for their highest-cost patients, they can keep premiums lower for everyone.\n\nThe ACA had a temporary reinsurance program from 2014 to 2016. It was intended to help insurers get started in a market where sick people were able to buy their own insurance for the first time. Prior to the law, most insurers did not cover many people with preexisting health conditions. If they did, it was at an extremely high cost.\n\nSince the federal program ended, several states, including Minnesota and Alaska, have adopted, with some success, their own reinsurance programs in an attempt to hold premiums down.\n\nThe subsidy fix\n\nThe other proposal, negotiated by Sens. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) and Patty Murray (D-Wash.), would guarantee insurers would get money that the Trump administration cut off in October. The senators are advocating reinstating federal reimbursement for so-called cost-sharing reduction subsidies—discounts that the ACA requires insurers to provide to their lower-income enrollees to help reduce their deductibles and other out-of-pocket costs.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) pledged to Collins, in exchange for her vote on the GOP tax plan in December, that he would support bringing both bills to the floor for debate.\n\nThat has not happened. Although, in a statement, Collins said she is continuing to have productive discussions with Senate and House leaders about both bills.\n\nMeanwhile, a lot has changed, including new questions about whether the fixes would work.\n\nWould the fixes help?\n\nState insurance regulators managed to find a workaround for Trump's sudden cancellation of the federal cost-sharing payments.\n\nThe cancellation made some premiums higher but the subsidies the federal government gave to consumers also increased to cover those higher prices. That's because most states allowed insurers to offset the loss of these funds by attaching the premium increases to the plans that determine how much in subsidies enrollees get to pay those premiums. The result is that most people who get government help pay the same (or, in some cases, less), while insurers are effectively being paid back.\n\nThat means, however, if the cost-sharing reduction payments were reinstated for 2018, as the original legislation called for, insurers would have to give the excess money back to the government.\n\nAnalysts agree that would only add to the confusion.\n\nRestoring the federal payments for this year, says Joseph Antos of the conservative American Enterprise Institute, does not lower premiums this year, so it does absolutely no good to the average person.\n\nSome advocates have suggested that Congress should guarantee the payments for 2019 and 2020. But Antos says that also makes no sense because the insurers would then think 'Are we going to go through this again?'  They might raise premiums even further to make up for the uncertainty.\n\nAntos — and many other analysts — agree that instead, restoring or creating a new reinsurance program would likely do more to control premium increases.\n\nReinsurance will protect premiums for the people who are actually most subject to them, says Sherry Glied, a former Obama administration health official now at New York University. She was referring to those in the individual market who do not get government help and have been footing large premium increases for the past several years. That's because having protection against the largest bills would allow insurers to lower premiums across the board.\n\nPotential partisan roadblocks\n\nThen there are the political considerations.\n\nMany Republicans in Congress have called the cost-sharing reduction payments, in particular, a bailout to the insurance industry and are resistant to reinstate the payments.\n\nInstead, they seem more amenable to the idea of reinsurance, because they consider it a type of high-risk pool, which they have been pushing for years. House Speaker Paul Ryan said at an event in Wisconsin in January that I think there might be a bipartisan opportunity there to get risk pools, risk mechanisms.\n\nBut Republicans have made clear they want something in return for what could be considered a fix to the health law they despise.\n\nHealth and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar was careful to say in a meeting with reporters last week that the Trump administration has no formal position yet on the stabilization efforts. But, he said, I think it would need to be part of an entire set of reforms there that we would want to see. That would likely include more flexibility for states to opt out of some of the health law's coverage requirements.\n\nThe delay has made Democrats more demanding, too. The repeal of the ACA's penalties next year for people who don't have insurance has changed the situation dramatically, says Sen. Murray.\n\nAs I have made clear, the bipartisan bill I originally agreed on with Chairman Alexander will not make up for this latest round of Republican health care sabotage, she said in a statement. In fact, there are changes that now need to be made to our bill to ensure it meets its intended goals of keeping premiums down and stabilizing markets.\n\nWhat's at stake\n\nBut while Congress decides if it will take action, insurers are warning that doing nothing will lead to still higher premiums.\n\nPremium rates for a benchmark silver plan could rise by 27 percent in 2019, the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association said earlier this month.\n\nCongressional action on reinsurance and cost-sharing, the association predicted, would help push premium rates 17 percent below this year's levels.\n\nHealth plans are looking for certainty in the market, said Justine Handelman, senior vice president in the association's policy arm.\n\nIdeally, Congress would include the funding in measures adopted this month, said Handelman, who spoke with reporters during a briefing at the association's Washington, D.C., headquarters: Most plans are filing premium rates by April.\n\nKaiser Health News is a nonprofit news service covering health issues.

Facing Pressure In Campaign, Sanders Defends His Signature Health Care Plan\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Patrick Semansky/AP Patrick Semansky/AP\n\nHoping to regain momentum as two rival candidates creep closer in the polls, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders returned to his signature policy theme in a major speech Wednesday: a single-payer, Medicare for All health insurance system.\n\nThe time is now to go forward. The time is now to expand Medicare to every man, woman, and child in this country, Sanders told supporters and reporters in Washington, D.C.\n\nSanders outlined in broad strokes how he'd implement Medicare for All: He'd lower the eligibility age from 65 to 55 in the first year of the new program, then to 45, then 35, then eventually to every adult.\n\nChildren, Sanders said, would be eligible for the insurance program in the first year of the transition.\n\nSanders also said he also wants to expand Medicare beyond its current benefits to include dental coverage as well.\n\nThe desire to have teeth in your mouth is a health care issue, he said.\n\nSanders argues that universal, government-run health care would lower medical costs and eliminate insurance premiums, deductibles, and payments — but he also acknowledged his proposal would require tax increases.\n\nSanders mocked the idea of families celebrating the status-quo insurance costs that he has pledged to eliminate.\n\nOh my God, dear, the insurance premium is here, what a wonderful day, he said. Oh wow, let's celebrate.\n\nThe costs for a program like the one Sanders has outlined long have been a sticking point. Two years ago, California legislative analysts put the price tag of a potential single-payer health care system at $400 billion for California alone.\n\nThe bill in question died in California's Assembly, which is overwhelmingly Democratic.\n\nStriving to stand out\n\nThe speech comes at a time when Sanders is facing increasing pressure from other Democrats in the top tier of polling and fundraising: most notably, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and California Sen. Kamala Harris.\n\nWhile Sanders had long registered far above any other candidate but former Vice President Joe Biden, Harris and Warren have gained substantial ground in recent weeks.\n\nWarren has narrowly jumped past Sanders into second place, behind Biden, in a handful of surveys, and raised more money than Sanders from individual contributions in the last quarter.\n\nSanders' campaign leaders say they're aware of the shifting dynamics but they're not panicking.\n\nI think it's more of the case that other people are gaining some attention and traction. They are new candidates in the race, and that is a credit to them, said campaign manager Faiz Shakir. They're fresher to the scene for that reason, so you're seeing other candidates get a little more support, which is good. It's healthy. It's fine.\n\nStill, Sanders has been reluctant to criticize Warren, Harris and other candidates who have embraced large planks from his progressive platform, even as he competes with them for support.\n\nElizabeth [Warren] is a longtime friend of mine, she is a very good senator, Sanders recently told NPR. Elizabeth's running her campaign. I'm running my campaign.\n\nThe hesitance is especially notable since Harris has repeatedly vacillated on her support for a core aspect of the Sanders Medicare for All plan she has co-sponsored in the Senate: the complete elimination of private health insurance, outside of supplementary plans.\n\nIn a CNN interview this week, Harris said it would likely take more than four years to fully transition from the current health care system to Medicare for All.\n\nHarris also argued that preserving private health insurance ensures more coverage for more Americans without raising taxes on the middle class.\n\nSanders has acknowledged his health care proposals would require higher taxes — but argues it would also lower medical bills and eliminated insurance costs, making the increase worth it.\n\nAnd while Warren laid out several detailed policy plans during the initial months of her presidential campaign, she too did not unequivocally back the full elimination of private health insurance until last month's debate.\n\nInstead of pointing out those inconsistencies to progressives who may be migrating to support for Harris and Warren, Sanders has focused his fire on Biden, attacking what Sanders rejects as a middle ground approach to politics.\n\nBiden's less radical outlook\n\nIn the days since Biden unveiled a health care plan centered around the existing Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, and creating a public option government insurance plan, Sanders and his campaign have gone as far as comparing Biden's view on health care to President Trump's.\n\nEarlier this week, Sanders' camp sent an email to reporters warning that an Obamacare-centered health insurance plan leaves nearly 10 million people uninsured, and leaves people at the whims of their employers.\n\nThat's despite the fact that Sanders helped lead the effort to save the Affordable Care Act in 2017 and 2018, when Republican majorities in the House and Senate tried and failed to repeal Obamacare.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act took us a step forward, Sanders told NPR in 2017, even as he advocated for an eventual shift to a single-payer system. It provided health insurance for over 20 million more Americans. That's no small thing. It did away with the obscenity of preexisting conditions and a number of other essential health care benefits that are now guaranteed to the American people. So it made some real change.\n\nFor his part, Biden has framed Medicare for All as a risky elimination of an Affordable Care Act that he argues is already here and working.\n\nI knew Republicans would do everything in their power to repeal Obamacare. They still are. But I'm surprised that so many Democrats are running on getting rid of it, Biden said in a campaign video posted this week.\n\nI understand the appeal of Medicare for All, Biden said. But folks supporting it should be clear that it means getting rid of Obamacare, and I'm not for that.
Paul Ryan's First 100 Days Under President Trump\n\nMARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST:\n\nHow is this for a to-do list for the coming week - one, stop the federal government from shutting down; two, overhaul health care - again? Safe to say those two items are at the top of Paul Ryan's long to-do list for next week. The speaker of the House has until Friday to help shepherd a budget bill through Congress. Otherwise, it's government shutdown starting one week from today. Now, that would be Saturday April 29, Donald Trump's 100th day as president.\n\nMichael Warren is a senior writer for The Weekly Standard, the conservative magazine. And he is with me now in the studio. Good morning, Michael.\n\nMICHAEL WARREN: Good morning.\n\nKELLY: I want to start with this relationship that is still taking shape between President Trump and Speaker Ryan. They got off to a rocky start. Have they settled into a relationship where they can actually get anything done?\n\nWARREN: No. But I think it's...\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nKELLY: To be blunt.\n\nWARREN: That's all I have to say about that. No, it's an odd marriage. It's one that I don't think anybody - either party or any of the people around them - thought would happen. And so it's been uneasy from the beginning. I think the Obamacare repeal-and-replace debacle from last month really kind of put it into focus that these are two men who just don't have a lot of the same interests or motivations. And so next week is going to be interesting in terms of trying to get some of those agenda items through. I would put more money on getting the government funded than on any sort of health care bill.\n\nBut there's - it's a difficult relationship because they just don't see eye to eye on much. And - the president has an agenda he's trying to pass. The speaker is trying to corral 216 or so Republicans who all have different interests as well. There's just not a lot of communication between the two groups.\n\nKELLY: Well, let's stay with these two big items on the to-do list next week. As you said, the specter of the government running out of money on Friday tends to focus the mind. What will Speaker Ryan's strategy be for getting this done next week?\n\nWARREN: Just to get as many people on board - get that 216...\n\nKELLY: Get those 216...\n\nWARREN: ...Seventeen, however many people they need depending on how many votes there are. And I tend to think that there's going to be enough votes to do that. And the White House is not going to stand in Speaker Ryan's way. And there's really - even the Freedom Caucus, the sort of thorn in the side of House leadership, are not going to do that either because nobody...\n\nKELLY: They were the ones who were the major stumbling block for the White House and others trying to get the health care...\n\nWARREN: Absolutely.\n\nKELLY: ...Bill (unintelligible).\n\nWARREN: That was a big, sort of comprehensive bill that has a lot of - people have a lot of opinions on. Spending is obviously something that conservatives in the House have a lot of opinions on as well. But nobody seems to be really interested on either side of Pennsylvania Avenue in any kind of government shutdown where Republicans are in charge of all sides of the political government. So I think that is an easier task to complete. Health care is another story.\n\nKELLY: It is a whole other story. I - one assumes that Speaker Ryan is not eager for a replay of the way that unfolded last month. Do we have any insight into what his strategy is going to be? He's not going to put a health care bill on the floor unless he's confident it will pass.\n\nWARREN: That's right. We may see a replay of what happened in March, which was the White House essentially pushing, pushing, pushing. And House leadership - Speaker Ryan, Kevin McCarthy, the majority leader, saying, we don't have the votes. We don't have the votes. Now I think House leadership is in a bit of a stronger position to say - look, do you want a repeat of all the embarrassing coverage, particularly with all this somewhat arbitrary but still significant 100-day marker here? I think this is sort of a lot of noise, a lot of PR, not a lot of meat on these bones. I don't think there's going to be a vote.\n\nKELLY: Well, in a sentence or two, does Speaker Ryan control the House at this point?\n\nWARREN: He does. Yes, he does. The president does not. And it's this weird dynamic of having a Republican president with a Republican House that he doesn't have a lot of control over.\n\nKELLY: All right. That's Michael Warren, senior writer for The Weekly Standard. He has been reporting on the first hundred days of the Trump presidency. Michael, thanks.\n\nWARREN: Thanks.\n\nCopyright © 2017 NPR.

The Next Big Democratic Primary Showdown\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Courtesy of Ayanna Pressley; Asma Khalid/NPR Courtesy of Ayanna Pressley; Asma Khalid/NPR\n\nThe night Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez won a Democratic congressional primary in New York, Ayanna Pressley, a Boston city council member who is also challenging a 10-term Democratic House incumbent, tweeted a congratulatory photo.\n\nAnd Ocasio-Cortez responded with an equally effusive tweet of her own.\n\nIt's hard not to see similarities between Pressley's race in Massachusetts' 7th Congressional District and the recent Democratic upset in New York where Ocasio-Cortez defeated Rep. Joe Crowley, the No. 4 Democrat in the House who might have run to succeed Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi.\n\nPressley, 44, the first black woman elected to the Boston City Council in its 100-plus-year history, is taking on a 10-term white male incumbent, Rep. Michael Capuano, 66, who represents an urban district that encompasses Boston, Cambridge and surrounding suburbs, much of the area once represented by a young John F. Kennedy, and now often called the Kennedy seat.\n\nBut beyond the initial optics, the 7th District primary, which will be held on Sept. 4, is fundamentally different from that in the Bronx and Queens district where Ocasio-Cortez won.\n\nPressley is not an outsider nor does she identify as a Democratic Socialist as Ocasio-Cortez does. She has worked within Democratic Party institutions for most of her career, as a congressional aide for 16 years, first to Rep. Joe P. Kennedy II and then to Sen. John Kerry.\n\nCapuano doesn't have the same vulnerabilities as Crowley did in New York. He has taken Pressley as a serious challenger from the outset. He specifically courted endorsements from civil rights icon Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga., the Congressional Black Caucus PAC and former Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick.\n\nCapuano is also a known progressive. He supports Medicare-for-all, voted against the Iraq War, refused to attend President Trump's inauguration and has even supported an impeachment vote on the president.\n\nThe reality is both Pressley and Capuano have similar progressive policies. She calls for abolishing U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. He voted against the Homeland Security Act that originally established ICE.\n\nThere's no daylight between the public policy positions of both candidates, said Scott Ferson, a Democratic strategist, who helped Rep. Seth Moulton, D-Mass., successfully challenge a Democratic incumbent congressman in 2014.\n\nPressley concedes there is no difference in how they would vote on Capitol Hill, but she also insists that is not why she is running.\n\nThis was the seat held by John F. Kennedy, so having a progressive voting record is baseline, she said before referring to Kennedy's famous book. That is not necessarily a profile in courage.\n\nPressley says even if they vote identically on existing bills, they'll likely write and champion distinctive legislation. She points to the Mothers and Offspring Mortality and Morbidity Awareness Act, a bill to improve federal efforts to fight maternal mortality, an issue that disproportionately affects African-American mothers.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Asma Khalid/NPR Asma Khalid/NPR\n\nAs of yet, no one from our delegation has signed on the MOMMA Act as a co-sponsor, Pressley said. Now there are 12,000 bills, it's impossible to keep up, I don't think this means they don't care about it. But if I'm there, this is an issue I'm focused on.\n\nShe also points to her record as a Boston council member on gun violence, structural racism and the wage gap.\n\n\n\nCapuano points to his experience, seniority on committees and record of delivering both results and money for infrastructure projects around Boston.\n\nWith no major policy arguments, the fight boils down to representation, worldview and how much race, gender and age ought to matter in Democratic Party politics.\n\nAnd although a majority of residents in the Boston-area district are not white, an analysis by NPR member station WBUR found that a majority of voters are white.\n\nPressley's campaign slogan is change can't wait. She is tired of some people suggesting it's traitorous to challenge a fellow Democrat. She points out that the 7th District is the most diverse district in the state, but also has very high income inequality. And that's the message she delivers on campaign stops.\n\nListen, I'm not saying vote for me because I'm a black woman, but I won't pretend representation doesn't matter. It matters, she told a couple dozen women and girls of color at a Dominican restaurant in Boston.\n\nThis district is 57 percent people of color and almost 40 percent single-female-headed households. The district has changed, she said. The needs of this district have changed, and the job description has changed.\n\nBut Capuano, who has held this job for 20 years and never faced a serious challenge until now, takes issue with that line of criticism.\n\nAll districts change, he said. This district, greater Boston, is a very transient neighborhood. It's always changing.\n\nPlus, he insists, the district does not have a simple majority demographic.\n\nThere's no majority of any race, any creed, any ethnicity, anybody, he said. And anybody who wants to govern this district, really has to reach out to people that don't look like them ... and don't think like them.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Asma Khalid/NPR Asma Khalid/NPR\n\nCapuano struggles to understand why some voters think race and gender are relevant in this race.\n\nI've always been put off by identity politics on every level, he told The Boston Globe in May.\n\nWhen asked about representation, he tends to pivot the conversation back to his record on housing or transportation.\n\nLook, I cannot be a woman of color, he told WBUR in February. I just don't think there's that many people who will vote for me because I'm a white male, or against me because I'm a white male.\n\nWhen Capuano campaigns, he doesn't talk much about his opponent; he tries to focus on his own record. But he has said that it's unfortunate Democrats are spending time and money on a family fight when their real foe is President Trump.\n\nI hear people who want me to fight against Donald Trump. I hear people who talk to me about issues, and the issues I hear mostly, first of all, are Donald Trump on pretty much everything, Capuano said at a recent campaign stop in a Boston suburb.\n\nAt another stop in a senior center in his hometown of Somerville, Capuano never once mentioned his rival. Instead, he spoke about Medicare, the Affordable Care Act and Republicans.\n\nThere's a lot of way to kill something, one way is to bankrupt it, so even if they don't repeal it, say 'we're gonna get rid of Obamacare, we're gonna get rid of Medicare,' they can still bankrupt it, he told a group of a seniors.\n\nThere is no doubt that Capuano has the money and the loyalty of a popular incumbent.\n\nYou have to have a reason to turn Mike Capuano out of office, and I don't see that, said Ferson.\n\nBut all signs in the midterm elections suggest this is the year of the woman, specifically the Democratic woman. Doug Rubin, a Democratic consultant in Boston, says it's plausible voters might think Capuano has done a good job as a congressman and yet still want a change.\n\nThere is a real kind of organization around women voters who want to send a message to Trump, he said. And Ayanna is in a perfect position to take advantage of that.\n\nRegardless of who wins, Rubin says a family fight every so often is healthy. It motivates people to get to the polls and that may be just what Democrats need, he says, not just here in Massachusetts, but all over the country.
Chastened Lawmakers Aim For Small, Bipartisan Health Care Victories\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Zach Gibson/Getty Images Zach Gibson/Getty Images\n\nAfter Republicans in the Senate spectacularly failed to deliver on their promise to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, a smaller group of lawmakers is trying a new approach: Bring in the Democrats and aim low.\n\nIt starts Wednesday when the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee holds the first of four hearings over two weeks with the goal of passing a modest bill to help stabilize the Obamacare health insurance markets for 2018.\n\nCommittee Chairman Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., says he's looking to do something small, bipartisan and balanced.\n\nWhat's remarkable is that he made that statement in a joint press release last month with the committee's ranking Democrat, Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash.\n\nUp until recently, all major Republican efforts to alter Obamacare were launched with no Democratic support, and no attempts to get any.\n\nAlexander and Murray say they want to work first to stabilize the markets for next year and then perhaps move on to broad reforms that will attract more insurance companies to compete in the individual markets, potentially making prices lower for consumers.\n\nThey've got a short window. Insurance companies have until Sept. 27 to sign contracts committing them to offering health plans on the Affordable Care Act exchanges next year, and setting their prices.\n\nAlexander says his priorities include getting Congress to commit to funding so-called cost-sharing subsidies — payments that reimburse insurance companies for giving their lowest-income customers discounts on deductibles and co-payments.\n\nPresident Trump has threatened to end the payments and has refused to even say whether the government will make them for the final four months of this year.\n\nState insurance commissioners have warned that abrupt cancellation of cost-sharing subsidies would cause premiums, copays and deductibles to increase and more insurance companies to leave the markets in 2018, Alexander said in a statement last month. Congress now should pass balanced, bipartisan, limited legislation in September that will fund cost-sharing payments for 2018.\n\nHe also wants the federal government to make it easier for states to get waivers so they can implement health policies that differ from Obamacare.\n\nWednesday's hearing will feature insurance commissioners from four states, including Julie Mix McPeak from Alexander's home state of Tennessee. She's called for assurances that the payments will continue.\n\nWhen there's any uncertainty surrounding the continuation of those payments, the insurers are doing two things. They are raising premium rates for 2018 and they're making decisions about whether or not to participate in the individual exchange markets across the nation, McPeak told NPR's Ari Shapiro in August.\n\nOn Thursday, governors from four states will testify. They include John Hickenlooper of Colorado, who together with Gov. John Kasich of Ohio recently proposed their own bipartisan plan to overhaul the insurance markets.\n\nTheir plan includes creating a two-year reinsurance fund to protect insurers from people who have severe illnesses and make big claims. It would also exempt insurance companies from certain taxes if they enter a market in which there's little to no competition.\n\nThe governors' plan also advocates maintaining the so-called individual mandate, which requires everyone to own health coverage or pay a fine. That mandate is one of the most hated elements of Obamacare among Republicans and President Trump has suggested that his administration will make little effort to enforce it.\n\nHickenlooper and Kasich laid out their plan last week in a letter to congressional leaders that was signed by the Republican and Democratic governors of eight states, including Gov. Brian Sandoval of Nevada. By signing on to this proposal, Sandoval, a popular Republican, seems to be indicating he will not support the new health plan proposed by his fellow Nevadan, Sen. Dean Heller.\n\nThroughout the late spring and summer, insurance companies filed plans with the federal government that included proposed premiums for the health insurance plans they intend to offer in 2018. Many said they were raising rates because they weren't certain the Trump administration would enforce the individual mandate or pay the cost-sharing subsidies.\n\nAn analysis by the consulting firm Oliver Wyman suggests that by taking action to stabilize the market, lawmakers could boost enrollment by 2 million people while cutting prices.\n\nHELP isn't the only Senate committee pursuing the bipartisan approach. Finance Committee leaders Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, and Ron Wyden, D-Ore., are planning two hearings in the next two weeks on insurance markets and the Children's Health Insurance Program.
Trump Pressures Congress To Replace Obamacare Quickly\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Evan Vucci/AP Evan Vucci/AP\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump said he's finishing a plan to replace the Affordable Care Act with a proposal that would provide insurance for everybody, according to a report by The Washington Post.\n\nHe did not get into any specific details about his healthcare plan during a telephone interview with the newspaper. But he did say it would be much less expensive and would involve much lower deductibles.\n\nTrump added that he does not plan to cut benefits for Medicare and that he does not want a single-payer health care system.\n\nHis plan will be revealed, Trump suggested, after the U.S. Senate confirms his nominee for Health and Human Services secretary, Rep. Tom Price, a Republican from Georgia. The Senate Finance Committee has not announced the timing of Price's confirmation hearing yet.\n\nStill, Trump said he expects Republicans in Congress to replace Obamacare quickly with his plan and is ready to put pressure on lawmakers, telling the Post:\n\nI think we will get approval. I won't tell you how, but we will get approval. You see what's happened in the House in recent weeks, Trump said, referencing his tweet during a House Republican move to gut their independent ethics office, which along with widespread constituent outrage was cited by some members as a reason the gambit failed.\n\nTrump's comments come as Republicans continue their debate over how exactly to repeal and replace Obamacare, while Democrats have been holding rallies around the country in support of the existing health care law.\n\nLast week, GOP lawmakers approved a budget resolution that sets up a framework for repealing the Affordable Care Act. But House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., has said that lawmakers are not holding hard deadlines for replacing the federal health policy.
Trump Claims Democrats Want Socialism, But Many Actually Want To Talk About Capitalism\n\nPresident Trump wants to make the 2020 election about socialism, but Democrats are having a debate about capitalism and how to make sure it provides broadly shared prosperity and economic mobility.\n\nMARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST:\n\nThe next presidential election is more than 500 days away, but battle lines are already being drawn. And there's a disconnect between how the president and Democrats are framing the debate. Donald Trump wants the campaign to be about socialism. The Democrats want it to be about capitalism, as NPR's Mara Liasson reports.\n\nMARA LIASSON, BYLINE: Donald Trump's message is pretty simple.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: The new Democrat Party believes in socialism. Take a look at Venezuela.\n\nLIASSON: For all of Trump's norm-busting behavior, on this, one he's following right in the footsteps of generations of Republican politicians.\n\nKEVIN KRUSE: What Trump is doing actually fits into a very long tradition in American conservatism of likening anything that happens to the left of where conservatism is in that moment as socialism.\n\nLIASSON: That's Princeton University historian Kevin Kruse.\n\nKRUSE: You look back over the history of 20th century politics, things like the polio vaccine that were supposed to be given away for free was denounced as socialism by the back door. The Interstate Highway System was announced by the far-right as socialism - the Civil Rights Act. Medicare, Medicaid - these were all denounced as socialism.\n\nLIASSON: And Social Security, of course, was attacked as the ultimate socialist plot. That's been the frame every time there was a push to expand the social safety net, and this time is no different.\n\nNEERA TANDEN: I see a debate about how to make capitalism work, not a mass adoption of socialism.\n\nLIASSON: Neera Tanden is the president of the liberal think tank Center for American Progress.\n\nTANDEN: We have inequality at levels we haven't seen in a hundred years matched with wages that are coming up but have been stagnant for many, many years. And there's a part of capitalism that seems out of whack.\n\nLIASSON: One of the leading Democratic candidates, Bernie Sanders, is advocating a classic socialist move - a government takeover of the private health insurance industry. But the other candidates say what they want is to regulate capitalism so that it generates broadly shared prosperity and economic mobility. And with the exception of Sanders, they all insist they are not socialists.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF MONTAGE)\n\nELIZABETH WARREN: I believe in markets, markets that work, markets that have a cop on the beat and have real rules and everybody follows them.\n\nPETE BUTTIGIEG: I believe in democratic capitalism.\n\nCORY BOOKER: I'm a capitalist. Monopolies are not capitalism.\n\nLIASSON: Democrats have a long list of proposals, including antitrust enforcement, a public option added to Obamacare, a higher minimum wage, a 2% wealth tax on people worth over $50 million, and plans to help middle-class families afford college, child care and retirement - the kind of restraints on free-market capitalism that America has been debating and sometimes enacting for a hundred years. As a matter of fact, says Republican strategist Bruce Mehlman, the corporate leaders he advises are talking about the same basic question - how to make capitalism work the way it's supposed to.\n\nBRUCE MEHLMAN: I spend a lot of time working with businesses and entrepreneurs. And the long-term challenges for the most successful capitalists in the world are making sure the capitalist system remains effective, remains inclusive and remains demonstrably better than alternatives.\n\nLIASSON: Mehlman says when he listens to the Democrats, he hears this...\n\nMEHLMAN: Bernie and AOC and some others aggressively suggesting that capitalism's time has ended, but the bulk of the party and certainly the bulk of the voters are looking for ways to improve the system - as was done in the Gilded Age, as was done around the Great Depression - to have a more inclusive growth.\n\nLIASSON: Back in 2016, even Donald Trump sometimes sounded like he was talking about this, like on the very first day of his campaign, when he rode down the escalator at Trump Tower and said...\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nTRUMP: Sadly, the American dream is dead.\n\nTANDEN: One of the great ironies of what's happened is that the national numbers in the economy were pretty positive in 2015 and 2016. And candidate Trump really focused in on stagnant wages, particularly for people who didn't have a college degree.\n\nLIASSON: Democrats like Tanden acknowledge that Trump painted a picture that resonated with some voters. American capitalism wasn't delivering the American dream for enough people. But then, Democrats say, Trump offered the wrong answer to the right question - attacking immigrants, starting a trade war and cutting taxes mostly for the wealthy. Democrats say they have better solutions to make sure the system provides more growth, broadly shared.\n\nTANDEN: The person who is a Democratic nominee is going to have to demonstrate that he or she will be good stewards of the economy and produce better results for more people.\n\nLIASSON: And they'll have to defend their plans to save capitalism from itself while being attacked as Venezuelan-style socialists.

Politics Chat: President Trump Nominates Amy Coney Barrett For Supreme Court\n\nWe look at the nomination of Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court and how the Democrats can respond. We'll also look at how President Trump is gaming out not being a clear winner on election night.\n\nLULU GARCIA-NAVARRO, HOST:\n\nAnd now we turn to national political correspondent Mara Liasson, who was listening in. Good morning to you.\n\nMARA LIASSON, BYLINE: Good morning, Lulu.\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: Any thoughts on what we heard there from Brian Morgenstern, the White House deputy press secretary?\n\nLIASSON: Well, they have the votes. They're going forward. He feels pretty confident that President Trump is going to succeed in getting the sixth conservative vote on the Supreme Court and cementing a conservative majority on the court for decades.\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: We know the Democrats can't stop this from happening, but do they have any options as far as strategy goes? What have you been hearing?\n\nLIASSON: Well, Democrats don't have the votes to stop her from being confirmed, but they did have a strategic choice to make. What Republicans were hoping Democrats would do is go after Barrett personally - maybe talk about her faith, kind of go after her the way they went after Brett Kavanaugh. But Democrats seem to understand that could backfire, and they are focusing on what she means for policy. Here's what the Senate minority leader, Democrat Chuck Schumer, said about Barrett.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nCHUCK SCHUMER: A vote for Amy Coney Barrett is a dagger aimed at the heart of the health care protections Americans so desperately need and want.\n\nLIASSON: So he's focusing on health care - the ACA, at this point, is very popular. And she is considered to be the sixth vote to end it - declare it unconstitutional. For Democrats, it's almost as if Amy Coney Barrett herself doesn't matter. They're going to focus on what a sixth conservative vote on the court might mean. I think during the hearings, they're going to ask her for clarification on where she stands on a lot of issues. I don't think they'll get much. But she'll be asked about Roe. She'll be asked about how she could possibly be objective if the election itself is contested and goes all the way to the Supreme Court. She'll be asked about voters' rights - voting rights and about precedent. She's written some things in the past where she said she believes precedent should not be binding in every situation. So that's their strategy for now.\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: Joe Biden released a statement last night in response to this nomination. What did it say?\n\nLIASSON: Well, he also focused on the reasons that so many Americans are voting right now. He talked about health care, Obamacare being in the balance. He said that she has a record of disagreeing with the U.S. Supreme Court's decision upholding the ACA. He talked about Roe and immigration. So he is sticking to the issues. He's also talking about the process. He knows that polls show, as you pointed out earlier, that majorities of Americans think the person who wins the election should nominate the next justice. And I think that even though the process might not move a lot of voters, it means something for activists who feel this has been very unfair. And also, it plays into this gathering debate about minority rule, where a president who lost the popular vote and a Senate who represents - Senate Republicans who represent fewer than 50% of Americans are going to pick the majority of Supreme Court justices. So that's where he's going to focus.\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: The president has continued to say some alarming things, since you mentioned the election, amplifying a message that election results, unless they favor him, are not to be trusted. Here's what he said at his rally in Virginia on Friday night.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: So this is a disaster waiting to happen, and the only hope we have really, other than going through a long, unbelievable litigation at the end after it's over - because we're going to win. We're not going to lose this except if they cheat. That's the way I look at it.\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: He went on to say that voting by mail was a scam and that law enforcement would be watching polling places on Election Day. What do you make of this?\n\nLIASSON: Well, he has been relentless in telling his supporters not to accept any result other than where he is the winner. And it is kind of the standard authoritarian playbook. He is saying that the election is illegitimate unless he is declared the winner. He has refused to guarantee the peaceful transfer of power. He's talked about sending law enforcement to watch the polls. Democrats say that's to intimidate voters. He said - he says it's to protect against fraud. But he is laying the groundwork to contest the results of the election unless he is declared the winner.\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: We should note, of course, that we don't know exactly what is going to happen. There is a lot of uncertainty. But what are voters to make of those particular statements by their president?\n\nLIASSON: Well, I think you have to take him at his word. Take him seriously and literally. He's pretty clear about what he says he wants to happen. He doesn't want to count mail-in ballots that come in after election night. In 2018 in an election in Florida, he said the voting - the counting should stop on Election Day. It's possible that if he is leading on election night, he will ask for no other ballots to be counted. And I think he's counting on the results to be so close and perhaps so chaotic that he can go to the Supreme Court and be declared the winner. He has said this election will go to the court, and that's why it's important we have a ninth justice.\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: And I'm going to ask this question yet again. What can the Democrats do in that scenario?\n\nLIASSON: Well, the only thing Democrats can do is try to turn out enough voters that the election - the result is very clear on election night - that it's not close enough to be contested.\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: That's NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson. Thank you very much.\n\nLIASSON: Thank you.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)\n\nCopyright © 2020 NPR. All rights reserved.

Aetna CEO To Justice Department: Block Our Deal And We'll Drop Out Of Obamacare\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg via Getty Images Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg via Getty Images\n\nIt's not often in the midst of an antitrust fight that the public gets a look at the gamesmanship that's happening behind the scenes.\n\nBut thanks to the Huffington Post's Jonathan Cohn and Jeff Young, we got a glimpse at how health insurer Aetna is making its case to acquire rival Humana — and new insight into Aetna's decision announced Tuesday to pull out of Obamcare exchanges in 11 states.\n\nThe reporters obtained a copy of a letter from Aetna CEO Mark Bertolini to the Justice Department on July 5. The letter was written while the government was still deciding whether to oppose the insurance companies' merger on the grounds that it (and another proposed deal between Anthem and Cigna) would hurt consumers and reduce competition.\n\nThe Bertolini letter was in answer to a Department of Justice request for information about how a decision on the Humana deal would affect Aetna's participation in the health insurance exchanges created by the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe letter is pretty direct: If the government moved to block the merger, then Aetna would begin to pull out of the health insurance exchanges.\n\nHere's the key paragraph (emphasis added):\n\nOur analysis to date makes clear that if the deal were challenged and/or blocked we would need to take immediate actions to mitigate public exchange and ACA small group losses. Specifically, if the DOJ sues to enjoin the transaction, we will immediately take action to reduce our 2017 exchange footprint. We currently plan, as part of our strategy following the acquisition, to expand from 15 states in 2016 to 20 states in 2017. However, if we are in the midst of litigation over the Humana transaction, given the risks described above, we will not be able to expand to the five additional states. In addition, we would also withdraw from at least five additional states where generating a market return would take too long for us to justify, given the costs associated with a potential breakup of the transaction. In other words, instead of expanding to 20 states next year, we would reduce our presence to no more than 10 states. We also would not be in a position to provide assistance to failing cooperative exchanges as we did in Iowa recently.\n\nThe Huffington Post reporters calls the letter a clear threat.\n\nA little more than two weeks later, on July 21, the Justice Department said it would sue to block the Aetna-Humana deal and the other proposed megamerger between Anthem and Cigna.\n\nOn Tuesday, Aetna said it would dramatically scale back its participation on the insurance exchanges in 2017. The company move would take it out of 546 counties in 11 states, leaving it active in 242 counties in four states: Delaware, Iowa, Nebraska and Virginia.\n\nRelated NPR Stories Aetna Joins Other Major Insurers In Pulling Back From Obamacare\n\nAetna said the pullback was a business decision stemming from a loss in the second quarter on individual plans and uncertainty about the policy outlook for the exchanges.\n\nIn the company's statement, Bertolini said, As a strong supporter of public exchanges as a means to meet the needs of the uninsured, we regret having to make this decision.\n\nThe statement made no mention of the company's pending offer for Humana nor its recent correspondence with the government about how Aetna would likely respond if the feds moved to block the deal. Aetna didn't immediately respond to a request for comment on how to reconcile Tuesday's announcement with the July 5 letter made public by Huffington Post on Wednesday.\n\nThe change in tack for Aetna is also noteworthy because Bertolini was talking up the business potential of the exchanges as recently as April, when he said during a call with analysts and investors that the exchanges were a good investment, despite the losses incurred.\n\nAt the time, Bertolini said that Aetna was committed to working constructively with the administration and lawmakers to find solutions that can improve this program, stabilize the risk pool, and expand product flexibility, all with the goal of creating a sustainable program that makes health care more affordable and accessible for all consumers.\n\nNow, the company appears to be taking its ball and going home.
Who Is Chief Justice John Roberts?\n\nThe Supreme Court ruled for LGBTQ workers and granted a lease on life to DACA recipients this week. In both opinions, Chief Justice John Roberts sided with the court's liberal justices.\n\nMARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST:\n\nTwice this week, the Supreme Court thrilled liberals and infuriated conservatives with its decisions, putting the spotlight once again on the man in the center chair, Chief Justice John Roberts. NPR's legal affairs correspondent Nina Totenberg reports.\n\nNINA TOTENBERG, BYLINE: There is much more to come from the court in the coming weeks, but Chief Justice Roberts is clearly putting his stamp on the term so far. He didn't write the court's 6-to-3 opinion on LGBT employment rights, but he joined it and almost certainly assigned the opinion to fellow conservative Neil Gorsuch. Two days later, Roberts wrote the court's opinion blocking the Trump administration's attempt to revoke the Obama-era program protecting the so-called DREAMers from deportation. Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer, who voted against Roberts' confirmation, yesterday choked up on the Senate floor.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nCHUCK SCHUMER: Wow. This decision is amazing. I am so happy. The Supreme Court, who would've thought?\n\nTOTENBERG: But Texas Republican Ted Cruz fulminated with rage.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nTED CRUZ: Chief Justice Roberts has been playing games to achieve the policy outcomes he desires.\n\nTOTENBERG: In fact, Roberts is in many ways fulfilling and defying expectations about what kind of a chief justice he would be. In almost all closely divided cases where the court's liberals and conservatives split along ideological lines, he's a firm conservative vote. He wrote the court's decision gutting the landmark 1965 Voting Rights Act, and he's written decisions obliterating most limits that Congress and the states have imposed on campaign money. But he also twice cast votes to uphold Obamacare. And twice in the last year, he's written decisions rejecting the way the Trump administration does its regulatory business.\n\nLast June, he wrote the court's decision invalidating Trump's attempt to add a citizenship question to the census. In the DACA case, he said that the administration had acted arbitrarily. It had not gone through the procedures required by law. In both cases, he said, the administration could try again, doing it the right way if it wanted to. In the DACA case, for instance, advocates on both sides agreed the administration could revoke the program if it had examined and explained the policy justifications for its decision. Instead, the only justification the administration offered was that Obama's DACA program was illegal from the get-go - period.\n\nImmigration Law Professor Lucas Guttentag says that at bottom, what Roberts was saying was this...\n\nLUCAS GUTTENTAG: Why should the court be the bad guy? If you want to rescind it, do it right, and take responsibility for it.\n\nTOTENBERG: Harvard law professor Richard Lazarus, who's known Roberts for decades, says that early in Trump's tenure, the chief justice ultimately gave the administration a break in the travel ban cases, barring travelers from some mainly Muslim countries. But since then, Trump has put the courts to a constant stress test. And as Lazarus sees the DACA ruling...\n\nRICHARD LAZARUS: I think the central message here is the law applies to everybody, and that includes the president of the United States. And I'm not going to give you any breaks here.\n\nTOTENBERG: Not everyone agrees.\n\nJOSH BLACKMAN: Roberts has gotten in his head that the role of the chief justice is to keep the court out of the headlines and to avoid looking like a partisan.\n\nTOTENBERG: South Texas College of Law professor Josh Blackman.\n\nBLACKMAN: He wants to take the most narrow path possible, even if it's not the best legal analysis.\n\nTOTENBERG: Indeed, Roberts is a conservative with a small c. And in a polarized political atmosphere, he knows that if the court goes too far and too fast in one direction, the public may lose faith in the last remaining branch of government that has retained some public trust as an institution.

California Attorney General Vows To Sue If Trump Uses Emergency Powers To Build Wall\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Reed Saxon/AP Reed Saxon/AP\n\nCalifornia Attorney General Xavier Becerra says he plans to sue the Trump administration the moment the president declares a national emergency to free up funds for a border wall.\n\nBecerra was responding in Spanish to President Trump's State of the Union address to Congress. But he released his response before Trump even delivered the first words of his remarks, anticipating a speech in which the president doubled down on his demand for the construction of a wall at the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nThe idea of declaring a state of emergency on the border that does not exist, to justify robbing funds that belong to the victims of fires, floods and hurricanes, to pay for the wall is not only immoral, it is illegal, Becerra said in Spanish, alluding to reports that Trump may tap into disaster relief funds to construct the wall.\n\nThe president did not mention using emergency powers to build the wall in his speech, but has suggested to reporters that he might consider using those powers if Congress doesn't agree to authorize its funding in a spending bill for the Department of Homeland Security. Declaring a national emergency would allow the president to divert funding set aside for other purposes for the wall.\n\nIn his speech, Trump painted an urgent crisis at the border, speaking of large, organized caravans at the southern border, but most of the migrants waiting at the border have obtained a humanitarian visa from the Mexican government, according to NPR's John Burnett and Carrie Kahn. Eddie Trevino, a Cameron County Judge in Brownsville, recently told reporters: There is no Central American invasion. This is a manufactured crisis.\n\nWe are ready to reject this senseless proposal in court the moment it touches the ground, Becerra said.\n\nIn his address, Trump reiterated his plan for a border wall as a moral and security issue and stressed that Congress has until Feb. 15 to pass a bill to fund our government, protect our homeland, and secure our Southern Border.\n\nI will get it built, Trump told Congress. Walls work and walls save lives.\n\nLoading...\n\nDon't see the graphic above? Click here.\n\nPresident Trump's insistence on a border wall ultimately led to a stand-off between Congress and the president in December and January, resulting in the longest partial government shutdown in U.S. history.\n\nIf Trump declared a national emergency, the act could be voted down in Congress, according to NPR's Scott Horsley. Trump would face strong pushback immediately by the Democratic-controlled House, but he is also facing opposition from some members of his own party in the Republican-controlled Senate, which could mean a resolution of disapproval could pass both chambers.\n\nLegal action in the federal courts is also another likely route to challenge any emergency declaration, and Becerra is a familiar opponent. Since taking the post of California's top lawyer in January 2017, Becerra has sued the Trump administration 45 times on behalf of California, more than any other state Attorney General.\n\nIn the courts or in Congress or in the voting booths, we have to fight for our agenda, Becerra said. And we're winning.'\n\nBecerra has sued the administration over several immigration-related actions, including the decision to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census, which could make non-citizens less likely to participate in the count, given the increased immigration enforcement under the Trump administration.\n\nCalifornia and other states also sued the administration over its plan to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA, which protects certain immigrants from being deported. In early January, a federal judge blocked that decision and said the program could continue as lawsuits move forward in court.\n\nBecerra, 61, has said that Trump's anti-immigrant rhetoric reminds him of the discrimination his own parents faced. His father was born in Sacramento but grew up in Tijuana, Mexico, and his mother was raised in Guadalajara, Mexico.\n\nIn his speech, President Trump highlighted crimes committed by people in the country illegally, despite research showing immigrants commit crimes at lower rates than people born in the U.S. and that illegal immigration does not increase the prevalence of violent crime.\n\nLoading...\n\nDon't see the graphic above? Click here.\n\nMy parents had to put up with some of these indignities, these injustices. My dad couldn't walk into a restaurant because of the signs that said 'No dogs or Mexicans allowed' even though he was a U.S. citizen, Becerra told NPR member station KQED. When you hear someone like Donald Trump say those vile things you absorb, you remember, but then you try to move forward as best you can.\n\nAt the end of his response to Trump, Becerra called to mind his parents, who just celebrated their 66th wedding anniversary.\n\nIf you asked them, my parents, what is the state of our union, I'm sure they would paint a more realistic image than that which President Trump presented to us tonight. They know what it means to work hard and respect the rules, Becerra said.\n\nBefore Becerra took the job as California's first Latino attorney general, he served for more than 24 years in the House, most recently for California's 34th district, which includes part of Los Angeles County.\n\nBecerra was chosen to give the State of the Union's Spanish response, a speech given most years since 2011, by Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif..\n\nAttorney General Becerra is a towering champion of equal justice and a tireless fighter, Speaker Pelosi said in a statement. She continued that Becerra would deliver a strong message of progress for all American families and communities.\n\nStacey Abrams, the former Georgia gubernatorial candidate and State House Minority Leader delivered the English language response to the State of the Union. Abrams did not touch much on immigration issues, leaving that to be done in Spanish, the language spoken by many of the immigrants who arrive at the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nKCRA News via YouTube\n\nEditor's note on March 1: The following transcript has been edited to fix grammatical mistakes and to address slight differences between Attorney General Becerra's prepared remarks and what he said during his address.\n\nNota del redactor, 1 de marzo: La siguiente transcripción fue redactada para corregir errores gramaticales y para abordar diferencias entre los comentarios preparados del fiscal general Becerra y lo que él dijo en su discursco.\n\nBuenas noches.\n\nEs un honor estar con ustedes desde la escuela secundaria C.K. McClatchy High School en la ciudad de Sacramento, la capital del estado de California. Me encuentro aquí con futuros líderes de nuestro país — estudiantes de la McClatchy — donde yo también estudié, ¡pero hace como cuatro décadas!\n\nYo soy hijo de inmigrantes trabajadores y el primero en mi familia que pudo caminar por las puertas de la universidad, y por las puertas de la oportunidad.\n\nMis padres empezaron su vida aquí por la misma razón que viene mucha gente a este país: para trabajar duro y darles a sus hijos una vida mejor. Al salir de Guadalajara, Jalisco, México, trajeron con ellos su fe y no mucho más. Confiaban en la promesa de este país de que todos aquellos que se esfuerzan y cumplen con las reglas, se han ganado la oportunidad de salir adelante.\n\nSé que soy producto de los que lucharon por abrir esas puertas de oportunidad. El optimismo – que caracteriza las olas de inmigrantes que han llegado aquí – corre en mi sangre. Y si el estado de nuestra nación se puede caracterizar como fuerte, es porque gente como mis padres y los suyos — ciudadanos o migrantes — construyeron este país.\n\nDurante 24 años de servicio como congresista en Washington, yo conocí mucho de nuestro gran país y trabajé con tres presidentes diferentes. Y ahora, como fiscal general, defendiendo y abogando por los derechos de millones de americanos aquí en California y, por extensión, en todo los Estados Unidos.\n\nPermítanme una observación obvia:\n\nNo hay otro país como los Estados Unidos.\n\nEl mundo nos necesita fuerte y listo. El mundo nos busca como líder y socio.\n\nSi se cae América, todo el mundo se lastima.\n\nEl estado de nuestro país decide destinos.\n\n¿Cómo puede ser, entonces, que el estado de nuestra joven, rica y fuerte nación ahora es desorden, tensión, hostilidad?\n\n¿Cómo puede ser que lo que defina el estado de nuestro país en el año 2019 es el cierre del gobierno a manos del presidente Trump? Y no solo una vez, pero quizás una segunda vez en las próximas semanas.\n\n¿Quién pudiera creer que el estado de nuestra unión sea impulsado por una obsesión extravagante del presidente Trump de construir un muro en la frontera que ni los expertos quieren? El presidente ya ni repite su promesa de que México pagaría los miles de millones dólares que cuesta este muro.\n\nY sí todo eso no fuera suficiente para preocuparnos, ¿cómo se explica que nuestra nación vive bajo una intensa investigación sobre la interferencia rusa en nuestras elecciones presidenciales del 2016 y sobre el papel que jugó el presidente Trump?\n\nCriminalidad, conspiración, obstrucción de justicia — todas esas sombras oscuras siguen a Donald Trump y a su administración.\n\nNo es sorpresa que la mayoría del pueblo aquí en los Estados Unidos piensa que el país camina en la dirección equivocada. Y que cuatro de cada 10 americanos creen que este es el peor gobierno que han visto en su vida.\n\nEsta noche era para convencernos que, de ahora en adelante, paraba el engaño y la disfunción y que empezaba la cooperación. Lo que escuchamos fue el cansado refrán de construir muros.\n\nSi el presidente Trump quisiera avanzar en serio una reforma migratoria integral, incluyendo la seguridad fronteriza, los Demócratas estamos y hemos estado listos. Pero cerrar nuestro gobierno — y dejar sin empleo o pago a cientos de miles de trabajadores — no es la manera de hacerlo.\n\nY la idea de declarar un estado de emergencia en la frontera cuando uno no existe, para justificar robar fondos que le pertenecen a los desamparados de los incendios, inundaciones y huracanes, para pagar por el muro, no solo es inmoral, es ilegal.\n\nEstamos listos para rechazar esta propuesta insensata, en la corte, en el momento que toque la tierra.\n\nEl muro en la frontera no es la única barrera que estamos viendo de esta administración que trata de construir:\n\nEllos también ponen un muro entre usted y su médico, dictando cuales servicios puede recibir. Por eso mis colegas y yo defendemos en la corte a personas como Elizabeth del estado de la Florida. Teniendo cobertura de salud, eso la dejó a ella terminar sus estudios universitarios y aseguró que su marido tuviera cobertura para poder vencer el cáncer. Y ahora, Elizabeth es abogada.\n\nTambién la administración de presidente Trump — ellos construyen un muro entre usted y las urnas de votación. Pero aquí tengo noticias: ¡Fracasaron! En las elecciones de noviembre, Latinos, especialmente los jóvenes, salieron a votar en números históricos. ¡Gracias!\n\n¿Qué más? Ellos ponen un muro entre nuestros veteranos y sus servicios médicos. Ellos están listos de malgastar millones de dólares para un muro fronterizo en vez de ayudarles a nuestros veteranos que se enfrentan demasiadas demoras en los hospitales.\n\nY ellos también construyen también un muro entre padres e hijos, al meter a niños en jaulas que los separan de sus padres.\n\nAmigos, créanmelo, podemos tumbar muros y abrir puertas con nuestras manos. Es más, ¡ya lo hicimos!\n\n¿No me lo creen?\n\nCon sus votos el noviembre pasado, ustedes cambiaron la composición del Congreso. Los votos de los congresistas con quienes contaba el presidente, ya no los tiene. Ahora él tiene que aprender lo que es gobernar en una democracia.\n\nYa no puede ignorar a los Demócratas. Y por eso, no tiene su muro.\n\nSu voto en noviembre cambió los votos en el Congreso. Y eso ha cambiado la política de nuestra nación.\n\nAhora que ven su poder, ¿están listos para abrir nuevas puertas?\n\n¿No les parece que ya es la hora de que nosotros en nuestro gobierno construyemos (sic) escuelas, no muros? ¡Entonces, prepárense, estas manos pueden cambiar mucho! ¡Estas manos pueden cambiar con la próxima votación!\n\nNuestro sistema demócrata premia a la participación de todos. Y con 66,000 ciudadanos Latinos cumpliendo 18 años de edad, la edad de votación, cada mes, tenemos muchas manos que premiar.\n\nImagínense si tuviéramos el poder de decidir la agenda política de esta nación.\n\nMejores escuelas: Check.\n\nUn cuidado médico para su familia que los políticos no le pueden quitar: Check.\n\nSueldos con beneficios y protecciones en el empleo: Check.\n\nMejores leyes para proteger nuestras familias y nuestra policía del violento uso de las armas de fuego: Check.\n\nProtección permanente para los Soñadores, los Dreamers: Check.\n\nLeyes que protegen el agua que tomamos y el aire que respiramos: Check.\n\nY una reforma migratoria integral para reparar el sistema roto: Check. Check. Check.\n\nEsta no es la agenda que presentó el presidente. Pero estas son las soluciones que abren puertas de la oportunidad.\n\nEn las cortes o en el Congreso, o en las urnas de la votación, tenemos que luchar por nuestra agenda. Por eso es que yo he luchado como fiscal general en la corte contra la administración del presidente Trump, ¡y estamos ganando!\n\nEn proteger el programa de DACA, luchamos y ganamos para los 700,000 jóvenes.\n\nEn proteger el programa de salud Obamacare, somos los protagonistas. Más de cuatro millones de Latinos dependen en el Obamacare para su seguro médico.\n\nEn proteger los estudiantes universitarios contra préstamos fraudulentos, luchamos y ganamos por miles de ellos.\n\nHace dos semanas mis padres celebraron 66 años de matrimonio. Empezaron su vida juntos con solo su fe. Todavía recuerdan los días cuando no podían cruzar las puertas de restaurantes debido a los letreros que les decían: Los perros o mexicanos, no permitidos.\n\nCon los años, han recibido los premios de su labor y dedicación a su familia. No hay duda de que el estado de la unión de María Teresa y Manuel Becerra es fuerte y sólido.\n\nSi les preguntamos a ellos, mis padres, cuál es el estado de nuestra nación, estoy seguro que pintarían un imagen más real que lo que nos presentó el presidente Trump esta noche. Ellos saben lo que significa trabajar duro y respetar las reglas.\n\nY bien que saben que para mantenernos fuertes como pueblo unido hay que trabajar juntos y mantener abiertas esas pesadas puertas para que todos nuestros hijos – como los estudiantes de C.K. McClatchy – puedan cruzar y conocer la oportunidad.\n\nYa sea con marchas en las calles o marchas a las urnas de votación, con luchas en la corte o a través del Congreso, haremos lo que se necesita para asegurar una unión nacional fuerte y vibrante.\n\nAmigos, con fe y la fuerza de nuestra labor, y respetando las diversas contribuciones del pueblo americano, los Estados Unidos seguirá siendo el dueño del sueño americano.\n\nMuchas gracias, buenas noches y que Dios los bendiga.
Trump Questions Persist Along Obama's Last Foreign Presidential Trip\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Pablo Martinez Monsivais/AP Pablo Martinez Monsivais/AP\n\nPresident Obama said Sunday he doesn't intend to become his successor's constant critic — but reserved the right to speak out if President-elect Donald Trump or his policies breach certain values or ideals.\n\nOffering a rare glimpse into his thoughts on his post-presidency, Obama suggested once he was out of office he would uphold the tradition of ex-presidents stepping aside quietly to allow their successors space to govern. He heaped praise on former President George W. Bush, saying he could not have been more gracious to me when I came in and said he wanted to give Trump the same chance to pursue his agenda without somebody popping off at every turn.\n\nBut Obama suggested there may be limits to his silence.\n\nAs an American citizen who cares deeply about our country, if there are issues that have less to do with the specifics of some legislative proposal or battle or go to core questions about our values and ideals, and if I think that it's necessary or helpful for me to defend those ideals, I'll examine it when it comes, Obama told reporters.\n\nObama, who has consistently praised Bush for the way he's handled his ex-presidency, faces a conundrum about how to handle his own. Though he's vowed to ensure a smooth handover of power, Obama is keenly aware he's being replaced by a new president who holds antithetical views on issue after issue.\n\nThe president spoke out vigorously throughout the campaign against Trump's calls for banning Muslim immigrants, deporting millions of people living in the U.S. illegally, repealing Obamacare, and canceling the Paris climate deal, to name a few. Those policy proposals and others like them have stoked fear for many Americans who oppose Trump and are hoping vehement opposition from Obama and other Democrats might prevent Trump from implementing them.\n\nThough Obama didn't specify what might trigger him to break silence, he left himself a broad window of possibilities. His comments suggested he'd be most inclined to weigh in if Trump violated basic principles Obama has tried to uphold, such as minority rights, equal protection and respect for civilian life. Obama has long warned that Trump might impulsively use nuclear weapons, and has cast a dim view on ideas like a Muslim registry, which Trump's incoming chief of staff declined on Sunday to rule out.\n\nYet Obama suggested that while he might not always hold his tongue, his goal wasn't to spend his time publicly disparaging his replacement.\n\nMy intention is to, certainly for the next 2 months, just finish my job, Obama said. And then after that, to take Michelle on vacation, get some rest, spend time with my girls, and do some writing, do some thinking.\n\nBush, like many ex-presidents, strictly avoided opining on politics during Obama's eight years. Former President Bill Clinton, after leaving office, focused his attention on global humanitarian issues, especially as his wife entered politics. Former President Jimmy Carter was more vocal in his views in his post-White House years, occasionally stirring up controversy with comments critical of Israel.\n\nObama's remarks at a news conference in Lima offered some of his most specific indications to date of how he feels Democrats and Trump opponents should handle the next four years. Asked whether Democrats in the Senate should follow Republicans' example of refusing to even consider a Supreme Court nominee, Obama said they should not.\n\nYou give them a hearing, said Obama, whose own Supreme Court nominee, Merrick Garland, has lingered for more than half a year due to the GOP's insistence that no Obama nominee be considered. Obama said he certainly didn't want Democrats to adopt that tactic spearheaded this year by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky.\n\nThat's not why the American people send us to Washington, to play those games, Obama said.\n\nHe declined to weigh in explicitly on whether House Democrats should stick with Rep. Nancy Pelosi as minority leader, arguing it was improper to meddle in the vote. But he said of the California Democrat, who faces a challenge for the leadership post: I cannot speak highly enough of Nancy Pelosi.\n\nObama's remarks came as he concluded his final world tour as president. For Obama, it was the last time he'd take questions on foreign soil, a staple of his overseas trips that his administration has seen as an important symbol of America's commitment to a rigorous free press.\n\nOn his final day in Peru, Obama chatted briefly with Russian President Vladimir Putin about Ukraine and the Syria crisis, though Obama said the U.S. accusation that Moscow tried to influence the U.S. election didn't come up. The four-minute conversation, likely their last face-to-face interaction, came amid intense speculation about whether Trump's election might herald a more conciliatory approach to Russia.\n\nPutin, speaking later in Lima, said he and Obama had a difficult working relationship but always respected each other's positions — and each other. He said he'd thanked Obama and told him he'd be welcome in Russia at any time.\n\nQuestions about Trump trailed Obama throughout his final overseas trip, as anxious world leaders quizzed him on Trump's stances on trade, foreign policy and the NATO alliance. Obama sought to reassure the leaders of Australia, Canada and other U.S. allies their longstanding ties with America wouldn't falter under Trump.
Democrats Get Closer To Serious Field Of Trump Challengers\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Win McNamee/Getty Images Win McNamee/Getty Images\n\nThere was something different about the Democratic debate this week, compared with the earlier rounds this summer. Something was happening that was hard to pin down, but it was palpable. Not the contrast of night and day, but perhaps the difference between dusk and dawn.\n\nIt's a critical difference, and it comes at a crucial time. Because the Trump presidency these candidates are competing to truncate has reached what may be a critical juncture. But more of that in a moment.\n\nThis week, the Democratic nomination fight once again took the form of a TV quiz show with too many contestants to fit onscreen at once. Once again, the candidates sounded a lot alike, peddling much the same wares as in June and July. And yes, three hours was too long.\n\nYet something different happened. The debate left a clearer imprint. The effect was at least somewhat more energizing than the summer meetings, or perhaps just a bit less dispiriting.\n\nThere were still 10 candidates onstage, but at least they were the candidates most people wanted to see and — best of all — there was not the prospect of 10 more contestants doing it all over on the following night.\n\nThat made a difference. The earlier affairs had the feel of the NFL exhibition season, this week felt more like playing for keeps.\n\nOn the substantive side, the candidate's answers and thoughts seemed more fully formed and more clearly expressed. Some of this is just practice. Some of these candidates are new to the big leagues; and veterans such as former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders are getting used to new roles.\n\nSome of the upgrade also seemed attributable to the ABC moderators, all four of whom were crisp. They had challenging questions and they probed in their follow-ups, but they did not intrude on the dynamic among the candidates. Like good referees, they pretty much let the players play — to the benefit of all.\n\nBenefiting most were the candidates who got the most airtime — Biden, Sanders and Sen. Elizabeth Warren.\n\nMuch was made of it being the first time that viewers had a chance to see Biden and Warren face off — with Sanders, the other candidate consistently in double digits, right there as well. It gave Democratic consumers their best chance for a taste test to date.\n\nAmong the three, Warren seemed to make the most of it. She had the freshest energy onstage, and she is getting better at pressing a point. Her share of the airtime this week was nearly 17 minutes — second to Biden, but only by a few seconds. And she was showing passion on a range of outrages rather than intellectual irritation at the way things are.\n\nThe NPR Politics Podcast Elizabeth Warren Gets Personal On The Trail Elizabeth Warren Gets Personal On The Trail Listen · 25:49 25:49\n\nShe also responded to questions and to the answers of her rivals with apparent spontaneity — even when she was recycling what might have been a practiced response.\n\nMost observers gave Biden, the putative front-runner, middling marks. For some, he was just OK, a left-handed compliment at best. For others, he was good enough, which isn't much better. All seemed to agree he wasn't bad.\n\nIt's hard to know how Biden, soon to be 77, would look to the Democratic electorate based solely on this debate performance, given how long he has been around. Even more of a factor is the defensiveness many Democrats feel about the guy they still think has the best chance of beating President Trump. But more of that in a moment.\n\nSanders, who is already 78, came across as every bit his age and just as irascible as he was at just 73 and challenging Hillary Clinton for the last presidential nomination. He once again made a strong case for the national health care system he calls Medicare for All — a concept that now gets at least lip service from many of his rivals, as well as pushback from a few.\n\nEven though Sanders' goal is to make the famous health program available to everybody, it is, for now, still primarily associated with old folks. It's likely to be the Democratic Party vehicle for getting to national health care, sooner or later, so it could use --– and likely will have — more age-appropriate champions.\n\nStill, it was Biden's age that was called into question in this debate, when he had talked about who would qualify under his amendments to Obamacare. Julián Castro, at one end of the stage, objected to what sounded like Biden contradicting himself. When Biden interrupted with a denial, Castro fired back, Are you forgetting already what you said just 2 minutes ago?\n\nWithout that word already, that question might have stood on its own. Instead, it seemed a shot at Biden's age and past lapses of memory. The audience reacted with a mix of groans and applause. They took it as a shot, and it played as such endlessly on broadcast highlights and in panel post-mortems.\n\nCastro may have been the victim of his own need to distinguish himself from the pack, a problem shared by all but the three candidates at center stage. He was anchoring the end of the lineup because his polls and fundraising are barely meeting the criteria for inclusion.\n\nAlso in endangered status was the candidate at the other far side of the stage, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, who continues to emphasize her middle-of-the-country roots and middle-of-the-road positions. Her focus on the middle surely includes the early-caucus state of Iowa, her neighbor to the south, where she needs a breakout showing.\n\nJust inside from the two ends onstage were two candidates who were expected to make more noise than either has to date: One was Cory Booker, the senator from New Jersey, a tall and commanding figure who got the night's best laugh and said many eloquent things on gun violence and the status of his fellow black Americans. The Booker campaign professes to be unworried, but it is hard to fathom why Booker has not broken through in the early states or the national polls.\n\nThe same might be said of Beto O'Rourke, the former congressman from El Paso whose campaign has drawn new impetus from last month's massacre in that city. O'Rourke was saluted by his rivals for his strong stance, and he had a viral moment saying: Hell yes, we're going to take your AR-15, your AK-47, referring to the military-style weapons used in many recent mass shootings. That promise, however, does not reflect the position of most of the other candidates or of the Democratic caucus in the House or the Senate.\n\nMoving in toward the centerpiece trio, one found Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind.,, who used every chance he got to insert thoughtful answers with a fine-chiseled edge. He used his closing remarks to say how much it had meant to his life to come out as gay and marry his husband. The fact that his age, 37, may be more of a weight for his candidacy than his sexuality is one measure of how life in America has changed.\n\nIn mirroring status across the stage stood Andrew Yang, a young entrepreneur making a splash with younger voters and casting a wider net with ideas for guaranteed federal income payments (in lieu of other programs) and 100 Democracy Dollars to supplant lobbyists' actual dollars.\n\nWhich leaves us with Kamala Harris, the one candidate who stood aside from the threesome at center stage but was not part of the trio on either wing. The California senator tried a good-natured jab at Biden regarding his oft-repeated ties to President Barack Obama. It worked in its way, especially with the crowd at Texas Southern University, a historically black school. But it didn't have nearly the bite of her June debate challenge to Biden for his opposition to busing for school integration in the 1970s.\n\nOne thing Harris succeeded in doing was returning the debate, again and again, to the subject of Donald Trump. One after another, the candidates would acknowledge that beating Trump was everyone's ultimate goal, an existential necessity for the party and the overarching unifying element in this contest.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Robyn Beck/AFP/Getty Images Robyn Beck/AFP/Getty Images\n\nYet, curiously, not one candidate mentioned the impeachment debate currently raging within the House of Representatives, where most Democrats now want a formal impeachment proceeding but Speaker Nancy Pelosi does not – at least not yet.\n\nNeither did anyone in the debate mention the recession jitters that polls show many Americans feeling, if only because the length of the current expansion and indications it may be ending.\n\nThat's important, because recessions beat incumbent presidents more often than the opposing party's nominee does. No incumbent lost between the Depression election of 1932 and 1976, when Democrat Jimmy Carter talked of an economic misery index in ousting Republican Gerald Ford. That same index was even worse when Ronald Reagan ousted Carter four years later.\n\nGeorge H.W. Bush also lost as an incumbent in 1992, the victim of a brief recession and an independent candidate (Ross Perot) who got 19% of the popular vote. Since then, three incumbent presidents have been re-elected and none has lost, despite the efforts of well-known, well-financed and party-backed challengers (Robert Dole, John Kerry and Mitt Romney).\n\nThat is largely why polls taken this week by CNN and by NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist found a plurality of Americans expect Trump to win a second term, even though far fewer think he deserves it. Trump's approval number is now among the lowest ever for presidents after 20 months in office. But some have come back from comparable low points, including Obama and Reagan (who came back to win 49 states).\n\nIt's going to take more than good debate performances, and more than winning the nomination, for one of these Democratic contenders to defeat this incumbent. Only bad economics, or the actions of the incumbent himself, are likely to accomplish that.\n\nBut to make themselves attractive as a reasonable option, the Democrats need to present coherent, clear alternatives in policy and persona. This week's debate was at least a longer step in that direction.
President Trump Could Announce His Supreme Court Nominee Within The Week\n\nPresident Trump says he'll announce his pick for the Supreme Court this week, and it will likely be a woman. It's also likely to be the most contentious court nomination in history.\n\nLULU GARCIA-NAVARRO, HOST:\n\nPresident Trump said he expects to announce his pick for the Supreme Court this week. Joining us is NPR justice correspondent Carrie Johnson.\n\nGood morning.\n\nCARRIE JOHNSON, BYLINE: Good morning.\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: You've been reporting on the president's shortlist to fill this vacancy. Who seems to be the leading contender?\n\nJOHNSON: To hear President Trump tell it, it will be a woman. Listen to what the president said last night.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: It will be a woman - a very talented, very brilliant woman.\n\nJOHNSON: And, Lulu, of the women on the shortlist, one stands out - Amy Coney Barrett. She's on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit, a former law professor. She's written critical things about the landmark abortion rights decision Roe v. Wade and about how Chief Justice John Roberts handled the Obamacare - the Affordable Care Act case. President Trump has called her highly respected, but I've also heard he had some reservations about her the last time around when she was a finalist for the job that Brett Kavanaugh eventually got.\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: President Trump has been criticized for a lack of diversity in his judge nominees, but I see there's also a Latina on this list. Who is she?\n\nJOHNSON: Barbara Lagoa - she's a Cuban American from Miami. She sat on the Florida Supreme Court until President Trump promoted her to a seat on the 11th Circuit federal appeals court. She is very highly touted by current and former politicians in Florida. She could help energize Latino voters in November. But a couple of members of the conservative legal establishment here in Washington told me there are some unknowns about her - that seems to be code for, is she reliably conservative? President Trump doesn't know her well, but he sounds like a fan already.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nTRUMP: She's an extraordinary person. I've heard incredible things about her. I don't know her. She's Hispanic and highly respected - Miami - highly respected.\n\nJOHNSON: And speaking of diversity, one other name on the list is Amul Thapar of Kentucky. He's a favorite of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. He would be the first Asian American on the high court.\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: You've reported that this White House has made a point of choosing relatively young people also to fill lifetime appointments on the federal bench. Does that pattern hold here?\n\nJOHNSON: It might. There are a couple of other younger women I'm hearing about - Kate Todd, who used to work at the Chamber of Commerce, now handles judge nominations inside the White House. They like her there. And there's Allison Jones Rushing. She's a favorite of evangelical groups, an important part of the Trump base. Judge Rushing was born in 1982. She only recently became a federal appeals court judge. And she has a lot of supporters, but she might be too young for the Supreme Court right now.\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: You know, the election is only six weeks away, and it usually takes much longer than that to vet and to confirm a candidate. How is that going to work if, indeed, they move forward?\n\nJOHNSON: Well, the president says he wants to make his announcement this week. In the past, it's taken about 69 days, on average, for a Supreme Court candidate to go from nomination to confirmation. And of course, time between now and November 3 is shorter than that. Trump says he wants to see his choice confirmed without delay, and he says before the election would be, quote, very good.\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: NPR Carrie Johnson, thank you very much.\n\nJOHNSON: Thank you.\n\nCopyright © 2020 NPR.

Democrats Are Politicizing Barrett Confirmation Hearings, Sen. Sasse Says\n\nNOEL KING, HOST:\n\nToday we're hearing from senators who are playing a pivotal role in shaping the future of the U.S. Supreme Court. Republican Sen. Ben Sasse of Nebraska is with us. He'll have the chance to question Judge Amy Coney Barrett this morning. She goes before the Senate Judiciary Committee again today. Barrett's confirmation process is happening quickly. The hearing started just yesterday, 22 days before the presidential election. Sen. Sasse, good morning. Thanks for being with us.\n\nBEN SASSE: Noel, thanks for the invitation. Good to be here.\n\nKING: Let's start by hearing from Sen. Kamala Harris, the Democratic candidate for vice president who also sits on this committee. Here's how she views this process.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nKAMALA HARRIS: A clear majority of Americans want whomever wins this election to fill this seat. And my Republican colleagues know that. Yet they are deliberately defying the will of the people.\n\nKING: Now, around 9 million Americans have already voted. We don't know who's going to win. Polls show a majority of both Republicans and Democrats want the winner to nominate the Supreme Court judge. Why not wait?\n\nSASSE: Well, thanks for the question. And, obviously, there's lots of history here where a lot of people want to view everything as Hatfields and McCoys. But I'd actually back up a step and ask, why do we think that every Supreme Court vacancy and nomination is so end-of-civilization-ish (ph), right? Like, why do we act like the politicization of the court is a normal thing to do? So I wish that we talked about justices in the ways that they were talked about for lots and lots of American history until a couple of decades ago.\n\nKING: I think a lot of people wish that. But the argument is that the politicization started in part when Mitch McConnell and others blocked Merrick Garland's nomination with the same words that are being used now - we're close to an election. The people should vote. That sounds, to a lot of people, like hypocrisy. How do you personally grapple with that accusation?\n\nSASSE: Well, you're asking a fair question that you - I understand why you'd want to put to a lot of Republican senators. But I actually hold the exact same position now that I held in 2016, which is that there are two plenary powers in the Constitution. One is for the president to nominate. And the second is for the Senate to advise and to provide consent or not assent and not consent. And I reached out to the Obama administration and told them the kind of person I'd like to see them nominate. And so I believe that we need people who understand why they put on a black robe. I believe the same thing now that I believed in 2016.\n\nKING: Amy Coney Barrett sits on the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals. And President Obama nominated a different replacement almost a year before President Trump took office. Senate Republicans blocked that nomination. In fact, Republicans blocked dozens of Obama-era judicial appointments. You say that judges should not be partisan - in an ideal world, should not be partisan. But a process that relies on who is in power to make nominations is partisan. It's a problem for your argument.\n\nSASSE: No, I don't think so. I mean, there are two political branches. And there's a third branch that's not political. So the constitutional structure has three separate but equal branches that check and balance one another. The two branches - the legislature and the executive - that are elected, we advocate for policy positions. We argue before the American people what we think we want to do with our power. And therefore, the people have the check on whether or not they want to retain politicians or fire them every next election. But judges are different. They wear robes. They have lifetime tenure. And they don't stand for election or reelection. And so we should get back to a question of asking, why do they put on a black robe? It is because they are not supposed to be politicians. The language of conservatives and liberals voting...\n\nKING: But the thing is politicians are not getting - politicians don't get a lot done. I mean, this is actually part of it...\n\nSASSE: That's true (laughter).\n\nKING: ...Is there's a lot that politicians aren't getting done. And as a result, it gets kicked over to the courts, these highly political things where you might want it to be decided by Congress, but Congress isn't doing it. So it does get kicked over to judges.\n\nSASSE: Well, so - Noel, you're identifying a real problem. And your solution, I think, is to make it worse, which is to treat the judiciary as a super legislature, though not at all accountable to the American people. I think you and I would definitely agree that America is way too polarized right now. There's way too much division. There's way too little common sense problem-solving happening. And the solution is not to say, let's take nine people in robes who never stand before the voters and say give them more power. What we should be doing...\n\nKING: My solution, for the record, would be that Congress should get some things done.\n\nSASSE: That's more aligned - (laughter).\n\nKING: It sounds like we agree on that. Yeah. You have suggested that skeptics take a look at Judge Barrett's record. In 2017, she wrote a law review article criticizing Justice John Roberts for upholding the Affordable Care Act. The court...\n\nSASSE: No, she didn't.\n\nKING: ...The Supreme Court is - go ahead, please.\n\nSASSE: I don't think she did. She talked about the argument in the case, about whether or not judges can rewrite a statute. You're summarizing it, I think, as the policy outcome. And I think something different is happening. It is 100% legitimate for people today in their questioning to ask what she was meaning in that article, why she took issue with Judge - Chief Justice Roberts' opinion and what she thought about the dissents in that opinion. All that is completely legitimate.\n\nThat's different than summarizing it, as was done by not just Sen. Harris and - vice presidential candidate Harris or all the other Democrats on the committee yesterday who talked about the Affordable Care Act and the particular - but a different - case that's before the court right now, and whether or not there's a specific policy goal about, quote, taking away health care from the American people. That is to make the judges and justices into policy advocates and into politicians. And so they weren't asking the question that I think is at the root of your very good question, which is, what was her disagreement with John Roberts' jurisprudence in that case? They instead talked about it as the policy outcome about Obamacare. And that's the line we shouldn't be crossing.\n\nKING: Democrats - in the seconds we have left - Democrats have asked her to recuse herself if the results of this election end up before the Supreme Court. She has not committed to do that. Should she?\n\nSASSE: Well, I mean, what case is going to come before the Supreme Court?\n\nKING: The election, potentially. President Trump seems to think so.\n\nSASSE: Well, President Trump says lots of things that I don't agree with and that don't make sense. Your producer's telling me we're at time. But we should continue to discuss this because I think there are lots of different things that could be litigated in the future. We don't know what those are yet.\n\nKING: Sen. Ben Sasse, Republican from Nebraska. Thank you.\n\nSASSE: Thank you.\n\nCopyright © 2020 NPR. All rights reserved.

Senate To Hold Bipartisan Hearings To Stabilize Insurance Markets\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Tasos Katopodis /AFP/Getty Images Tasos Katopodis /AFP/Getty Images\n\nUpdated 4:21 p.m. ET Aug. 1\n\nSen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., and Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., announced today that the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions committee will hold bipartisan hearings on ways to stabilize the Affordable Care Act marketplaces for 2018.\n\nThe hearings will start the week of Sept. 4. Their aim is to act by Sept. 27, when insurers must sign contracts to sell individual insurance plans on HealthCare.gov for 2018.\n\nAlexander says the committee will hear from insurance commissioners, consumers, governors, insurance companies and health care experts. If Congress doesn't act, he says, some people could find that they have no exchange options, and millions of people would find insurance unaffordable.\n\nAlexander also urged President Trump to continue what's known as cost-sharing reduction payments to insurance companies through September. These payments help to lower copays and deductibles for low-income Americans who earn 100 to 250 percent of the federal poverty level. The Trump administration has been doling out the payments on a month-to-month basis and threatening to end them altogether, which is spooking insurers into raising rates.\n\nAlexander stressed that stabilizing the marketplace for 2018 is only step one, and that after that, lawmakers will continue to work towards a more robust individual insurance market for the long term.\n\nThe announcement came after President Trump took to Twitter to threaten insurance companies that he may withhold payments to insurers in an effort to undermine the Affordable Care Act.\n\nIt's not the first time the president has threatened to cut off these payments, which he refers to as BAILOUTS.\n\nBut these payments aren't designed to compensate insurers for business failures. Rather, they reimburse insurance companies for discounts the law requires them to give to low-income people who buy insurance through the Affordable Care Act exchanges. The federal money offsets the money insurers lose by lowering the deductibles and co-payments they require of these policyholders.\n\nTrump, who is angry that the Congress failed to pass a law to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, has been wielding his threat to withhold these CSRs — which could cause chaos in the insurance markets – in hopes of forcing lawmakers back to the table to try again to get rid of the health care law.\n\nThe next cost-sharing payments are due to be paid in a few weeks and the president has said he'll announce this week whether he'll pay the money or keep it in the Treasury.\n\nIn the absence of the CSR, the rate increases could be astonishing, says Dr. Marc Harrison, CEO of Intermountain Healthcare, which operates nonprofit hospitals and clinics and insures more than 800,000 people across Utah.\n\nWe'll see [the number of] people who are uninsured, or functionally uninsured, go way, way up, he adds.\n\nHarrison says he and his company filed two sets of proposed rates for policies sold on the insurance exchange next year. If the president cuts off the cost-sharing payments, he says, the rates will be much higher.\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office estimates the payments, if they're all made, will total $7 billion this year. Margaret Murray is CEO of the Association for Community Affiliated Plans, which represents these safety net health plans aimed at people with lower incomes. She says she has been in touch with the Department of Health and Human Services to urge them to fund the payments.\n\nShould the payments cease, insurers will be required to fund cost-sharing reductions on their own, Murray says. If that happens, they will either raise their rates – our plans indicate that it could be by up to 23 percent – to compensate for these losses, or they will withdraw from the markets altogether.\n\nIf Trump does decide to stop making the payments, it may end up costing the U.S. Treasury more, while insurance companies who remain in the markets could do just fine.\n\nThat's because insurance companies will charge more in premiums to make up for the lost payments. And that will lead the Treasury to spend more on subsidies to policyholders who qualify, according to an analysis by the consulting firm Oliver Wyman.\n\nIf those subsidies go up enough, more people could be lured into the exchange markets.\n\nHere's the wonky reason why:\n\n\n\nThe Obamacare exchanges require insurance policies to conform to one of four metal levels -- bronze, silver, gold or platinum — which coincide with how much an individual is expected to pay in premiums, deductibles and other out-of-pocket expenses. A bronze plan covers about 60 percent of a customer's health care costs, with relatively low monthly premiums, while a platinum plan will cost more each month but pay 90 percent of total health costs.\n\nThe law provides income-based tax credits to people to buy insurance, and those credits are calculated based on the price of silver plans. Last year about 85 percent of people who bought Obamacare insurance got a credit, according to the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services.\n\nPeople with the lowest incomes also get those discounted deductibles and co-payments if they buy a silver plan; and then the government reimburses insurers through CSR payments.\n\nIf Trump decides not to make those payments, insurance companies are likely to raise rates about 19 percent, according to an analysis by the Kaiser Family Foundation.\n\nThat means subsidies will have to rise for many people to meet those higher premiums. Some people may take that bigger subsidy to buy a cheaper policy — and many could even get insurance for free, according to Oliver Wyman, because premiums on bronze plans probably would not rise as much as those on silver plans.\n\nThe higher subsidies could cost the government as much as $2.3 billion in 2018, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation's Larry Levitt. Levitt notes that Congress could end the ambiguity over the payments by appropriating the money for them.\n\nSen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, said in an interview with Reuters that he thinks Congress will do just that.\n\nI'm for helping the poor; always have been, Hatch said. And I don't think they should be bereft of health care.\n\nThe reason CSRs are in limbo at all is because House Republican who did not want Obamacare to succeed sued the administration, claiming the payments to insurers were illegal because they had not appropriated money for them.\n\nA federal judge agreed, but the Obama administration appealed. When Trump took the White House he continued the appeal, to allow lawmakers time to pass a bill to repeal Obamacare and make the payments disappear altogether.\n\nNow that that effort has failed, the lawsuit and the cost-sharing money are once again in play.\n\nAdditional reporting by Gisele Grayson.
Biden To Expand Access To Reproductive Health Care And Obamacare\n\nPresident Biden is signing two executive actions designed to expand access to reproductive health care and health insurance through the Affordable Care Act and Medicaid.\n\nARI SHAPIRO, HOST:\n\nFormer President Trump spent his whole term trying to undermine and weaken the Affordable Care Act and limit funding for reproductive health. Well, today, President Biden signed two executive actions that essentially turn back time on those changes. Here to tell us more is NPR health policy reporter Selena Simmons-Duffin.\n\nHi, Selena.\n\nSELENA SIMMONS-DUFFIN, BYLINE: Hi, Ari.\n\nSHAPIRO: Begin by telling us about this time machine idea. What is Biden undoing with these actions today?\n\nSIMMONS-DUFFIN: Well, first, there's a memorandum to undo the changes to Title X funding that affected health care providers like Planned Parenthood and rescind the global gag rule. So that means both domestically and internationally, there should soon be more access to federal funding for organizations that provide or refer for abortions. And then there's an executive order that takes aim at a whole slew of changes Trump made to the Affordable Care Act and Medicaid. For example, work requirements for Medicaid was something that states were encouraged to put in place under Trump. Biden even said himself while signing these actions, essentially, there's nothing new here. We're going back to how things were before Trump.\n\nSHAPIRO: But Biden did do at least one new thing here - right? - a special enrollment period for healthcare.gov. Tell us about that.\n\nSIMMONS-DUFFIN: Yeah, so this is something the Trump administration was pressured to do when the economy started cratering last spring because of the coronavirus pandemic, but they never did it. Biden says starting February 15, healthcare.gov will be open for people to enroll in a plan for three months until mid-May.\n\nI called up Katie Roders Turner earlier today. She works at the Family Healthcare Foundation in Tampa Bay, Fla. And she's what's called a navigator. They are unbiased and free for consumers. They're federally funded. And they just help people sign up for these plans. And as we were talking about the special enrollment period, I told her, you sound really excited about this.\n\nKATIE RODERS TURNER: I'm so excited (laughter). I'm so excited. I really am. Thank you. Yeah. No, no, no. I do. I know. I'm, like, giddy.\n\nSHAPIRO: She's very excited. But the regular annual open period just ended, right? Why is another one needed?\n\nSIMMONS-DUFFIN: Yeah, that's true. Open enrollment wrapped up in mid-December, but Roders Turner says a lot of people might have missed it. The Trump administration barely advertised it at all. They famously slashed their outreach spending by 90%. And she says the lack of outreach caused a lot of confusion.\n\nRODERS TURNER: We would have people come to us, consumers coming to us. They know they're uninsured. They know that we can potentially help them. But when we would, you know, go through the process of saying, like, this is the Affordable Care Act, the health insurance marketplace, they would say, oh, Obamacare; I thought that was gone.\n\nSIMMONS-DUFFIN: So she thinks the combination of opening up this new enrollment period and telling people about it might get more people who are eligible for plans to sign up.\n\nSHAPIRO: People who are eligible - like what? Talk about who might be likely to sign up during this enrollment period.\n\nSIMMONS-DUFFIN: Well, there are about 26 million people who are uninsured right now. And Cynthia Cox, who's the vice president of the program on the Affordable Care Act at the Kaiser Family Foundation, recently did an analysis on this. So I asked her to describe the people who are eligible for low- or even no-cost plans on the exchanges but are uninsured.\n\nCYNTHIA COX: They're more likely to be Hispanic and Spanish-speaking at home. They're more likely to work in construction or arts and entertainment - like, fields that typically don't offer health insurance. They are also more likely to have a high school education or less.\n\nSIMMONS-DUFFIN: So she says knowing all of this could help the Biden administration figure out how to shape their outreach campaign, and she says they've got a healthy budget to work with - about a billion dollars in funding that the Trump administration had for this outreach and just left on the table.\n\nSHAPIRO: That's NPR's Selena Simmons-Duffin on President Biden's health care actions today. Thanks a lot.\n\nSIMMONS-DUFFIN: Thank you.\n\nCopyright © 2021 NPR. All rights reserved.

Elizabeth Warren's Ambiguity On Health Care Comes With Some Side Effects\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Alex Wroblewski/Getty Images for GLAAD Alex Wroblewski/Getty Images for GLAAD\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren has built a reputation as the presidential candidate with a plan for almost anything. Plans are her brand, so much so that her campaign shop sells T-shirts proclaiming Warren has a plan for that.\n\nBut the Massachusetts Democrat has not rolled out a health care plan of her own. Instead, she has insisted I'm with Bernie on Medicare for All. (Recently, after weeks of being hounded by both journalists and her opponents, Warren announced that in the next few weeks she'll release a plan that outlines the costs for Medicare for All and how she intends to pay for it.)\n\nEarlier in this campaign cycle, Warren referred to Medicare for All as a framework and seemed open to alternatives, telling CNN's Jake Tapper that there could be a role for private insurance.\n\nBut Warren has also publicly tethered herself to Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders' Medicare for All plan, and on the debate stage this summer she raised her hand in support of eliminating private insurance.\n\nIn her academic work, Warren has long pointed to health insurance instability and high medical costs as a major cause of bankruptcy. In 2008, she co-authored a book chapter that referred to universal single-payer health care as the most obvious solution. But when that statement surfaced, and she was asked about single-payer during her 2012 Senate challenge to Scott Brown, she focused on cementing the then-newly passed Affordable Care Act.\n\nSome voters and old colleagues are convinced that Warren is not as resolute on health care as Sanders, perhaps because of that historic willingness to aspire to a progressive goal, but be open to other options if the goal isn't politically acceptable.\n\nThat flexibility might be a perception, but the frequency with which people bring it up is noteworthy.\n\nI think we need to improve Obamacare, have a public option, that's the better way to go, Donna Mombourquette said as she grabbed popcorn in between candidate speeches at the New Hampshire Democratic Party state convention last month.\n\nMombourquette, a New Hampshire state representative, said she considers Sanders too far to the left, particularly on health care. But Warren, who supports the same idea, is one of her top two choices.\n\nI guess with Elizabeth Warren, for some reason, I think that she's probably gonna be more open to moderating her positions to bring in more voters, said Mombourquette, who recently endorsed South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, but insists she still really likes Warren.\n\nThat inconsistency is hurting\n\nWhile some of Warren's fans might interpret her lack of health care details with their own positive spin, her opponents have not.\n\nYour signature, senator, is to have a plan for everything. Except this, Buttigieg told Warren in the last Democratic debate as he pressed her over her refusal to concede that Medicare for All would require raising taxes on the middle class.\n\nPublic opinion polling has consistently shown that a public option, which would create a broad government-run insurance program like Medicare or Medicaid as an alternative to private insurance, is more popular than a mandatory Medicare for All system that would entirely eliminate the current employer-based insurance system.\n\nWarren supports the less-popular health care option, and while that may be an uphill challenge politically, Chris Jennings, who served as a senior health care adviser to both Presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton, suggests the bigger challenge for Warren is that her lack of details on health care could undermine her brand.\n\nThis is the one area where her lack of directness stands in contrast with all her other policy visions and message approaches said Jennings. To me, that inconsistency is hurting more than even the policy itself.\n\nEarlier this month, after weeks of sidestepping questions about health care, Warren said that she intends to release a plan soon that explains how she intends to pay for Medicare for All.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Joshua Lott/Getty Images Joshua Lott/Getty Images\n\nWhenever Warren has been asked about a potential tax increase to fund Medicare for All, she tries to reframe the question as a matter of costs, not taxes.\n\nThis much I promise to you: I will not sign a bill into law that does not reduce the cost of health care for middle class families. That's what matters to them, and that's what matters to me, she recently told voters at a town hall in Des Moines.\n\nBut as some in the ultra-left progressive flank of the party have begun to suggest that Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders is the only true believer in Medicare for All, Warren has also made a point to reaffirm her support for the idea itself.\n\nMedicare for All is the cheapest possible way to provide health care coverage for everyone, she told voters in that same Des Moines speech. I want you to hear it from me.\n\nShe will think clearly about alternatives\n\nStill, there is a sense among some people who like Warren that her support for Medicare for All is somewhat out of character.\n\nI was a little surprised recently that she came out in favor of a Medicare for All plan, said Tom McGarity, who taught law school with Warren at the University of Texas in the early 1980s and is a fan of her candidacy. My guess is as the campaign continues, she'll refine that to some extent.\n\nIt's a very expensive proposition, and it's not well defined. One thing about Liz is, at least politically, usually before she comes out with something ... she defines it better, he added.\n\nThe Warren campaign has not responded to questions about whether she could eventually compromise on the issue.\n\nIt is not uncommon to meet die-hard Warren supporters who are lukewarm about Medicare for All.\n\nRecent polling from NPR member station WBUR finds that Warren is the most popular candidate in her home state of Massachusetts, but her idea of Medicare for All is not. Medicare for All Who Want It is a more popular option.\n\nI'm not sure that Medicare for All is the correct answer. I think a hybrid is perhaps a better answer, said Kimberly Winick, a former law school research assistant for Elizabeth Warren and a strong supporter of Warren's candidacy.\n\nThe real question isn't whether you support every plank of the platform, but whether you think the person standing at the top is somebody whom you can trust, she added.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Elise Amendola/AP Elise Amendola/AP\n\nAnd Winick trusts Warren. She worked closed with the senator in the 1980s on bankruptcy research and feels she has an understanding of her personality and work ethic.\n\nI also know down the road if it becomes implausible, impractical, impossible to do those things, she'll consider alternatives, she said. And she will think clearly about alternatives, she won't pretend facts don't exist.\n\nFormer Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid espoused a similar thinking recently in a podcast interview with David Axelrod, a former strategist for President Obama. Reid, in an attempt to defend Warren from criticism that she's too far left, gave the impression that Warren is not as committed to Medicare for All as she has suggested.\n\nHe said he advised Warren that strengthening Obamacare is the best plan for now, and a public option is as good as Medicare for all, anyways.\n\nThat's not what she's saying though, Axelrod responded.\n\nYou give her some time, Reid said. I think she's not in love with that, you'll wait and see how that all turns out.\n\nSo you think she's more pragmatic? Axelrod asked.\n\nOh, I know she's pragmatic, just wait, Reid insisted.\n\nBut pragmatism is not what Warren has been selling on the campaign trail. She often ends her stump speech with a promise to dream big and fight hard.\n\nIt's not clear how much wiggle room — if any — Warren has on the substance of Medicare for All. But health care consultant Chris Jennings thinks she has a little bit more negotiating space than some of her rivals.\n\nHer fan base, her voters, will give her more credit for trying to go as far as she possibly can on this issue, and then when, and if, she has to trim it back a bit, she'll have more room for compromise than many other candidates will, said Jennings. And I say that because she's viewed as a fighter, she won't compromise just to compromise, she'll compromise to get something done.
Reporters Say Members Of Congress Are 'Obsessed' With Getting Re-Elected\n\nJake Sherman and Anna Palmer, who cover Congress for Politico, discuss the power dynamics of Capitol Hill during the Trump Presidency. Their new book is The Hill To Die On.\n\nTERRY GROSS, HOST:\n\nThis is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. Congress in the Trump era is the subject of the new book by my guests Jake Sherman and Anna Palmer. It's called The Hill To Die On: The Battle For Congress And The Future Of Trump's America. Sherman and Palmer are senior writers for Politico and co-write the twice-a-day newsletter Politico Playbook.\n\nTheir new book covers Capitol Hill, when Republicans controlled both houses of Congress as well as the White House, and describes how the power dynamic changed after Democrats took control of the House last year and Nancy Pelosi reclaimed her position as speaker. One thing that Democrats and Republicans in Congress have in common during this divisive period is that they're both dealing with a president who is unpredictable and doesn't follow protocol when it comes to dealing with Congress.\n\nJake Sherman, Anna Palmer, welcome to FRESH AIR. So we're supposed to be a government of checks and balances. The Congress voted against giving President Trump the money he requested for the wall, so the president declared a national emergency to build the wall and plans on getting the money from other parts of the budget. And Republicans who voted against funding for Trump's wall seem to be willingly ceding their power to the president - ceding their power as being, like, a check against the president. Tell us why you think that's happening.\n\nJAKE SHERMAN: I think it's kind of the most recent example of a long string of Congress giving its power away to the presidency, to be honest with you. We've seen this in various fashions over the last 10 years. Congress has given away some of its power of spending and things of that nature. But this truly is new.\n\nAnd the fear from the people that we talk to every day on Capitol Hill is that the next president will come in and say something else is an emergency. And if they can't get it from Congress, they'll also declare an emergency and try to get money from other places in the budget. So I think, more than anything, this specifically is a very dangerous precedent to set.\n\nGROSS: Do you think that Republicans in Congress are afraid of President Trump and afraid to stand up to him?\n\nANNA PALMER: I don't think they're afraid. But I do think there is a concern about going up against the president on key issues like immigration and the border, for example, and what that impact might have on their re-election. One of the things that, you know, you find when you're talking to these members every single day is how obsessed they are with their next election and their popularity. And the president is very popular with the Republican base. And he has shown no compunction to do anything but go after Republicans who aren't in line with what he thinks.\n\nGROSS: So Republicans have traditionally been against massive federal spending and against deficits. But right now, I mean, the tax bill that Republicans passed has greatly added to the deficit. Spending for the wall that the president wants - I mean, that's a hugely expensive bill. And it's another issue where Republicans don't seem to be standing up to Trump on that. Have Republicans changed in their attitude toward spending as the party has gotten further to the right? Have the priorities shifted?\n\nPALMER: Yeah. I mean, I think it's actually pretty stunning. When Jake and I have been covering Capitol Hill Republicans in power for years, the orthodoxy was, spend less, cut spending. And Donald Trump came in and really doesn't care about any of that. And so one of the kind of interesting things that we discuss in the book - and talking to members who were his key allies, whether that's Mark Meadows of North Carolina or Jim Jordan of Ohio - that kind of cutting spending and government waste is - was how they came into office.\n\nThey, you know, are willing to let the president spend and do what he wants to on those things. But then there are issues such as immigration or the border wall where they really want to make sure and try to pressure the president to hold fast to where they are on those issues.\n\nGROSS: It seems so paradoxical that for the first couple of years of the Trump presidency, Paul Ryan was the speaker of the House. And he was, like, the deficit hawk. I mean, that was - there were so many programs he wanted to cut. That was his thing.\n\nSHERMAN: It was. And this is something that history will have to reckon with in a way that we are not able to at this moment or we're only beginning to be able to at this moment. But Paul Ryan's orthodoxy - his entire intellectual makeup and his entire partisan makeup - has completely shifted. As you noted, he was a spending hawk, a deficit hawk, who spent the first 15 or 20 years of his congressional career railing against the - a bloated bureaucracy and a bloated federal government.\n\nAnd he - Donald Trump - got into office. And in a sense, Paul Ryan, I believe, felt like he had lost the argument - that he presented one view of America, which he believed for - between 1999 and 2016. He was on the presidential ticket in 2012. And then Donald Trump got elected, presenting another, completely different view of the Republican Party in America. And Donald Trump won the presidency.\n\nSo I think Paul Ryan felt, at that moment, that he had a decision to make. Either he would have to retire, leave Congress, when Donald Trump got elected, or stick around and try - in his words and his thinking - to keep the government on the rails, to keep things from going too crazy. And that was his thinking as he got into Donald Trump's presidency.\n\nNow, a lot of people will say, Republicans only cared about deficit spending when Barack Obama was in office. And Donald Trump got in there, and they didn't care anymore. And there's some truth to that. And there's some truth to Ryan completely changing his tune on all of these things. And that's something we get into a lot.\n\nGROSS: Well, you write about how one of the reasons why Ryan wanted to stay in the House - 'cause he was conflicted about staying or going. He wanted to set an example that there could be, like - I think he used the word a normal person in Congress in the party.\n\nPALMER: I think Paul Ryan, and I certainly think Mitch McConnell, who leads the Senate Republicans, feel like they are kind of the guardrails of this presidency in terms of making sure that things don't go totally haywire. And so I think Paul Ryan - this - Donald Trump offends him in so many ways in what he personally believes, how the president tweets, how he, you know, is crass in some ways. That is not the kind of person that Paul Ryan believes he is himself or how he comports himself to be. But I think he felt a real responsibility to try and make sure that things didn't go completely off the rails.\n\nGROSS: But then he decided to leave.\n\nSHERMAN: He did. And in his telling publicly, it was because he has a young family. His father and grandfather both died young. And he's getting to the age where they passed away. And he had a sense of time in the sense that he thought, in his head, that he was lucky. He was living on borrowed time, in a sense. And he wasn't sure how much time he would have left, although he's a very physically fit guy and shows no sign of slowing down.\n\nBut I mean, you do get the sense - and we all got the sense from covering this every day for the last two years - that Paul Ryan did get sick of Donald Trump. And there were several episodes throughout the last two years where Paul Ryan got in massive, blow-up arguments behind the scenes with the president over immigration law, over spending, over just his behavior.\n\nThere's an episode where he says - he - the president said he wanted to do away with the 14th Amendment, which allows birthright citizenship. And Paul Ryan went on the radio and said, he can't do that. And then the president called him, screaming. And that's kind of a good encapsulation of their relationship. And President Trump, by the way, who we interviewed, said he - basically said he didn't really care that much for Ryan in the end. He said, he really abandoned me a few times.\n\nPALMER: Foxhole Paul.\n\nSHERMAN: He called him Foxhole Paul, which is his way of saying he wasn't in the foxhole with the president. Paul Ryan wasn't in the foxhole with the president. So it was a complicated relationship between two men who really did not care for each other but felt like they had to work with each other to keep the government open and to keep some things on the rails. Although, many would argue that things did go off the rails on many occasions.\n\nGROSS: Now, I want to ask you about Lindsey Graham. He heads the Senate Judiciary Committee. And after the House voted unanimously to release the full Mueller report, Lindsey Graham decided not to even bring that up to the Judiciary Committee. And Graham's been demanding that the Democrats also vote on appointing a special counsel to look into alleged Department of Justice misconduct on the investigations into President Trump and into Hillary Clinton.\n\nLindsey Graham used to be so close to John McCain - to Senator McCain. And President Trump seems to have missed no opportunity to insult John McCain. He insulted him during the campaign. He insulted him when he came to office. He insulted John McCain after John McCain died. And Lindsey Graham has become very close and very politically aligned to President Trump. Do you have any insights into what happened to Lindsey Graham between the time when he was, you know, the closest of allies with John McCain and now, when he's so close to the person who has maligned John McCain?\n\nPALMER: I think it's important to note that Senator Graham most recently did speak back home and said that what the president was - his most recent criticism of John McCain was not appropriate. And he really did push back on that. But I do think what you have to realize is, yes, John McCain and Lindsey Graham were close, personal friends. Lindsey Graham also tried to do a massive immigration deal. He has - he's up for re-election. And as I said earlier, what you really realize when you're on Capitol Hill every day is that when members are up for re-election, they are constantly looking at the numbers there. And it's a political calculus.\n\nI think he has decided that, you know, they - he doesn't believe that the Mueller report needs to be released. He wants to go - he has aligned himself with the president in a lot of ways. He's personally golfed with him many times. Being close to the president is politically advantageous to Lindsey Graham at this point.\n\nSHERMAN: I would say one more thing on top of that. I think that writing this book has made - has sharpened this point in my mind - that politicians really exist in a political moment, meaning they act the way they do because of the political dynamics at one moment. And number two, politicians are there to gain power, keep power and increase power. And however they might do that, they'll do it.\n\nAnd in this situation, Lindsey Graham basically said back home - Anna alluded to this - what the president said about John McCain wasn't right. But the voters of South Carolina put me in office to get things done and to work with this president, and I'm going to do that - basically saying, I understand that he's critical of my very close - former very close friend John McCain. I don't appreciate that. But I also have something else I need to do, which is to work with Donald Trump to achieve the policies I'm looking to achieve. And he's pretty brash about that. And he's pretty honest about it, even though, to everybody else - and many people we talked to - they find it to be intellectually dishonest. But that's the way he views it.\n\nGROSS: What are Republicans looking to right now to see if the winds are shifting against Trump? - because if they're aligning with Trump because they think it's going to help them with re-election, then they need Trump's support. But if Trump is losing support, then it would hurt them to be aligned with Trump when the next election comes around. So how are they testing the winds on that? - because it's always - it always seems to be questionable if there's going to be a point at which the wind shifts.\n\nSHERMAN: You saw this recently. The president said he wanted to do health care reform. And Republicans said, no, thanks. We lost the House of Representatives because we got into a prolonged fight over health care reform, a policy that Republicans do not have their arms around in a real, big way. And I think you saw them back off on that. And you see them back off on several other fronts, too. I think they're trying to put distance between themselves and the president where it's useful.\n\nBut, especially in the House of Representatives, many Republicans now hold seats that are overwhelmingly supportive of Donald Trump. The Republican Party on Capitol Hill now is Trump's party. And their fortunes - some - many members tell us, when they go home, they couldn't be close enough to the president. That's the political dynamic at this point. That's what the political map looks like at this point. They couldn't be close enough and tied closely enough to this president. And his - their fortunes are tied together. But in many of their districts, the president's still incredibly popular.\n\nGROSS: Let's take a short break here, and then we'll talk some more about what's happening in Congress now.\n\nIf you're just joining us, my guests are Jake Sherman and Anna Palmer. They co-write Politico's Playbook, and now they have a new book-book - (laughter) - which is called The Hill To Die On: The Battle For Congress And The Future Of Trump's America. We'll be right back. This is FRESH AIR.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF LOUIS SCLAVIS' FETE FORAINE)\n\nGROSS: This is FRESH AIR. And if you're just joining us, my guests are Anna Palmer and Jake Sherman. And they co-write Politico's Playbook. And they also have a new book that they've co-written called The Hill To Die On: The Battle For Congress And The Future Of Trump's America.\n\nLet's look at some divisions within the Democratic Party now between the mainstream of the party and the newer, more left members in the House, like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. And so there's questions now about whether to push for Medicare for All or make incremental changes in Obamacare, whether to go for the Green New Deal or more incremental environmental change. Give us a sense of the dynamic now in the House among Democrats, between the more left-leaning, new members - who are also largely, you know, younger - and the more veteran members, those who are more mainstream.\n\nSHERMAN: Yeah. The center of gravity in the House of Representatives among Democrats is Nancy Pelosi, the House speaker. And that's the - kind of an eternal truism about Democratic politics. Nancy Pelosi has been the leader of House Democrats now for a very long time and is probably as powerful as ever. And if you ask Nancy Pelosi about the Green New Deal or Medicare for All or any of these positions that some of the younger members are advocating for, she kind of deals with them in her own way by saying, I'm as progressive as they come, but I'm also about getting an outcome. I'm about solutions that can pass the House of Representatives and have a chance of, some point, getting into law. And she's spoken very dismissively about the Green New Deal and about Medicare For All and says we actually have a good health care system, called Obamacare, and we should improve and strengthen that. And she talks about the Green New Deal as the green new dream. She knows the name, obviously, and she knows what's in it. But she's dismissive of it, in a sense, and says she has her own solutions that she's been working on for many years.\n\nAnd I think there's some of the older guard. The Democrats that have been in the House of Representatives for a decade or more feel like they've been working on these issues for a very long time, and in come a new crop of freshmen and they're taking all the credit for it. And I think there's some tension there. But there's no question that the younger Democrats, like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and some of her allies in the House of Representatives, have brought an energy to the House that we really haven't seen in a long time, especially on the left. I mean, we saw a little bit in 2010 with Republicans, but - definitely have brought a new energy and a new vigor to a House Democratic Caucus that was increasingly old.\n\nGROSS: How are divisions among Democrats effecting the tactics that they're using to move forward with opposition to the president? Are they divided on those tactics?\n\nSHERMAN: Minorly, but not really in a major way. I'd say the one thing Democrats are completely on the same page on is going after President Trump with all the weapons and all the tools they have. Now, there is a small clutch of Democrats at the moment who believe that the party should immediately move to impeach the president. That's still a very small minority in the House of Representatives among Democrats. But I think that they have largely stuck together when it comes to demanding the president's tax returns, issuing subpoenas for bank records going back several decades from the president's businesses, things of that nature. I don't think you see much divide there, and I don't think you will, going forward.\n\nBut in a way, Democrats are helped by President Trump in that there's not much that could get the president's signature. They're not going to pass many bills into law. So they only really have to stick together on these big investigatory committees, on these big oversight issues, which is not difficult with a president who probably polls in the low teens, if that, with the Democratic base.\n\nGROSS: President Trump - you write that President Trump wanted Nancy Pelosi to be speaker after the Democrats won the House and that his plan was to ask the Freedom Caucus - the most conservative members of Congress, who are also his allies - to vote for her. And Trump told you that he thought the most conservative members of Congress would do him a favor and vote for Nancy Pelosi as House speaker. Tell us more about that. That's an interesting and surprising story.\n\nSHERMAN: I do think that there is some dynamic between Pelosi and Trump that's hard to capture and hard to explain. It seems like, from our experience both talking to the president and watching him publicly, he does seem almost taken by Pelosi, taken by her power, taken by her ability to corral Democrats together to keep them on the same page. And he lamented to us in the book that Democrats stick together much better than Republicans do, and that's something that he was very upset about and very regretful that Republicans couldn't stick together. He doesn't appreciate Democrats' policies, he says, but he appreciates their unity, which was an interesting insight into the president's head.\n\nBut also, furthermore, I do think that the president likes cutting deals with Democrats periodically. I think he likes the Hollywood flair, in his mind, and the ratings - again, in his telling - of doing business with Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer - by the way, two people that he's known for a very long time. So it's a very interesting relationship, and I think we'll see more in the months ahead between the Democratic speaker, who, by the way, President Trump was a donor to and was very, very, very praising of when he was a developer in New York.\n\nGROSS: Wait - to Schumer, not to Pelosi, right?\n\nSHERMAN: To both of them.\n\nGROSS: To both of them.\n\nSHERMAN: Yes, he wrote the - he wrote Pelosi a note when she became speaker in 2006 saying how great she was and how much he respected her. Again, I'm paraphrasing the president's words, but he sent her a note very praising of her abilities when she became speaker in 2006, 2007.\n\nGROSS: My guests are Jake Sherman and Anna Palmer, senior writers for Politico who co-write the newsletter Politico Playbook. Their new book is called The Hill To Die On: The Battle For Congress And The Future Of Trump's America. We'll talk more after a break. And Maureen Corrigan will review a new novel by Sally Rooney that was named the Irish novel of the year. I'm Terry Gross, and this is FRESH AIR.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ALLISON MILLER'S BOOM TIC BOOM'S WELCOME HOTEL)\n\nGROSS: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. Let's get back to my interview about Congress in the Trump era. My guests are Jake Sherman and Anna Palmer. They're senior writers for Politico and co-write the twice-a-day newsletter Politico Playbook. Their new book is titled The Hill To Die On: The Battle For Congress And The Future Of Trump's America.\n\nLet's talk about the role of the Freedom Caucus. You write about the Freedom Caucus a lot in your book. And I should say the Freedom Caucus is basically a far-right Republican caucus within the House. And their role has obviously changed from when the House was run by Republicans to now, when it's run by Democrats. But tell us how they were first created.\n\nSHERMAN: The Freedom Caucus came to be during John Boehner's speakership, and it was started by Jim Jordan and Mark Meadows - Jim Jordan of Ohio, Mark Meadows of North Carolina. And they wanted a small group of people who would be able to stand up against their own party when they thought their party went astray. And I visited Jim Jordan at his home in Ohio in reporting this book and talked to him about this. And he compares it to a union because in the House of Representatives, you don't have power as a single member of Congress. You have power if you band together and starve the speaker of the House of the ability to move legislation. And they were able to do that on almost every issue - tax reform, health care reform, spending, immigration. They were able to hold the party's feet to the fire, hold Donald Trump's feet to the fire and drag every piece of legislation to the right.\n\nAnd they found a kindred spirit, in a sense, in Donald Trump, who was elected, obviously, in 2016. They had been planning to try to oust Paul Ryan if Hillary Clinton was elected president. Instead, they found themselves with a ideological ally in the White House or someone they thought could be an ideological ally. And they have - and it's no overstatement to say they have really shaped the Republican Party in that image and shaped, in a small way, America the - some policies that got enacted into law in Donald Trump's presidency in their image over the last couple years.\n\nGROSS: What are the tactics that they used during Republican control of the House to block legislation they didn't like and to move legislation further to the right?\n\nPALMER: Yeah, I mean, they oftentimes - a lot of it's behind the scenes - right? - so it's not just going to the House floor. But it would be starving John Boehner first and then Paul Ryan of the necessary votes to get bills passed. They would - you know, in the book, we detail how both Mark Meadows and Jim Jordan went to the floor and, you know, kind of would give speeches that then would get played on Fox News that then the president would see. And so you see their impact kind of all along the way.\n\nAnd I would also say they also had - they - particularly Mark Meadows has a very good relationship with the president. And he was brought in on tax reform kind of surprisingly after he and Jim Jordan wrote a letter saying these were the kind of, you know, four or five things that needed to be in tax reform for their support. And not only did the president read it, but then the president wanted to make sure that he kept those guys happy.\n\nSHERMAN: One other tactic is they took unrelated bills hostage. They were looking for certain policies on immigration reform, so instead, they starved Republicans of the votes they needed to pass an agricultural policy bill. So they would take completely unrelated issues hostage to get what they want on issues that Donald Trump cared about, like immigration reform, immigration overhaul, restrictive immigration policies.\n\nSo they were really bending the legislative process to their will and angering a lot of people, but they saw Paul Ryan and the House Republican leadership as not representative of what Donald Trump got elected to do. They thought Donald Trump got elected on a very simple platform, which was building a wall on the border with Mexico and very restrictive immigration policies. And it was - in their view, they needed to do everything they could do to help the president achieve those ends, which, at times, included blocking unrelated pieces of legislation to make a point and to achieve an end.\n\nGROSS: Did the Freedom Caucus have just enough people to block legislation?\n\nSHERMAN: Yes, they had a little bit more than the margin that Republicans had over Democrats, which allowed them - basically gave them veto power over anything that Paul Ryan wanted to do. So if they stuck together, they were the most powerful 20 people in America or 30 people, depending on who their allies were on that specific issue, which is amazing. We had never seen power exercised like this in the modern House of Representatives.\n\nPALMER: I don't think you can underscore how frustrating it was to Republican leadership that this kind of band of ragtag Republicans that typically would never have been taken seriously would've, you know, given rousing speeches on the House floor, but would never have been able to control the agenda how big of an impact that made.\n\nGROSS: Now, you write Jim Jordan of the Freedom Caucus craves confrontation. Give us an example of a confrontation that he initiated.\n\nSHERMAN: Well, he was the mastermind behind the December government shutdown, which we know now was the longest government shutdown in American history - lasted more than a month and impacted Americans who work for the federal government to a degree that we're only beginning to realize. He went to the White House and pushed Donald Trump to shut down the government if he did not get money for his border wall. He thought - in his mind, Jim Jordan - some of his allies thought - in crises - in big legislative crises like a government shutdown, people's incentive structures in people's minds would be scrambled, in a sense, and they would make decisions that were irrational, which is an interesting way to think about governing. He thought if you put people against a wall, they might abandon their ideology.\n\nHe thought Nancy Pelosi - there was no way Nancy Pelosi could stand up for not having a wall on the border with Mexico. And he put that theory to a test and pushed Donald Trump into a government shutdown. So those were the kinds of things he did to try to achieve ends for Donald Trump. And I think the president realizes now that those tactics are not necessarily successful, not necessarily good strategy, but that's what Jim Jordan tried to do. He put the government in crisis and believed that he would be able to achieve an end out of that.\n\nGROSS: Let's talk about Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader. And you write, you know, with Congress often in gridlock, the judiciary has become more important. And McConnell's goal is to reshape the federal judiciary. How long has that been his goal?\n\nPALMER: Really, when you look at the Republicans and conservatives writ large across the country, the judiciary and the importance of the judiciary has been something that they have been talking about for years. It's something that wins elections for them. It's something that really energizes their base - you know, getting the Supreme Court to be more conservative. And what you've seen this Congress and even before is that Mitch McConnell - his single focus, more than anything else, has been to try to push through more judges that are conservative and - particularly in the Trump administration, they are younger. They are conservative. They are going to be on the bench for a very long time.\n\nGROSS: So he has changed some of the rules in order to push through very conservative judges. So what are some of the rules he's changed?\n\nSHERMAN: Well, I think it's most important to note the kind of unwritten rule that he changed back in Obama's years. President Barack Obama nominated Merrick Garland to be a Supreme Court justice when Scalia passed away. And Mitch McConnell, at that moment - that day, he was on vacation with his wife in the islands. And the moment Scalia, who he knew very well - the moment he died, McConnell took a pen out and wrote a statement, sent it to his office, saying, Merrick Garland will not be given a hearing. The next president will choose the next Supreme Court justice - which, by the way, was a massive gamble for McConnell because Hillary Clinton was ahead in the polls. Donald Trump, who McConnell likes to remind people was donating money to Chuck Schumer just a few years ago - Republicans weren't confident about how Donald Trump would view the judiciary, so it was a huge gamble. But McConnell - that was McConnell's goal, to not get Merrick Garland a hearing and not give him a vote on the floor. And he achieved that. And from that, he got Neil Gorsuch. And later, he got Kavanaugh. But that's right. I mean, McConnell has fast-tracked the procedures to get nominees to the floor and has done so with stunning success and has gotten dozens of judges on to federal courts across the country. And Congresses come and go, and people don't always remember that. The House flips all the time. The Senate flips all the time. Judges have lifetime appointments, and that's incredibly important to remember when thinking about Mitch McConnell and his long-term goals.\n\nGROSS: One of the things that McConnell recently did was to cut the debate time from 30 hours to two hours for judicial and administrative nominees. What's the significance of that?\n\nSHERMAN: The Senate has very arcane rules, to say the least. And it just basically, in layman's terms, allows him to move judges - more judges in a short period of time. Remember; the Senate is home probably one out of every four weeks. So instead of taking several days to move judges, he can move several judges in one day. And that's incredibly, incredibly important because the Judiciary Committee in the Senate can move judges out of their committee quite quickly. But there was this threshold that forced a slowdown in that process, and McConnell has completely removed that stumbling block. And McConnell's critics will say, well, this might not benefit you when you're in the minority. But McConnell's retort is that Democrats are blocking, and they're forcing Republicans to use up all of those 30 hours. And that's preventing the president from getting the judges he wants. And that's, obviously, a very big priority of the president, which McConnell is helping him out with.\n\nGROSS: Do you think McConnell is also thinking, by the time the Democrats have a majority, there will be so many conservative judges who have been appointed, it won't matter that much?\n\nPALMER: Sure. I mean, I think he's making a gamble to say, I'm going to stack the judiciary as far as he can according to Democrats' perspective. And, you know, he's going to continue that mission. When we sat down with him - I think a lot of people wonder what motivates Mitch McConnell because he's a man of few words. He doesn't get fiery. He rarely, you know, kind of does long speeches or different things like that. He's been in politics for a long time. But the one thing that is clear is he sees his legacy as the federal judiciary.\n\nGROSS: Let me reintroduce you. If you're just joining us, my guests are Jake Sherman and Anna Palmer. They wrote the new book The Hill To Die On: The Battle For Congress And The Future Of Trump's America. They cover Congress for Politico where they write The Playbook, which is a twice-a-day newsletter about what's going on on the Hill. We'll be right back after we take a short break. This is FRESH AIR.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF CUONG VU & PAT METHENY'S SEEDS OF DOUBT)\n\nGROSS: This is FRESH AIR. And if you're just joining us, my guests are Jake Sherman and Anna Palmer, who cover Congress for Politico. They write the daily newsletter the Playbook. And they also have a new book they've co-authored called The Hill To Die On: The Battle For Congress And The Future Of Trump's America.\n\nHow have you seen Congress change in the years that you've been covering it? And that's since 2009 and 2011 to the year or...\n\nSHERMAN: Yeah, that's right.\n\nPALMER: You know, I mean, I've covered Congress...\n\nSHERMAN: Yeah.\n\nPALMER: ...Since 2004.\n\nSHERMAN: OK, sorry.\n\nGROSS: Oh, OK.\n\nPALMER: I'm older. But we've been at Politico since 2009 and 2011.\n\nSHERMAN: We've been covering it together since 2009.\n\nPALMER: Yes. Yes, sorry.\n\nGROSS: OK. OK. So what are some of the ways you've seen Congress change in that time?\n\nPALMER: I definitely think that it has only become more partisan. I think that the way elections start - the day after a member is elected, they're raising money. They're trying to go back to their districts. There's not a lot of community and bipartisanship in a sense of Republicans and Democrats getting to know each other as humans, as people. And I think that's to the detriment of, you know, the institution in the sense that you don't give your colleague on the other side of the aisle the benefit of the doubt that they're coming from a good place. I do think the amount of money in politics has also increased tremendously in my time covering Washington. And the amount of dark money and 527's after Citizens United has had a huge impact on the overall tenor of things as well.\n\nSHERMAN: And I think Anna's right on the money front. I mean, individual House races - races that are conducted with electorates of five-, 600,000 people are costing tens of millions of dollars, which is just astronomical. People were raising several hundred thousand dollars in the past. Now they have to raise three-, $4 million for competitive races. And I think everything has become politicized. I mean, starting in 2009, Republicans made a calculated choice to - in the worst financial crisis in a very long time - to allow President Obama to pass legislation on his own without their help. It was a political decision, but it really set the tone for the last decade of legislating. And I'm not sure Republicans realized that at the time, but their decision to really oppose Barack Obama at every turn set the tone for just a really partisan phase in our politics.\n\nGROSS: Now that the Democrats control the House, it seems the people who really watch right now include the heads of some of the committees, like the House Intelligence Committee, Ways and Means, judiciary - the committees that are really investigating President Trump and continuing to investigate Russian interference in the election. So how are you covering them? You know, like Adam Schiff, Jerrold Nadler - they hold a lot of power now, and what they're trying to do could prove to be very significant.\n\nPALMER: I think we cover them like we always have. I think one of the great things about being a reporter on Capitol Hill that is unlike any other institution is the amount of access that you have to these members. You can follow them in the hallways. You can wait for them after votes. They regularly talk to - both Republicans and Democrats talk to reporters. And so I think that now that they're in power, we cover them because they get to make some of the key decisions about whether these investigations happen and how they happen.\n\nSHERMAN: And also they're sending letters every day. I mean, they're really pressuring the administration. But we also - it's important to keep in mind that everything flows through Nancy Pelosi. She sets the tenor and tone of all these investigations, and it's important to listen to every one of her utterances on every topic to really know what the Democrats are going to do when it comes to investigations.\n\nAnd I will say, within the Democratic Party, there is some nervousness about looking overzealous. I think that's something that we'll begin to see in the next couple months is Democrats wanting to make sure they proceed with caution because while holding Trump accountable is very important both substantively and in the polls - it polls very well - there is concern of overreach and going too far too quickly too much. There's a lot of committees looking into the president, and it's the Democratic leadership's job to keep it streamlined, to keep everybody in line.\n\nGROSS: I want you to tell a couple of stories about Jared Kushner that you learned that show the ability he thinks he has to fix things and to, like, change how Congress operates for the better.\n\nSHERMAN: During the shutdown, during the immigration fight in late 2018, Jared Kushner was not really involved in the immigration policy and not really involved in anything that was going on. And the - as the government was about to shut down, moments from shutting down, Jared Kushner blew into a meeting with with Paul Ryan, Steve Scalise and Kevin McCarthy and said, I wasn't involved earlier, but now I am, and I can fix this quite quickly.\n\nSo Jared tended to think, according to people that we spoke to for the three-year period, 2 1/2-year period that we were writing this book, that he had a unique ability to, again, bend the government to his will and to do things that otherwise people thought were impossible. And he came up short a number of times. He did have one big success in the Trump administration, which was he passed - he helped pass a criminal justice reform bill. But that's about it. That's really the only episode where he had been successful in getting Congress to do what he wanted.\n\nGROSS: Like a lot of other reporters, you reported that President Trump, you know, watches a lot of TV. And if he likes you on TV, he'll make an alliance with you or maybe give you an appointment (laughter). And so I'm wondering. He sees you on TV probably 'cause you - you're on TV a lot. And has that affected your access to him?\n\nSHERMAN: I don't think so. I mean, he's acknowledged passively that he has seen us on TV earlier before we started writing this book. So I don't think it's impacted our access to him, but it certainly has impacted other people's access to him and frankly has impacted who he's put in key government positions and who he's given jobs to and who he likes defending him.\n\nAnd I mean, we write in the book that members of Congress have literally rearranged their schedules so they can appear more frequently on television, which is really one of the chief ways that Washington has changed - is that daytime television is really prime real estate for policymakers and journalists and people who are trying to speak to the president or who want the president to hear them. I mean, dayside cable, which was at one point kind of an afterthought in the media climate, is now really prime territory for a lot of people.\n\nGROSS: All right. I want to thank you both for talking with us.\n\nSHERMAN: Thank you very much.\n\nPALMER: Thank you.\n\nGROSS: Jake Sherman and Anna Palmer are the authors of the new book The Hill To Die On: The Battle For Congress And The Future Of Trump's America. They co-write the daily newsletter Politico Playbook.\n\nAfter a break, Maureen Corrigan will review a new novel by Sally Rooney, who's been called the first great millennial author.

Through Regulation, Trump Could Dismantle Parts Of Obamacare\n\nNPR's Ari Shapiro talks with Sarah Kliff of Vox about how Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price could dismantle parts of the Affordable Care Act through regulations.\n\nARI SHAPIRO, HOST:\n\nNow that the Republican health care bill is dead, President Trump says his plan is to let Obamacare explode. There are lots of ways his administration can chip away at the Affordable Care Act, which is the official name for Obamacare.\n\nSarah Kliff covers health policy for vox.com. And she has made a list of things the administration could do by itself to undermine the system.\n\nWelcome to the program.\n\nSARAH KLIFF: Thanks for having me.\n\nSHAPIRO: First, is the Affordable Care Act already exploding, or does it require Republicans taking steps to make the system fail?\n\nKLIFF: I don't think it's exploding. It's not performing as well as Democrats would like. It certainly has its problems. But it is working. It's covering about 20 million people. But there are certainly policy decisions the Trump administration will need to make that will really determine if it goes into explosion mode like Trump is predicting.\n\nSHAPIRO: You've listed more than a dozen policy decisions the administration can or will have to make. In your opinion, what would be the single most consequential one that could undermine the Affordable Care Act?\n\nKLIFF: So right now there is this lawsuit pending over Obamacare's cost-sharing reductions. These are payment to insurance companies to offset the co-pays and deductibles for especially low-income Obamacare enrollees. The...\n\nSHAPIRO: You're talking about people who don't make a lot of money, who get coverage under the insurance exchanges, get basically underwritten by the government.\n\nKLIFF: Exactly. So these are people who earn maybe $20,000 or so a year. And if the co-pay is normally $10, they might pay a $3 co-pay because the government is paying the other $7.\n\nThere is a lawsuit right now brought by House Republicans saying that these cost-sharing reductions are illegal. The biggest thing the Trump administration could do right now to undermine the Affordable Care Act is just stop defending the lawsuit, to say, we agree with House Republicans; they're illegal. And that would wipe out a $7 billion fund that provides these cost-sharing reductions to low-income Americans.\n\nSHAPIRO: You write that the Trump administration could stop enforcing the individual mandate, the requirement that everybody have health insurance. Didn't President Trump sign an executive order basically saying this when he first took office?\n\nKLIFF: Not exactly. So he did sign an executive order that told the whole Trump administration to get rid of whatever regulations, whatever mandates you can. Just try and cut them out.\n\nThe hard thing about the individual mandate is it's part of the Affordable Care Act. You can't really get rid of it entirely through regulation. But what the Trump administration can do is essentially change the rules around the individual mandate.\n\nThey could say, the fine seems to be too onerous, so we are going to scale it back this year, or we're going to create more exemptions from the mandates so fewer people have to pay.\n\nSo they do want to get rid of the mandate. But what they need to do next if they're going to do that is write the rules around the mandate and essentially clarify if they're going to enforce it or not.\n\nSHAPIRO: Also on this list of ways the Trump administration could undermine the Affordable Care Act, there has been a lot of debate about essential health benefits. Those are 10 categories of services that insurers must cover under the Affordable Care Act, like maternity or pediatric care. What would it look like if the Trump administration decided to narrow the definition of these services?\n\nKLIFF: So you would have much skimpier health insurance plans. Things like you mentioned, Ari, maternity care, for example, used to not be covered in most individual market plans. The Trump administration is a little bit restricted on how much it can do on the essential health benefits here. They're actually written into law. So in the Affordable Care Act, it says that all insurance plans must cover maternity care, these other sets of 9 benefits.\n\nBut we're waiting to see right now, do they think there are things they can do through regulation to narrow that down or narrow down within maternity care - for example, what counts as covering maternity care? - or turn more of a blind eye towards health insurance plans that aren't covering those benefits.\n\nSHAPIRO: Can you give us an example of, for example, if they scaled back maternity care, what that might look like?\n\nKLIFF: Yeah, so they might take out, like, certain prenatal benefits, for example. Or they might try and target certain services related to breastfeeding after birth. So right now we don't really know. We haven't seen a proposal from the Trump administration.\n\nBut what they could do is say that fewer services count as coverage, essentially, to say, you know, as long as you're covering the actual delivery, that counts as maternity care. And we won't make you cover all the rest of the things associated with the pregnancy.\n\nSHAPIRO: If we imagine the Trump administration doing everything within its power to undermine the Affordable Care Act, how significant will the likely impact be? Could the administration basically make Obamacare fail by implementing all these changes?\n\nKLIFF: I think so. If they put them all together, if we take together, for example, not defending the cost-sharing subsidies, not advertising the marketplaces, scaling back the essential health benefits however they can through regulation, not trying to get more insurers into the market, I think you would definitely see some marketplaces collapse.\n\nOne of the things that's important to remember about Obamacare is it really varies a lot state by state. You have states like California that has a very active board running its marketplace. They'll be fine. They will make this work because they want to make it work. But you have big, rural states, like Alaska and Tennessee and a lot of states in the South, that could teeter into collapse if you make the policy decisions that are generally going to decrease enrollment and make insurance companies less excited to be part of the marketplace.\n\nSHAPIRO: Sarah Kliff is senior policy correspondent at Vox.

Affordable Care Act Can Stay In Effect While Under Appeal, Judge Says\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption AP AP\n\nThe federal judge in Texas who ruled the Affordable Care Act unconstitutional earlier this month said that the law can remain in effect while under appeal.\n\nU.S. District Court Judge Reed O'Connor wrote in his ruling filed on Sunday that many everyday Americans would otherwise face great uncertainty during the pendency of appeal.\n\nBut O'Connor still stands by his initial decision, he wrote, that a recent change in federal tax law that eliminated the penalty on uninsured people, in turn, invalidates the entire health care law, which is also referred to as Obamacare.\n\nBefore issuing the stay, O'Connor struck down the ACA on Dec. 14, siding with a group of 19 Republican attorneys general and a governor, led by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton.\n\nAs Julie Rovner of Kaiser Health News wrote for NPR following the district court judges decision, The plaintiffs argued that because the Supreme Court upheld the ACA in 2012 as a constitutional use of its taxing power, the elimination of the tax makes the rest of the law unconstitutional.\n\nJudge O'Connor agreed with that reasoning.\n\nIn some ways, the question before the Court involves the intent of both the 2010 and 2017 Congresses, O'Connor wrote in his 55-page decision. The former enacted the ACA. The latter sawed off the last leg it stood on.\n\nDemocrats, meanwhile, say they plan to challenge O'Connor's judgment. A spokesperson for California Attorney General Xavier Becerra — who's joined by 16 other states defending the ACA — said his state is prepared to appeal the December 14 decision imminently.\n\nWe've always said we're going to protect the healthcare of Americans and make clear that the ACA is the law of the land, Becerra said in a statement emailed to NPR. Today the judge granted what we asked for when we filed our expedited motion but at the end of the day, we're working to keep healthcare affordable and accessible to millions of Americans, so we march forward.
Questions About Obamacare's Future As Health Insurers Back Out\n\nAetna announced this week it's dropping out of Obamacare exchanges in 11 of the 15 states where the company has been competing. UnitedHealth and Humana are also scaling back their Obamacare business raising questions about the future of government run exchanges.\n\nAUDIE CORNISH, HOST:\n\nThis week began with a big insurance company saying it's out of the Obamacare business in nearly a dozen states. And it ends with policymakers wondering about the future of government-run insurance marketplaces. The Affordable Care Act created those marketplaces as a way to help individual consumers shop for health insurance. But Aetna is just the latest company to say it's scaling back its participation. NPR's Scott Horsley reports.\n\nSCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: Aetna and other big insurance companies say they've lost hundreds of millions of dollars trying to compete in the Obamacare marketplaces. Insurance premiums collected by those companies haven't covered the cost of providing health care to a population that's turned out to be smaller, sicker and more expensive than expected.\n\nAVIK ROY: Part of that was because they just guessed wrong that all the models that everyone was using indicated that it would be a much broader pool of people that would sign up - young and healthy people would sign up, for example.\n\nHORSLEY: Avik Roy was a health policy adviser to Republican presidential candidates Marco Rubio and Mitt Romney. He notes only about 11 million people bought insurance through the Obamacare marketplaces this year - just over half as many as congressional forecasters predicted. Next year, most marketplace customers will still have several insurance carriers to choose from, but Vice President Sara Collins of The Commonwealth Fund, a health research organization, says with Aetna, United Health and Humana all scaling back, shoppers in some areas may find slim pickings.\n\nSARA COLLINS: There is a concern that in some markets they'll be fewer competitors, and we know that when a market dips below three plans, the price competition really drops. There's just less incentive for plans to offer lower prices. These will likely be mostly in more rural areas.\n\nHORSLEY: Pinal County, Ariz., could be left with no insurance offerings in the Obamacare marketplace, though, Blue Cross is having second thoughts about its decision to pull out of that county. Competition among insurance companies is critical to help keep premiums in check.\n\nExperts have suggested a variety of carrots and sticks to draw more customers and insurers into the marketplaces. But, like everything concerning Obamacare, there are big political hurdles. For example, more people might buy health insurance if the government subsidies were more generous. But congressional Republicans are not about to approve additional spending on a program they already hate. Roy says Democrats, on the other hand, aren't likely to agree to bigger penalties to punish people who don't buy insurance.\n\nROY: You could double the signs in the individual mandate, for example, but that would, of course, be incredibly controversial and unpopular.\n\nHORSLEY: Finally, there's the so-called public option, a government-run insurance program that would compete alongside private carriers. Congress rejected that idea back in 2009, partly out of concern that government insurance would have an unfair advantage. CEO Drew Altman of the Kaiser Family Foundation says that objection might carry less weight in parts of the country that private insurers have already walked away from. But Altman admits passing a public option would be an uphill climb.\n\nDREW ALTMAN: That is a popular idea which is easier to say than to do or to accomplish politically.\n\nHORSLEY: President Obama argued in a recent journal article it's time to revisit the public option, and Hillary Clinton has called for that as well. Altman says Clinton may have to devote more energy to defending the Affordable Care Act on the campaign trail. Donald Trump and other Republicans point to Aetna's pullback this week as another sign the controversial health care law should be repealed.

'No Regrets': House Speaker Paul Ryan Will Not Seek Re-Election\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images\n\nUpdated at 3:00 p.m. ET\n\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan announced Wednesday that he will not seek re-election and will retire in January.\n\nYou all know I did not seek this job, Ryan said, addressing reporters. I took it reluctantly. ... I have no regrets.\n\nRyan, 48, cited wanting to be around his adolescent children more often.\n\nMy kids aren't getting any younger, Ryan said, and if I stay, they'll only know me as a weekend dad. That's it right there.\n\nRyan has three teenage children. He noted that his oldest just turned 16, which was how old Ryan was when his father died.\n\nI think we have achieved a heck of a lot, Ryan said, noting that Republicans did big things.\n\nYouTube\n\nBut the GOP-controlled Congress was only able to pass a signature tax cut legislation. That was something Ryan has been focused on since he entered Congress in 1999. On the other hand, Republicans during his tenure were unable to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, advance the ball on entitlement reform or cut the deficit. In fact, the deficit has only gone up. After a high-profile failure last year, Ryan described the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, as the law of the land.\n\nAnd Congress is not expected to get much, if anything, else done this year before the midterms.\n\nRepublican challenges\n\nRyan's departure is the highest-profile retirement yet in what has been a record number of Republicans already heading for the exits. Ryan wasn't the only person to announce his retirement on Wednesday: Rep. Dennis Ross, R-Fla., also said he won't run for re-election.\n\nThat means a total of 39 GOP members are not running for re-election — 24 are retiring from public office altogether, while 15 are seeking other positions. Democrats, meanwhile, are facing about half of that number with only 18 of their members not running for re-election to the House.\n\nThere have been rumors for some time that Ryan could retire. And his tenure has been something of an uneasy one — even before taking the job. Ryan ran for the post after House Speaker John Boehner was ousted, under pressure from conservatives in his conference.\n\nHe was thought to have little interest in the job, given his position as chairman of the powerful House Ways and Means Committee. But he was roundly seen as the only person who could get the votes necessary to be elected speaker.\n\nThose tensions didn't entirely go away within his conference, and then along came Donald Trump. Ryan was critical of Trump's demeanor during the 2016 campaign, but he soon swallowed those criticisms when Trump won.\n\nHoping to push forward on conservative legislation, Ryan worked with the president more than against, but he was still — on a near-daily basis — quizzed by reporters on the latest Trump tweet or sound-off.\n\nRyan did not mention Trump in his press conference but a source familiar with the speaker's decision insisted that it had nothing to do with Trump.\n\nTrump tweeted out praise for Ryan on Wednesday, calling him a truly good man. He also touts his legacy of achievement that nobody can question.\n\nFrom House staffer to Speaker\n\nRyan grew up in a Catholic family in Janesville, Wis., After his father died, he worked a series of blue collar jobs to help support his family and himself — from McDonald's to camp counselor to an Oscar Mayer salesman who once drove the company's famed Wienermobile.\n\nRyan was also a former congressional staffer before he rose to the highest position in the House. He interned for Wisconsin GOP Sen. Bob Kasten while he was attending college at Miami University of Ohio and later joined his staff. He had some odd jobs to help make ends meet during that time too, working as a waiter at a Capitol Hill watering hole and as a fitness trainer.\n\nThe politician who had the greatest influence on Ryan by far was New York Rep. Jack Kemp, the famed tax reform crusader and supply-side economics evangelist. He was a speechwriter for Kemp, would go on to work for the think tank he co-founded, Empower America, and would also follow in his footsteps as an ultimately unsuccessful candidate for vice president. Ryan also served as legislative director for then-Kansas Rep. Sam Brownback.\n\nWhen Ryan returned to Wisconsin to launch his own political career (running for and winning an open seat in 1998 when he was only 28 years old), he adopted many of those same conservative fiscal philosophies once he got to Congress. In addition to pushing for tax cuts, Ryan would go on to put an emphasis also on cutting the deficit and balancing the budget via major changes to social programs such as Medicare and Social Security.\n\nHis first major policy push came during the George W. Bush administration when he championed the president's plan to create private Social Security accounts. That crusade failed, but Ryan had put begun to make his mark on the House GOP conference. In 2007, he was named the top Republican on the House Budget Committee and regularly rolled out his own alternative budget frameworks to contrast with President Obama's fiscal plans.\n\nOnce Republicans won back the House in 2010, Ryan became one of the Young Gun GOP leaders on the rise and assumed the chairmanship of the Budget Committee. In 2012, Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney chose him as his running mate. After the duo lost, Ryan tried to refocus on working on anti-poverty policies and becoming part of a bipartisan group who wanted immigration reform. In 2015, he would become chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, giving him his biggest platform yet to push through some of his conservative economic ideas. Later that year, he would reluctantly succumb to calls for him to run for speaker after Boehner stepped aside.\n\nLooking ahead\n\nRyan has said he fully expects that this will be his last job in elected politics and the source familiar with the speaker's decision would not discuss Ryan's plans or next steps. He has always believed this [being speaker] is not a long-term thing, said the source.\n\nBut getting out of the spotlight now, especially in the Trump era, could help Ryan should he change his mind about running for office again down the road. Ryan, the vice presidential candidate with Mitt Romney in 2012, is, after all, only 48.\n\nBeing a congressional leader is usually not helpful to a politician's public image. They often become lightning rods for political partisanship. By getting out now, one theory goes, Ryan could lay low and potentially run for president at a later date.\n\nRyan's exit also adds another potential target for Democrats looking to take over the House this year. The filing deadline to get on the primary ballot in Wisconsin is June 1. The primary is Aug. 14.\n\nAlthough Ryan won his last re-election with 65 percent of the vote, he was facing a strong challenge from Democrat Randy Bryce this year, who had already raised more than $4.7 million.\n\nPaul Ryan decided to quit today rather than face Randy Bryce and the voters, said Bryce's communications director, Lauren Hitt.\n\nFormer Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California, the current minority leader, called Ryan an avid advocate for his point of view.\n\nShe added, Despite our differences, I commend his steadfast commitment to our country. During his final months, Democrats are hopeful that he joins us to work constructively to advance better futures for all Americans.\n\nKelsey Snell contributed to this story.
Obama Calls On Congress To Have 'Courage' On Health Care\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Getty Images Getty Images\n\nFormer President Barack Obama urged Republicans to be guided by a personal standard of ethics and integrity, not political avarice, as they forge ahead with plans to dismantle the Affordable Care Act — his signature legislation.\n\nObama had refrained from weighing in on the bitter health care battle, but he broke his silence while accepting the Profile in Courage Award at the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum in Boston on Sunday night.\n\nI hope that current members of Congress recall that it actually doesn't take a lot of courage to aid those who are already powerful, already comfortable, already influential. But it does require some courage to champion the vulnerable and the sick and the infirm, Obama said.\n\nHe also had these words of caution for members of the Senate, who will be taking up the repeal-and-replace plan next: I hope they understand that courage means not simply doing what is simply politically expedient, but doing what [people] believe in their hearts is right.\n\nObama never mentioned President Trump by name, but he did say that despite valiant efforts by many leaders who had come before him, health care overhaul had failed because it was hard, adding that it is easily subject to misinformation and fearmongering.\n\nHe commended the members of Congress who voted to push through the Affordable Care Act, which came to be known as Obamacare, in 2009 and 2010, saying they did so at great political peril to their own careers. Several lawmakers lost their seats in the following midterm elections.\n\nThese men and women did the right thing. They did the hard thing. Theirs was a profile in courage, Obama said.\n\nFurther reflecting on his first term, Obama recalled the brief period when Democrats and Republicans worked together to stave off a series of national crises. Amid the financial chaos that followed his inauguration, Obama said, the two sides enacted laws that kept the economy from free fall and saved the auto industry.\n\nIn addition to the words of advice he doled out to elected officials, Obama also shared words of encouragement with the electorate at large. (After all, he's one of them now.)\n\nEverywhere we see the risk of falling into the refuge of tribe and clan and anger at those who don't look like us, he said, adding, At such moments, we need courage to stand up to hate.\n\nThe Kennedy library bestowed the award upon Obama for securing health coverage for millions of Americans, a cause that was long championed by Sen. Ted Kennedy of Massachusetts, who died in 2009. Caroline Kennedy, the senator's niece and the daughter of former President John F. Kennedy, presented Obama with the award.\n\nToday, when many doubt the integrity of our elected leaders, this award is more important than ever, Caroline Kennedy said. She was followed by her son, Jack Schlossberg, who praised Obama for inspiring millions of young people like himself to become politically active.\n\nWithout President Obama, I might still be sitting on my couch eating Doritos and watching sports, he said.\n\nThe Obama-Biden bond appears to still be strong: After thanking the former first lady, Michelle, Obama also took a moment to note the former vice president, the best vice president this country's ever known, Mr. Joe Biden.\n\nObama is the third president to receive the Profile in Courage Award. Gerald Ford was honored in 2001 for making a controversial decision of conscience to pardon former President Richard M. Nixon. George H.W. Bush was a recipient in 2014 for the 1990 decision to raise taxes, despite declaring in his 1988 campaign, Read my lips: No new taxes.\n\nJFK Library via YouTube\n\nRead the full text of Obama's speech:\n\nHello, everybody. Thank you so much. Thank you very much. Thank you. Please, everybody have a seat. Thank you. Thank you very much.\n\nWell, first of all, thank you so much, Jack, for that really kind introduction. And I like the socks.\n\nI also want to thank you and Rose and Tatiana and your dad for sharing Caroline with us the past few years as America's ambassador to Japan.\n\nCaroline, you, true to form, did your country proud, and I'm sure your father and mom would have been proudest of all. I sure was proud, and I'm grateful for your friendship.\n\nI want to thank Ken Feinberg for his service as chairman of the John F. Kennedy Library Foundation these past 12 years. He also rendered outstanding service to my administration when we were dealing with the BP oil spill, 9/11. He has rendered public service again and again and again. We're very grateful for him.\n\nIt is wonderful — it is wonderful to see Senators Markey and Senator Warren; my dear friend and former governor, Deval Patrick, and his lovely wife, Diane; governors and members of Congress; Cardinal O'Malley; one of the finest secretary of states ever to represent America around the world, John Kerry, and Theresa; and the best vice president this country has ever known, Mr. Joe Biden.\n\nI also want to thank Michelle Obama for, after the presidency, sticking with me because I think she felt an obligation to the country to stay on. But once her official duties were over, it wasn't clear. I love my wife. And I'm grateful for her. And I do believe that it was America's great good fortune to have her as first lady.\n\nSo I am humbled by this evening and to be honored by a family that has given this country so much, a family that's challenged us to ask what we can do for our country, to dream and say why not, a secret cause that endures and to sail against the wind in its pursuit.\n\nThat's what this family has done for America. And to all the members of the Kennedy family that are here tonight, thank you.\n\nI could not be more grateful to the Profile in Courage Award Committee for this honor. I'm also grateful that, unlike the Nobel Prize Committee, you waited until I was out of office.\n\nHow fitting that we gather here this month, the 100th anniversary of President Kennedy's birth. I was born the year he took office, which makes me 55 years old. Had he lived to finish two terms, he would have been just 51. And he remarked on that possibility once. It has been suggested, he said, that whether I serve one or two terms in the presidency, I will find myself at the end of that period at what might be called the awkward age, too old to begin a career and too young to write my memoirs.\n\nNow, I hadn't seen this quote when I wrote my first memoir at 33. I'm now in the middle of my second. Moreover, I expect to be busy if not with a second career, then at least a second act. But it is true that I'm at the age, at that turn in the road, where one looks back as well as forward to remember one — where one has been, so it's better to chart where one is going.\n\nAnd one thing I'm certain is that I was lucky to be born into that new frontier, a new world and a new generation of Americans. My life in many ways would not have been possible without the vision that John F. Kennedy etched into the character and hearts of America.\n\nTo those of us of a certain age, the Kennedys symbolized a set of values and attitudes about civic life that made it such an attractive calling. The idea that politics in fact could be a noble and worthwhile pursuit. The notion that our problems, while significant, are never insurmountable.\n\nThe belief that America's promise might embrace those who had once been locked out or left behind and that opportunity and dignity would no longer be restricted to the few but extended to the many.\n\nThe responsibility that each of us have to play a part in our nation's destiny, and by virtue of being Americans, play a part in the destiny of the world. I can see truthfully that the example of Jack and Bobby Kennedy helped guide me into politics and that the guidance of Teddy Kennedy made me a better public servant once I arrived in Washington.\n\nI have to imagine it would give them great pride to see a new generation of Kennedys, like Joe, carving their own proud paths in public service.\n\nFor whatever reasons I receive this award, whatever the scale, the challenges that we overcame, and the scope of progress we made over my presidency, it is worth pointing out that in many ways the times that President Kennedy confronted were far more perilous than the ones that we confront today.\n\nHe entered the Oval Office at just 43, only a few years after Khrushchev had threatened to bury America. Wars raged around the world. Large swaths of the country knew poverty far deeper and more widespread than we see today. A young preacher's cause was just gaining traction against a land segregated not only by custom but by law.\n\nAnd yet in that volatile tinderbox of a time, President Kennedy led with a steady hand, diffusing the most perilous moment of the Cold War without firing a single shot and forcing the rights of young black men and women to study at the university of their choice. Unleashing a corps of young volunteers as ambassadors for peace in distant corners of the globe. Setting America's sights on the moon precisely because it was hard, unwilling to consider the possibility that we might not win the space race because he had an unwavering faith in the character of the people that he led: resilient, optimistic, innovative and courageous.\n\nIt's worth remembering this, the times in which President Kennedy led us, because for many Americans I know that this feels like an uncertain and even perilous time. The forces of globalization and technology have upended many of our established assumptions about the economy. It provided a great opportunity and also a great inequality and uncertainty for far too many. Our politics remains filled with division and discord, and everywhere we see the risk of falling into the refuge of tribe and clan and anger at those who don't look like us or have the same surnames or pray the way we do.\n\nAnd at such moments, courage is necessary. At such moments, we need courage to stand up to hate not just in others but in ourselves. At such moments, we need the courage to stand up to dogma not just in others but in ourselves. At such moments, we need courage to believe that together we can tackle big challenges like inequality and climate change. At such moments, it's necessary for us to show courage in challenging the status quo and in fighting the good fight but also show the courage to listen to one another and seek common ground and embrace principled compromise.\n\nCourage, President Kennedy knew, requires something more than just the absence of fear. Any fool can be fearless. Courage, true courage, derives from that sense of who we are, what are our best selves, what are our most important commitments, and the belief that we can dig deep and do hard things for the enduring benefit of others.\n\nAnd that's why JFK's first inaugural still rings true. That's why Bobby's campaign still means so much. That's why Teddy's cause endures, and we still love him so much.\n\nBecause of the tragedies that befell each of them, sometimes we forget how fundamentally the story they told us about ourselves changed the trajectory of America. And that's often where courage begins, with the story we tell ourselves about who we are and what's important and about our own capacity to make a difference.\n\nWe live in a time of great cynicism about our institutions. That's one of the few things that Democrats and Republicans can agree on. It's a cynicism that's most corrosive when it comes to our system of self-government, that clouds our history of jagged, sometimes tentative but ultimately forward progress, that impedes our children's ability to see in the noisy and often too trivial pursuits of politics the possibility of our democracy doing big things.\n\nOf course, disdain for elected officials is not new, as many of you in the room can tell others. Sixty years ago, President Kennedy quoted a columnist in Profiles in Courage who had written, People don't give a damn what the average senator or congressman says. The reason they don't care is that they know what you hear in Congress is 99 percent tripe, ignorance, and demagoguery and not to be relied upon.\n\nWhich is perhaps a little harsh. Ninety-nine percent seems high. Eighty-five?\n\nBut President Kennedy also wrote that the complication of public business and the competition for the public's attention have obscured innumerable acts of political courage, large and small, performed almost daily.\n\nInnumerable acts of political courage large and small performed almost daily. And that is true. I've seen it. I've witnessed it.\n\nI've been thinking on this notion of political courage this weekend, in particular about some of the men and women who were elected to Congress the same year I was elected to the White House. Many of them were new to Washington, their entire careers ahead of them. And in that very first term, they had to take tough vote after tough vote because we were in crisis.\n\nThey took votes to save the financial system and the economy, even when it was highly unpopular. They took votes to save the auto industry when even in Michigan, people didn't want to see bailouts. They took votes to crack down on abuses on Wall Street, despite pressure from lobbyists and sometimes their donors.\n\nAnd they found themselves in the midst of a great debate, a debate that had been going on for decades, a debate that the Kennedy family had participated in and helped lead: a debate about whether a nation as wealthy as the United States of America would finally make health care not a privilege but a right for all Americans.\n\nAnd there was a reason why health care reform had not been accomplished before. It was hard. It involved a sixth of the economy and all manner of stakeholders and interests. It was easily subject to misinformation and fearmongering.\n\nAnd so by the time the vote came up to pass the Affordable Care Act, these freshmen congressmen and women knew that they had to make a choice. That they had a chance to insure millions and prevent untold worry and suffering and bankruptcy, and even death, but that this same vote would likely cost them their new seats, perhaps end their political careers.\n\nAnd these men and women did the right thing. They did the hard thing. Theirs was a profile in courage. Because of that vote, 20 million people got health insurance who didn't have it before.\n\nAnd most of them — and most of them did lose their seats, but they were true to what President Kennedy defined in his book as a congressional profile in courage: the desire to maintain a reputation for integrity that is stronger than the desire to maintain office, the desire to maintain a reputation for integrity that is stronger than a desire to maintain office, a conscience, personal standard of ethics, integrity, morality that is stronger than the pressures of public disapproval or party disapproval, a faith that the right course would ultimately be vindicated, a faith that overcame fear of public reprisal.\n\nIt was a personal sacrifice. But I know, because I've spoken to many of them, that they thought and still think it was worth it.\n\nAs everyone here now knows, this great debate is not settled but continues. And it is my fervent hope and the hope of millions that regardless of party, such courage is still possible, that today's members of Congress, regardless of party, are willing to look at the facts and speak the truth even when it contradicts party positions.\n\nI hope that current members of Congress recall that it actually doesn't take a lot of courage to aid those who are already powerful, already comfortable, already influential. But it does require some courage to champion the vulnerable and the sick and the infirm, those who often have no access to the corridors of power.\n\nI hope they understand that courage means not simply doing what is politically expedient but doing what they believe deep in their hearts is right. And this kind of courage is required from all of us. Those of us who consider ourselves progressives, those of us who are Democrats, we've got some soul-searching to do to see what kind of courage we show. We have our own dogmas. Those of us not in elected office have to show some courage. And we're prone to bestow the mantle of courage too easily on the prominent and the powerful and then too eager to wrap ourselves in cynicism when they let us down because they weren't perfect.\n\nWe lose sight sometimes of our own obligations, each of ours, all the quiet acts of courage that unfold around us every single day, ordinary Americans who give something of themselves not for personal gain but for the enduring benefit of another. The courage of a single mom who is working two jobs to make sure her kid can go to college. The courage of a small-business owner who's keeping folks on the payroll because he knows the family relies on it, even if it's not always the right thing to do bottom line. The courage of somebody who volunteers to help some kids who need help.\n\nWhen we recognize these acts of courage, we then necessarily recognize our own responsibility as citizens and as part of the human family to get involved and to get engaged and to take a stand, to vote, to pay attention.\n\nI'm reminded of a story that Teddy once told me about his experiences many years ago when Teddy Jr., now state Senator Ted Kennedy Jr., was sleeping after one of his cancer treatments.\n\nAnd Ted would wander the halls of the hospital and talk with other parents, keeping vigil over their own children. These parents lived in constant fear of what might happen if they couldn't afford the next treatment. Some calculating in their own minds what they might have to sell or borrow just to make it for a few more months, some bargaining with God for whatever they could get.\n\nAnd right there in the quiet of night, working people of modest means and one of the most powerful men in America shared the same intimate and immediate sense of helplessness.\n\nAnd Ted could, of course, afford his son's treatment. But it was that quiet dignified courage of others to endure the most frightening thing imaginable and to do what it takes on behalf of their loved ones that compelled Teddy to make those parents his cause, not out of self-interest but out of a selfless concern for those who suffer.\n\nThat's what the ordinary courage of everyday people can inspire when you're paying attention, the quiet sturdy courage of ordinary people doing the right thing day in and day out. They don't get attention for it. They don't seek it. They don't get awards for it. But that's what's defined America.\n\nI think of women like my grandmother and so many like her who worked their way up from a secretarial pool to management and in the process pushed the glass ceiling just a little bit higher.\n\nI think about people like Michelle's dad who, despite MS, got up every single morning. Had to wake up an hour early to button his shirt up and put on his clothes and take those two canes he used and go to work every single day to make sure that he was supporting his family, not missing a dance recital or a basketball game.\n\nI think of the troops and the cops and the first responders that I've met who have put themselves at risk for strangers they will never know. And business owners who make every kind of sacrifice they can to make sure that their workers have a shot. And workers who take the risk of starting a new career, retraining at my age. Kids in the Peace Corps working to build bridges of understanding in other nations and spread the same values that helped bring down an iron curtain, banish the scourge of apartheid, expand the boundaries of human freedom.\n\nI think of dreamers who suppress their fears to keep working and striving in the only country they've ever called home. And every American who stands up for immigrants because they know that their parents or grandparents or great-grandparents were immigrants too, and they know that America is an idea that only grows stronger with each new person who adopts our common creed.\n\nI think of every young activist who answers the injustices still embedded in our criminal justice system not with violence, not with despair, but with peaceful protests and analysis and constructive recommendations for change.\n\nI think of the powerless who crossed a bridge in Selma and discovered they had power. Those who gathered at Stonewall and discovered they had a voice. Those who marched on Washington because they believed that they, without an army, without great wealth, could somehow change the very fabric of the greatest power on earth and kept on until they stretched the lofty ideals of our founding to encircle everyone.\n\nEvery citizen inspired by that history who dips their toes in the water of active democracy for the first time and musters up the determination to try and fail and try again, and sometimes fail again and still try again, knowing their efforts aren't always rewarded right away, because they believe in that upward trajectory of the American story, a story that nobody told better than John F. Kennedy.\n\nThat very Kennedyesque idea that America is not the project of any one person and that each of us can make a difference and all of us ought to try. That quiet sturdy citizenship that I see all across the country and that I especially see in young people like Jack and Rose and Tatiana, Malia and Sasha, and your kids.\n\nI don't know whether President Kennedy's aide and friend, historian Arthur Schlesinger Jr. was right when he wrote that history unfolds in cycles, but I do know that it doesn't move in a straight line.\n\nI know that the values and the progress that we cherish are not inevitable, that they are fragile, in need of constant renewal.\n\nI've said before that I believe what Dr. King said, that the arc of the moral universe is long but it bends toward justice, but I've also said it does not bend on its own. It bends because we bend it, because we put our hand on that arch, and we move it in the direction of justice and freedom and equality and kindness and generosity. It doesn't happen on its own.\n\nAnd so we are constantly having to make a choice because progress is fragile. And it's precisely that fragility, that impermanence, that is a precondition of the quality of character that we celebrate tonight.\n\nIf the vitality of our democracy, if the gains of our long journey to freedom were assured, none of us would ever have to be courageous. None of us would have to risk anything to protect them. But it's in its very precariousness that courage becomes possible and absolutely necessary.\n\nJohn F. Kennedy knew that our best hope and our most powerful answer to our doubts and to our fears lies inside each of us, in our willingness to joyfully embrace our responsibility as citizens, to stay true to our allegiance, to our highest and best ideals, to maintain our regard and concern for the poor and the aging and the marginalized, to put our personal or party interest aside when duty to our country calls or when conscience demands.\n\nThat's the spirit that has brought America so far, and that's the spirit that will always carry us to better days.\n\nAnd I take this honor that you have bestowed on me here tonight as a reminder that, even out of office, I must do all that I can to advance the spirit of service that John F. Kennedy represents.\n\nThank you all very much. May God bless you. May he bless these United States of America.\n\nThank you.
How Obamacare Affects Our Wallets And Debt Ratio\n\nA study examined the economic effects of the Affordable Care Act. Researchers found states that opted to expand Medicaid through Obamacare had residents with fewer unpaid bills and less debt overall.\n\nMARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST:\n\nWe've spent a lot of time tracking how the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, is affecting our health as a nation. Well, today we're going to take a different tack and ask how it affects our wallets. There's new research out on that. And here to explain it to us is NPR's social science correspondent Shankar Vedentam. Good morning.\n\nSHANKAR VEDANTAM, BYLINE: Hi, Mary Louise.\n\nKELLY: Hi. Set this up for us. What's the new research?\n\nVEDANTAM: Well, people sometimes forget that Obamacare is, first and foremost, about insurance. And insurance is really about economics. When you buy car insurance, for example, it doesn't make your car run faster or be more efficient in terms of fuel. But if you get in a car crash, having insurance means you have a financial cushion to deal with any unexpected health or legal issues. So this new study is really asking a very simple question - do we see similar economic outcomes as a result of health insurance as we do with insurance in other domains?\n\nKELLY: And I gather the experiment that they're looking at here is set up by the way that different states have implemented Obamacare.\n\nVEDANTAM: That's right. I was speaking with Sarah Miller at the University of Michigan. Miller and her co-authors Luojia Hu, Robert Kaestner, Bhashkar Mazumder and Ashley Wong...\n\nKELLY: That's a mouthful.\n\nVEDANTAM: (Laughter) It is. They analyzed the credit reports of hundreds of thousands of Americans. And they used this quirk that you're just referring to, which is Obamacare called for an expansion of Medicaid. Medicaid, of course, is health coverage for poor people. And under the ACA, a larger pool of poor people was going to be eligible for Medicaid. Several states, largely states led by Republican leaders who were opposed to Obamacare, elected not to expand Medicaid. But what this meant is that some states expanded it. Some states didn't. And now you have the workings of a natural experiment. Here's Miller.\n\nSARAH MILLER: Not all states adopted the Medicaid expansions of the ACA as was originally intended in the law. And so we were able to compare - how did these credit market outcomes evolve in states that opted to expand Medicaid through the ACA and states that chose not to?\n\nKELLY: OK. Shankar, help us understand that. She said they're measuring credit market outcomes - kind of a wonky term - what does that mean?\n\nVEDANTAM: It is a wonky term. Basically, what she was doing is she's look at the likelihood that people have unpaid bills and also have debts that are sent to collection agencies. Miller and her colleagues specifically looked at hundreds of ZIP codes around the country with high numbers of low income people. Presumably, these are people who would be affected by a Medicaid expansion. These are also people who might have their economic lives upended by a sudden health care emergency. Here's Miller.\n\nMILLER: What we found is that in the states that took up the Medicaid expansions, we saw significantly fewer unpaid bills on people's credit reports. And the amount of money that was owed that was in these unpaid bills fell as well.\n\nKELLY: Shankar, that seems like a fairly obvious conclusion - that in states where people have greater access to insurance, they're going to be less overwhelmed if they're suddenly find themselves in a medical crisis with huge bills.\n\nVEDANTAM: I think that's exactly right. I mean, Obamacare has become this highly partisan and politicized issue. But the researchers here are actually not trying to make a political point. They're just merely establishing that this effect that's widely seen in other domains - having insurance can cushion you against sudden financial losses - is also at work here.\n\nKELLY: Shankar, thanks so much.\n\nVEDANTAM: Thank you.\n\nKELLY: That is Shankar Vedentam.

As He Leaves The Senate, Harry Reid Says He's 'Hopeful' On Trump\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Alex Wong/Getty Images Alex Wong/Getty Images\n\nSenate Minority Leader Harry Reid will give his farewell address Thursday on the Senate floor. The Nevada Democrat has served in Congress for 30 years, and as his party's leader in the Senate for 12.\n\nReid tells Morning Edition's Rachel Martin that he — and many other Americans — are still anxious about the incoming Trump administration, but he sees reasons for optimism as well.\n\nI've learned to accept the Trump election, he says.\n\nInterview Highlights\n\nOn Americans' dreadful approval rating for Congress\n\nI agree with the American people. I don't have a real high regard for Congress either, because we're not getting things done.\n\nOn Republicans' assessments that Reid was, in the words of party leader Sen. Mitch McConnell, the worst leader here ever\n\nSometimes when people lose they strike out and say things they probably shouldn't. Sen. McConnell was at that time saying that because they'd held up scores of judges — 98 to be exact. We had a National Labor Relations Board they were going to put out of business. And he lost that. We changed the rules of the Senate so they couldn't do that anymore. ... They tried over 70 times to repeal Obamacare; they couldn't get it done. I'd consider that a kind of a loss, wouldn't you?\n\nOn why he thinks the Affordable Care Act might not go away\n\nIf they repeal Obamacare, they are in for a rude awakening. I don't think they want to get rid of health care for 21 million Americans. I don't think they want to be those who say that if you have a disability, you can't get insurance — the way it used to be before Obamacare. ... They repeal Obamacare at their peril.\n\nOn how his assessment of President-elect Donald Trump has changed\n\nI have to say this — he's not as bad as I thought he would be. ... We heard from Trump that one of the first things he was going to do is repeal [the Dreamers] executive order. In an interview he had with Time magazine in the last day or two, he said, Nah, I'm not going to do that — those young people deserve to stay here. He's not going to prosecute Hillary Clinton criminally, as he said he would do. Obviously he didn't believe in all of the stuff he said — which is a step in the right direction. ...\n\nYou know, it's not as if Donald Trump and I have been enemies our whole lives — he's done fundraisers for me. When I was elected last time he sent me a letter saying you're awesome — a handwritten note. ... It's not as if I have hate in my soul for Donald Trump. I hope, beyond all, that he does well. It's important to the stability of this great nation we have. And I'm hopeful — I keep using that word, but that's what it is — hopeful that he will lessen his rhetoric and work toward a safer, more productive America.
Federal Judge Strikes Down Affordable Care Act As Unconstitutional\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Eric Gay/AP Eric Gay/AP\n\nA federal judge in Texas issued a ruling Friday declaring the Affordable Care Act unconstitutional, apparently setting the stage for another hearing on the health care law by the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nThe ruling by U.S. District Judge Reed O'Connor invalidates what's commonly referred to as Obamacare nationwide and casts into doubt the survival of the law on the eve of the deadline for tens of millions of Americans to sign up for health care coverage in 2019.\n\nThe ruling comes in a lawsuit brought against what was one of the major domestic achievements of the Obama administration. An alliance of 19 Republican attorneys general and a governor led by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton challenged the law.\n\nAs NPR's Alison Kodjak explained on All Things Considered,\n\nThe lawsuit had to do with whether when Congress last year repealed or eliminated the penalty for not having insurance — it was a tax penalty for people who didn't have insurance — whether that meant the rest of the law didn't apply anymore. The court case argued that all of the pieces of the law were dependent upon each other, so by eliminating the penalty the rest of the law fell apart. The judge agreed with that opinion.\n\nIn his 55-page opinion,O'Connor said the debate over the ACA's interlocking provisions is like watching a slow game of Jenga, each party poking at a different provision to see if the ACA falls.\n\nIn a statement, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders praised the ruling.\n\nObamacare has been struck down by a highly respected judge. The judge's decision vindicates President Trump's position that Obamacare is unconstitutional. Once again, the President calls on Congress to replace Obamacare and act to protect people with preexisting conditions and provide Americans with quality affordable healthcare. We expect this ruling will be appealed to the Supreme Court. Pending the appeal process, the law remains in place.\n\nShortly afterwards, Trump tweeted, As I predicted all along, Obamacare has been struck down as an UNCONSTITUTIONAL disaster! Now Congress must pass a STRONG law that provides GREAT healthcare and protects pre-existing conditions.\n\nCalifornia Attorney General Xavier Becerra, who led the coalition of states that defended the ACA promised to continue the court fight to preserve the law.\n\nRep. Nancy Pelosi, who is expected to be House speaker when Democrats come into the majority next month, tweeted, Tonight's absurd ruling exposes the monstrous endgame of the GOP's all-out assault on people w/ pre-existing conditions & the ACA. When @HouseDemocrats take the gavel, the House will swiftly intervene in the appeals process to #ProtectOurCare!
If Republicans Repeal Obamacare, Ryan Has Replacement Blueprint\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Allison Shelley/Getty Images Allison Shelley/Getty Images\n\nDonald Trump and Republicans in Congress are vowing to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, the signature health care overhaul of President Obama.\n\nTrump has offered a few ideas of where he'd like to see a health care overhaul go, such as a greater reliance on health savings accounts, but he hasn't provided a detailed proposal.\n\nThe absence of specifics on health care from the president-elect makes the 37-page plan that Speaker of the House Paul Ryan has released the fullest outline of what Republicans would like to replace Obamacare. Some health policy analysts say it looks a bit like Obamacare light.\n\nRepublicans through this plan have embraced, I think rightfully so, the basic idea that everybody in the U.S. should have health insurance, says Jim Capretta, a health policy fellow at the American Enterprise Institute. And people who are outside the employer system should get some level of financial help through a tax credit, because, frankly, that's similar to the tax break that is available through employer coverage.\n\nRepublicans had been criticized for years for promising to repeal the ACA and offering nothing as a replacement. Ryan unveiled the proposal at AEI in June.\n\nThe Wisconsin Republican's comments at the time reflected that: Well, here it is, a real plan, in black and white, right here. We are officially putting it on the table.\n\nThe Ryan report details what he says is wrong with Obamacare and how Republicans could fix it.\n\nThe upshot?\n\nDon't force people to buy insurance, Ryan told the crowd. Make insurance companies compete for our business.\n\nAnd, yes, he added, we're going to help you buy insurance.\n\nWhile the Ryan plan gets rid of the mandate to buy insurance, it otherwise has many provisions that will be familiar to people who know Obamacare. It would offer tax credits to help people pay for insurance. And it would protect people with existing illnesses and medical conditions from being dropped by their health plans.\n\nThe main difference from the Affordable Care Act reflects the conservative view that a market approach could make health care more efficient, and cheaper.\n\nWhile the Ryan proposal is more detailed than many, it does lack some key information. Most importantly, the size of the subsidies that would be offered is unknown, as is the level of insurance that would be tied to them.\n\n\n\nObamacare bases its financial assistance on a policy that pays a set percentage of a person's health care costs and that carries a minimum set of benefits. Ryan has only hinted at what level of insurance coverage his subsidies are expected to buy.\n\nBut a major aim of his overhaul is to move people to insurance policies that carry high deductibles. To pay those deductibles and other health care costs, people would have tax-free health savings accounts. The individual, government or employer could contribute to such an account. That could keep premium costs down for young, healthy people, says Paul Howard, director of health policy at the conservative Manhattan Institute.\n\nMost of the care that most people need for most of their adult lives can be very inexpensive, Howard says.\n\nSo rather than spending a lot of money on premiums for insurance they don't need, people could save that money for when they do get sick. Howard says people could start young and save for major health problems over time.\n\nBy the time you're 40, ideally, you would have built up a health savings plan that would be partly funded by government sources, plus your own sources, a significant nest egg, he says.\n\nRyan also wants to limit the tax breaks for employer-based insurance to nudge companies into buying cheaper, high deductible, policies for their employees too. The idea is similar to the so-called Cadillac tax in Obamacare that levies a tax surcharge for expensive health insurance policies.\n\nHoward says workers might prefer a high-deductible plan, especially if they were aware of how much of their compensation goes to health insurance. He says companies should ask their employees the following.\n\nDo you know that $20,000 of your wages are going every year to insurance? he asks. Would you rather have $10,000 in your pocket, put $5,000 into a high-deductible plan or something like that, and then put some aside for a rainy day that will accumulate over time?\n\nConservatives argue that making people buy their own health care — even with money provided by the government or their employer — will get them to shop around for the best quality and price, and lower overall health care costs in the long run.\n\nRyan wants to launch his new system with a single open enrollment period, rather than the annual sign-up windows offered under Obamacare.\n\nPeople with ongoing medical conditions who maintain their coverage continuously can't be cut off, or see their prices raised. But what if you let your coverage lapse?\n\nYou could be denied a policy because you have diabetes, and the next time you could get coverage again would be when you turn 65 and become eligible for Medicare, says Sabrina Corlette, a professor at the Georgetown Center for Health Policy Reform. The effect of it could be to lock a lot of people out who have pre-existing conditions.\n\nFor people in that situation, Ryan has proposed creating high risk pools — special government subsidized coverage for hard to insure people like those with cancer or other chronic illnesses.\n\nCorlette, however, says high-risk pools have been tried already, in 35 states, and failed.\n\nWhen you put people into this insurance ghetto, which is these high risk pools, the cost is going to be extraordinarily high, she says.\n\nCorlette says Ryan's plan covers fewer people and offers fewer benefits.\n\nWhat Paul Ryan has called for is a much skimpier set of protections so that tax credit buys you a lot less than it would have under the ACA, she says.\n\nA key feature of Obamacare is that it spreads the cost of insurance across generations. So healthy young people subsidize older sicker people who use more health care.\n\nRyan's plan would change that.
Trump Highlights Health Agenda And Vows To Lower 'Unfair' Drug Prices\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Alex Wong/Getty Images Alex Wong/Getty Images\n\nHealth was a persistent theme, if not the centerpiece, of President Trump's State of the Union address at the Capitol on Tuesday night.\n\nThe president laid out a series of health-related goals, including some that even Democrats indicated could be areas of bipartisan negotiation or compromise. Trump vowed to take on prescription drug prices, pursue an end to the HIV epidemic in the U.S. by 2030 and boost funding for childhood cancers.\n\nHe also took a victory lap for goals that his administration had accomplished. We eliminated the very unpopular Obamacare individual mandate penalty, he said, referring to the requirement in the Affordable Care Act that most people must have health insurance or pay a fine. It was eliminated as part of the 2017 GOP tax bill, despite backlash from critics that it could undercut Obamacare, after many failed attempts by Republicans to repeal the law.\n\nAnd Trump noted congressional passage of a right-to-try bill that was supposed to make it easier for terminally ill patients to gain access to experimental medications, but so far, few patients have been able to make the law work for them.\n\nThe most likely ground for bipartisanship will be the issue of drug prices, where Democrats are as eager as the president to do something to rein in prices.\n\nIt is unacceptable that Americans pay vastly more than people in other countries for the exact same drugs, often made in the exact same place. This is wrong, this is unfair, and together we will stop it. We will stop it fast, he said. I am asking the Congress to pass legislation that finally takes on the problem of global freeloading and delivers fairness and price transparency for American patients.\n\nDemocrats are cautiously optimistic on the drug price front. I really am hopeful about making strides on prescription drug legislation this year on a bipartisan basis, Wendell Primus, top health aide to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said at a conference for health policy researchers hours before the speech.\n\nBut not all of Trump's claims Tuesday about his efforts on drug pricing stand up to close scrutiny. He proclaimed that in 2018, drug prices experienced their single-largest decline in 46 years. The drug-price portion of the consumer price index declined slightly last year for the first time since 1972, but prices for many individual drugs are still rising.\n\nFactors beyond the administration's actions appear to have played the biggest role in the overall slowdown. Drug price increases have slowed largely because patents have expired on expensive, blockbuster drugs, and several years have passed since the introduction of expensive medicines to treat hepatitis C, according to independent analysts.\n\nBut even as consumer drug prices have moderated, drug spending per hospital admission soared 19 percent from 2015 to 2017, a study sponsored by hospital trade groups found last month. That includes anesthesia drugs, chemotherapy infusions and other medicines that are not counted in the CPI.\n\nSome well-placed Republicans praised the drug price effort. I expect deep-pocketed interests to oppose anything and everything to protect the status quo, said Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, chairman of the powerful Senate Finance Committee. But the moment is ripe for action and Americans expect us to work together to get the job done.\n\nNews organizations including NPR and Kaiser Health News have reported on dozens of cases of surprise hospital bills, unaffordable costs for life-sustaining drugs and other health-expense shocks for patients.\n\nShereese Hickson, whose experience with a $123,000 bill for multiple sclerosis drugs was covered by KHN and NPR, was watching the speech. I'm glad he mentioned it, she said of Trump's promise to bring transparency and competition to pharmaceutical prices. But I would like to see if it really will come true. If you do that — that's going against the drug companies. They'll be losing money and they're not going to let that happen.\n\nPaul Davis — a retired doctor from Findlay, Ohio, whose family's experience with a $17,850 bill for a simple urine test was detailed in a story that launched NPR-KHN's Bill of the Month project last year and who met with Trump about surprise billing last month — said he was disappointed Trump didn't go into further detail about his health care proposals.\n\nHe didn't say anything, Davis said.\n\nDavis said he would have liked to have heard more about the administration's recently announced plan to eliminate drug rebates negotiated by middlemen in the Medicare drug program, as well as the recently implemented policy requiring hospitals to list their prices online.\n\nIf he wanted to use the podium to talk about the wonderful things that he's done, that's one of the things he's gotten accomplished, Davis said.\n\nIn their official responses to the speech, Democrats were more combative. In this great nation, Americans are skipping blood pressure pills, forced to choose between buying medicine or paying rent, said Stacey Abrams, former Georgia House minority leader and a rising star in the national Democratic Party. Maternal mortality rates show that mothers, especially black mothers, risk death to give birth. And in 14 states, including my home state where a majority want it, our leaders refuse to expand Medicaid, which could save rural hospitals, economies and lives.\n\nCalifornia Attorney General Xavier Becerra, who gave the Spanish-language Democratic response, reminded viewers that while the Trump administration is seeking to have the Affordable Care Act overturned in court, Democrats would provide medical care for your family that no politician can take away from you.\n\nIn another outreach to Democrats, Trump vowed that his budget will ask Democrats and Republicans to make the needed commitment to eliminate the HIV epidemic in the United States within 10 years. Together, we will defeat AIDS in America, he said.\n\nGroups that have been fighting HIV praised the promise.\n\nWhile we might have policy differences with the president and his administration, this initiative, if properly implemented and resourced, can go down in history as one of the most significant achievements of his presidency, said Michael Ruppal, executive director of The AIDS Institute.\n\nTrump also promised that his budget, which has been delayed by the recent government shutdown, will seek new funding to expand research into cures and treatments for childhood cancer.\n\nHe said he will seek $500 million over the next 10 years to fund this critical lifesaving research. The National Institutes of Health has long been a bipartisan favorite in Congress, although Trump in his first budget did seek cuts in NIH funding.\n\nThe one area in which bipartisanship will clearly not prevail is that of abortion. Trump reiterated a promise he made to anti-abortion groups as a candidate in 2016 and pushed for a federal bill to ban abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy.\n\nLet us reaffirm a fundamental truth: All children — born and unborn — are made in the holy image of God, he said.\n\nSenate Republicans voted on such a bill in 2018; it failed to advance by a large margin. The bill still lacks the votes in the Senate, and the House now has a majority that supports abortion rights.\n\nAbortion opponents praised the president's comments. Once again, President Trump has proved he is our nation's most pro-life president ever and he is keeping his promise to the voters who fueled his victory, said Marjorie Dannenfelser of the Susan B. Anthony List.\n\nAbortion-rights supporters, meanwhile, chastised Trump's comments.\n\nShame on the president for using the State of the Union to vilify people who have abortions and the providers who care for them, said Megan Donovan of the Guttmacher Institute. Make no mistake: This is part of a larger agenda to eliminate access to abortion altogether.\n\nKaiser Health News is a nonprofit news service that is an editorially independent program of the Kaiser Family Foundation.

Newest Senate Health Care Overhaul Would Increase Uninsured By 22 Million, CBO Says\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Alex Wong/Getty Images Alex Wong/Getty Images\n\nThe Republican scramble to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act has yielded yet another version of a health care overhaul bill, along with yet another score from the Congressional Budget Office — the second analysis from the nonpartisan agency in two days.\n\nThe CBO released its Thursday analysis hours after Senate Republicans posted a new draft, but the updated budget report had a familiar ring to it. The agency found that, like a prior Senate version, the latest bill would increase the number of uninsured Americans by 22 million by 2026. Not only that, but as with all other things health care-related these days, it is likely to change in the near future.\n\nAside from increasing the number of uninsured compared to Obamacare, Thursday's version would also lower premiums and reduce the deficit. The latest draft would reduce the deficits to greater degrees than the older draft: $420 billion, compared to $321 billion in the previously scored version. It would also reduce average premiums in the Obamacare exchanges by 25 percent in 2026, as opposed to the last version's 20 percent.\n\nThe provisions in the latest version of the Senate bill are much like the version scored at the end of June: It would end the individual and employer mandates, it would roll back the Affordable Care Act's Medicaid expansion and cut spending to that program by hundreds of millions of dollars, and roll back some taxes. However, this bill would not roll back Obamacare investment income taxes and payroll taxes that hit higher-income Americans.\n\nNotably, Thursday's bill does not have a provision known as the Cruz amendment, pushed by Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas. That amendment, included in a version of the bill released on July 13, said that as long as an insurer offers an Obamacare-compliant plan, it can also offer noncompliant, less-comprehensive plans.\n\nTwo large health insurance industry groups, America's Health Insurance Plans and the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association, called the provision simply unworkable in any form and said that it would mean prices go up and millions of people who buy on the individual market will lose insurance.\n\nThat's because it could lead to a bifurcated market, in which sick people gravitate to the more comprehensive plans and healthy people choose the skimpier coverage. That could create expensive insurance in the sicker pool, meaning some people would get priced out of that pool, which could drive prices even higher. And that would mean more government spending on premium subsidies, as the Kaiser Family Foundation's Larry Levitt noted on Thursday (meaning the CBO's latest deficit-reduction estimate could see a sizable change with a Cruz amendment).\n\nThat amendment could still be added to this bill later, and it would likely change these latest headline numbers — potentially in a big way. A Senate Republican aide told Bloomberg news that the bill didn't include the Cruz amendment because the CBO isn't scoring it yet.\n\nIn a call on Thursday, CBO staff said they would evaluate the Cruz amendment, but had no information on when that estimate might be available.\n\nThe latest analysis comes just a day after the CBO estimated that a repeal-only bill — without an immediate plan for what would replace the current health law — would increase the uninsured population by 32 million by 2026.\n\nThat repeal-only bill is one option Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has placed on the table as a possibility for senators to consider next week.\n\nTo proceed on any health plan, McConnell must get 50 senators to vote yes on a motion to proceed (Vice President Pence would provide the 51st vote needed). That would allow senators to begin debating whatever health care legislation they present.
TAMARA KEITH, HOST:\n\nExciting news before we start the show - we are doing a live taping of our podcast at the Warner Theatre in Washington, D.C., on November 8. Go to nprpresents.org to get your tickets now. Now let's talk about that Democratic debate in Texas that was hosted by ABC News.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, FLAWLESS)\n\nUNIDENTIFIED SINGER: (Singing) I'm out that H-town, coming, coming down.\n\nKEITH: Hey there. It's the NPR POLITICS PODCAST. I'm Tamara Keith. I cover the White House.\n\nSCOTT DETROW, BYLINE: I'm Scott Detrow. I cover the campaign.\n\nAYESHA RASCOE, BYLINE: I'm Ayesha Rascoe. I also cover the White House.\n\nRON ELVING, BYLINE: And I'm Ron Elving, editor correspondent.\n\nKEITH: And, of course, that is Houston's own Beyonce Knowles instead of our regular theme music. And the time now is 11:23 p.m. on Thursday, September 12. The third Democratic debate just ended a bit ago. And I'm here in studio in D.C. with Ron. Hey, Ron.\n\nELVING: Good to be here with you, Tam.\n\nKEITH: Scott and Ayesha, where are you right now?\n\nDETROW: So I am looking down over the debate room. It's in a gym on campus. And I am on the little indoor running track hovering above the gym, looking down on all the spin.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nKEITH: Ayesha?\n\nELVING: Scott hovering.\n\nRASCOE: I'm in my bedroom, which is very messy.\n\nKEITH: (Laughter).\n\nRASCOE: So it's a lot of mess. I'm looking at a lot of mess.\n\nKEITH: But, you know, what is great about a messy bedroom is there are more clothes on the floor to dampen the sound and make it sound more like a studio.\n\nDETROW: Tam, you are such a thorough journalist that you felt the need to say Knowles when you said that was Beyonce Knowles.\n\nKEITH: (Laughter).\n\nDETROW: Like, oh, I thought it was Beyonce Smith. OK.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nKEITH: All right. So we are all here tonight to break down the key moments from this, the, third Democratic debate. But first let us do our traditional thing by running through all of the candidates who are on the stage in order of their speaking time. Ayesha.\n\nRASCOE: Yes. So at the very top - but this is just time-wise, speaking-time-wise - former Vice President Joe Biden. And he clocked in at 17 minutes, eight seconds. And right behind him came Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren, who clocked in at 16 minutes, 38 seconds. So after them, in kind of descending order, you have Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, California Senator Kamala Harris, New Jersey Senator Cory Booker, South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, former HUD Secretary Julian Castro, Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar, former Texas Congressman Beto O'Rourke. And businessman Andrew Yang clocked in at the very end with eight minutes, one second.\n\nKEITH: All right. So, Ron, Scott, Ayesha, this is the third of these debates. What was - Ron, I'll start with you. What was your big takeaway from this?\n\nELVING: Unlike the first two rounds of these debates, even though there were 10 people on stage still, the way it was structured, the candidates each had a little bit more time to talk, a little more time for interchange and clarity. It seemed like - and more healthy energy. There was more energy. It was a slightly more positive energy with one or two exceptions. Almost all the candidates had some strong moments. Almost all of them had some weak moments. I thought Cory Booker, Amy Klobuchar, Pete Buttigieg and Elizabeth Warren all helped themselves distinctively tonight. I didn't think Julian Castro on balance, although he had some strong moments, will come out of this stronger or Andrew Yang or, frankly, Kamala Harris, who continues to disappoint, perhaps in comparison to her one strongest performance in the first round of the debate.\n\nDETROW: Agreed with almost everything Ron said, which is, you know, not new.\n\nKEITH: If this were a presidential debate, I'd be, like, but, Scott, tell me where you disagreed with Ron.\n\nDETROW: I have two main thoughts. Like Amy Klobuchar, I'm going to reject the premise of your question and say my own thoughts.\n\nKEITH: (Laughter).\n\nDETROW: First of all, I think that this was kind of a status quo debate. I don't think anything tonight really shook up the debate or really massively changed any of these candidates' fortunes. I think one really notable thing is that this evening showed that Joe Biden has really affected the conversation about health care. For months and months, Bernie Sanders really set the tone for health care. It was, do you agree with Bernie or disagree with Bernie? And most candidates said that, yeah, I agree with Bernie or at least big chunks of what Bernie's trying to do when it comes to Medicare for All and in some forms of the going away with private health insurance.\n\nOver the last couple months, Joe Biden has really framed that as blowing up Obamacare, undoing the Affordable Care Act - and saying, I'm the one who wants to build on Obamacare. Other people want to tear it down. So it was interesting to me that, tonight, Joe Biden made that point on stage saying, she's with Bernie, but I'm with Obama, speaking about Warren's support for Sanders' plan. But then seeing so many of the other candidates make pains to say, thanks, Barack Obama.\n\nI think Barack Obama took a big first step. I really appreciated what Barack Obama did - and then criticized aspects of Sanders' plan. So clearly, I think, many candidates are saying Joe Biden might have a point here that voters are latching on to. And I need to moderate my health care position just a little bit.\n\nKEITH: Yeah. And that was my other takeaway, which is not a big takeaway, but that, you know, in past debates, there was at times some distancing from former President Obama. In this debate, there was so much embracing of President Obama.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF MONTAGE)\n\nJOE BIDEN: The senator says she's for Bernie. Well, I'm for Barack.\n\nELIZABETH WARREN: We all owe a huge debt to President Obama, who fundamentally...\n\nKAMALA HARRIS: I want to give credit first to Barack Obama for...\n\nAMY KLOBUCHAR: ...I favor is something that - what Barack Obama wanted to do from the very beginning.\n\nJULIAN CASTRO: I'm fulfilling the legacy of Barack Obama, and you're not.\n\nHARRIS: ...Say, hey, Joe, instead of saying, no, we, can't, let's say, yes, we can (laughter).\n\nKEITH: And that, of course, is a famous line from President Obama's first election campaign. It was his whole theme. Ayesha, what stood out to you from this debate?\n\nRASCOE: What stood out to me was how aggressive Joe Biden was. And to me, this was one of the first debates where he really seemed to act as if he were the front-runner. In the other ones, especially in that first one, which, I think most people agreed, was not a strong performance for Joe Biden, he kind of leaned back a bit. But in this one, he was aggressive. There were moments - and really just trying to set the tone instead of just responding.\n\nYou know, he went after Bernie Sanders when it came to the health care debate, saying, oh you think that once employers don't have to provide health care or aren't providing health care that they're just going to give those savings back to the employers. You know, you say you're a socialist. You have a lot of faith in the private sector. I'm paraphrasing.\n\nAnd then also, just when he obviously had that moment in the first debate where he wouldn't go over the time limit, and he said, I'm done. He stopped himself. But in this one, he's like, I'm going for it. Everybody else is doing it.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nRASCOE: And he kept going. So that, to me, stood out. He definitely had more energy. We don't want to talk about low energy. He had more energy in this debate.\n\nDETROW: Definitely.\n\nELVING: And let's face it - this was three hours long. It took some energy just to watch it.\n\nRASCOE: Yes.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nELVING: Imagine being out there on the - in the ring and having everybody directing most of their negative energy mostly towards Biden and having all of the tension that goes with one of these events and being on your feet like that for three hours. That would test anyone, let alone someone who's about to be 77.\n\nKEITH: One of the areas where he was particularly aggressive on policy was health care. And earlier, we heard a little clip where he made a comparison. You know, you're for Bernie. I'm for Barack. Let's hear a bit more of that.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nBIDEN: I think we should have a debate on health care. I think - I know that the senator says she's for Bernie. Well, I'm for Barack. I think the Obamacare worked. I think the way - we add to it, replace everything that's been cut. Add a public option, guarantee that everyone will be able to have affordable insurance.\n\nKEITH: And the senator he is referring to is Senator Elizabeth Warren, who supports a version of Medicare for All or actually just Medicare for All. But when she was asked sort of specifically about, well, what will this mean for middle-class taxes? - she did, you know, a bit of a boxing move and jumped out of the way.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nWARREN: What families have to deal with is cost, total cost. That's what they have to deal with and understand. Families are paying for their health care today. Families pay every time an insurance company says, sorry, you can't see that specialist. Every time an insurance company says, sorry, that doctor is out of network. Sorry, we are not covering that prescription.\n\nELVING: The question, of course, here was, are you going to raise taxes? And, of course, the answer is inevitably yes. But she is saying, let's look at the total picture. Families are going to be better off. Their costs overall are going to be lower. And if they are paying a little more in tax, look at the people who are going to be paying a lot more in tax. And let's talk about the big corporations. And let's talk the very richest taxpayers. We're really going to go after them. As for the middle class, well, they'll have to chip in more in taxes, but they'll save so much more in their other costs. That's the pitch.\n\nRASCOE: But she didn't say that explicitly, though. And I was struck by how they were trying to get her on that point, and she just wouldn't say she wouldn't say that...\n\nELVING: She wouldn't say the word taxes.\n\nRASCOE: ...Explicitly that raising taxes.\n\nELVING: Would not say the word.\n\nRASCOE: No.\n\nELVING: Would not say taxes, no.\n\nKEITH: One of the moments that stands out from this debate was sort of health care adjacent in that they were talking about health care, but it really seemed like former HUD Secretary Julian Castro was looking for an angle to go after Biden.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nCASTRO: My plan would do that. Your plan would not.\n\nBIDEN: They do not have to buy in.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nBIDEN: They do not have to buy in.\n\nCASTRO: You just said that two minutes ago. You just said two minutes ago that they would have to buy in. You said they would have to buy in.\n\nBIDEN: Your grandmother would not have to buy in. If she qualifies for Medicaid...\n\nCASTRO: Are you forgetting what you said two minutes ago?\n\n(OOHING)\n\nCASTRO: Are you forgetting already what you said just two minutes ago?\n\nRASCOE: Yeah, that reaction kind of said it all when he said that - did you just forget what you just said? And everybody's like, oh.\n\nDETROW: I think it's notable that nobody else followed Castro's lead, and Castro dropped that after that first back-and-forth and did not return to that line of attack.\n\nELVING: And he may not - we don't know - but he may not have meant it to be quite so blunt a reference to his age.\n\nDETROW: I think so, Ron.\n\nKEITH: (Laughter).\n\nELVING: But the audience reaction made it very clear how everyone took it. So whether he meant it or not, that's the way it goes into the book.\n\nDETROW: I'll say this. I'll say Julian Castro has shown that he thinks through most of the things he does. He is pretty upfront about the political calculation that he puts into a lot of his actions.\n\nKEITH: I have a debate question, which is, in the first debate, Kamala Harris came in with her planned fight that she was going to have with Joe Biden. And Julian Castro clearly came into this debate out to have a fight with Joe Biden. I know that initially, the thought was that Kamala Harris really excelled in that fight with Biden. But in the end, I don't know. Does it actually work? You know, since then, I've talked to a lot of voters who were like, you know, I thought she was really mean to Joe.\n\nELVING: It did not work in the long run because while she got a big spike and a lot of people noticed her - and she sold that attack on him on bussing very well, and it was a real vulnerability, too, a long standing vulnerability of Joe Biden's. So she was really hitting a soft point. This thing tonight seemed a little bit more like a cheap shot, especially given the audience reaction. And so when Buttigieg jumped in to be critical of it and to, in a sense, implicitly defend Biden...\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nPETE BUTTIGIEG: This is why presidential debates are becoming unwatchable. This reminds everybody of what they cannot stand about Washington.\n\nELVING: ...That sort of cauterized the moment, and they went on. They just moved on. And there did not seem to be an opportunity for him to benefit as there was for Harris in that first debate.\n\nKEITH: All right. We are going to move on and take a break. And when we come back, Beto O'Rourke, Kamala Harris, foreign policy and a few things we couldn't let go.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)\n\nKEITH: And we're back. And I want to start with Kamala Harris. She is the senator from California, and it seemed like she came into tonight's debate with one mission in mind, and that was to entice President Trump to tweet at her.\n\nRASCOE: (Laughter).\n\nKEITH: And maybe I'm wrong about this.\n\nELVING: Tweet me.\n\nRASCOE: She may succeed...\n\nELVING: Tweet me.\n\nRASCOE: ...That little man behind the curtain.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nHARRIS: The bottom line is this - Donald Trump in office on trade policy - you know, he reminds me that that guy in The Wizard Of Oz. You know, when you pull back the curtain, it's a really small dude.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nKEITH: And that was not her only time going after President Trump in the debate. It seemed like every single time she spoke, she was, like, let me turn this around.\n\nDETROW: Well, she began the debate with - her opening statement was, she said, I'm going to directly address President Trump, who I know is watching. And actually, he was giving a speech to Republicans in Baltimore.\n\nKEITH: Like, an hour-long speech.\n\nRASCOE: (Laughter).\n\nDETROW: I think...\n\nRASCOE: He'll TiVo it.\n\nKEITH: He said he would.\n\nDETROW: He is...\n\nRASCOE: Yeah.\n\nDETROW: ...A big TiVo-er (ph) for sure.\n\nRASCOE: It seemed like the strategy for this one was, yes, to get Trump to maybe notice her (laughter) and strike out at her or - on Twitter, but also trying to make this distinction that, look - Trump is the person we need to go after. And that's always been the question during these campaigns - like, how much do you want to make it about Trump?\n\nAnd so what she seemed to be trying to say is, we want to beat Trump. None of this matters - and I think she did say none of this matters if we don't beat him. And so I'm the person to do that. That's what she was trying to do. Of course, people will debate whether it was successful.\n\nKEITH: Yeah. Yeah. I think she was almost trying to say, like, we can fight amongst ourselves, but really, we should just fight the other guy - maybe the one behind the curtain.\n\nELVING: Which can sometimes be a great unifying strategy. It just didn't seem to catch tonight.\n\nKEITH: I want to turn to Beto O'Rourke and, more broadly, the issue that he has really taken up since the mass shooting in El Paso and Dayton and later in West Texas. He has made that the centerpiece of his campaign - trying to get gun legislation and making other changes. And in particular, he has gone out farther than many other Democrats in the field, calling for not just a ban on new sales of assault-type-style weapons, AR-15s, but a mandatory buyback - basically, taking the guns away.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nBETO O'ROURKE: And in Odessa, I met the mother of a 15-year-old girl who was shot by an AR-15. And that mother watched her bleed to death over the course of an hour because so many other people were shot by that AR-15 in Odessa and Midland there weren't enough ambulances to get to them in time. Hell yes - we're going to take your AR-15, your AK-47.\n\n(CHEERING)\n\nDETROW: And that's the closest he came to cursing, we should say.\n\nKEITH: Yes. That was his mild cursing.\n\nRASCOE: This issue of the buybacks is - it's a tricky issue. And it may be why O'Rourke is so out on this, and other people may not be joining him - is because NPR had a poll - the NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll that came out earlier this week. And what they found was that support for actual buybacks is really mixed.\n\nSo overall, only 45% of people are supporting buybacks. And then - now, Democrats do support it more. You have 70% supporting it, Republicans 23%. But those independents who you're probably going to want to win - they - only 40% support these buybacks. So this is something where there isn't - outside of the Democratic base, there doesn't seem to be widespread support.\n\nELVING: Even among House Democrats - they don't have a clear consensus on anything beyond background checks. They're not really ready to go for an assault weapons ban, even among House Democrats looking for what they can get through the Judiciary Committee and through the House floor. They know they won't get anything through the Senate, of course, but just deciding what their unified position is in the House.\n\nSo it's very hard to imagine that this is going to be the cutting edge of the Democratic platform next year, But maybe it will. And certainly, incidents of the kind that have been suffered in El Paso, so many other cities - Midland, Odessa in Texas just in the last few weeks - have changed the conversation.\n\nKEITH: But when President Trump talks about, oh, those scary Democrats, they want to take your guns away, what he's talking about is Beto O'Rourke and people who would support a mandatory gun buyback.\n\nELVING: And that is going to be a popular view among not only Trump Republicans but also many independents.\n\nKEITH: Foreign policy is something that we said would come up in this debate And, lo and behold, it did come up in this debate. One of our predictions was correct (laughter).\n\nELVING: You know, every once in a while.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nELVING: Well, you know, we just saw the national security adviser fired, and we have just had this extraordinary, phenomenal spectacle of watching the president say, you know, I had a secret meeting coming up at Camp David to settle that whole Afghanistan war thing, and now I called it off because one of our soldiers got killed. Clearly they were going to have to get around to talking a little bit about foreign policy tonight. And they did talk about Afghanistan. They did talk, of course, about Iraq.\n\nIt was another occasion for Joe Biden to have to do a dance about how he voted for the Iraq war, and he called in an authorization for the use of military force, and didn't think it was really going to lead to a war. And we've heard it all before. But it was another moment for Biden to be vulnerable.\n\nDETROW: He was specifically talking tonight about something that he told the NPR POLITICS PODCAST. He had said he had voted for - to authorize the war in order to give President Bush leverage but that he had begun to oppose the war the moment that bombs started dropping, the moment that it began. Well, that just wasn't true. Biden didn't really fully oppose the war until about two years later, and he addressed that discrepancy tonight.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nBIDEN: I said something that was not meant the way I said it. I said from that point on. Well, what I always argued against in the beginning once he started to put the troops in was that, in fact, we were doing it the wrong way.\n\nKEITH: So that was Iraq. But Afghanistan was a larger focus of the conversation in the debate and is more present in a lot of people's minds because of what Ron talked about with the president potentially negotiating with the Taliban at Camp David and then scrapping it. Ayesha, they were asked, what would you do? What did they say?\n\nRASCOE: Well, many of the candidates were basically saying that it's time for the U.S. to get out of Afghanistan - that the war has gone on too long. In particular, Warren said that she would pull out the troops even without a deal.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nWARREN: We need to bring our troops home, and then we need to make a big shift. We cannot ask our military to keep solving problems that cannot be solved militarily.\n\nELVING: And several of the candidates said that as long as we could have the suppression of any terrorist threat to the United States originating in Afghanistan - here we are just a few days after the 18th anniversary of 9/11, which was planned and largely put together in Afghanistan - as long as we could be assured that that couldn't happen again, and we had the suppression of that kind of terrorist activity, we didn't really need to tell Afghanistan what kind of government it was going to have anymore, and we could leave that part of the world.\n\nThat seemed to be the basic thrust. Pete Buttigieg, who has actually served in Afghanistan, wanted to make that point and also wanted to say that we shouldn't be looking at any of our troops and telling them that we're not going to stand with them and that we are not going to be committed to the things we send them into the field to die for.\n\nKEITH: So, as with every debate, there were a lot of things covered. There were also a lot of things that weren't covered. And there are a few stray moments that I feel like we should probably talk about. One of those was Vice President Biden, in a very long answer about schools and segregation - he started talking about turntables.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nBIDEN: Play the radio. Make sure the television's - the - excuse me. Make sure you have the record player on at night, the phone. Make sure the kids hear words. A kid coming from a very poor school - a very poor background will hear 4 million words fewer spoken by the time they get there.\n\nKEITH: So many words - there were so many words.\n\nDETROW: It is a very real point about making sure your kids hear a lot of words, though.\n\nELVING: That is a good point.\n\nKEITH: It's...\n\nRASCOE: It is true.\n\nKEITH: ...Very important.\n\nRASCOE: Although the study that kind of came from - there are, like, questions about that because it said that, like, poor people or people on welfare - their kids hear, like, millions less words, and there's a question about whether that's actually the case. But yes, you should talk to your kids. It's important.\n\nKEITH: Yeah. And I narrate everything for my poor children. They - like, their whole lives are, like, one NPR POLITICS PODCAST. And now we're eating bananas - oh, bananas.\n\nRASCOE: (Laughter).\n\nELVING: Understood. Understood. My daughter would...\n\nRASCOE: But the thing...\n\nELVING: ...Make the same complaint.\n\nRASCOE: ...With the record player, right?\n\nKEITH: Yeah.\n\nRASCOE: Like, that was...\n\nELVING: Yeah.\n\nRASCOE: ...The issue with what he said.\n\nELVING: The record player is what's going to stick.\n\nRASCOE: Play the record player for your kids.\n\nKEITH: Yeah.\n\nDETROW: I texted our colleague Kelsey Snell making fun of this. And as soon as I hit send, I regretted it. And I thought, oh, Kelsey's actually someone who probably would have a record player. And five minutes later, she was, like, hey, I have a record player.\n\nKEITH: Yeah, because...\n\nDETROW: So there you go.\n\nKEITH: ...Record players are cool again. They're back.\n\nELVING: Vinyl is cool.\n\nKEITH: Scott, what can you not let go of?\n\nDETROW: You know, I'll admit - and I know our bosses are listening, so I will say that this does not take up too much mental energy on debate nights - but on debate nights, I've got a side passion project.\n\nKEITH: (Laughter).\n\nDETROW: And that is #debatedogs. This actually started in 2016 during the general election debate. Sam Sanders and I - just at one point, when they were really grim and really toxic, we were just, like, hey, everybody. Just tweet a picture - if your dog is watching the debate, tweet us a picture of your dog watching the debate. And people did that.\n\nAnd then when the first debate started up again this year, a couple listeners remembered it, and they said, hey, are you still doing debate dogs? And I was, like, you're right. We are still doing debate dogs. So every debate night, I encourage people to tweet pictures of their dog watching the debate on TV with the hashtag #debatedogs. I retweet as many as I can when I am, of course, not working very hard focusing on my day job. But...\n\nKEITH: Or your late-night job.\n\nDETROW: Or my late-night job.\n\nRASCOE: Yes.\n\nDETROW: But a lot of great pictures came in. If you have a dog, and you watch the debate with them, please join #debatedogs next time around. And I will just say I lost my pooch earlier this year.\n\nKEITH: Aw.\n\nDETROW: And that makes these pictures that come in on my Twitter feed - because I certainly have an entire column dedicated to this - makes me really happy to see all the dogs, especially beagles, watching the debates. And it was very telling that about halfway through this three-hour debate, most of the dogs in the pictures were fast asleep.\n\nRASCOE: (Laughter).\n\nKEITH: Aw.\n\nELVING: Aw.\n\nKEITH: That is a wrap for today. We will be back as soon as there is political news that you need to know about. Until then, join us on Facebook and our brand-new Facebook group. It's a place for you to connect with us and other podcast listeners. Just head to n.pr/politicsgroup and request to join. Scott, you had better post some dog pictures in there.\n\nDETROW: Yes, I will.\n\nKEITH: OK, good.\n\nI'm Tamara Keith. I cover the White House.\n\nDETROW: I'm Scott Detrow. I cover the campaign.\n\nRASCOE: I'm Ayesha Rascoe. I also cover the White House.\n\nELVING: And I'm Ron Elving, editor correspondent.\n\nKEITH: And thank you for listening to the NPR POLITICS PODCAST.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, FLAWLESS)\n\nBEYONCE: (Singing) Ladies, tell them, I woke up like this.

Georgia Governor Sparks Fight With Trump Allies Over Senate Appointment\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Rich von Biberstein/Icon Sportswire via Getty Images Rich von Biberstein/Icon Sportswire via Getty Images\n\nGeorgia Gov. Brian Kemp plans to appoint Kelly Loeffler on Wednesday as the state's next U.S. senator, effective Jan. 1, according to two sources with knowledge of Kemp's decision. The businesswoman and Republican donor will fill the seat held by Sen. Johnny Isakson, who plans to retire Dec. 31 for health reasons.\n\nThe pick comes despite strong opposition from prominent allies of President Trump, who is reported to have favored Rep. Doug Collins, R-Ga., for the seat. Loeffler's conservative bona fides have been questioned, with conservative talk show host Mark Levin referring to her as a RINO (Republican in name only) on Sunday.\n\nLoeffler is a wealthy businesswoman without political experience. The CEO of Bakkt, a Bitcoin-focused subsidiary of Intercontinental Exchange Inc., casts herself as a lifelong Republican and tells a personal narrative of working her way up the corporate ladder from her family's farm in rural Illinois.\n\nOne of Kemp's most vocal critics over the weekend was Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz, a close Trump ally, who said Kemp was ignoring Trump because you THINK you know better than @POTUS. Another Trump confidant, Fox News personality Sean Hannity, also endorsed Collins last week.\n\nKemp's director of communications, Candice Broce, fired back at Gaetz directly, calling him oddly submissive to #TheSwamp, and said the appointment was Kemp's to make independently. Kemp's adviser and former campaign communications director, Ryan Mahoney, wrote: mind your own business. We don't know you and we don't care what you think.\n\nLoeffler herself has faced backlash in the past week from some members of Georgia's conservative political community for past donations to Mitt Romney and ties to former Democratic gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams, who did legal work for the WNBA team that Loeffler co-owns, the Atlanta Dream.\n\nPhil Kent, a conservative pundit and communications consultant who has worked with Loeffler, vouched for Loeffler's conservative politics, describing her as a big opponent of Obamacare, a supporter of gun rights and someone who's very tough on illegal immigration.\n\nSo she would check some of those boxes with the president, said Kent.\n\nKemp has generally been seen as a close ally of the president. First elected governor in 2018, Kemp helped secure the Republican nomination with Trump's backing.\n\nAmid the criticism, Kemp offered his own preemptive defense, writing on Twitter, The idea that I would appoint someone to the U.S. Senate that is NOT pro-life, pro-2nd Amendment, pro-freedom, and 100% supportive of our President (and his plan to Keep America Great) is ridiculous. He added, Frankly, I could care less what the political establishment thinks.\n\nLoeffler takes the job following an online application process that Kemp opened in September. She submitted her résumé on the day of the deadline.\n\nLoeffler's company, Bakkt, offers a regulated market for bitcoin trading, and its parent company, ICE, owns and operates commodity and financial market exchanges, including the New York Stock Exchange. Loeffler previously worked as ICE's chief communications and marketing officer and is married to its founder and CEO, Jeff Sprecher.\n\nShe grew up on her family's corn and soybean farm in Illinois and wrote in her cover letter to Kemp that From working on the family farm to creating jobs and opportunity in the business world, I have been blessed to live the American Dream. I am offering myself to serve hardworking Georgians as a political outsider in the United States Senate to protect that dream for everyone.\n\nIf our country is to embrace the conservative values that made America great, women must play a key role in that dialogue, she said in 2013 to the Georgia Federation of Republican Women. This is where our voices are needed.\n\nHer name was floated as a possible Senate candidate at that time, an option she ultimately rejected to remain with ICE amid its acquisition of the New York Stock Exchange. In 2013, she told Atlanta magazine about her political experience, explaining that it amounted to running against my best friend for student council president in eighth grade. It was all about the campaign posters and how many of the kids you could talk to at lunch break.\n\nIn her cover letter, she cast that as an advantage, writing about the importance, now more than ever before — to have leaders with significant life and business experience outside of politics representing Georgia families in Washington, D.C.\n\nIf appointed, Loeffler will face reelection in November in an open race, without party primaries.\n\nCollins was noncommittal when asked Sunday on Fox News if he would run against Loeffler in the November election, saying, That'll be a decision that we'll have to make at that point. Collins is the top Republican on the House Judiciary Committee and is also playing a prominent role as one of Trump's defenders in Congress.\n\n2020 is set to be a big political year for Georgia. Buoyed by rapidly changing demographics, Democrats believe they have a chance to win the state for the first time since 1992. In addition, both of Georgia's Senate seats are on the ballot in November. Sen. David Perdue, also a Republican, is defending his seat. At least four major Democratic candidates are vying in the primary to challenge him.
Yes, All This Happened. Trump's First 2 Weeks As President\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Getty Images Getty Images\n\nPresident Trump's first two weeks in office have been a sprint, not the start of a marathon. If the rapid pace and, sometimes, hourly developments of executive orders, news, controversies and more have left you exhausted, you're not alone. If you're finding it hard to remember just everything that's transpired too, we're here for that as well.\n\nHere's a quick recap of the highlights — and lowlights — of the first 14 days of Trump's nascent presidency.\n\nSaturday, Jan. 21\n\nOn his first full day as president, Trump went to the CIA to try to mend fences with the intelligence agency he repeatedly maligned during the campaign and the transition. (He blamed the media for creating the feud, but his own tweets disprove that.) While standing before a memorial at the agency, he argued over the crowd size at his inauguration, making false assertions that run counter to aerial photos of the event and NPR's own reporters on the ground. He also claimed it stopped raining during his inaugural address, when it did not.\n\nHours later, new press secretary Sean Spicer made his first appearance in the White House briefing room to double down on those falsehoods about crowd size. He cited wrong numbers for Metro usage in D.C. and also falsely said that floor coverings used for the first time on the National Mall made photos show where there were gaps, when in fact such coverings had been used before. After delivering his fiery broadside, Spicer left without taking any questions.\n\nWhile all that was happening, the Women's March on Washington protesting Trump and his policies toward women drew thousands and thousands of people — and the second-highest Metro ridership day ever, second only to President Obama's first inauguration. Protests weren't just limited to D.C., though — similar events happened across the country that also drew massive crowds. And the protests even went worldwide, happening on all seven continents.\n\nSunday, Jan. 22\n\nThe White House should have been in cleanup mode after Saturday's first rocky day in office, but instead on the Sunday shows spokespersons doubled down on false claims about crowd size and more. Trump counselor Kellyanne Conway argued on NBC's Meet the Press that Spicer had simply provided alternative facts when making his arguments — a moniker that looks primed to persist throughout the Trump administration.\n\nMonday, Jan. 23\n\nThe biggest news happened when Trump met that evening with both Republican and Democratic congressional leaders, reviving his unfounded claims that there were between 3 million and 5 million illegal votes cast in the 2016 election that caused him to lose the popular vote to Democrat Hillary Clinton. This would continue to be an issue for the rest of the week (more on this below).\n\nTrump also signed an executive order reinstating the Mexico City policy, a global gag rule prohibiting international nongovernmental organizations that provide or talk about abortion services from receiving federal funding. He also signaled his intent to withdraw from the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement and instituted a federal hiring freeze except for the military.\n\nSpicer had his second outing with the press, still in a largely defensive crouch. He blamed the press for trying to undercut the tremendous support for Trump and doubled down on his insistence that Trump's was the most-watched inauguration ever, though given difficulty in counting streaming numbers, that's hard to back up.\n\nEthics experts filed a lawsuit in court alleging that the president was in violation of the Emoluments Clause of the Constitution because of his overseas businesses\n\nTuesday, Jan. 24\n\nSpicer repeated Trump's unfounded assertions that there was widespread voter fraud during the U.S. elections but provided no further proof of why the president believed that.\n\nTrump approved construction of the Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines, which had both been stopped during the Obama administration amid outcry from environmental groups. Other executive orders directed the Commerce Department to review how federal regulations might be impeding U.S. manufacturers.\n\nWednesday, Jan. 25\n\nTrump signed two executive orders keeping one of his top campaign promises, ordering the U.S. government to begin construction of a wall along the Southern border with Mexico. He asserted that while the U.S. government would have to front the money, Mexico would pay it back. (Mexican leaders have said they will not.) Trump also directed the Homeland Security and Justice departments to withhold federal funds from sanctuary cities.\n\nIn his first interview as president, Trump doubled down (tripled down?) on his unproven belief that there were millions of illegal voters. You have people that are registered who are dead, who are illegals, who are in two states. You have people registered in two states. They're registered in a New York and a New Jersey. They vote twice. There are millions of votes, in my opinion, he told ABC's David Muir.\n\nStudies Trump cited offer no proof of such voter fraud. And he also incorrectly claimed it was illegal to be registered in two states; it's not illegal unless someone votes in two states, because often voter rolls are not quickly updated. In fact, it turned out some Trump aides and family members were registered in multiple states.\n\nThursday, Jan. 26\n\nTrump traveled to Philadelphia to address the GOP congressional retreat, where he delivered a relatively on-message speech promising Obamacare repeal and to crack down on violent crime, and touting his executive actions on immigration and trade.\n\nMexican President Enrique Peña Nieto canceled a planned trip to the U.S. amid Trump's continued assertion that his country would repay the U.S. for the border wall. One possibility to recoup the investment from Mexico that the White House floated was a 20 percent import tax, which, as NPR's Scott Horsley reported, would effectively saddle U.S. consumers with a significant portion of the wall's cost, estimated at $15 billion or more.\n\nTrump gave his second interview, to a friendly source, Fox News' Sean Hannity. He again boasted of his crowd sizes during his inauguration and talked about the (still unproven) allegations that there were millions of illegal votes cast in November.\n\nHe also told Hannity he continues to believe waterboarding works and talked about bringing it back, though it is outlawed in the U.S. as torture. His new defense secretary, retired Gen. James Mattis, has said he does not believe waterboarding is effective and has reiterated it is illegal, as have top GOP congressional leaders such as Speaker Paul Ryan.\n\nFriday, Jan. 27\n\nTrump signed an executive order blocking travelers from seven countries, all of which are Muslim-majority — Iraq, Iran, Syria, Yemen, Sudan, Libya and Somalia — from entering the U.S. for 90 days. New refugee admissions are suspended for 120 days, while Syrian refugees are banned indefinitely. There was confusion at airports whether or not the ban includes those with valid U.S. visas, green cards or people from those countries who are permanent residents. Protests began at airports as travelers were detained.\n\nTrump hosted his first foreign leader at the White House — British Prime Minister Theresa May. She pushed for a future trade deal with the U.S. The two held a joint news conference, where May said Trump had reaffirmed his support for NATO — though he has questioned whether the U.S. should be in the alliance in the past.\n\nThe annual anti-abortion event called by its proponents the March for Life drew thousands more demonstrators to the National Mall. Vice President Pence and Conway both spoke.\n\nSaturday, Jan. 28\n\nProtests continued at airports across the country amid confusion over Trump's travel ban. Immigration attorneys began offering their services pro bono. Late on Saturday, a federal judge issued a stay on the deportations of valid visa holders after they have landed in the U.S. in response to an ACLU lawsuit.\n\nTrump reshuffled the National Security Council, elevating controversial chief strategist Steve Bannon to be a permanent member of the Principals Committee, giving him equal billing with other Cabinet-level officials. The director of national intelligence and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who are typically permanent members, will now only attend when pertinent issues are being discussed.\n\nTrump called several foreign leaders, including Russian President Vladimir Putin. He also had a tense call with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, though details would not be reported until later in the week. The president told Turnbull it was the worst call by far that he (Trump) had had that day, and the two clashed on the Obama administration's deal to accept refugees from the country.\n\nTrump signed several executive orders — an ethics order banning administration appointees from ever lobbying foreign governments and from federal lobbying for five years after they leave office. He also directed the administration to develop a comprehensive plan to defeat ISIS.\n\nSunday, Jan. 29\n\nA U.S. Navy SEAL was killed during a raid in Yemen targeting al-Qaida militants, the first military casualty of Trump's administration. Later in the week, questions were raised over how the operation — which also is believed to have killed several civilians — was carried out.\n\nProtests continued at airports over the Trump administration's travel ban.\n\nMonday, Jan. 30\n\nActing Attorney General Sally Yates (a holdover from the Obama administration) announced she would direct Justice Department lawyers not to defend Trump's travel ban. Hours later, the president fired her, naming Dana Boente, the top federal prosecutor in suburban Virginia, as the interim attorney general until nominee Jeff Sessions is confirmed by the Senate.\n\nMore Republicans continued to speak out against Trump's travel ban, voicing concern over its implementation. Former President Barack Obama broke his silence since leaving office, saying through a spokesman that American values are at stake.\n\nTrump signed an executive order that says for every regulation the executive branch proposes, two others must be repealed.\n\nTuesday, Jan. 31\n\nTrump nominated federal appeals court Judge Neil Gorsuch to fill the Supreme Court seat of the late Justice Antonin Scalia. The evening ceremony in the White House's East Room was arranged for suspense, which gave it the aura of a reality TV show in some ways. Conservatives praised his pick, which was a major campaign issue after Senate Republicans refused to take up former President Obama's nominee, Judge Merrick Garland, for much of 2016.\n\nWednesday, Feb. 1\n\nNational Security Adviser Michael Flynn made a surprise appearance at the daily press briefing to announce that the Trump administration was putting Iran on notice after the country conducted a ballistic missile test.\n\nTrump and daughter Ivanka traveled to Dover Air Force Base for the return to the U.S. of the remains of Navy SEAL William Ryan Owens, who was killed over the weekend in the Yemen raid.\n\nThe AP reported that during a call with Mexican President Nieto last week, Trump threatened to send in the U.S. military to stop the bad hombres down there. Mexico denied the remarks.\n\nThursday, Feb. 2\n\nCelebrity Apprentice creator Mark Burnett introduced Trump at the annual National Prayer Breakfast. During his remarks, Trump called out the low ratings of the NBC reality show he once hosted and criticized the new host, action star and former California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger. And I want to just pray for Arnold, if we can, for those ratings, OK, the president said.\n\nTrump also pledged at the breakfast to repeal the Johnson Amendment, which prohibits tax-exempt groups, including religious ones, from wading into politics.\n\nFriday, Feb. 3\n\nA federal judge in Seattle temporarily halted Trump's executive order on immigration and travel from some Muslim-majority countries. The order is effective nationwide.\n\nNew sanctions were announced against Iran, following up on the administration's earlier threat against the country.\n\nTrump signed two executive orders directing the review of the Dodd-Frank financial regulations and halting implementation of another federal rule that mandates financial advisers to act in the best interests of their clients.\n\nSaturday, Feb. 4\n\nAirlines resumed allowing travelers once affected by Trump's travel ban to come to the U.S.\n\nTrump, who was at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Fla., for the weekend, tweeted, The opinion of this so-called judge, which essentially takes law-enforcement away from our country, is ridiculous and will be overturned! Because of the terrible decision, he later added on Twitter, many very bad and dangerous people may be pouring into our country.
In A Conservative Corner Of California, A Push To Preserve Obamacare\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption April Dembosky/KQED April Dembosky/KQED\n\nModoc County, in the northeast corner of California, is roughly the size of Connecticut. It's so sparsely populated that the entire county has just one stoplight. The nearest Walmart is more than an hour's drive, across the Oregon border. Same with hospitals that deliver babies.\n\nGreta Elliott runs a tiny health clinic in Canby, on the edge of the national forest. Rural doesn't begin to describe the area, she says. This is the frontier.\n\nThere are more cows in Modoc than there are people, Elliott says.\n\nThere's a frontier mentality, too. People take care of each other, and they take care of themselves. They don't like being told what to do. Being forced to buy insurance made Obamacare a dirty word.\n\nEven Elliott, administrator of the Canby Family Practice Clinic, decided against buying coverage for herself.\n\nIt's too expensive, she says. I choose to put my money back into paying the bills of the whole family.\n\nOverall, the Affordable Care Act helped 25,000 people in the upper reaches of Northern California buy plans through the state marketplace, Covered California. But the law helped three times as many people, 75,000, enroll in Medi-Cal, the state's Medicaid program that provides free health coverage for low-income residents.\n\nThe data shows it's the rural communities that have greatly benefited from the Medicaid expansion. That's the irony, says Dean Germano, CEO of the Shasta Community Health Center. These are places that voted much more heavily for Donald Trump.\n\nIn Modoc and Lassen counties, 70 percent of people voted for Trump in the November election. In neighboring Shasta County, Trump won 64 percent of the vote.\n\nBut now a coalition of clinics from across the northeast corner of the state is lobbying local officials to take an unpopular position in this conservative land: defend the Affordable Care Act.\n\nAnd the right-leaning Shasta County Board of Supervisors took them up on it.\n\nWe thought 'Whoa! That is really bold,'  Germano says. I was surprised.\n\nThe board sent a letter to the local Republican representative, Doug LaMalfa, asking him to vote against the initial GOP repeal and replace bill, because it would hurt local people.\n\nWe have an obligation to say something, says Supervisor David Kehoe. And if it may be mildly offensive from a political standpoint for some, well, we're not going to be intimidated by politics.\n\nBut LaMalfa still voted in favor of dismantling Obamacare.\n\nLaMalfa didn't return calls and emails for this story. But in May, he told KQED that skyrocketing premiums were the main driver behind his vote.\n\nUnfortunately, the reality is that too many young and healthy individuals are deciding they'd rather pay the penalty than sign up for care, citing financial barriers and lack of choice, he said in a statement. A 28-year-old making $45,000 a year with no major health concerns is not going to pay upwards of $400 a month for a plan that does not even work for them.\n\nWhen clinic representatives met with LaMalfa's staffers, they were told the congressman's office was flooded with calls like that.\n\nBut people with Medi-Cal didn't call to say how much they appreciate that program. In fact, at first clinics struggled getting people to sign up for Medi-Cal.\n\nThey feel like it's a handout and they're too proud, they don't want to, says Carol Morris, an enrollment counselor for the Mountain Valleys Health Centers in Shasta County.\n\nOne way clinic workers get around the stigma is to avoid calling it Medi-Cal. Instead, they promote the name of the insurer that manages the Medi-Cal contract in that region. People get a card for Partnership Health Plan and may not realize they're actually covered by a government program.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption April Dembosky/KQED April Dembosky/KQED\n\nIt feels like it's more of an insurance, Morris says. It's like a laminated, wallet-sized card that's got your numbers on it. It just looks exactly like an insurance card.\n\nOne patient at the Mountain Valleys clinic in Bieber, Kay Roope, 64, knew she had Medi-Cal, and she liked it.\n\nIt did me good, she says.\n\nNow she has a subsidized commercial plan through Covered California with modest premiums and copays, and she likes that, too.\n\nIt's OK, 'cause I'm at the doctor's at least once a month, she says.\n\nBut when asked what she thinks of Obamacare overall, she says she doesn't like it.\n\nBecause of Obama himself, she says with a laugh. I rest my case.\n\nThe confusion and the contradictions are common among patients, explains Morris, the enrollment counselor.\n\nPeople just don't understand the different names, she says. But of course, it's the same thing.\n\nMorris has seen the difference the Affordable Care Act has made for people in the region. She has seen patients get treatment for diabetes and breast cancer, or get knee surgery that they otherwise wouldn't have gotten.\n\nThose patients won't fight for Obamacare, Morris says, so that's why the clinics have to.\n\nThis story is part of a reporting partnership with NPR, KQED and Kaiser Health News.
Sunday Deadline Looms For Affordable Care Act Open Enrollment\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Brakkton Booker/NPR Brakkton Booker/NPR\n\nFor millions of Americans, time is running out to sign up for health insurance through the Affordable Care Act's online marketplace healthcare.gov.\n\nFor those who will not receive health coverage beginning Jan. 1, 2020 through an employer or other programs like Medicaid, Medicare or the Children's Health Insurance Program — commonly referred to as CHIP — the deadline to purchase health insurance is Sunday, Dec. 15.\n\nHealth and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar tweeted a reminder: If you decide that purchasing coverage through healthcare.gov is the right decision for you, make sure you select coverage by this Sunday.\n\nSign-ups for 2020 coverage in the first six weeks of open enrollment for the ACA, also referred to as Obamacare, are down slightly, trailing last year's totals by 6%. However, this decline is happening at a slower rate when compared to 2019 coverage sign-ups in the first six weeks. That decline dipped 12%, according to Modern Healthcare.\n\nThe publication also notes that the latest numbers don't include the millions of people who will be automatically enrolled in coverage at the conclusion of open enrollment.\n\nNPR's Health Policy reporter Selena Simmons-Duffin told NPR's Up First podcast on Saturday that enrollment has been down every year since 2016.\n\nLast year more than 11 million people enrolled and we're on track to be slightly behind that this year, Simmons-Duffin said.\n\nMany experts blame the drop in sign-ups on the Trump administration making sharp reductions in outreach efforts to connect would-be insurance purchasers to available plans.\n\nOne of the actions that President Trump's administration took to change the [Affordable Care Act] law is to radically cut back the funding to do outreach and to do advertising to let people know that this exists, Simmons-Duffin said.\n\nKaiser Health News points out there is typically a flurry in the last few days before the Dec. 15 deadline when last-minute participants decide to sign-up.\n\nSome states have seen double-digit declines. In Arizona, for example, enrollments are down 17% from this time a year ago, according to the Arizona Republic. The paper cites apprehension among some Latino families over enrolling in anything government-related as one possible cause for the drop off.\n\nMeanwhile, Delaware Public Media reports a 1.7% decline from last year. It adds: Lagging enrollment comes despite premiums in Delaware dropping for the first time since the ACA became law seven years ago.\n\nHealth officials in California announced Thursday more than 130,000 people signed up for new coverage plans this year — an increase of 16% compared to the open enrollment period last year.\n\nFor those who miss the open enrollment sign-up period, not all is lost. The health care law does allow, in specific cases, a special enrollment period where people can sign-up after the open enrollment period ends.\n\nThe government lists circumstances including losing health insurance, getting married, moving, having a baby or adopting a child as life events that would make applicants eligible.
Experts Say It Could Be A Make Or Break Year For Obamacare\n\nPresident Obama traveled to Florida Thursday to encourage more people to sign up for Obamacare when the enrollment window opens next month. The president's signature health care law has helped cut the uninsured rate to record lows. But it's showing some cracks, and many young people are reluctant to sign up.\n\nROBERT SIEGEL, HOST:\n\nThe annual sign-up period for Obamacare begins in less than two weeks. Experts say this could be a make-or-break year for the program. The Obama administration is hoping to enroll nearly 14 million people over the next few months, and the president himself made a pitch for sign-ups when he was in Miami today. NPR's Scott Horsley reports.\n\nSCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: President Obama told students at Miami Dade College, in some ways, his signature health care law has done just what it's supposed to - provided health care coverage for some 20 million people who didn't have it before.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nPRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: Never in American history has the uninsured rate been lower than it is today - never.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nHORSLEY: But Obama acknowledged the law, muscled through Congress without a single Republican vote, has its flaws. He argues that's a reason to improve Obamacare, not repeal it.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nOBAMA: Think about it. When one of these companies comes out with a new smartphone, then it has a few bugs, what do they do? They fix it. They upgrade it unless it catches fire. Then they just...\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nOBAMA: Then they pull it off the market.\n\nHORSLEY: Obama insists the problems with the Affordable Care Act are not so explosive as to justify going back to the health care equivalent of rotary dial phones. Those problems mostly affect the roughly 1 in 14 people who buy health insurance on the individual market, including the government-run exchanges set up by Obamacare.\n\nHealth care expert Cynthia Cox of the Kaiser Family Foundation says so far those exchanges have not attracted as many customers as expected, so some insurance companies are quitting the business.\n\nCYNTHIA COX: They're not seeing enough young and healthy enrollment. And what that's meant is that their costs have been higher than they expected, and they're losing money in the exchanges, which is part of why you're seeing many of these companies exit right now.\n\nHORSLEY: About 20 percent of people shopping for coverage on the exchanges this year will have just one insurance company to choose from. And with less competition, insurance premiums are rising sharply - about 25 percent on average. The administration hopes to counteract that by bringing more low-cost customers into the market. That was a big part of the president's message at the community college this afternoon.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nOBAMA: The more young and healthy people like you who do the smart thing and sign up, then the better it's going to work for everybody.\n\nHORSLEY: But it will take more than the president's promotional efforts to cure what's ailing Obamacare. Some observers suggest both carrots and sticks are needed, including more generous subsidies to defray the cost of insurance and stiffer penalties for those who don't sign up.\n\nHealth policy professor Sara Rosenbaum of George Washington University says similar adjustments were made to fix Medicare's prescription drug benefit introduced during the George W. Bush administration.\n\nSARA ROSENBAUM: We know how to do these repairs - affordable subsidies, penalties for not enrolling. These are all very familiar terrain to health insurance policymaking.\n\nHORSLEY: Obama even renewed the idea of a public insurance option which lawmakers rejected seven years ago. Many of these fixes would require at least some support from congressional Republicans. Obama says he hopes that might come easier once he's no longer in office.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nOBAMA: They can even change the name of the law to Reagancare (ph).\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nOBAMA: Or they can call it PaulRyancare (ph).\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nOBAMA: I don't care...\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nOBAMA: ...About credit. I just want...\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nOBAMA: ...It to work.\n\nHORSLEY: Of course Republican presidential hopeful Donald Trump has promised to repeal Obamacare altogether. So while he was in the swing state of Florida today, Obama also did some campaigning for Hillary Clinton. Scott Horsley, NPR News.\n\nCopyright © 2016 NPR. All rights reserved.

How A Lawsuit Challenging Obamacare Could Affect People With Pre-Existing Conditions\n\nNPR's Ailsa Chang talks with Sabrina Corlette from Georgetown University's Center on Health Insurance Reforms about how a lawsuit against Obamacare could impact people with pre-existing conditions.\n\nAILSA CHANG, HOST:\n\nOne of the central goals of the Affordable Care Act is to protect people with pre-existing conditions. That means insurers have to cover sick people. The Trump administration announced earlier this week that it supports a federal lawsuit challenging the existence of the ACA. Wiping out the health care law could mean that people with pre-existing conditions won't be able to get coverage or will have to pay more for insurance.\n\nTo talk about all this, we're joined now by Sabrina Corlette. She's a professor at the Center on Health Insurance Reforms at Georgetown University. Welcome.\n\nSABRINA CORLETTE: Thank you.\n\nCHANG: So we throw around this phrase a lot - pre-existing conditions - when we're talking about health care. Can you just first lay out exactly what is a pre-existing condition?\n\nCORLETTE: Well, that can be very much in the eye of the insurance company. In fact, before the Affordable Care Act, many companies maintained lists of up to 400 different conditions that might cause somebody to be denied a policy or to be charged more. And that could range from serious conditions like HIV, AIDS, hemophilia, cancer or could be fairly minor - asthma, glaucoma...\n\nCHANG: Glaucoma.\n\nCORLETTE: (Laughter) Exactly. All of those things could trigger what was called underwriting, where they would screen somebody out or carve out the treatment that you might need to treat that condition and not pay for it.\n\nCHANG: And where did this idea of the pre-existing condition come from in the first place?\n\nCORLETTE: Well, most insurance companies, their business model is based on avoiding risk. They worry that people will wait until they're sick to sign up for coverage. So to protect themselves from that, they came up with a variety of tools that allow them to screen out people who might cost them money. And that includes denying policies.\n\nIt includes charging a higher premium than they would a healthy person. It could mean that they don't cover certain parts of the benefit package. For example, if you had a history of asthma, they might say, well, we'll cover you but nothing having to do with an upper respiratory condition.\n\nCHANG: Right. But it sounds like what you're saying is, this concept of the pre-existing condition, it's an invention by the insurance industry. This is not some medical term from the medical profession. This is an insurance-invented word or idea.\n\nCORLETTE: That's absolutely right.\n\nCHANG: So in a way, though, insurers have a point. It is more expensive to cover someone who has an illness.\n\nCORLETTE: Yes, that's right. And they do worry that, without certain protections in place, people will not buy coverage when they're healthy and then, you know, when they're in the ambulance on the way to the hospital, they'll call up the insurance company and say, please sign me up for a policy. And if that happens, then the system just doesn't work because premiums will be too expensive and unaffordable for everybody else.\n\nCHANG: OK. But even if the Trump administration is successful in ending the Affordable Care Act in the courts, is it politically possible at this point to completely take away protection for pre-existing conditions because it's popular among voters in both parties?\n\nCORLETTE: Right. So if the court rules in favor of the Trump administration, these protections will be gone at the federal level. And so Congress would have to step in and restore them. Unfortunately, we have a pretty divided House and Senate, and it's hard to imagine them coming to agreement. That said, interestingly, the number of states have stepped up to try to enact these protections at the state level.\n\nBut there are limits. For example, states are not allowed to pass laws that affect people with employer-based insurance. That's really a federal responsibility. So states can protect people in the individual market - folks who are buying on their own. But for most of us in employer-based plans, that really would need a federal law change.\n\nCHANG: Sabrina Corlette is a lawyer and professor at Georgetown's Center on Health Insurance Reforms. Thanks so much for coming into the studio today.\n\nCORLETTE: Thank you.\n\nCopyright © 2019 NPR. All rights reserved.

Koch Brothers Vow To Stand By Republicans Who Oppose Health Care Bill\n\nNPR's Audie Cornish talks to Akash Chougule, policy director of Americans for Prosperity about the group's opposition to the AHCA bill, and their plans to support members of Congress who vote against the bill during the 2018 midterm elections.\n\nAUDIE CORNISH, HOST:\n\nCharles and David Koch are known for spending tens of millions of dollars when trying to achieve their policy goals. The free market conservatives have opposed the Affordable Care Act since its passage. But now two of their grassroots groups, Americans for Prosperity and Freedom Partners, not only oppose the bill; they say they'll spend millions to protect Republicans who stand with them in opposition.\n\nAkash Chougule is the policy director for Americans for Prosperity. He joins me now in the studio. Welcome to ALL THINGS CONSIDERED.\n\nAKASH CHOUGULE: Thanks for having me on this evening.\n\nCORNISH: With the power of President Trump to single out lawmakers who go against his priorities - you have pressure from House Republican lawmakers - did you feel like you guys had to back up lawmakers who wanted to vote against this bill?\n\nCHOUGULE: This is nothing new for Americans for Prosperity. This, you know, announcement that we plan to defend lawmakers and applaud them for doing the right thing made a lot of headlines because President Trump and Speaker Ryan happened to be on the other side of this issue. But this is what Americans for Prosperity exists to do. It's...\n\nCORNISH: But is this not a key moment?\n\nCHOUGULE: It's a very key moment, and that's why - you know, that's why I think it's drawn these kind of headlines. But this is what we exist to do - is to hold accountable members for the promises they made on the campaign trail.\n\nRepublicans for seven years have run for office on the promise to repeal Obamacare. This bill simply does not do that, and so Republicans who stand on principle, supporting free market reforms and saying this bill does not go far enough - we want to educate their constituents that they stood on principle and did the right thing.\n\nCORNISH: So is there a scenario where you would support a challenger to someone like Speaker Paul Ryan or another member of Republican leadership, educating their constituents, so to speak?\n\nCHOUGULE: I'm not in a position to comment on exactly who, you know - what members of Congress and what amount of money we're going to spend in what districts. So I think that remains to be seen. This is all very fluid. It remains - our focus right now is on educating the American people about what this bill does. It simply does not go far enough, keeps intact too much of a law that has cancelled millions of people's health care plans, raise their costs, made it so they can't see their own doctor, raised their taxes.\n\nWe want to educate the American people on what this law contains in it, what Republicans promised to do for seven years, which is to repeal Obamacare and then finally, as you have mentioned, educate them when their lawmakers are going to Washington and doing what they promised, which is standing firm on principle and fighting for a full repeal of Obamacare.\n\nCORNISH: So a full repeal - do you want any kind of replacement in reality, or are you fine to kind of - is it repeal or nothing?\n\nCHOUGULE: No, of course not. I mean even that 2015 repeal bill that got to President Obama's desk - that had a two-year transition period built into it to enact free market health care reforms. The other organization you mentioned, Freedom Partners Chamber of Commerce - they laid out a memo almost a month ago now that laid out some free market health care reforms that we've talked about.\n\nAnd you know, without getting, you know, too bogged down with the details, I'll give you one good example. So the most significant portion of insurance gains under Obamacare has come through the Medicaid expansion. That has also accordingly been the most expensive part of Obamacare for taxpayers. All we're saying is, of course we don't want to immediately repeal the Medicaid expansion and throw everybody off, you know, insurance that they're counting on.\n\nOur solution is relatively simple. Let's freeze enrollment now. Taxpayers cannot afford this program in its current state. Let's shut the front door to this program. And states Arizona and Maine have both done this, one of which was approved by President Obama. Freeze enrollment, and as these able-bodied adults start working and their incomes grow, they become ineligible, and eventually the program shrinks through attrition.\n\nCORNISH: And of course we know there are several Republican governors actually (laughter) who disagree with you about doing that, and that's part of this ongoing debate. Akash Chougule, policy director for Americans for Prosperity, we hope to talk to you again as this debate continues.\n\nCHOUGULE: Absolutely. Thank you for having me.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF TYCHO SONG, AWAKE)\n\nCopyright © 2017 NPR. All rights reserved.

Losing The House Is A Blow To President Trump's Agenda\n\nNoel King talks to NPR political editor Domenico Montanaro and former White House adviser Marc Lotter about the consequences of the midterm election results for President Trump.\n\nNOEL KING, HOST:\n\nDemocrats took control of the House last night. They did not take control of the Senate. It will be a Congress divided. What does that mean for President Trump? NPR's political editor Domenico Montanaro is here to help us answer that question. Good morning, Domenico.\n\nDOMENICO MONTANARO, BYLINE: Hey there, Noel.\n\nKING: So is the president going to be going forced to compromise, especially with Democrats who now have the power to block his legislative agenda?\n\nMONTANARO: Well, it puts him in a little bit of a box because everyone is going to have their own narrative today. The reality is that losing the House is a major blow to the president and his agenda potentially. You know, he can either choose to compromise or essentially become a lame duck, starting in January, if he decides that he wants to become more entrenched, say, hey, the Senate went more Republican, so - and use that as a way to say that he won. And I assume that we're going to see the president try that at least for a little while.\n\nKING: All right. Domenico, stand by just a minute. Also with us now is Marc Lotter, a former special assistant to the president. He is an outside spokesperson for the White House. And he did sign an NDA with the White House, meaning he may be limited in how much he can say. Mr. Lotter, good morning.\n\nMARC LOTTER: Good morning. Thanks for having me.\n\nKING: All right. So despite some victories in key races, a majority of people voted against the president's party. What do you make of that?\n\nLOTTER: Well, I completely disagree. I mean, the Republicans expanded their majority by a significant margin, possibly, right now, it looks like up to five seats added to the Republican majority in the United States...\n\nKING: Talking about...\n\nLOTTER: ...Senate.\n\nKING: ...Numbers, talking about numbers.\n\nLOTTER: And - well - and - but those are...\n\nKING: Numbers of people...\n\nLOTTER: ...Important numbers...\n\nKING: ...Who voted in...\n\nLOTTER: ...When it comes to governing.\n\nKING: Yes, of course, of course. So you would say - well, let me switch gears here a little bit. A lot of people said that they voted on health care, right? Many Republicans said that they would work to protect coverage for people with pre-existing conditions. Are Republicans acknowledging that at least some elements of Obamacare are important and popular?\n\nLOTTER: I think it's long been acknowledged that there have been elements of Obamacare that that needed to be retained, primarily the pre-existing coverage.\n\nKING: By Republicans.\n\nLOTTER: ...And how you do that. The challenge that we face - and this is the challenge that Democrats will face - is that they - it's often easy to campaign and say you are against something, but when it comes to governing and replacing it or coming up with a plan that can move forward, that's where the stumbling block is. We've seen this happen. The president reached out in the previous - or the current Congress on immigration issues, on infrastructure issues. And, while the Democrats talked about wanting to compromise, they actually never did. So now we're going to see, how does that translate in terms of governing with the House controlled by Democrats and the Senate firmly in the control of Republicans?\n\nKING: Well, yeah, what do you make of the prospects for bipartisanship, for compromise?\n\nLOTTER: I think, if I had to guess, I would assume that both sides will try to find an area where they can get to relatively quick agreement. That would probably be in the area of infrastructure, where there is lower hurdles to overcome because both sides are going to want to be able to tell their voters that they've been rewarded, that their leadership has produced something, that they want to be bipartisan so they can always point back to that when the partisan battles happen. Now, whether that will hold for the next two years will be a different story. But it wouldn't surprise me to see something come early in the next year where both sides could get together and throw out something as a victory.\n\nKING: All right. Let me pull back a little bit and ask you about the president's campaign. We just heard on the show from the conservative commentator Max Boot, a former Republican famously. Here's some of what he had to say about the president's campaigning during the midterms.\n\nMAX BOOT: He is essentially appealing to this angry, old, undereducated, white demographic in our society, and he's figured out how to mobilize them with fear-mongering about this supposed caravan invasion and all the rest of it. This is not the Republican Party that I grew up with. This is not the Republican Party I want to see. But this is what the Republican Party has become, which is essentially a white nationalist party.\n\nKING: That is a very strong statement. What do you make of it?\n\nLOTTER: Well, I think it's complete nonsense from somebody who usually utters complete nonsense. I mean, the president is reaching out and trying to grow the economy for everyone. We have seen the results - the positive results, whether it is the lowest African-American unemployment rate in history or the lowest unemployment rate for Latinos and Hispanics in history. We have rising paychecks. That is lifting all boats. And, trust me, the president is going to reach out over these next couple of years into areas where we're seeing, according to some polling, that the president has the highest approval rating among African-Americans among Republicans...\n\nKING: All right.\n\nLOTTER: ...In modern history.\n\nKING: I think all of those numbers you just cited are actually debatable, but we don't have time to debate them right now. Marc Lotter is a former special assistant to President Trump.\n\nThank you, Mr. Lotter.\n\nLOTTER: Thank you.\n\nKING: All right. We're back now with NPR's Domenico Montanaro.\n\nDomenico, what do you think?\n\nMONTANARO: Well, I thought it was interesting that he said that they want to probably reach out to try to do something quickly...\n\nKING: Yeah.\n\nMONTANARO: ...On bipartisanship because I think he's right that people do want at least to be able to point back and say, in the partisan battles, look, that we did this thing. Now, I kind of laugh out - you know, to myself a little bit when anyone talks about infrastructure...\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nMONTANARO: ...Because almost anything...\n\nKING: Tell us why.\n\nMONTANARO: ...Almost anything that's tried to get done on infrastructure - you know, it's always dangled out there as the thing that they want to do. And they can never agree on how to pay for it. And, you know, every time there's been an infrastructure week, quote-unquote, in this administration, something crazy has happened, and it had nothing to do with infrastructure (laughter). So, you know, seeing that as a possibility - you know, I think it's interesting that at least there's the fig leaf out there to say, look - acknowledging they probably need to get something done.\n\nKING: But do you predict, very quickly, more legislative gridlock ahead?\n\nMONTANARO: Absolutely - unless the president is willing to compromise on a host of issues, then there is going to be legislative gridlock. And that's just fine by Democrats, who are looking to just put a - you know, gum up the system until 2020, when they'll have a shot to try to take out this president for re-election.\n\nKING: NPR's Domenico Montanaro.\n\nThanks, Domenico.\n\nMONTANARO: You're welcome.\n\nCopyright © 2018 NPR.

FACT CHECK: Trump's False Claims On 'Medicare-For-All'\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Win McNamee/Getty Images Win McNamee/Getty Images\n\nUSA Today published an opinion column by President Trump Wednesday in which the president falsely accused Democrats of trying to eviscerate Medicare, while defending his own record of protecting health care coverage for seniors and others.\n\nThe column — published just weeks ahead of the midterm elections — underscores the political power of health care to energize voters. But it makes a number of unsubstantiated claims.\n\nHere are 5 points to know\n\n1. The political context: Health care has emerged as a dominant issue on the campaign trail in the runup to the November elections. According to the Wesleyan Media Project, which tracks congressional advertising, health care was the focus of 41 percent of all campaign ads in September, outpacing taxes (20 percent), jobs (13 percent) and immigration (9 percent). Democrats are particularly focused on health care, devoting 50 percent of their ads to the issue, but health care is also a leading issue in Republican commercials (28 percent), second only to taxes (32 percent).\n\nPerhaps sensing that Democrats are gaining traction, Trump has decided to go on the attack, targeting the Democratic proposal known as Medicare-for-All.\n\n2. Cost of the plan: Trump claims that expanding the federal government's Medicare program would cost $32.6 trillion over a decade. But as Business Insider reports, that would actually be a discount compared with the nation's current health care bill.\n\nTrump's figure was calculated by the libertarian Mercatus Center, but he fails to note that total health care spending under Medicare-for-All would be about $2 trillion less over the decade than currently projected. The federal government would pay more, but Americans on the whole would pay less.\n\nRemember that the U.S. already spends far more per person on health care than does any other country. And when you count the tax break for employer-provided insurance, the federal government already pays about two-thirds of this bill. But because of the fragmented private insurance system, the government gets none of the efficiency or buying power that a single-payer system would provide.\n\n3. Health care rationing: Trump claims — with no supporting evidence — that the Democratic plan would inevitably lead to the massive rationing of health care. Doctors and hospitals would be put out of business. Seniors would lose access to their favorite doctors. There would be long wait lines for appointments and procedures. Previously covered care would effectively be denied.\n\nDetailed implementation of any single-payer plan would of course be subject to substantial negotiation. But the Medicare for All bill drafted by Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., states explicitly that Nothing in this Act shall prohibit an institutional or individual provider from entering into a private contract with an enrolled individual for any item or service outside the plan.\n\n4. Pre-existing conditions: Trump notes that as a candidate, he promised that we would protect coverage for patients with pre-existing conditions. In fact, Trump and his fellow Republicans tried — unsuccessfully — to repeal the Affordable Care Act, which guarantees insurance coverage for people with pre-existing conditions. GOP plans would leave it up to the states to craft alternative protections. In addition, Republican attorneys general have sued to overturn Obamacare's protections, and the Trump administration has declined to defend them.\n\nAmerica's Health Insurance Plans, the trade group for the insurance industry, warns that ending the Obamacare guarantee could result in hardship for the estimated 130 million Americans under 65 with pre-existing conditions.\n\nRemoving those provisions will result in renewed uncertainty in the individual market, create a patchwork of requirements in the states, cause rates to go even higher for older Americans and sicker patients, and make it challenging to introduce products and rates for 2019, AHIP said in a statement in June.\n\n5. Strength of Medicare: Trump writes that Democrats have already harmed seniors by slashing Medicare by more than $800 billion over 10 years to pay for Obamacare. Likewise, Democrats would gut Medicare with their planned government takeover of American health care.\n\nHe is repeating a claim that was widely debunked during the 2012 election. The Affordable Care Act actually strengthened the solvency of Medicare, but it has since been weakened again by the GOP tax cut.\n\nThe president is trying to play on the fears of seniors — who vote in large numbers — with the claim that any effort to improve health security for younger Americans must come at their expense. But that is a false choice.
Republicans Restrained In Response To Trump Sharing Intelligence With Russia\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Susan Walsh/AP Susan Walsh/AP\n\nRepublicans in Congress are calling for briefings and pleading for less drama at the White House following revelations that President Trump shared classified intelligence with Russia — but most are muted in their criticism of him.\n\nFor the leader of Senate Republicans, the biggest concern is that the controversy over Trump's sharing of secrets — with the successor to what Republican President Ronald Reagan once labeled the evil empire — is that it's distracting lawmakers from their legislative program.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said Tuesday morning in an interview with Bloomberg News that we could do with a little less drama from the White House on a lot of things. McConnell added that drama was interfering with the ability of Republican senators to focus on our agenda, which is deregulation, tax reform, repealing and replacing Obamacare.\n\nIn a statement, Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., said the intelligence sharing was deeply disturbing. McCain, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, added, Reports that this information was provided by a U.S. ally and shared without its knowledge sends a troubling signal to America's allies and partners around the world and may impair their willingness to share intelligence with us in the future.\n\nSen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, said it would be very troubling if Trump shared sensitive information with the Russians and said the Senate Intelligence Committee should be briefed on this important issue immediately. Collins is a member of that committee.\n\nAnother lawmaker calling for briefings is Rep. Barbara Comstock of Virginia. Comstock is one of the more vulnerable House Republicans, facing a tough re-election campaign in a district that voted for Democrat Hillary Clinton over Trump last fall by 10 points.\n\nComstock issued a blistering statement, saying lawmakers need to have immediate classified briefings on what occurred at this meeting so that Congress can at least know as much as Russian leaders.\n\nThe chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Bob Corker of Tennessee, said the White House is in a downward spiral right now. He added that the Trump administration has got to figure out a way to come to grips with all that's happening.\n\nRep. Mike Gallagher, a Wisconsin Republican in his first term, tweeted: For the purpose of transparency, the White House should share a transcript of the meeting with the House and Senate intelligence committees. He said that as an intelligence officer by training, I know firsthand the life and death implications of safeguarding classified information.\n\nBut as with the abrupt firing of FBI Director James Comey last week, most GOP lawmakers have been restrained in their criticism of Trump. So far no one in the GOP's leadership on Capitol Hill is calling for an independent investigation or a special committee to investigate any Trump ties to Russia. And while some GOP lawmakers privately express frustration with the president's distractions and crisis-prone administration, there's been little public condemnation of Trump, who remains popular with the GOP base.
Trump Administration Says Entire Affordable Care Act Should Be Repealed\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Kevin Hagen/Getty Images Kevin Hagen/Getty Images\n\nUpdated at 1:30 p.m. ET\n\nIn a significant shift, the Trump administration says the entirety of the Affordable Care Act should be struck down in the courts. Previously, the administration had pushed to remove the law's protections for people with pre-existing conditions but had not argued in court that the whole law should be struck down.\n\nThe change was announced in a two-sentence letter from the Department of Justice to the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals, which said that the ruling made in December by a district court judge in Texas should be affirmed.\n\nIn that case, District Judge Reed O'Connor declared the ACA unconstitutional. He ruled that a 2017 change in federal tax law eliminating the penalty on uninsured people invalidated the entire health care law.\n\nThe Department of Justice has determined that the district court's comprehensive opinion came to the correct conclusion and will support it on appeal, Justice Department spokeswoman Kerri Kupec said in a statement. The letter said the DOJ will further explain its position in a brief to be filed later.\n\nThe Justice Department's letter won't change anything yet for the law, also known as Obamacare. Coverage for those who have insurance through the ACA — more than 10 million people through Medicaid expansion, and nearly 12 million more through ACA exchanges — stays the same for now. The case will continue to wind through the courts and is likely to end up before the Supreme Court.\n\nIf the case does land at the Supreme Court, it would be the third time that the court would rule on a constitutional question related to the ACA. The court upheld the law in 2012 and rejected a challenge to it in 2015.\n\nMeanwhile, a group of Republican state attorneys general is fighting to have the law repealed, while a group of Democratic state attorneys general is arguing to keep the law in place.\n\nIn addition to the law's best-known aspects — the exchanges and the federal requirement to buy health insurance — the ACA touches every part of the health care system, from how Medicare pays doctors to the Medicaid expansion that has covered millions of low-income people to whether restaurants have to post nutrition information. Hospitals would have to develop new payment systems, and an entire section of the insurance industry would go away.\n\nThe ACA's popularity played a role in Democrats' success in the 2018 elections, when they took back the House. Upending the law could prove politically dangerous for the Trump administration and Republicans who are backing the law's repeal.\n\nDemocrats were quick to criticize the move.\n\nLast night, the Department of Justice declared the entire law and all of its vital health care protections must go, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a Democrat from New York, said in remarks on the Senate floor Tuesday. Make no mistake about it, this is an escalation of the Trump administration and Republicans' attacks on protections for people with pre-existing conditions.\n\nNPR health policy correspondent Alison Kodjak contributed to this report.
Obamacare Has Problems. The Senate Health Care Bill Doesn't Solve Them, Experts Say\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Spencer Platt/Getty Images Spencer Platt/Getty Images\n\nThe Affordable Care Act isn't perfect. Even proponents of the law would agree with that.\n\nIn many parts of the country, there is only one insurer in the individual markets — and in a few, there are zero. Premiums have spiked, sending some people on the insurance exchanges hunting for new plans.\n\nIf you listen to the news, you know all of this. Particularly in the past year or so, these complaints have been at the heart of Republicans' push for repealing the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. And as senators try to scrape together enough votes to pass their own health care overhaul, these are at the heart of their pitch to the American people.\n\nNPR asked several health care experts to tell us what they view as the biggest problems with the current health care system. Then we asked: Does the Senate bill fix them? Most of the experts we consulted (backed up by a Congressional Budget Office assessment) said that for the most part, no — the Senate bill won't solve the health care system's problems and that it, in fact, could make some of those problems worse.\n\nProblem 1: health care costs\n\nThe biggest problem with health care in the U.S. was around long before Obamacare, several experts who spoke to NPR said.\n\nThe fundamental problem with the health care system is health care is too expensive, said Sara Rosenbaum, a professor of health law and policy at George Washington University.\n\nThe U.S. spends around $9,450 per person, per year on health care — that is money charged by providers and insurers for services, according to data compiled by the Kaiser Family Foundation. That is around twice as much as in other rich countries.\n\nWe spend so much more than other countries, said Larry Levitt, senior vice president for special initiatives at the Kaiser Family Foundation. And while health care costs have been growing relatively modestly recently, they're still growing faster than the economy as a whole.\n\nThese bills [from the House and Senate alike] don't even really attempt to solve that problem, he said. This is a much narrower effort.\n\nEssentially they're moving the deck chairs on the Titanic, concurred Sabrina Corlette, research professor at the Center on Health Insurance Reforms at Georgetown University. This bill does nothing on cost containment, nothing on delivery system reform, nothing on the underlying reasons that health care is so expensive in this country.\n\nThe experts tended to agree that the Affordable Care Act didn't have much success on the cost-containment front, although they disagreed on why.\n\nHealth care spending did slow down a lot sort of during ACA implementation, but I don't think we can attribute most of that to ACA, said Caroline Pearson, senior vice president for policy and strategy at Avalere Health. A lot of it had to do with the economy and the state of recession and sort of the hangover that that caused.\n\nProblem 2: unstable individual markets\n\nOne of the most common criticisms of Obamacare right now is that insurers have been dropping out of individual markets set up by the health law. That leaves people in many parts of the country with only one option, and in 2018, 47 counties could have zero insurers, according to the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services.\n\nOpinions vary on how pressing the one-insurer problem is — It's not ideal, but it's not catastrophic having one insurer, said Levitt. Pearson was more urgent in her warnings: Absolutely that needs fixing. The ACA exchange markets are very fragile at this point.\n\nEither way, it's not clear that the Senate health bill would increase stability in the individual markets.\n\nUnder current law, the Congressional Budget Office says, the markets will generally hold firm over the coming decade: The subsidies to purchase coverage, combined with the effects of the individual mandate — which requires most individuals to obtain insurance or pay a penalty — are anticipated to cause sufficient demand for insurance by enough people, including people with low health care expenditures, for the market to be stable in most areas.\n\nHowever, a small number of people live in places with limited participation by insurers. That is due in part to low profits for insurance companies, but it's also due to uncertainty about how health care laws might be enforced in the future — which is created by continual threats to remove the law.\n\nThe Senate bill would not necessarily make more areas more stable. The recent CBO report refers to stability in most places, just as it does to describe the individual marker under current health law: Nongroup insurance markets would continue to be stable in most parts of the country.\n\nBut rural areas could have particularly unstable markets under the Republican plan, the CBO said. That is because low populations, combined with smaller subsidies, could mean few consumers. That would make exchanges in those areas less profitable.\n\nSo the difference between one law and the other isn't terribly clear in this respect.\n\nIn addition, it's foreseeable that as funding like Obamacare's cost-sharing reductions disappear, the markets will get shakier, says one expert.\n\nBetween now and 2021, the substantial stabilization funding in the bill would be enough to calm markets even without an individual mandate, said Levitt. After that, money then disappears and there's some grant funding to states, but that also diminishes over time. After 2021, it's very likely that insurance markets would look a lot worse under this bill than under ACA.\n\nProblem 3: rising premiums\n\nPremiums have climbed sharply in the Obamacare markets for a variety of reasons. The Senate bill would fix those increases, according to the CBO, but at a price. By 2020, the average premium for a benchmark plan would be 30 percent lower than it would be under Obamacare.\n\nThat sounds good, but those lower premiums wouldn't be enough to entice poorer Americans to buy insurance. Few low-income people would purchase any plan under this bill, the CBO wrote.\n\nAnd that is because the costs would just shift elsewhere. The Senate health care plan might push premiums down for some people, but it would also push deductibles up, the CBO said: Because nongroup insurance would pay for a smaller average share of benefits under this legislation, most people purchasing it would have higher out-of-pocket spending on health care than under current law.\n\nThat was the take of Christine Eibner, a senior economist and associate director of the Health Services Delivery Systems program at the RAND Corporation.\n\nIt's still going to be more out-of-pocket spending relative to the ACA for people with incomes between 138 and 400 percent of the federal poverty level, she said. Those people are currently eligible for subsidies on the individual exchanges.\n\nNicholas Bagley, who teaches about health law at the University of Michigan, elaborated.\n\nBy linking subsidies to these less generous plans, the GOP health care plan says, 'Yes, we're going to make sure you can purchase a plan, but the plans we're going to make sure you can purchase are going to be very high deductible plans,'  he said.\n\nNot everyone agrees with that assessment, though. Avik Roy, president of the Foundation for Research on Equal Opportunity, has been one of the loudest proponents of the Senate's Better Care Reconciliation Act. He admits one thing he likes about Obamacare is the degree to which it tries to expand the size of the people who try to shop for their own insurance.\n\nThe Senate bill further encourages that economically coherent goal, he said, of more people buying insurance on their own in a thriving, robust and stable insurance market.\n\nHe thinks the individual markets will end up pulling people's health care spending down because new age-rating rules (which make insurance cheaper for younger people relative to older people) and a change that would make marketplace plans, on average, cover less will drive younger and healthier people into the markets, pulling premiums further downward and lowering people's health spending altogether.\n\nProblem 4: coverage\n\nBy and large, it appears coverage levels would go down under the Senate bill, according to the CBO. Under that legislation, 22 million more people would be uninsured in 2026 than under current law, the CBO said. Nearly 70 percent of that — 15 million — is attributed to Medicaid changes. Seven million fewer people would be enrolled in the exchanges in that time frame.\n\nThere will be a lot of low-income people who won't have access to insurance, and then there will be some who won't be able to buy a plan through the exchanges, said Pearson. Even if they can afford the premiums, if the deductible is a $6,000 deductible, then that doesn't really leave low-income people in a position to use their insurance.\n\nThat is a massive hit to coverage, and it's one of the headline numbers causing Republicans the most headaches since the CBO report's release.\n\nOnce again, however, Roy believes that the CBO is wrong. In his opinion, removing the individual mandate won't drive nearly as many people out of the market as the office says.\n\nThere's a simple way for Republicans to highlight the CBO's mandate mania: have CBO score one version of the bill with an individual mandate, and one version without, he wrote. That would show, in his words, that the mandate is the secret sauce driving the CBO's faulty coverage predictions.\n\nOther, less obvious problems\n\nDepending on whom you ask, the Republican plan is solving other problems, though — some of which are not exactly health care-centric.\n\nThe problem it's trying to solve is the Republicans didn't like the Affordable Care Act taxes, Bagley said. The Senate bill gives a massive tax cut, largely for the wealthiest Americans, and it finances that tax cut largely by cutting Medicaid, the program for low-income Americans, he added.\n\nNearly 70 percent of the tax cuts that would happen under the Senate bill would go to the top 20 percent of earners, according to the Tax Policy Center, and nearly 45 percent would go to the top 1 percent sliver of earners.\n\nMeanwhile, another problem for many on the right is the existence of the Affordable Care Act itself. For eight years, repeal Obamacare has been the drumbeat of Republican candidates nationwide. The Senate bill is ostensibly a solution to this political problem, in the sense that it is billed as a repeal proposal.\n\nBut conservatives from David Brooks to Ann Coulter have blasted it as Obamacare lite. They argue from two directions — Brooks that the bill wouldn't help enough people, Coulter that she wants a one-sentence law saying there shall be a free market in health insurance — but they both say that too much of the original Obamacare structures (subsidies, insurance exchanges) are still there.\n\nThe Senate bill isn't seeking to tackle real health care issues here with conservative solutions, Brooks elaborated, so much as it is seeking a politically palatable, half-repeal solution that can somehow amass enough Republican votes to pass.\n\nIn other words, even if Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell can get those votes together, he will still have to face those in his party who say that the Senate bill still won't fully repeal Obamacare.

Each of our players will have 60 seconds in which to answer as many fill-in-the-blank questions as they can. Each correct answer now worth two points. Bill, can you give us the scores?\n\nBILL KURTIS: I sure can. Peter has two. Roxanne and Roy each have three.\n\nSAGAL: All right.\n\nSAGAL: So that means Peter is in third place.

And when police attempted to arrest him, he gave the cops a fake name. That probably would have worked if Bushman did not have his full name tattooed in giant letters on his neck. It also didn't help that he was also wearing a nametag from a recent forgers convention...\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nSAGAL: ...That said, hello, my name is guilty.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nSAGAL: Bill, how did Peter do on our quiz?\n\nKURTIS: Real good - six right, 12 more points, total of 14.

One of those...\n\nSAGAL: No.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nSAGAL: They had students - during this test to keep them from cheating, they had students wear cardboard boxes on their heads. A recent picture showed university students taking an exam while wearing these cardboard boxes with small cut out eye holes presumably to keep students from looking to their left or right and cheating off the person next to them. Or maybe just every student had ended up with a bad Halloween costume. The school has since apologized for doing this to their students. They say that when it comes to future ideas for preventing cheating, they'll try and think outside the box.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nSAGAL: Bill, how did Roy do on our quiz?\n\nKURTIS: He got three right, six more points, total of nine.

Why Some Ohioans Are Supporting Bernie Sanders\n\nOhio voters head to the polls on Tuesday. Rick Kepler, a retired union worker in Ohio, tells NPR's Rachel Martin why he plans to vote for Bernie Sanders.\n\nRACHEL MARTIN, HOST:\n\nDemocrats are also in Ohio campaigning. Senator Bernie Sanders is feeling some momentum after his surprise victory over Hillary Clinton in Michigan. Now, he heads to Ohio where some of the same economic issues are driving the conversation there. We're going to hear from one Ohio voter now. He's 66-year-old Rick Kepler, a retired teamster organizer. He told us one of his local unions recently held a mock election. Half of the members supported Donald Trump. The other half, 2 to 1, backed Bernie Sanders. I asked him why Sanders has his vote.\n\nRICK KEPLER: For the first time in my life, I heard a presidential candidate say that it's not the Russians or the Islamists or debt or some other thing that's causing the problems of the working people of this country. He came right out and said what it is. He said it's corporate America. It's Wall Street. It's the 1 percent.\n\nMARTIN: And you don't feel that Hillary Clinton is on the same page.\n\nKEPLER: Well, Bill Clinton was not a very good friend of labor - all those trade agreements, the Glass-Steagall Act and other things that Bill Clinton did. I knew then that they had created a right turn on the Democratic Party, what we call the corporate wing of the Democratic Party. She's campaigning to the left, as all the establishment Democrats do, but I believe that once she's in office, she too will then govern according to the needs of Wall Street before she takes care of the people on Main Street.\n\nMARTIN: Bernie Sanders has been in the halls of Congress for a long time. Have you seen evidence that these are issues he has moved the needle on?\n\nKEPLER: He's been consistently principled on his positions whether it's in foreign affairs or, you know, what he talked about the last debate about what happened in - when Reagan was attacking the common folks in Latin America. And so I think as a Democratic socialist, he's a lot closer to the ideas that I believe in. We do need Medicare for all. It should be a right in this country and not a commodity that can be sold.\n\nMARTIN: But let me ask you about that because this country went through a pretty vicious fight over Obamacare. And the House has repeatedly tried to get it rolled back. So what makes you think a candidate who wants a single-payer system could win in a general election on that kind of platform?\n\nKEPLER: What he's doing is making us take a look at issues the corporate media just hides under the rug. What he's saying is - if you want to see these changes, you better have this political revolution and start talking about this. Don't forget Occupy. They're the first ones who drew attention to the 1 percent, and then they got crushed. But he's resurrected it.\n\nMARTIN: Let me ask you, though. You clearly know the issues. You study the political map, I'm sure, so you know that Bernie Sanders has a tough path to the nomination right now.\n\nKEPLER: Absolutely.\n\nMARTIN: Let's say Hillary Clinton wins the nomination and she's running against Donald Trump. What does that internal calculus look like for you?\n\nKEPLER: We have to support that. We have to make sure Trump does not grab the presidency of the United States of America. Won't be no full-fledged, boy, let's get Hillary in and things will change because we've got a few social issues that she'll stand up for. But when it comes to challenging Wall Street, nope, that's not going to happen.\n\nMARTIN: Rick Kepler, he joined us on the line from his home outside of Akron, Ohio. He is a supporter of Senator Bernie Sanders. Rick, thanks so much for sharing your thoughts with us.\n\nKEPLER: Rachel, thanks for the opportunity.\n\nCopyright © 2016 NPR. All rights reserved.

A Woman's Grief Led To A Mental Health Crisis And A $21,634 Hospital Bill\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Alyssa Schukar for KHN Alyssa Schukar for KHN\n\nArline Feilen lost her husband to suicide in 2013. Three years later, she lost her dad to cancer. And this February, she lost her 89-year-old mom to a cascade of health problems.\n\nWe were like glue, and that first Mother's Day without her was killer. It just dragged me down, said Feilen, who is 56 and lives in suburban Chicago. It was just loss after loss after loss, and I just crumbled.\n\nA few days after that painful holiday, she drank eight or nine light beers in several hours, trying to drown her pain. She sent alarming texts to her sister and friends, raising concern she might harm herself. One friend called 911, summoning an ambulance that took her to Northwestern Medicine Central DuPage Hospital.\n\nFeilen arrived in the emergency room on a mid-May night and was moved to a shared room in the inpatient psychiatric unit the next day. In total, she spent five nights in the hospital.\n\nFeilen underwent a battery of tests: bloodwork, an abdominal ultrasound and an electrocardiogram. She got group counseling, which her sister, Kathy McCoy, said really helped. She also started taking an antidepressant, Remeron.\n\nWhen she got home, she stopped drinking beer. She kept taking the medication and continued counseling. She came to view her mental health crisis as another mountain I've climbed — and reminded herself of her accomplishment by keeping her hospital bracelet in her bedroom near a candle. Her grief began to recede.\n\nThen the bill came.\n\nPatient: Arline Feilen, the widow of a veteran, is a part-time, self-employed medical transcriptionist who lives in Carol Stream, Ill. She purchased individual insurance on the open market, not through the Affordable Care Act exchange.\n\nTotal bill: $29,894.50, including $16,480 for room and board in a semiprivate psychiatric room and $3,999 for the ER. After the hospital reduced the bill because her insurance didn't cover mental health, she owes $21,634.55.\n\nService provider: Northwestern Medicine Central DuPage Hospital, a large, acute care hospital in the Chicago suburbs. It's part of the nonprofit academic health system Northwestern Medicine.\n\nMedical service: Feilen received inpatient care for a depressive episode, including blood draws, an ultrasound, an electrocardiogram and behavioral health treatment.\n\nWhat gives: Feilen has an association health plan purchased through Affiliated Workers Association. It's called SelectCare 1, costs her $210 a month and doesn't cover mental health care.\n\nThis is one type of plan that the Obama administration curtailed. But some like Feilen's are permitted again since the Trump administration gave the go-ahead for sales of plans previously considered to offer inadequate coverage.\n\nLike other association plans, hers doesn't have to include the 10 essential health benefits required under the federal Affordable Care Act, such as mental health and substance use disorder treatment. In plans that comply with the ACA, those benefits must be treated the same way as physical needs.\n\nJennifer Snow, acting national director for advocacy and public policy for the National Alliance on Mental Illness, said the type of plan Feilen has is allowed to undermine the ACA.\n\nIf you or someone you know may be considering suicide, contact the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255 (En Español: 1-888-628-9454; Deaf and Hard of Hearing: 1-800-799-4889) or the Crisis Text Line by texting HOME to 741741.\n\nThe Trump administration last year issued rules making it easier for small employers to band together to offer insurance through these plans. In March, a U.S. District Court judge sided with 11 states and the District of Columbia challenging the law, invalidating a large chunk of those rules. But association plans are still out there, and some states support broader access to them.\n\nSheri Boehle, an insurance agent who handles Affiliated Workers Association, said many people buy this type of insurance for a short period of time. For the right people, she said, it's a great option that can protect them from the costs of catastrophic physical health problems.\n\nShare your medical billing story Do you have a medical bill you'd like us to investigate? You can tell us about it and submit it here.\n\nBoehle said she always gives customers a brochure explaining exactly what's covered and what's not, and Feilen said she got one saying treatment for mental health care wouldn't be covered. Feilen said that was all right with her when she bought the policy years ago because she didn't expect to need that service.\n\nTo keep costs down while hospitalized, Feilen said, she tried to refuse treatments like the ultrasound but was told she needed it. She got no answers when she inquired how much she might pay.\n\nI'm asking a simple question, and there should be a simple, finite answer, she said.\n\nHospitals generally charge uninsured people much more than they charge people who have insurance. A 2017 report from the Health Care Cost Institute showed that the average negotiated price of an acute mental health admission was $9,293 for a commercially insured patient who stayed, on average, for a week. That's less than half of Feilen's bill.\n\nGetting answers about the cost of care can be extremely difficult for patients, even those footing the bills without the help of insurance.\n\nHospital pricing is obviously opaque, said Ezra Golberstein, an associate professor at the University of Minnesota's School of Public Health. The easiest prices to get are how much to pay for parking and how much things cost at the snack bar.\n\nThe biggest chunk of Feilen's bill was $16,480 for four nights in a psychiatric unit room shared with another patient. Adding the night in the ER brings it up to $20,479 — the majority of the entire bill.\n\nMcCoy joked that it would have been a lot cheaper for her sister to stay at a Ritz hotel.\n\nThat's true. According to its website, five nights in the fanciest suite at the Ritz-Carlton in downtown Chicago costs $12,895.\n\nResolution: Without prompting, the hospital reduced Feilen's bill by $8,968.35 because she lacked mental health coverage. This amount was already taken off the bill when she got it.\n\nHospital officials provided a statement saying Northwestern Medicine offers a variety of financial assistance programs for uninsured, underinsured and insured patients. Often, they said, a social worker or community partner helps the patient navigate the process, which includes filling out an application and providing supporting information and documents.\n\nIn this case, we have tried numerous times to connect with this patient to provide guidance and assistance, the statement said.\n\nFeilen said she talked to a social worker at the hospital about costs and began filling out a form for financial help, but stopped when she got to a part that asked about stocks and bonds. Although her annual income is below the poverty level ― and she likely qualifies for Medicaid ― she received a modest inheritance from her parents that she has put into a retirement plan, she said, and thought that meant she wouldn't qualify.\n\nWhen she was buying insurance years ago, Feilen said, she started to look into plans on healthcare.gov that offer subsidies to many people with low or middle-class incomes. But she said she found them confusing and gave up.\n\nNAMI's Snow said it's sometimes tough for consumers to know whether a plan complies with the health care law. Plans sold outside of healthcare.gov may be labeled Obamacare but not have the health law's guaranteed benefits.\n\nYou have to be really careful you don't accidentally buy one. They're always cheaper, she said. But if it seems too good to be true, it probably is.\n\nTo find ACA-compliant plans, which must cover mental health, Snow suggested going to HealthCare.gov, the federal marketplace that covers most states. (It will direct you if your state set up its own ACA marketplace.)\n\nThe takeaway: If you're uninsured, you'll generally face bigger bills than patients with health insurance because you lack the power of the insurance company to negotiate prices with the hospital. Ask whether you qualify for Medicaid or charity care. If you don't, negotiate with the hospital anyway to try to lower your bill. Arm yourself with information about the going rate insurers pay for the care you received by consulting websites like Healthcare Bluebook or Fair Health.\n\nWhen buying insurance, make sure you know what's covered and what's not, which can be tricky to determine for plans — many of which can be found on the Internet — that don't have to follow all the rules of the federal health law.\n\nOn the individual market, it's very much 'buyer beware' for plans that are not ACA-compliant, Golberstein said. With short-term or association health plans, really read the fine print.\n\nIf Feilen could go back in time, she said she would have surely bought insurance that covered mental illness, which affects 1 in 5 U.S. adults each year.\n\nI would definitely recommend it. You don't know what life is gonna bring you, she said. I never imagined in a million years that I'd need mental health care.\n\nNPR produced and edited the interview with Kaiser Health News' Elisabeth Rosenthal for broadcast.

Platform Check: Trump And Clinton On Health Care\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Harry Sieplinga/Getty Images Harry Sieplinga/Getty Images\n\nWhen it comes to health care, the choice between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump comes down to whether to keep, or trash, the Affordable Care Act.\n\nHealth Care Premium Hike Catapults Obamacare Into Election Spotlight Premium Hike Catapults Obamacare Into Election Spotlight Listen · 6:03 6:03\n\nTrump says he wants to repeal and replace the health care law that is responsible for insuring about 20 million people, while Clinton has vowed to retain it and even expand its reach.\n\nHere are the candidates' plans:\n\nHILLARY CLINTON\n\nEnlarge this image Charlie Neibergall/AP Charlie Neibergall/AP\n\nKeep and build on Obamacare\n\nOffer a tax credit of up to $5,000 to offset out-of-pocket costs over 5 percent of income\n\nCreate a public option for health insurance\n\nIncrease funding for community health centers\n\nEstablish federal oversight of drug price increases\n\nAllow people to buy in to Medicare starting at age 55\n\nClinton's plan maintains the basic structure of Obamacare, with its expansion of Medicaid to more people with higher incomes and the ability to buy insurance through government-run exchanges. But she acknowledges problems with the program in its current form and offers changes to cut consumer costs, rein in drug prices, and ensure more uninsured people get covered.\n\nThe so-called public option would allow consumers to buy health insurance directly from the federal government. It's proposed in most cases to ensure there are choices for buyers in places where only one insurance company offers policies through the Obamacare exchanges.\n\nAn analysis of Clinton's plan by the Commonwealth Fund, a private foundation that supports independent health care research, concludes it would boost the number of people with health insurance by about 400,000. But the impact on the federal deficit is unclear: The report says it could range from a small decline to an increase of as much as $90 billion.\n\nThe Commonwealth analysis doesn't account for Clinton's proposal to allow people to buy in to Medicare at 55 rather than waiting until 65. That could reduce premiums for younger people who buy insurance through the ACA exchanges but would increase the cost of Medicare, says Joe Antos, a scholar at the American Enterprise Institute.\n\nShe says 'buy in' because that disguises the fact that there has to be more taxpayer money in the subsidy to work, Antos says.\n\nIf the House remains under Republican control, there's little to no chance the public option or Medicare buy-in will become law.\n\nDONALD TRUMP\n\nEnlarge this image Evan Vucci/AP Evan Vucci/AP\n\nRepeal and replace Obamacare\n\nPromote tax-free health savings accounts\n\nMake insurance premiums tax-deductible\n\nAllow insurers to sell policies across state lines\n\nTurn Medicaid into a state block grant program\n\nAllow consumers to import drugs from other developed countries\n\nTrump, like most Republicans, says he wants to repeal Obamacare, but he hasn't offered many details about what will happen to the 20 million people who will lose their insurance if that happens. In a speech this week, his running mate, Mike Pence, said Obamacare subsidies would be phased out so consumers could have a smoother transition to new insurance.\n\nTo buy that insurance, Trump wants to expand the use of health savings accounts, which allow people to save money tax-free to pay for health care costs. He also says allowing insurance companies to sell policies across state lines will cut costs, a notion economists question.\n\nThe Commonwealth Fund analysis says Trump's proposal would increase the number of people without insurance by as many as 25 million.\n\nAs with Clinton's plan, the estimates of this plan's impact on the budget is a big range, from no impact to an increase of as much as $41 billion. That's because much of his plan involves tax breaks to encourage people to buy insurance, while taking away the requirement to buy that's embedded in the Affordable Care Act.
News Brief: Democrats On Health Care; Interest Rate Cut Expected\n\nAs 10 Democratic presidential candidates debated Tuesday night, health care dominated the first hour. Another 10 will meet on stage tonight. Also, the Fed is expected to cut interest rates today.\n\nDAVID GREENE, HOST:\n\nWhen Democratic presidential candidates gathered for a debate last night, the location really meant a lot.\n\nSTEVE INSKEEP, HOST:\n\nTen Democrats were on stage in a historic theater in Detroit, which is in Michigan, a swing state - one of three states the Democrats were really counting on that voted for Donald Trump in 2016 and assured his election. A big question for Democrats is how to win back the likes of Michigan. And last night's 10 candidates - the first of two sets of 10 - spent much time debating how far left to go on issues like health care.\n\nLet's hear three of the candidates now. The first is Montana Governor Steve Bullock, a centrist who notes that some of his rivals want to go much farther than Obamacare.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF MONTAGE)\n\nSTEVE BULLOCK: It used to be just Republicans wanted to repeal and replace, now many Democrats do as well.\n\nPETE BUTTIGIEG: If we embrace a far-left agenda, they're going to say we're a bunch of crazy socialists. If we embrace a conservative agenda - you know what they're going to do? They're going to say we're a bunch of crazy socialists...\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nBUTTIGIEG: ...So let's just stand up for the right policy, go out there and defend it.\n\nMARIANNE WILLIAMSON: And I've heard some people here tonight - I almost wonder why you're Democrats. You seem to think there's something wrong about using...\n\n(CHEERING)\n\nWILLIAMSON: ...About using the instruments of government to help people.\n\nINSKEEP: The candidates following Steve Bullock there are South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg and author Marianne Williamson.\n\nGREENE: NPR political correspondent Asma Khalid is in Detroit. She covered the debate last night. Hi, Asma.\n\nASMA KHALID, BYLINE: Good morning.\n\nGREENE: First, how awesome is the Fox Theater? I had some of my wedding photos taken outside of it...\n\nKHALID: Oh, my gosh. It's the most beautiful...\n\nGREENE: ...It's gorgeous, right?\n\nKHALID: Yeah - beautiful, beautiful architecture.\n\nGREENE: Yeah, what a setting. Well, a lot happened there last night. I guess for the Democratic Party, there was no hiding from real divisions between progressives and moderates. How did that all emerge?\n\nKHALID: That's right. That was the overarching theme of the night. And I would say we saw it play out in terms of multiple public policy fronts, most notably health care and immigration. And, you know, these are two issues that are going to animate the debate and the general election as well between Democrats and Republicans. One big applause line around this clash came from Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren. It was in response to former Maryland Congressman John Delaney when he said that Democrats win when they run on, quote, real solutions, not impossible promises.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nELIZABETH WARREN: You know, I don't understand why anybody goes to all the trouble of running for president of the United States just to talk about what we really can't do and shouldn't fight for.\n\n(CHEERING)\n\nKHALID: You know, David, there was a lot of pre-debate chatter about a potential clash between two progressive icons - that's Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders and Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren. But they did not fight last night. In fact, they tag teamed on progressive policies all night as they fended off attacks from some of the more moderate candidates.\n\nGREENE: Wow. I just think about some of the issues you were talking about. Another that comes to mind is climate change, which is something a lot of Democratic voters are passionate about. Did that emerge as an issue where there are some divisions?\n\nKHALID: You know, David, I would say, not surprisingly, to some degree, the Democrats were fairly in agreement on climate change. It is a top issue, you know, when we look at polling consistently among Democratic voters. But the conversation last night really tried to focus and bring it back to jobs and how you address climate change in a really economically feasible way.\n\nGREENE: One of the really interesting dynamics going into last night was the lineup for last night and then tonight - it's a random draw by CNN. But all of the candidates on stage last night were white, right? And, you know, President Trump has really put racial divisions front and center in this campaign recently. So how did an entire field of white candidates deal with issues of race and racism?\n\nKHALID: Well, you know, also noteworthy to me, this conversation was happening in Detroit. And Democrats on the campaign trail talk a lot about how you win back the White House. Do you try to persuade centrist voters? Or do you really energize the base? - most notably, African Americans. And I will say, given the conversation being in Detroit, we did not hear extensively about race - even, you know, given the comments that Donald Trump has made in the last couple of weeks.\n\nThe way that the moderators focused the conversation, I was - even the discussion around immigration, was largely through the lens of the concerns of white suburban voters, right? Is decriminalizing the border, say, going too far? It was not necessarily through the lens of some of the concerns that I hear from Latino voters. That being said, we have a far more diverse field tonight. And so I anticipate we will hear a lot more about racial justice, criminal justice issues.\n\nINSKEEP: OK. So we heard that there were big divisions on some big issues. Let's talk about what some of those divisions are in a little more granular way. NPR political reporter Danielle Kurtzleben was up very late last night but has come back in early this morning, as Asma did as well. Danielle, good morning.\n\nDANIELLE KURTZLEBEN, BYLINE: Hey, Steve.\n\nINSKEEP: So what is the difference on health insurance between a centrist Democrat and a more progressive one?\n\nKURTZLEBEN: Well, as it was framed last night, the difference was Medicare for All versus not Medicare for All...\n\nBULLOCK: OK.\n\nKURTZLEBEN: ...It was a very sort of blunt, black-and-white discussion that eluded - in which they sort of alluded a lot of the details. Maybe I'll - I'll highlight one memorable exchange between Senator Bernie Sanders and Ohio Representative Tim Ryan, where Sanders made his ownership of Medicare for All really clear.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nBERNIE SANDERS: Medicare for All is comprehensive. It covers all health care needs. For senior citizens, it will finally include dental care, hearing aids and eyeglasses...\n\nTIM RYAN: But you don't know...\n\nSANDERS: ...Second of all...\n\nRYAN: You don't know that, Bernie.\n\nSANDERS: ...Second of all...\n\nJAKE TAPPER: We'll come to you in a second, Congressman.\n\nSANDERS: I do know it. I wrote the damn bill.\n\n(CHEERING)\n\nINSKEEP: OK.\n\nKURTZLEBEN: Yeah. A spicier exchange of the night there. But, yeah. I mean, listen; it's unsurprising that Medicare for All dominated. But it's still important to talk about because you had some real significant other policy differences on that stage. But they didn't really get to a lot of these policy differences because they spent a lot of time talking about Medicare for All. And one other really important thing that I want to bring up in response to your question about moderate versus progressive is that it's really notable to step back and realize that just 10 years ago a public option was - couldn't get into Obamacare...\n\nINSKEEP: Sure.\n\nKURTZLEBEN: ...And now public option is the moderate position...\n\nINSKEEP: That's the minimum.\n\nKURTZLEBEN: Yeah.\n\nINSKEEP: The minimum is the government is going to get into the health insurance business more directly. And the question is whether private insurers get to be in the field as well or whether they get knocked out.\n\nKURTZLEBEN: Right.\n\nINSKEEP: There's also a question about trade and tariffs, which, of course, President Trump has made a big deal. How are Democrats positioning themselves on that issue?\n\nKURTZLEBEN: It's really impossible to generalize because this is an area where you can have a really big rift among Democrats. I mean, the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which, of course, Trump has pulled America out of, it's a giant trade deal among - that would have been among 11 nations plus the U.S. - now U.S. no longer. That's something that Obama negotiated. Last night, you had former Maryland Rep. John Delaney saying he supports it. Well, the two people at the center of the stage, Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, were two of the most vocal opponents of that. Not only that, but Donald Trump was a vocal opponent of that.\n\nINSKEEP: Sure.\n\nKURTZLEBEN: So if you got one of those two on the debate stage with Donald Trump, you can imagine that there would have to be some sort of nuanced discussion of, OK, you all - you both opposed TPP. What exactly do you oppose about it and how do you differ?\n\nGREENE: No rest for the weary. Another round tonight that we'll all be covering. Asma, you're in Detroit. What are you looking for on night two?\n\nKHALID: Yeah. The main concern - or the main concern, I would say, for folks here, it would be Joe Biden. And that is a concern for him of how he fends off some attacks. He did not have a particularly strong night last time during the debates.\n\nGREENE: All right. NPR's Asma Khalid in Detroit and Danielle Kurtzleben in Washington, D.C. Thank you both.\n\nKURTZLEBEN: Thank you.\n\nKHALID: You're welcome.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)\n\nGREENE: All right. So today, the Federal Reserve might do something it has not done since the 2008 recession.\n\nINSKEEP: The Fed is expected to announce it is cutting interest rates. This is a bit unusual. Normally, when the economy has grown for years, as it has - we've got about a decade of economic growth - you would expect the Fed to be raising rates or holding them steady. Recently, though, Fed officials have said there are areas of concern in an overall strong economy. Lower interest rates would make it cheaper for Americans to do things like borrow on their credit cards or take out car loans.\n\nGREENE: NPR's Scott Horsley covers economics and, among other things, keeps a close eye on the Fed and joins us on the line this morning. Hi, Scott.\n\nSCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: Good morning, David.\n\nGREENE: All right. So let's talk this through. The Fed raised rates as recently as December of last year - not so long ago. So what warning signs are Fed officials seeing that might make them go in the opposite direction now?\n\nHORSLEY: We're definitely seeing a slowdown in economic growth both here in the U.S. and around the world. Just last Friday, we learned that the U.S. economy grew at an annual rate of only 2.1% in the spring. That's down from about 3.1% in the first three months of the year. We also learned that last year's economic growth was actually slower than initially reported. At the same time, we're seeing slowing growth overseas, partly as a result of rising trade tensions.\n\nAnd inflation, which is often sort of the boogeyman for the Fed, is safely trussed up under the bed. So there's no signal of runaway price hikes. What that means is the Fed is ready to goose the economy in an effort to keep this decade-old expansion going a little longer. The Fed chairman, Jerome Powell, has noted that it's only recently that a lot of Americans have begun to enjoy the fruits of that expansion.\n\nSo if the old joke about the Fed is they take away the punchbowl just as the party is getting started - Powell and his colleagues seem to feel like, you know, there are a lot of thirsty people who've been waiting in line for the punch. Let's bring out some more punch.\n\nGREENE: Well, I mean, lower interest rates, I mean, as Steve said, can make things cheaper for Americans to do stuff. So, I mean, how do consumers in general react to a decision like this?\n\nHORSLEY: Yeah. It could mean cheaper credit card rates. It could mean cheaper car loans. But here's the thing, David. You know, consumer spending is actually already pretty strong. It's not a lack of consumer spending that's slowing the economy. Instead, what we have seen is a drop in things like business investment. And that may or may not respond to such a modest reduction in what are already, you know, very low interest rates.\n\nGREENE: Could it actually have a negative impact? I mean, what do some economists see as a negative impact of cutting rates like this?\n\nHORSLEY: You know, it could mean lower interest rates for savings - on savings accounts and CDs, so it's not so good for people who actually have money in the bank. Of course, a lot of big banks are already paying next to nothing on savings accounts. But there are some attractive offers out there. I was looking at some internet banks that were paying north of 2% on savings. And, you know, even if that were to go down by, say, a quarter percentage point, that would still be outpacing inflation.\n\nGREENE: Scott, remind me about President Trump's role here. I mean, he's done things that other presidents have not done in terms of his open and very passionate criticism of the Fed. How does that all potentially fit into this?\n\nHORSLEY: He has been loudly jawboning the Fed to cut rates in a big way. He was complaining just yesterday that both the economy and the stock market would be higher still had the Fed not raised interest rates on four separate occasions last year. As you say, a lot of presidents in the past have complained quietly and privately about the Fed's moves. But President Trump has been very vocal...\n\nGREENE: Not like this.\n\nHORSLEY: No. Now, the Fed insists they are going to be guided by economic signals, not political pressure. But that said, Trump's own trade policies have certainly contributed to slowing economic growth and that, in turn, is prompting the Fed to make these moves. So indirectly, the president's having an influence, even if it's not for the reasons he'd like.\n\nGREENE: All right. Scott, thanks so much for explaining all this. We always appreciate it.\n\nHORSLEY: You're welcome.\n\nGREENE: That's NPR's Scott Horsley.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF EVIL NEEDLE'S VIBIN')\n\nCopyright © 2019 NPR. All rights reserved.

Looking Back On The Many Times The Affordable Care Act Has Been Challenged\n\nThe Affordable Care Act is on trial again — this time at a federal appeals court in Louisiana. It's the latest in a string of challenges to the healthcare overhaul since President Obama signed it.\n\nARI SHAPIRO, HOST:\n\nToday, the Affordable Care Act is on trial again, this time at a federal appeals court in Louisiana. It's the latest in a string of challenges to the health care overhaul ever since President Obama signed it into law.\n\nAUDIE CORNISH, HOST:\n\nThe biggest legal challenge was filed immediately after the law passed in March of 2010.

Can Biden Expand Obamacare Without A Majority In The Senate?\n\nNPR's Rachel Martin talks to Kathleen Sebelius, who helped implement the Affordable Care Act while serving as secretary of Health and Human Services from 2009-2014, about the future of Obamacare.\n\nRACHEL MARTIN, HOST:\n\nPresident-elect Joe Biden is moving forward. And part of that means explaining how he wants to improve the Affordable Care Act. Here's what he said in a speech yesterday.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nJOE BIDEN: Beginning on January 20, the Vice President-elect Harris and I, we're going to do everything in our power to ease the burden of health care on you and your families. I promise you that.\n\nMARTIN: But before Joe Biden can try to do that, the Supreme Court has to decide if the Affordable Care Act is even going to survive. Yesterday, during oral arguments, Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Brett Kavanaugh seemed to indicate that they would vote to preserve most of the law. But the court has yet to give its final decision. Joining us now is Kathleen Sebelius. She was the governor of Kansas from 2003 to 2009. She also served as the secretary of Health and Human Services under President Obama. And she was instrumental in the implementation of the ACA in its early days. Secretary Sebelius, thank you so much for joining us.\n\nKATHLEEN SEBELIUS: Great to be with you, Rachel.\n\nMARTIN: So I guess, first off, I would ask you about that remark that the vice president just made. I don't have to tell you that President Obama had a heck of a time getting the Affordable Care Act through. How can President-elect Biden expect to expand the ACA without a majority in the Senate?\n\nSEBELIUS: Well, I think, Rachel, the ACA, in many ways, was on the ballot in 2020. And one of the reasons that Vice President Biden will be sworn in as the next president of the United States is that people voted for health care. People made it clear over the last 10 years that the ACA has been the law of the land, that they don't want to lose their health coverage. They don't want to lose their insurance. And, in fact, Americans now, unlike the time when President Obama was trying to pass the law, widely believe that preexisting condition should be protected and that all Americans deserve health care. That's a huge step forward.\n\nMARTIN: At this point, do you think expanding the ACA will mean pushing for a public option?\n\nSEBELIUS: Well, it's certainly something that I think President Biden will propose. He said all during the campaign that that was his plan. It is something that we tried to put in the law 10 years ago. There were not enough Democratic votes even though there were 60 Democrats in the Senate. I think, 10 years later, there's very little question that having a public option as a competitor to the private health plans offered in the marketplace would actually give people a lower-cost choice.\n\nMARTIN: I mean, we'll see what happens in the Georgia runoffs - right? - in terms of control of the Senate. But when it comes to Republicans who viewed the public option, as some people called it, a threat to the current health care system, do you think any of those minds have been changed?\n\nSEBELIUS: Well, I would hope that people have paid attention in the last 10 years. The public option is a choice that people would have between privately offered health plan in the private market and a more government-like plan, which can dramatically lower administrative costs. You know, Rachel, we have exactly that same setup in Medicare. And what we know is Medicare right now can deliver benefit packages at a two to 3% administrative cost. Most private insurance companies are in the 15 to 20% level. So you get exactly the same benefits, you're just not paying huge administrative costs. And the dollars can be spent on health care and improving people's health.\n\nMARTIN: I want to ask you about the case before the Supreme Court. I mean, this case has Democrats, liberals worried that the conservative court would strike down the ACA. But even the conservative justices suggested that the case itself isn't strong. What's your response to that? And are you confident the ACA, as a result of what the justices are intimating right now, will remain the law of the land?\n\nSEBELIUS: Well, I certainly hope they will follow what seems to be the pretty universal sentiment among lawyers who have looked at this case, that it's a very weak case. I hope the Supreme Court doesn't try to legislate from the bench. Congress actually left the law in place as they got rid of the individual mandate. So the law has been in operation for 2 1/2 years since the mandate was gone. The argument that somehow the law can't stand without the mandate has been proven to be false for the last 2 1/2 years.\n\nMARTIN: I want to pivot, if I could, and ask you about the state of the pandemic. I mean, you understand the perspective of the federal government as the former secretary of Health and Human Services. You were also a governor. What do you think needs to happen to make sure that, moving forward, there is a more coordinated response between states and the federal government, which has been so lacking for the past nine months?\n\nSEBELIUS: So I think Joe Biden is doing exactly what governors would expect him to do, starting with clear, scientifically driven communication, a very clear idea that the federal government will gather and distribute protective equipment needed by the states, a very transparent process for mobilizing a national vaccination campaign, an equitable look at how the distribution system will go. Then a governor can respond to that plan. But right now, they are really on their own. And I think they will welcome a framework that has been traditionally how we operate in a disaster. The state does whatever they can, but then calls the federal government for help that they can't possibly provide within their own state.\n\nMARTIN: Kathleen Sebelius, former governor of Kansas. And she also served as the secretary of Health and Human Services from 2009 to 2014 under President Obama. Thank you so much for talking with us. We so appreciate it.\n\nSEBELIUS: Thanks very much for having me.\n\nCopyright © 2020 NPR. All rights reserved.

Views Of The Election: Reconciling Values, Votes In Raleigh, N.C.\n\nNorth Carolina's most prosperous area is experiencing a housing boom, and population is on the rise. But voters here say it's more than just economic issues that will determine their vote next week.\n\nSTEVE INSKEEP, HOST:\n\nThis election looks very different from the top and the bottom of the economy. We saw that when visiting the richest county and the poorest county in North Carolina, which is a presidential swing state. The poorest is a rural zone. We visit elsewhere on today's program.\n\nThe richest is Wake County, where the median household income is $66,000, far above that of the nation as a whole.\n\nTODD MASINTER: And we're going to make our way out of here and go explore some of Raleigh...\n\nINSKEEP: Todd Masinter was our tour guide through the state capitol, which is Wake County's largest city. We joined a tour group riding two-wheeled Segway scooters downtown.\n\nMASINTER: Watch your wheels. There's a small pothole here to your right.\n\nINSKEEP: We're rolling past a restaurant. We're actually going through the outdoor tables on these Segway scooters.\n\nMASINTER: We are in the middle of a massive housing boom right now. Behind you, if you're feeling comfortable, pivot around - it's a 22-story sky house apartment building. That's brand new.\n\nINSKEEP: This old city, with its buildings from before the Civil War, is also part of a region filled with new tech firms and universities. Businesses all over Wake County share in that prosperity, like the rock climbing gyms co-owned by Joel Graybeal.\n\nWow. How high is the ceiling in here?\n\nJOEL GRAYBEAL: So the tall walls go to 55 feet.\n\nINSKEEP: And there is someone very near the top, climbing up a vertical...\n\nGRAYBEAL: There is someone quite near the top.\n\nINSKEEP: Graybeal is one of many people who've moved from elsewhere to the Research Triangle region. He was a banker and then changed careers.\n\nIf you're looking across the country, what would make Raleigh the smart place to open a business?\n\nGRAYBEAL: Lots of smart people.\n\nINSKEEP: He says his customers include engineers and software designers.\n\nGRAYBEAL: This sport appeals to them because it's not just the physical aspects of the sport. It's the mental and the problem solving aspects.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MAN: All right, you got it. Let's go for it. Oh, [expletive].\n\nINSKEEP: When asked to name the area's problems, Graybeal mentions traffic. That's a symptom of Wake County's rapid population growth.\n\nYet for all the positive signs, Graybeal is not entirely satisfied. He's bracing for higher insurance costs. His small business offers health benefits to employees. And if he continues that, he says, Obamacare will soon require him to change to a more expensive plan.\n\nGRAYBEAL: Our insurance carrier today told me that our rate, if we were on an ACA-compliant plan today, Steve, 70 percent increase in premium.\n\nINSKEEP: Seventy, seven-zero?\n\nGRAYBEAL: Seven-zero percent increase.\n\nINSKEEP: Graybeal told us he'd rather not reveal how he's voting this fall. He has business associates and relatives on both sides. That is one way that North Carolina's richest county resembles the poorest. In both places we found people who grew anxious when discussing politics.\n\nWhen you come from the poorest county in North Carolina to this county, the wealthiest, you just notice the signs of prosperity everywhere. We're on the campus of North Carolina State University, lovely tree-lined campus. The parking lots are jammed. And early voting is underway just up the way here in this building.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #1: You have ID?\n\nUNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #2: Yes.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #1: OK.\n\nINSKEEP: This is a line. I mean, this is going to be a little while.\n\nDuring the half-hour wait, we talked with three NC State seniors.\n\nWhat do you guys want to do when you graduate?\n\nUNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #3: We're figuring that out (laughter).\n\nUNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #4: Yeah. We're seniors.\n\nINSKEEP: The voters wore Hillary Clinton stickers. They were Taylor Jones, Anna Arroyo and Kelly Hillsgrove, who's voted one time before.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #5: This time I feel like I've really made this decision myself.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #3: We've watched all the debates together.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #5: We've been really informed and really made this decision for ourselves without letting each other influence us or our friends or family.\n\nINSKEEP: What difference does it make if there's a woman president?\n\nUNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #3: It opens a lot of doors for us.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #5: And honestly, I mean, I'm not voting for Hillary because she's a woman. I mean, she's the most experienced candidate. And, yeah, I agree with everything she wants to do.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #4: She's moving forward instead of back.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #5: Yeah. It's just moving forward, like, it's...\n\nUNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #4: I think you got to move forward and you got to stay progressive. And there's only one that really does that.\n\nINSKEEP: You mean Trump seems backward-looking to you?\n\nUNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #4: Yes.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #5: Absolutely.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #3: I think we would be going back in time.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #4: He wants a wall. You don't do that anymore (laughter).\n\nUNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #3: I was born in Mexico so that, to me, is just absolutely absurd. There's just no - there's just no way I could ever vote for somebody so backwards.\n\nINSKEEP: So many younger people have moved to Wake County that it's median age is now 35, below that of the nation as a whole. Younger voters helped to explain why the county has voted Democratic for president in recent years.\n\nIt is an open question though how big the county margin could be in 2016. Near the university, we met people who embrace their changing home but are also conservative and must now decide.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED TRAIN CONDUCTOR: All right. Everybody ready to go on a train ride?\n\nUNIDENTIFIED CROWD: Yeah.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED TRAIN CONDUCTOR: All aboard.\n\nINSKEEP: Step across the tracks of the kids-size train in Raleigh's Pullen Park...\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF TRAIN WHISTLE)\n\nINSKEEP: ...And you arrive at a playground, which is where we met Justin and Sarah Leonard. They had a 3-year-old son and a newborn in a stroller under a blanket.\n\nHow old's the baby in there?\n\nSARAH LEONARD: He is just over a week old.\n\nINSKEEP: Oh, my goodness. Wow.\n\nLAUREN MIGAKI, BYLINE: Oh, my gosh. Congratulations.\n\nINSKEEP: That's our producer Lauren Migaki. Justin pushed the older child on a swing as we talked. The Leonards are young and religious.\n\nS LEONARD: We struggled with infertility for several years, and I just think that life begins at conception.\n\nINSKEEP: They're also part of Wake County's high-tech economy. Justin is a patent lawyer whose clients are often from Europe.\n\nYou're part of the global economy.\n\nJUSTIN LEONARD: Oh, that's very, very true.\n\nINSKEEP: Which is part of his struggle with the presidential election. He's not sure he can rely on Donald Trump in foreign relations...\n\nJ LEONARD: To be respectful of the other nations involved and, frankly, any other people involved.\n\nS LEONARD: He brings Trump up specifically because we've always voted Republican for president in the past. And this is our first year that we're really still not quite sure how we're going to vote on Tuesday (laughter).\n\nINSKEEP: They might cast a third party vote as a protest. Or they might just vote for Trump after all.\n\nHillary's not coming up as a choice for you, it doesn't sound like?\n\nS LEONARD: She would not be a choice for us.\n\nINSKEEP: They don't agree with her support for abortion rights. They don't agree with her support for same-sex marriage. They fear their conservative views are becoming less socially acceptable. Yet their views on life, which have made them Republican, also make it harder to vote for Trump.\n\nS LEONARD: That is one of our struggles with Trump, that he is pro-life but his view of refugees and immigration doesn't really feel like it's valuing life to me because those are people, too. And to not care for people that are trying to escape war is just - it's falling flat on valuing life.\n\nINSKEEP: North Carolina's most prosperous county has taken in hundreds of refugees, including some from Syria. The Leonards don't view them as much of a threat. Once their newborn is older, they say they plan to volunteer to help refugees. Before that, they must make the agonizing decision of how to reconcile their values with their votes.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)\n\nINSKEEP: So that's the richest and the poorest county in a swing state.

More Than Politics On The Line For Voters With Preexisting Conditions\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Lynne Sladky/AP Lynne Sladky/AP\n\nIn swing states from Georgia to Arizona, the Affordable Care Act — and concerns over protecting preexisting conditions — loom over key races for Congress and the presidency.\n\nI can't even believe it's in jeopardy, says Noshin Rafieei, a 36-year-old from Phoenix. The people that are trying to eliminate the protection for individuals such as myself with preexisting conditions, they must not understand what it's like.\n\nIn 2016, Rafieei was diagnosed with colon cancer. A year later, her doctor discovered it had spread to her liver.\n\nI was taking oral chemo, morning and night — just imagine that's your breakfast, essentially, and your dinner, Rafieei says.\n\nIn February, she underwent a liver transplant.\n\nRafieei does have health insurance now through her employer, but she fears whether her medical history could disqualify her from getting care in the future.\n\nI had to pray that my insurance would approve of my transplant just in the nick of time, she says. I had that Stage 4 label attached to my name and that has dollar signs. Who wants to invest in someone with Stage 4?\n\nThat is no way to feel, she adds.\n\nAfter doing her research, Rafieei says she intends to vote for Joe Biden, who helped get the ACA passed in this first place.\n\nHealth care for me is just the driving factor, she says.\n\nEven 10 years after the Affordable Care Act locked in a health care protection that Americans now overwhelmingly support — guarantees that insurers cannot deny coverage or charge more based on preexisting medical conditions — voters once again face contradicting campaign promises over which candidate will preserve the law's legacy.\n\nA majority of Democrats, independents and Republicans say they want their new president to preserve the ACA's provision that protects as many as 135 million people from potentially being unable to get health care because of their medical history.\n\nPresident Trump has pledged to keep this in place, even as his administration heads to the U.S Supreme Court the week after Election Day to argue the entire law should be struck down.\n\nWe'll always protect people with preexisting, Trump said in the most recent debate. I'd like to terminate Obamacare, come up with a brand new, beautiful health care.\n\nAnd yet the Trump administration has not unveiled a health care plan or identified any specific components it might include. In 2017, the administration joined with congressional Republicans to dismantle the Affordable Care Act, but none of the GOP-backed replacement plans could summon enough votes. The Republicans' final attempt, a limited skinny repeal of parts of the ACA, failed in the Senate because of resistance within their own party.\n\nIn an attempt to reassure wary voters, Trump recently signed an executive order that asserts protections for preexisting conditions will stay in place, but legal experts say this has no teeth.\n\nIt's basically a pinky promise, but it doesn't have teeth, says Swapna Reddy, a clinical assistant professor at Arizona State University's College of Health Solutions. What is the enforceability? The order really doesn't have any effect because it can't regulate the insurance industry.\n\nSince the 2017 repeal and replace efforts, the health care law has continued to gain popularity.\n\nPublic approval is now at an all-time high, but polling shows many Republicans still don't view the ACA as synonymous with its most popular provision — protections for preexisting conditions.\n\nDemocrats hope to change that.\n\nIf you have a preexisting condition — heart disease, diabetes, breast cancer — they are coming for you, said Biden's running mate, California Sen. Kamala Harris, during her recent debate with Vice President Pence.\n\nVoters support maintaining ACA's legal protections\n\nIn key swing states, many voters say protecting preexisting conditions is their top health concern.\n\nRafieei, the Phoenix woman with colon cancer, still often has problems getting her treatments covered. Her insurance has denied medications that help quell the painful side effects of chemotherapy or complications related to her transplant.\n\nDuring those chemo days, I'd think, wow, I'm really sick, and I just got off the phone with my pharmacy and they're denying me something that could possibly help me, she says.\n\nBecause of her transplant, she will be on medication for the rest of her life, and sometimes she even has nightmares about being away and running out of it.\n\nI will have these panic attacks like, 'Where's my medicine? Oh my god, I have to get back to get my medicine?'\n\nElection season and talk of eliminating the ACA has not given Rafieei much reassurance, though.\n\nI cannot stomach politics. I am beyond terrified, she says.\n\nAnd yet she plans to head to the polls — in person — despite having a compromised immune system.\n\nIt might be a long day. But you know what? I want to fix whatever I can, she says.\n\nA few days after she votes, she'll get a coronavirus test and go in for another round of surgery.\n\nA key health issue in political swing states\n\nRafieei's home state of Arizona is emblematic of the political contradictions around the health care law.\n\nThe Republican-led state reaped the benefits of the ACA. Arizona's uninsured rate dropped considerably since 2010, in part because it expanded Medicaid.\n\nBut the state's governor also embraced the Republican effort to repeal and replace the law in 2017, and now Arizona's attorney general is part of the lawsuit that will be heard by the Supreme Court on Nov. 10 that could topple the entire law.\n\nDepending on how the Supreme Court rules, ASU's Reddy says any meaningful replacement for preexisting conditions would involve Congress and the next president.\n\nAt the moment, we have absolutely no national replacement plan, she says.\n\nMeanwhile, some states have passed their own laws to maintain protections for preexisting conditions, in the event the ACA is struck down. But Reddy says those vary considerably from state to state.\n\nFor example, Arizona's law, passed just earlier this year, only prevents insurers from outright denying coverage — consumers with preexisting conditions can be charged more.\n\nWe are in this season of chaos around the Affordable Care Act, says Reddy. From a consumer perspective, it's really hard to decipher all these details.\n\nAs in the congressional midterm election of 2018, Democrats are hammering away at Republican's track record on preexisting conditions and the ACA.\n\nIn Arizona, Mark Kelly, the Democratic candidate running for Senate, has run ads and used every opportunity to remind voters of Republican Sen. Martha McSally's votes to repeal the law.\n\nIn Georgia, Democratic challenger Jon Ossoff has taken a similar approach.\n\nCan you look down the camera and tell the people of this state why you voted four times to allow insurance companies to deny us health care coverage because we may suffer from diabetes or heart disease or have cancer in remission? Ossoff said during a debate with his opponent, Republican Sen. David Purdue.\n\nRepublicans have often tried to skirt health care as a major issue this election cycle because there isn't the same political advantage to pushing the repeal and replace argument, says Mark Peterson, a professor of public policy, political science and law at UCLA.\n\nIt's political suicide, there doesn't seem to be any real political advantage anymore, says Peterson.\n\nBut the timing of the Supreme Court case — exactly a week after election day — has somewhat obscured the issue for voters.\n\nRepublicans have chipped away at the health care law by reducing the individual mandate — the provision requiring consumers to purchase insurance — to zero dollars.\n\nThe premise of the Supreme Court case is that the ACA no longer qualifies as a tax because of this change in the penalty.\n\nIt is an extraordinary stretch, even among many conservative legal scholars, to say that the entire law is predicated on the existence of an enforced individual mandate, says Peterson.\n\nThe court could rule in a very limited way that does not disrupt the entire law or protections for preexisting conditions, he says.\n\nLike many issues this election, Peterson says there is a big disconnect between what voters in the two parties believe is at stake with the ACA.\n\nNot everybody, particularly Republicans, associates the ACA with protecting preexisting conditions, he says. But it is pretty striking that overwhelmingly Democrats and Independents do — and a number of Republicans — that's enough to give a significant national supermajority.\n\nThis story is part of NPR's health reporting partnership with Kaiser Health News.
Week In Politics\n\nLULU GARCIA-NAVARRO, HOST:\n\nSpecial counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian election interference took a dramatic turn this past week with former national security adviser Michael Flynn pleading guilty to lying to the FBI and publicly vowing to cooperate with Mueller. Meanwhile, the GOP overhaul of the tax code is now rocketing toward the president's desk - two very different and very important stories. And joining me now to talk about them is Heather Timmons, White House correspondent for Quartz. Good morning.\n\nHEATHER TIMMONS: Good morning.\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: And Michael Warren, senior writer at The Weekly Standard. Welcome.\n\nMICHAEL WARREN: Good morning.\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: All right. Flipping Flynn. Let's start with that. Is this on par with indicting former Trump campaign chairman Manafort, or is this a huge new trophy and a huge new face for the Mueller investigation? Let's start with you, Heather.\n\nTIMMONS: Well, the Manafort - accusations against Manafort having to do with money laundering are one thing. But if you read Flynn's statement of offense, what it seems to show is that there was a coordinated effort among the Trump transition team to talk to Russia about sanctions and to talk to them and to contradict what a sitting President Obama's foreign policy was. And so it is really a completely separate matter and a lot more serious.\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: Right. And..\n\nWARREN: Yeah, I agree. And I think that it's even bigger than the guilty plea that Mike Flynn agreed to. This is somebody who was at every step of the way with Trump in the campaign, in the transition and then for 25 days in the White House. That's a big - a wide berth of information that Mike Flynn may have. I think we're so focused on what happened at the end of December 2016 and the transition and whether or not - and what Mike Flynn lied about to the FBI - that we're - that we can sort of forget that there's a lot of other things that he could be telling and talking to Mueller about and continuing to talk to Mueller about. And this is implicating not just the campaign, the transition but also figures in the White House, as well.\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: Figures in the White House. The president has, of course, reacted. He's been on a tweet tear this morning. But yesterday, what's getting a lot of focus is his tweet - or to be precise, the president's account showed a tweet - stating that he fired Flynn for lying to the vice president but also for lying to the FBI. There's been a lot of speculation that part of the tweet would indicate Trump knew Flynn had lied to law enforcement and still tried to protect him from prosecution. Do you think this is significant?\n\nTIMMONS: Well, I think the fact that the White House came out afterwards and is telling people that that tweet was drafted by a lawyer shows that they think it's significant. And the fact that they would try to use a lawyer - and the lawyer that they're referencing is a real veteran guy. And the idea that he would use that kind of sloppy language is sort of unfathomable. So obviously, the White House thinks this is important.\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: All right. And Michael.\n\nWARREN: No, I think that every step of the way, the president has tried to protect Mike Flynn. And then when it became - what? - this was late January, early February of this year. When it became untenable, then the blame began with Mike Flynn lied to the vice president. I think this is something we have to think about as being less strategic and more situational from the president - the president seeing another way for him to put distance between himself.\n\nHe can't say, as he did with George Papadopoulos in that guilty plea, this was just a coffee boy. Mike Flynn is no coffee boy. And so putting any distance he can between himself - it's entirely situational. The White House is trying to clean it up because I think they realize the implications of it legally could be problematic. So - but and the way...\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: And clearly, he is not listening to his lawyers. I mean, this cannot...\n\nWARREN: Right.\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: ...Be good for him to keep on tweeting this way. I'm going to turn to taxes in the few minutes we have left. The last time we had big changes to the tax code was 1986. If the GOP does successfully merge the House and Senate bills, will this overhaul be as far-reaching as Ronald Reagan's? Michael.\n\nWARREN: It could be. It's also not as far reaching as it could've been. I think the margins for Republicans in the Senate and the problems that they have in their house conference mean that it's not as big as maybe Paul Ryan always dreamed it would be. It could be significant. And it could be in many ways very similar to what Obamacare was for Democrats and the way that legislation didn't go as far as the party wanted it to go but could have far-reaching consequences. It could also be problematic for the Republican Party as Obamacare was for the Democrats.\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: It's unpopular.\n\nWARREN: Yeah, exactly.\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: And we're not sure what it's going to - what exactly this bill's going to look like once it goes into reconciliation. I'm curious, Heather - Democrats were careful to keep their fingerprints off these bills in the House and the Senate, but there may have been parts they could've changed. Was that wise - sort of not engaging in this at all?\n\nTIMMONS: When I talked to Democrats and Democratic aides in Congress, you know, some of them have quietly said that, we're at a point now where my constituency dislikes Trump so much that if I'm shown to be cooperating in any way, that's going to be bad for me in my next election and bad for me at the polls. So maybe. But they made a political calculation that, no matter what, this thing was going to go forward. And they'd rather just not have their fingerprints on it.\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: Do you think that that was a good plan? I mean, do you think the Democrats just sort of washing their hands of the whole thing really is the best move?\n\nWARREN: Probably politically for them. I'm not so sure for the good of the country. There was a perfect example of this in the Mike Lee-Marco Rubio amendment to try to expand the - increase child tax credit to payroll taxpayers - people who are on the lower income scale who don't pay income tax but do pay payroll tax.\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: Right.\n\nWARREN: It would've been the kind of thing to actually drive a wedge. Democrats could have come onboard and maybe even passed that. The fact that they had no interest is probably good politics, but I think it would've been good policy for them to get on board with that. And, of course, for Republicans to do so, I think that's a missed opportunity, actually, for both parties.\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: All right. Michael Warren, senior writer at The Weekly Standard, and Heather Timmons, White House correspondent for Quartz, thank you so much.\n\nTIMMONS: Thank you.\n\nWARREN: Thank you.\n\nCopyright © 2017 NPR.

CBO Predicts Rise In Deficit If Trump Cuts Payments To Insurance Companies\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Melina Mara/The Washington Post/Getty Images Melina Mara/The Washington Post/Getty Images\n\nUpdated 4:31 pm August 16: On Wednesday, the White House said it would continue what's known as cost-sharing reduction payments to insurers for another month, buying President Trump some time to decide whether he'll continue the payments long-term or cut them off altogether.\n\nThe announcement came a day after the Congressional Budget Office released an analysis that found that ending the payments would increase the deficit by $194 billion over 10 years.\n\nThe cost is eye-poppingly large, says Nicholas Bagley, a professor of health law at the University of Michigan. This single policy could effectively end up costing 20 percent of the entire bill of the ACA.\n\nUnder the Affordable Care Act, the federal government reimburses insurance companies for the discounts on copays and deductibles they're required by law to give to low-income customers.\n\nTrump threatened repeatedly to cut off the payments, which he has called bailouts, during the unsuccessful effort by Senate Republicans to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare.\n\nMore recently, the president has remained mute on the topic, and insurers have been left to wonder, month-to-month, whether they will continue to receive the payments. On Wednesday, a White House spokesman said the administration will reimburse insurers for this month's discounts next week. Future payments remain in question.\n\nBagley says there is no good policy reason to cut off the payments. If you can cover roughly the same number of people for about $200 billion less, why wouldn't you want to do that? he asks.\n\nCutting the cost-sharing payments ends up costing the government more because insurance companies say they will raise rates in response.\n\nThe CBO report predicted that premiums for benchmark plans sold on the Affordable Care Act exchanges will rise about 20 percent next year and about 25 percent by 2020. The cost to consumers, however, would stay the same or even decline.\n\nThat's because under the Affordable Care Act, people with lower incomes who buy insurance on the exchanges get a tax credit, so their costs remain stable as a share of their income. When premiums rise, those government subsidies rise as well.\n\nThe CBO says for people with incomes below 200 percent of the federal poverty level, the out-of-pocket cost of insurance would remain about the same because of the bigger tax credits. For those with incomes between 200 percent and 400 percent of the federal poverty level, the cost to buy insurance could actually get cheaper.\n\nLast year, about 85 percent of people who bought Obamacare insurance got a tax credit, according to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.\n\nThe CBO analysis makes clear that ending cost-sharing subsidies would be a perfect example of cutting off your nose to spite your face, says Larry Levitt, a vice president at the Kaiser Family Foundation. Premiums would rise, and the government would end up spending more in the end through tax credits that help people pay their premiums.\n\nThe CBO report confirms earlier analyses, including this one by Kaiser and this one from the consulting firm Oliver Wyman, that suggested eliminating the cost-sharing payments could make policies cheaper for some individuals.\n\nSome insurers may decide to leave the ACA markets altogether if the subsidies were to disappear because of the substantial uncertainty about the effects of the policy on average health care costs, the CBO says. The agency estimates about 5 percent of the population would not have access to insurance through the ACA markets next year if Trump ends the payments.\n\nBut the agency says insurers would come back over the next two years.\n\nTimothy Jost, a professor emeritus of health care law at Washington and Lee University School of Law, says that picture may be a bit too rosy.\n\nHe says the CBO assumes that state insurance commissioners will allow insurance companies to set premiums in ways that would be most advantageous to them, thereby ensuring they continue to sell policies on the Obamacare exchanges. But that may not happen, Jost warns.\n\nCBO assumes that things will work out rationally, and there will be a smooth landing, he says. It could be much more chaotic than that.\n\nLast Friday, the Department of Health and Human Services extended the deadline for insurance companies to decide which health plans to offer on the Obamacare exchanges and what to charge.\n\nThe cost-sharing payments have been at the center of a political battle over the Affordable Care Act since before Trump took office.\n\nHouse Republicans opposed to the health law sued then-President Barack Obama, saying the payments were illegal because Congress hadn't appropriated money for them. A judge agreed but allowed the administration to continue making the payments during an appeal.\n\nNow that Trump is in the White House but GOP efforts to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act have failed, many Republicans are urging the president to continue the payments rather than undermine the health care markets.
Trump Pushes Health Care, Clinton Scandals Despite His Own Looming Court Dates\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Evan Vucci/AP Evan Vucci/AP\n\nDonald Trump is continuing his homestretch campaign strategy of trying to stay on message. As the Clinton campaign also tries to focus on issues and policy in the heat of another FBI investigation, Trump rolled out his health care plan for the country. Noticeably, Hillary Clinton was largely absent from his speech Tuesday in Valley Forge, Pa.\n\nWhen we win on November 8th, he said, and elect a Republican Congress, we will be able to immediately repeal and replace Obamacare. Have to do it. I will ask Congress to convene a special session so we can repeal and replace. And it will be such an honor for me, for you, and for everybody in this country because Obamacare has to be replaced. And we will do it and we will do it very, very quickly. It is a catastrophe.\n\nTrump criticized rising premiums under the Affordable Care Act and took an opportunity to appeal to young voters, where his campaign's support has reached historic lows.\n\nThis is particularly unfair to millennials and younger Americans generally who will be totally crushed by these massive health care costs before they even get started on their journey through life, he said.\n\nThe event was billed as an address on health care but segued into a more standard stump speech. Trump calmly and quickly mentioned his campaign's plans for health savings accounts, Medicaid dollars and family options before moving on to the topics of trade and manufacturing. He also turned to education, pledging to totally eliminate Common Core and bring it local, then praised the concept of vocational training and promised to start it up big league.\n\nBut despite his measured tone in Pennsylvania, Trump hasn't been able to completely resist mentioning the FBI controversy. He spent the morning before his speech tweeting about Crooked Hillary and the email case.\n\nAnd on Monday, Trump used a rally in Michigan to call out Hillary Clinton's top aide, Huma Abedin, and Abedin's estranged husband.\n\nThank you, Huma. Good job, Huma. Thank you, Anthony Weiner, he taunted.\n\nTrump turned the investigation into a campaign pitch. He warned the crowds that, if elected, Clinton would be too distracted by what he called a constitutional crisis to be an effective president.\n\nHow can Hillary manage this country if she cannot even manage her emails? he asked his cheering supporters.\n\nBut Trump himself, who is no stranger to court cases, lawsuits and scandals, has a few legal hurdles in front of him post-election day.\n\nThe fraud case against Trump University is moving forward later this month. Former students allege they were tricked into paying tens of thousands of dollars for real estate courses that ultimately had no teachers, classes or degrees.\n\nAnd the Trump Foundation is still under investigation in New York for impropriety, with Trump reportedly spending money from the foundation on himself and using funds to settle his lawsuits.
Will The Affordable Care Act Survive The Next Supreme Court Challenge?\n\nRepublicans have been trying to drive a stake into the heart of Obamacare pretty much since it was passed — both through legislation and litigation, New York Times reporter Sarah Kliff says.\n\nDAVE DAVIES, HOST:\n\nThis is FRESH AIR. I'm Dave Davies, in today for Terry Gross. One week after the presidential election, the U.S. Supreme Court will hear oral arguments in the latest challenge to the Affordable Care Act. Republicans have sought to put an end to Obamacare through litigation and legislation for most of the 10 years it's been in effect.\n\nThe current legal challenge could be decided by a court with a six-vote conservative majority if President Trump's nominee, Judge Amy Coney Barrett, is confirmed and sworn in by then. All this happens as candidates this fall debate the issue of preserving health insurance for people with preexisting conditions, and President Trump's handling of the COVID-19 pandemic and his own infection are issues in the campaign.\n\nFor insight today, we turn to Sarah Kliff, an investigative reporter for The New York Times who focuses on national health policy. Kliff has been covering the beat for more than 10 years for several media outlets, including Politico, Newsweek, The Washington Post, Vox and now The New York Times. She spoke to me from her home in Washington, D.C.\n\nSarah Kliff, welcome back to FRESH AIR.\n\nSARAH KLIFF: Thank you for having me.\n\nDAVIES: We planned this interview to talk about the Affordable Care Act, but I have to begin by getting your take on the president's experience with COVID-19. There's been so much discussion and criticism of the president's conduct and that of other members of his administration when it comes to, you know, precautions for the coronavirus. What's your take on that?\n\nKLIFF: You know, I think it is certainly the case that when you see some of those photographs from the past weekend of the ceremony for Amy Coney Barrett, other events at the White House, that you do see a lack of distancing, you know, compared to what a lot of Americans have been observing over the past few months and what the CDC has recommended.\n\nAnd I think it is certainly jarring, you know, for someone like me - who hasn't hugged anyone, you know, besides my husband in the past six, seven months - to see, you know, folks freely hugging each other. It's a bit jarring, and it's a bit different from the experience a lot of Americans have been having living through this pandemic.\n\nDAVIES: You and I are speaking on Wednesday morning. There's been a lot of criticism of the president returning to the White House and of some of his messaging. You know, it's - which has been sort of, you know, the - you know, the virus is - you know, I took it on. Don't let it run - rule your life. I mean, how do you think this whole experience might affect Americans' perception of the threat of COVID-19?\n\nKLIFF: Oh, I think it'll definitely affect Americans' perception of the threat of COVID-19, particularly among Trump supporters. You know, he was tweeting on Monday, slightly before his return to the White House, you know, don't be afraid of COVID; don't let it dominate your life. We saw him take off a mask in a pretty public way. And I think one of the things we've learned over the past four years - which, you know, maybe is surprising; maybe isn't - but particularly Trump supporters, they really do take what the president tells them at face value.\n\nYou know, this is slightly separate, but I think it's related. Last week, I reported a story about how President Trump's voters think about his record on preexisting conditions, and most of them think the president will protect preexisting conditions because he constantly says he will in rallies and tweets, on Facebook, when in actuality, his policy record is the complete opposite of that. It's been a lot of work to try and get rid of those consumer protections.\n\nBut I think one of the things that has driven home to me that is a bit applicable here is that the president's supporters, you know, they take what he's saying at face value. We're used to trusting our leaders and assuming that they are not lying to us; they're telling the truth. And I think you will see a number of folks kind of taking Trump's message to heart and, you know, deciding I don't need to be afraid of this because our president isn't afraid of it.\n\nDAVIES: Right. And that would be among his core supporters. Of course, he's in an election where he needs others. How might this affect the views of others - independents, Democrats?\n\nKLIFF: Yeah, I think that's a more challenging, you know, question to answer. We have seen some polling suggesting that there is not much trust in the White House when it comes to President Trump's health condition and the information being put out. So I do think I agree with you, Dave, there - that, you know, this might rally his base and they're going to take to heart what he is saying.\n\nBut I think you do see, out in the real world, a lot of folks support masks. There's widespread support for mask mandates, you know, even across political parties, that this might alienate some folks who are on the fence, who feel like they're living their lives very differently because of the threats of coronavirus and are not seeing the president do the same thing.\n\nDAVIES: So let's talk about the Affordable Care Act, Obamacare, and what remains. You know, in 2017, the penalties associated with the individual mandate were removed, which was, you know, considered a big part of the law. So let's look at what's still standing and what is still in effect. It's still illegal to deny coverage to someone with preexisting conditions. Kids can remain on their health care plans until age 26. That all still in effect?\n\nKLIFF: That is all still in effect.\n\nDAVIES: And what about the minimum requirements for health care plans offered on the exchanges? Has that changed?\n\nKLIFF: That hasn't changed. But I will say one of the things that has changed is the Trump administration has loosened the rules around the sales of what are called short-term health insurance plans. These are plans that typically last less than a year of coverage. And what the Trump administration has done differently than the Obama administration - it has allowed these plans to exist and not cover the minimum benefits. So this means you could have plans that don't cover prescription drugs, don't cover maternity care. Those type of plans were quite common before the Affordable Care Act on the individual market.\n\nAnd so we are seeing, you know, while on the marketplace, on healthcare.gov or the state-run marketplaces, all the minimum benefits are required, we are seeing off-marketplace these skimpier plans that might have cheaper premiums but also offer less robust services. Those are growing in numbers in terms of what Americans are able to purchase.\n\nDAVIES: Yeah. I mean, health care is so confusing and complicated that I could imagine people picking the lower price, not realizing what they're not getting.\n\nKLIFF: Exactly. And you do see some pretty aggressive marketing by some of these short-term plans. I mean, I've even received calls on my phone, you know, from folks who are trying to sell me individual insurance. And I often start asking a lot of questions and get hung up on when I start kind of probing into the benefits that they would offer.\n\nSo - but you could certainly see that happening. And usually you only realize that the benefits aren't what you thought they were when you have some kind of medical need, an emergency, and all of a sudden, you have these bills you didn't expect, and then you really start researching - what is this I purchased? And you realize what you purchased isn't really what you thought it was.\n\nDAVIES: One of the parts of the act which really increased health insurance for a lot of people was the expansion of Medicaid, then funded largely by federal subsidies. Is that expansion still largely in place?\n\nKLIFF: It is. It is, and it's growing. One of the things we've seen over the past few years is about a half-dozen states have expanded Medicaid via ballot initiatives. Republican governors, many remain resistant to Medicaid expansion. They don't want to sign up for it. And we've seen a number of grassroots organizers kind of take this question directly to the voters, and when they do, it's quite successful. So just this year alone, both Oklahoma and Missouri have decided to join the Medicaid expansion. And that happened via ballot initiatives; that didn't happen through the legislature.\n\nSo one of the things we've really learned over a decade of the Affordable Care Act is it's that expansion of Medicaid and expansion of public coverage, that's what's driving most of Obamacare's enrollment. It's not the subsidized private plans; it's the free public plans that are bringing a lot of people into coverage.\n\nDAVIES: And do states have to cover most of the cost of this now?\n\nKLIFF: They don't. The federal government pays 90% of the costs, and states foot about 10% of the costs. That is a more generous match than what exists in the traditional Medicaid program. Usually it's closer to 50-50 or 60-40. So it's really a big, enhanced match, and that was a key part of getting the Affordable Care Act passed. The drafters wanted to say to states, this is not going to be onerous on you; you're only going to have to kick in a little bit to get a lot of people covered.\n\nDAVIES: And do we know overall what the fiscal impact of the act is? I mean, a lot more Americans are insured than before. Is costing us a lot?\n\nKLIFF: You know, generally, the Affordable Care Act has come in below cost estimates. We've seen the Congressional Budget Office revise downward how much they think the law costs, and that actually comes back to the type of coverage people are getting. Enrollment in Medicaid is higher than expected. Enrollment in the private plans is lower than expected. And Medicaid typically pays lower prices to doctors than private insurance plans do. So generally - you know, it obviously costs money to get people covered, but it is costing the federal government less money than was expected when the law was passed a decade ago.\n\nDAVIES: We're going to take a break here. Let me reintroduce you. We're speaking with Sarah Kliff of The New York Times. She's an investigative reporter who covers the American health care system. We will continue our conversation in just a moment. This is FRESH AIR.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF SLOWBERN'S WHEN WAR WAS KING)\n\nDAVIES: This is FRESH AIR, and we're speaking with Sarah Kliff. She's been covering the American health care system and national health policy for more than 10 years. She's an investigative reporter for The New York Times.\n\nThe big blow to Obamacare was in 2017 when the tax bill was passed. And it eliminated the penalties that were associated with people not getting health insurance, right? The requirement is technically still there, but a zero penalty, so it's lost its teeth. And I think a lot of people thought, uh-oh, because, you know, the whole idea was, if we're going to provide more protection for people with preexisting conditions and all of these other benefits, we've got to get younger, healthier people into the system so that the finances work. What's been the impact on some of those younger, healthier folks staying in or getting in or getting out now that there's no penalty for them declining coverage?\n\nKLIFF: Yeah, this was something that surprised health economists is they constantly talked about Obamacare as - they'd use this analogy of a three-legged stool. And one leg is, you know, getting rid of preexisting conditions - you let everyone in. The other leg is subsidies - you make it affordable. And the third leg is the mandate - you make everyone buy coverage, even people who don't think they need it. And health economists spent, you know, the better part of a decade saying you cut off any leg, and the stool just tumbles over.\n\nAnd Republicans did cut off one of the legs, and it hasn't really tumbled. You know, we just got the health insurance numbers from the census for 2019, which is the first year without the mandate, and there wasn't really any noticeable change. A lot of economists have gone back and kind of no longer think the mandate was quite as important as they initially did when they were drafting the Affordable Care Act. I kind of loved - what one economist told me was that, you know, maybe it's not a three-legged stool. Maybe it's kind of like the wobbly table at a restaurant that isn't perfect, but, like, it works, and it does the job you need to do to eat your dinner.\n\nThe mandate, it turns out, was a kind of weak penalty. The size of it wasn't very big compared to the size of purchasing health insurance. And one of the things I think economists have realized that the subsidies, the things that make insurance affordable on the Obamacare marketplace, that's really what got people enrolled, not the mandate to enroll, but the money to make it affordable.\n\nDAVIES: So the idea that young, healthy people would just, you know, roll the dice and go without insurance turns out not to be true. I mean, they realize it's actually something worth doing if you can make it affordable.\n\nKLIFF: Exactly. And a lot hinges on the last thing you said - the if you can make it affordable - that we're seeing, you know, with the way these subsidies are structured, they go up with the cost of health insurance. So if you are someone in the subsidized population, you're always going to have your premium capped at a certain share of your income.\n\nAnd it turns out that structure has worked really well. It's made insurance affordable for millions of Americans who couldn't afford it before now, whereas, you know, a kind of small mandate, it just wasn't getting the job done. The carrot was good enough that you didn't really need the stick.\n\nDAVIES: So where are we now in the increase of the number of Americans insured since the act was passed or, conversely, the decline in those uninsured?\n\nKLIFF: Yeah, so we've seen about 20 million Americans gain health insurance since the Affordable Care Act was enacted. Those numbers were generally going up during the Obama administration, and then they've ticked downwards a little bit in the Trump administration. We did, like I mentioned earlier, get recent census data last month, which showed health insurance rates were basically holding stable in 2019 after declining a notable amount in 2018. So generally, you know, it fluctuates a little bit year to year. But we're talking about 20 million Americans who have health insurance compared to pre-Affordable Care Act times.\n\nDAVIES: Republicans have been trying to drive the stake into the heart of Obamacare pretty much since it was passed, both through legislation and litigation. And so far, it's standing. But, you know, the health care system's complicated. And if these threats are hovering, I wonder how they have affected the market and the actions of insurance companies and hospitals and others in the system.\n\nKLIFF: You know, it's actually been relatively stable in kind of a surprising way. As you mentioned, you know, Obamacare has been under threat since the day it was passed - multiple repeal attempts, multiple Supreme Court cases, a lot of governors doing what they can to block the law in their states. But the law has actually been relatively stable. We saw some pretty swift premium increases when the marketplaces launched in 2014. Those have kind of petered out a little bit.\n\nYou know, usually each year, there's about nine to 10 million people who buy coverage on the marketplaces. That number might increase significantly this year with people losing their coverage that came along with the jobs they used to have before the pandemic. But it's been surprisingly stable. It surprised me. It surprised a lot of sources that I talked to, given all these efforts to take the Affordable Care Act down.\n\nDAVIES: So let's talk about this court case, which is going to be argued a week after the election. The caption on the case is California v. Texas. Who are the plaintiffs in this case? What's their argument for knocking down Obamacare?\n\nKLIFF: Yeah. So it's a little confusing because the plaintiffs in this case are actually the ones defending the Affordable Care Act. So why don't I tell you about the challengers to the Affordable Care Act and kind of what they are arguing? So the challengers is a group of Republican attorneys general. And they are making a two-part argument that's a little complex, but I'll do my best to try and summarize that. It all starts with this 2017 tax bill we talked about earlier that dropped the individual mandate penalties to zero dollars. They make the argument that without a tax, without a number attached to it, the mandate is unconstitutional. If you remember back to the 2012 decision that upheld the individual mandate, the Supreme Court ruled there that it was constitutional because of the federal government's taxing powers. They say no tax, now it's unconstitutional. So that's the first part in their argument. The second part is really what the case hinges on. They argue that the mandate is so key to the Affordable Care Act. It's such a crucial part of the law that if the court finds the mandate to be unconstitutional, it needs to strike the rest of the law down. In legal terms, they are saying that the individual mandate is inseverable from the rest of the Affordable Care Act and that if a court finds the mandate unconstitutional, that everything - the protections on preexisting conditions, the Medicaid expansion, you know, really far-off provisions like requirements to post calorie labels in restaurants - all of that needs to fall if the mandate is unconstitutional.\n\nDAVIES: Right. You know, that argument that if one part falls, the rest of it must fall just always struck me as more of a debating point than a legal argument. I guess the connection to the Constitution is to the taxing authority of Congress here, huh?\n\nKLIFF: It is. So it all kind of comes back to the taxing authority of Congress. And I think there are, you know, some liberal legal scholars who say, you know, maybe that first part of the argument is right. You know, maybe there really isn't a case for upholding the mandate anymore, but it's kind of a so what of it at this point. The penalty is zero dollars. Having the mandate struck down as unconstitutional really wouldn't change Obamacare much one way or another. The real question of this case sits on this question of severability, of if the court decides that they are not going to sever the mandate from the rest of the law, I mean, that's - that would be a huge, huge deal to pull the Affordable Care Act out of the health care system after it spent a decade kind of integrating into all of our lives.\n\nDAVIES: Right. And to just get a little technical for a moment, I mean, this idea that one part of a law - the invalidation of one part of a law invalidates all of a law. Surely that issue comes up in many, many different kinds of legislation at every level. This is a new issue?\n\nKLIFF: No, no, it's definitely not a new issue. And it's come up recently in the Supreme Court. And it's actually given defenders of the Affordable Care Act some hope that the Affordable Care Act will survive, given how conservative justices have written on it. There's an opinion that came out earlier this year written by Justice Kavanaugh that deals with this issue of severability and it feels quite pertinent to the Affordable Care Act case, where Justice Kavanaugh, you know, really advocates for a narrow interpretation of severability, saying, you know, that they should not be trying to strike down entire laws based on tiny portions. So that Kavanaugh opinion from earlier this year, it kind of gives us some insight into how he thinks about the severability issue, which, like you mentioned, is not new. It's just going to get a lot more attention with this Affordable Care Act case.\n\nDAVIES: Right. Now, of course, this case comes at a particularly interesting time because, you know, President Trump and the Republicans are trying to get Judge Amy Coney Barrett approved by the Senate and sworn in before the case is heard. What effect might that have?\n\nKLIFF: So interestingly, you know, I spent some time reporting on this a few weeks ago, and most of the folks I talked to actually don't think there will be a big impact on this case. They were generally expecting this case not to succeed at the Supreme Court and were even raising the possibility of a 9-0, 8-1 decision against this challenge. One thing to know about this court challenge is a lot of the legal scholars who have supported previous Obamacare challenges think the argument is very weak, especially that jump from the first part to the second part, this idea of saying the mandate is not severable is kind of an overreading of what Congress meant to do when they zeroed out those penalties. So, you know, when I've interviewed folks who follow the court closely, they actually don't think it'll make a big difference in this case. And they also look at the writings of some conservative justices, particularly Justice Kavanaugh on severability, and think that they might be inclined to uphold the Affordable Care Act in this particular challenge. That being said, you know, the Supreme Court is unpredictable. We're in unpredictable, unknown times. So anything could happen. But the bright minds I have talked to do not think this particular case is especially affected by that change in who is holding the seat on the court.\n\nDAVIES: We're going to take another break here. Let me reintroduce you. We're speaking with Sarah Kliff. She's an investigative reporter for The New York Times covering the American health care system. We will continue our conversation after this short break. I'm Dave Davies, and this is FRESH AIR.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF HUTCHINSON ANDREW TRIO'S MINTAKA (FEAT. DONNY MCCASLIN))\n\nDAVIES: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Dave Davies, in today for Terry Gross. We're speaking with Sarah Kliff, an investigative reporter for The New York Times who covers the American health care system. We're talking about campaign debates over insurance coverage for people with preexisting conditions and the latest legal challenge to the Affordable Care Act, which will be argued before the U.S. Supreme Court next month.\n\nYou know, President Trump has said and, according to your writing, his core followers believe that he is committed to preserving health insurance for people with preexisting medical conditions. Democrats say that if you look at what Trump's actually doing, that the administration is in court specifically trying to strike down those protections. Are they right?\n\nKLIFF: Sort of. Mostly. So I would say, generally, when you look at President Trump's record, it is not one of trying to uphold protections from preexisting - for Americans with preexisting conditions. It starts with support for repealing the Affordable Care Act, which created those protections, and a number of plans circulated by Republicans that would not continue those protections, despite some statements they made about it.\n\nAnd then it really continues up through this legal challenge where, you know, it is not the Trump administration itself that is suing, but the Justice Department did file a brief over the summer that supported the challenge and said that it also agreed that protections for preexisting conditions should fall if the mandate is ruled unconstitutional. So I do not think it is accurate to say, as President Trump repeatedly does say, that he is for protecting preexisting conditions. What we know of his policy record, his administration's litigation record, is that they've done a number of things that would erode those consumer protections.\n\nDAVIES: And I guess what they would say is, well, once it's gone, we'll come up with something that's better. It's not just repeal; it's repeal and replace. What does the record show about the likelihood of that happening?\n\nKLIFF: Yeah, it's funny you mention that because, you know, I remember when President Trump was inaugurated - or right before his inauguration, he started saying there was going to be a health care plan, and all the health reporters were kind of, you know, jittering to see it. Like, oh, what's the Trump plan? What's the Trump plan? And we just - you know, we're four years out from that, and we just have not seen a plan. The White House constantly promises that a new plan is coming. They've done that in recent weeks. And then it just doesn't turn up.\n\nObviously, it could at some point. But if you look at the past four years, it's a lot of promising from the White House that there is going to be a plan; it's going to do as well as Obamacare at protecting preexisting conditions. But so far, no one has seen that plan.\n\nDAVIES: There were some congressional initiatives - right? - to provide some kind of an alternative while repealing Obamacare, right?\n\nKLIFF: There were. There were. And none of them, you know, had the same protections for preexisting conditions that you see in the Affordable Care Act. So, you know, sometimes you'd see things like, well, of course, we're going to protect preexisting conditions for Americans with continuous coverage - meaning, you know, if you stay insured, if you never have an uninsured month, then insurance companies can't deny you. But that obviously leaves out someone who has a gap in coverage - or, you know, they'd say we're going to require insurance companies to accept people with preexisting conditions but get rid of the Obamacare requirements that bar them from charging those people more.\n\nSo you did see some steps towards protection that were, you know, further beyond what existed before Obamacare, but you did not see those plans matching the protections that exist in current law because of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nDAVIES: You know, the act also included a number of measures that were designed to reduce costs in the health care system - you know, reimbursements for hospitals for Medicare patients, those kinds of things. Are they still in effect?\n\nKLIFF: They are still in effect. You know, the administration is still running a number of programs, and these ones tend to be less political. They're not really the focus of the debate. But those generally are still in effect. I'd say they have a mixed track record - some of them more successful than others in reducing costs. But those parts of the Affordable Care Act continue through this day.\n\nDAVIES: The president did sign an executive order recently which established as policy that the administration favors the preservation of insurance for people with preexisting conditions. What did that provide?\n\nKLIFF: I mean, it provided a nice photo op to sign the executive order. But in terms of what that actually changes policywise, the answer is nothing. You know, that's just not how laws work in the United States. They have to go through Congress. And with the health care system as complex as the United States, you know, it's not really about signing a piece of paper saying, we protect preexisting conditions; it's about actually writing the rules for how insurance companies have to act and spelling out what that means.\n\nSo let's say the Supreme Court, you know, rules in favor of the challengers; it says all of Obamacare is unconstitutional. That executive order is not going to do anything to keep Obamacare's preexisting condition protections on the books.\n\nDAVIES: This is an issue in the fall campaign, and Democrats are really talking a lot about protecting protections for people with preexisting conditions. And they managed to get a vote in the Senate on a bill, which had no chance of passing, but which would have, in effect, barred the Trump administration from continuing its intervention in this case to strike down the Affordable Care Act. What happened there?\n\nKLIFF: Yeah, I think, broadly, what you see happening in the two political parties is a big role reversal. You know, if you look back at the conventions in 2012 and 2016, Republicans loved to talk Obama - about Obamacare. They were constantly talking about Obamacare repeal and getting rid of the law and how terrible it was. And now flash-forward to 2020 and Republicans are not really saying much.\n\nYou know, I watched most of the Republican convention and, you know, did a story about this, that Obamacare was mentioned just once the entire Republican convention, whereas Democrats are quite enthusiastic to talk about it. They want to talk about preexisting conditions. They want to talk about repeal in a way Republicans no longer do. And I think that's what you see with this Senate vote.\n\nHeading into the election, particularly with the Supreme Court battle ahead of us, Democrats are quite, quite eager to make health care a big issue over the next few weeks. And, you know, you see that in the Senate vote. You see that in the first presidential debate, where Joe Biden immediately starts talking about the Affordable Care Act and preexisting conditions when the debate opens. You know, it's an issue Democrats want to talk about in a way that was not true, you know, in the last two election cycles.\n\nDAVIES: It kind of reminds me of - you know, Social Security and Medicare were really controversial when they were passed, but at some point, they become, you know, just a part of the infrastructure and accepted and embraced by just about everybody.\n\nKLIFF: Yeah, I think you're right. This is kind of what we see with social welfare programs. I will say, for Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security - they did not face quite the blowback that the Affordable Care Act did. You know, they were accepted a bit quicker than what we're seeing with the Affordable Care Act, which, you know, as we've already discussed, is still facing a lawsuit in the Supreme Court to overturn it.\n\nBut in general, you know, it becomes a lot harder to repeal this, and you saw this in the 2017 repeal effort. It's so much harder to repeal a law that covers millions of Americans than it is to - you know, trying to stop it while it's being drafted. This is a really tangible benefit to a number of people. And it would be quite noticeable to them if that benefit were taken away.\n\nDAVIES: Yeah, it's interesting that while, you know, national Republicans in an election year are not talking about this stuff much, I mean, there are 20 Republican attorneys general who are generally elected - right? - they're politicians - and they were prepared to go to court and try and knock Obamacare out. Is there an incentive among their supporters or donors here? I mean, does it - is it a matter of some of these taxes? Or - why does it still get energy?\n\nKLIFF: You know, that is something that continues to puzzle me to this day is why pursue this challenge? You know, it seems like - I am not a political strategist. But just, you know, from writing about the issue, it seems like a big liability to have this case on preexisting conditions coming just days after the election. I will say one thing that's a bit different about this challenge than previous challenges is it's not generally supported by a lot of the mainstream conservative legal community. This kind of came up more from the fringe and then proved quite successful in lower district courts.\n\nBut, you know, at the same time, like you said, there's 20 attorney generals who signed onto it. So it's not like this is totally out of left field. It's getting some support from kind of the - from very important figures within the party. And I don't fully understand the political calculation around it, why you would want to be pursuing this kind of Supreme Court case in an election year.\n\nDAVIES: One other issue, you know, the president says he's done an awful lot to fight high prescription drug costs. Has he?\n\nKLIFF: You know, this is another one where we kind of see a lot of talk about it. And we saw an executive order last week that's signed at the same time as the executive order around preexisting conditions. But we actually haven't seen much policy movement on the topic. President Trump, you know, does like to claim drug prices are lower. He said at the last presidential debate that insulin is now as cheap as water, which any diabetic would tell you is not true. Insulin is much more expensive than water, much more expensive in the United States than other countries.\n\nBut - so we haven't really seen much movement. It's clearly an area of focus for the president. He talks about it a lot. And when you ask Americans about, you know, what sort of health care issues they're dealing with, drug prices often comes up as the kind of most frustrating - medical bills they're receiving. But we actually haven't seen much policy movement that would lower those drug prices.\n\nDAVIES: Right. There were some negotiations with the pharmaceutical industry which didn't yield an agreement, right? And then the president talked about issuing $200 voucher or cards to older Americans - right? - soon, this fall.\n\nKLIFF: Yeah. So we're still waiting to see what is going to happen with those cards, if they actually exist or not. There are certainly some questions about the legality of sending out $200 vouchers to a number of voters in the weeks leading up to an election. They claim they have authority under certain waiver rules that allow them to test out new programs.\n\nBut I think, you know, if they do actually move forward on sending those out, you might see them challenged in court. So we don't know what's going on with those vouchers. They were mentioned a few weeks ago. But, you know, in the past week or so, we have not heard anything about them. Obviously, there's been a lot going on with the president in the past week or so that might overshadow that.\n\nDAVIES: Right, right. Let me take a break here. I want to reintroduce you again here. Sarah Kliff is an investigative reporter for The New York Times covering the American health care system. We will continue our conversation after this short break. This is FRESH AIR.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF NOAM WIESENBERG'S DAVKA)\n\nDAVIES: This is FRESH AIR, and we're speaking with Sarah Kliff. She's an investigative reporter for The New York Times. She's been covering national health care policy for more than 10 years.\n\nYou're kind of obsessed with medical costs and charges.\n\nKLIFF: (Laughter).\n\nDAVIES: You love to collect data on this. And, you know, there are federal laws that govern costs for COVID-19 tests. And many insurance companies have told their subscribers that, you know, there will be no co-pays. Have you found that to be the truth, that the case?\n\nKLIFF: Yeah. You know, in most situations, it is. But there's also a lot of people who are facing surprise medical bills due to their coronavirus testing and treatment. We've worked with some data companies. And we estimate that about 2.4% of Americans face some kind of charge that they have to pay for their coronavirus test, despite the requirement that insurance companies fully cover them. And, you know, that number might seem small. But keep in mind, there's been 108 million coronavirus tests in the United States. So when you start doing the numbers, 2.4% of that is actually millions of Americans facing some kind of bill for coronavirus tests. You know, I'm just starting to get further into understanding the costs of coronavirus treatment. And, again, they're - you're starting to see patients who are getting bills they didn't expect for, you know, treatment that they thought was going to be covered by their insurance company.\n\nDAVIES: Right. And sometimes going to get a test, you can also be charged for a doctor's visit. I mean, what kinds of bills are you seeing among those who get them?\n\nKLIFF: Yeah. So you definitely see - one of the things, I think, that's pretty common in these surprise bills is a situation you mentioned where someone goes to a doctor's office or an emergency room for a coronavirus test, and the coronavirus test is covered by the insurance company, but something else that happened is not covered. Sometimes, that's an emergency room facility fee, kind of the price of going to an emergency room, which I've seen emergency rooms applying to drive-through sites. People don't actually enter the emergency room, but they still receive the facility fee for driving through and getting their tests there.\n\nI've seen a number of providers tacking on flu tests or, in some even more egregious examples, STD tests that patients, you know, they just thought they were getting a drive-through coronavirus test. And now, they see a dozen or so different items from the lab that they were billed for, some of them the insurance is not required to cover. So it just - it's really hard to know. And patients typically only find out, you know, what was tacked onto their bill when they get the charges in the mail.\n\nDAVIES: You know, health care treatment is very private. And health insurance companies aren't exactly dying to share data about this. How do you find out what people are paying for these bills?\n\nKLIFF: So I find out by asking readers to send me their bills. It sounds like a kind of insane way to investigate this. But, you know, I found, with some previous work I did on emergency room billing, that the best way to understand what patients are being charged is to actually see the billing documents themselves. Insurance companies and hospitals typically keep those numbers secret. They do not want to share them. They do not publish some list of their charges. So I get my information from what patients are willing to send me and, in this case, what they're willing to send me for their coronavirus testing and treatment bills.\n\nDAVIES: So if somebody wants to send you their bills, what do they do?\n\nKLIFF: They just go to a very simple URL - nytimes.com/costofcare. There's a really easy way just to upload a picture or a PDF or whatever you have - a screenshot of your bill. And it would be such a huge help to the work I'm doing trying to understand the costs of this disease.\n\nDAVIES: So what are you going to be focusing on the next few months?\n\nKLIFF: Well, you know, I think - like a lot of my colleagues - I'm focused a little bit on the election and what are going to be the consequences for health care, you know, depending on who wins. We'll have the Supreme Court case we talked about coming up on November 10, and an eventual decision on that is going to be a pretty big deal. And then the other thing is, you know, understanding the billing experience that patients are having due to coronavirus. I'm trying to understand - I know a lot about testing now, but I know less about treatment, and I'd like to understand that better.\n\nAnd then I think - you know, big-picture, zooming out a little bit - you know, one of the things we haven't talked as much about lately is that the health care system lost a lot of money due to coronavirus, due to all that canceled and delayed care. And how does it react to that? Do we see hospital closures? Do we see new fees being tacked on to doctor visits? I'm pretty interested in how the health care system deals with this reality of losing a lot of money in 2020.\n\nDAVIES: Yeah. You know, you've written about how many preventative tests just aren't happening. And I'm wondering, are we going to see an increase in - I don't know - measles, undetected breast cancer or colon cancer or prostate cancer?\n\nKLIFF: Yeah, it's hard to know. And I think it's going to take, you know, a few years to really understand the consequences of all this missed preventative care. I think we're going to learn a lot about how necessary or unnecessary that care is based on what happens in this experience. And that is one of the things I do think a number of primary care experts worry about - is that all this skipped care might lead to more breast cancer deaths, more colon cancer deaths. But these are kind of the ripple effects we're going to have to wait months or even years to fully understand.\n\nDAVIES: I'm wondering if - kind of what macro impacts you might be seeing in the health care system from the pandemic - I mean, rural health care being degraded as opposed to urban health care; you know, some hospitals making it, others not.\n\nKLIFF: Yeah. I think, generally, what you see is that the hospitals that were well-positioned and quite wealthy before the coronavirus pandemic are having an OK time weathering the storm. They had reserves and could survive something like this, whereas those that were, you know, already running tight margins, running a loss - and when I think of those, I think of rural hospitals, hospitals serving urban, low-income populations - those are the ones that, you know, you worry about having to close or having to cut off certain service lines that cost them more money to run.\n\nAnd the one area I worry about the most is, really, primary care because you've seen their revenue just decimated as Americans put off a lot of the preventive care that is, you know, typically delivered at their doctor's office. They were already, you know, some of the less-profitable, lower-margin type of doctor offices we have in the United States, and now with this big hit to their business, I am concerned about the strength of that part of our health care system.\n\nDAVIES: Again, Sarah Kliff, if people want to send copies of their medical bills to you for your research, how do they do that?\n\nKLIFF: They just go to nytimes.com/costofcare. And there's a really simple form to fill out where they can do that.\n\nDAVIES: Well, Sarah Kliff, thank you so much for speaking with us again.\n\nKLIFF: Yeah, thank you so much for having me.\n\nDAVIES: Sarah Kliff is an investigative reporter for The New York Times covering the American health care system. Coming up, jazz critic Kevin Whitehead reviews an album from a trio of road musicians who came together to record something special.

Kavanaugh Pick Shows Trump Bowing Again To The GOP Legal Establishment\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Mandel Ngan/AFP/Getty Images Mandel Ngan/AFP/Getty Images\n\nIn the end, after days of highly dramatized deliberation, President Trump had to choose. He had to choose not only between several possible nominees for the Supreme Court, but also between categories of advisers.\n\nIn this case, he chose to listen to his lawyers rather than his talk show hosts. And he did not seem overly concerned about the warning Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell had issued over the weekend about which prospective nominees would be easiest to get confirmed.\n\nThe man the president finally summoned to the stage in the East Room of the White House on Monday night was Brett Kavanaugh, whom many considered the front-runner to replace Justice Anthony Kennedy even before Kennedy had announced his retirement. Kavanaugh was once a clerk for Kennedy, overlapping briefly with Neil Gorsuch, the man President Trump made his first choice for the Supreme Court last year.\n\nThis time around, Kavanaugh was the lead horse, the candidate with the glittering resume and the inside track. As a double Yalie, he would keep intact the current domination of the court by just two law schools: Harvard and Yale (Gorsuch went to Harvard). He also has the longest and most distinguished record of service as a federal appellate judge among the four finalists announced by the White House.\n\nKavanaugh has written a lot of important decisions, because he serves on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, often called the Little Supreme Court for its docket of administrative and constitutional cases and its history of sending its alumni to the high court across the street from the Capitol.\n\nAll this mattered to the man who has run the vetting process for Trump's judicial nominees, White House Counsel Don McGahn, who was joined by other prominent legal minds within the GOP. They led the president to follow once again the conventional script for appointing conservative Republicans to the Supreme Court, finding the name on his famous list of 25 that pleased him while checking off the maximum number of boxes.\n\nThe list, of course, came from the Federalist Society and its leader, Leonard Leo, with input from other conservative organizations. It played an enormous role in Trump's 2016 election, reassuring a whole category of religious conservatives that Trump would appoint a court that would overturn Roe v. Wade and do it automatically, as he promised in his third presidential debate against Hillary Clinton.\n\nYet in Kavanaugh, Trump chose someone who might well have been chosen by President George W. Bush (for whom Kavanaugh worked as staff secretary in the White House, helping to choose his Supreme Court nominees) or by the elder President Bush, or Ronald Reagan. Trump even paid homage to Reagan in his introductory remarks, saluting the Gipper for putting Kennedy on the court three decades ago.\n\nWith all these credentials, Kavanaugh still met resistance within Trump world. Longtime association with the Bush family is not generally a plus in the president's realm, nor is the sense that Kavanaugh might surprise once he has reached the ultimate level of independence on the court.\n\nCritics have complained that the hundreds of thousands of pages and emails and everything else Kavanaugh has produced will slow the confirmation process and perhaps complicate the vote.\n\nBesides, Kavanaugh was not the exciting, breakout, populist, anti-establishment pick some on the right had wanted and expected. When presented with a chance to vote against Obamacare from his perch on the appeals court a few years ago Kavanaugh chose an off-ramp to avoid a strong opinion. When he was a prosecutor working for independent counsel Ken Starr in the late 1990s, he concluded that former White House counsel Vince Foster had not been murdered (as countless conspiracy theorists maintained). And there are surely other jurists out there who have worked harder to establish their bona fides with the far right.\n\nMoreover, there were boomlets in the last few days for other prospective nominees. Thomas Hardiman of the Pennsylvania Circuit, the runner-up to Gorsuch, was still presumed the favorite of his former colleague Maryanne Trump Barry, the president's sister. And Raymond Kethledge of Michigan was, with Hardiman, one of the two prospects McConnell thought it would be easiest to confirm.\n\nSo there was uncertainty right up until curtain time at the White House on Monday night, the culmination of the latest production by Trump the Showman. Given a rather predictable nominee to present, Trump managed through days of interviewing and sending mixed signals to create an atmosphere of suspense.\n\nRemarkably, the usually leaky White House operation managed to preserve The Secret right up to the moment of The Big Reveal at 9 p.m., allowing speculation and campaigning and contesting of the nomination throughout the final day.\n\nThat meant cable TV and Twitter were teeming with such prominent and influential talk show personalities as radio host Steve Deace in Iowa and Sean Hannity on Fox News, voicing their fervent support for Amy Coney Barrett, an Indianan serving on the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Chicago.\n\nConservative media stars such as Erick Erickson, former CEO of RedState.com, were rhapsodizing about what a Barrett pick would mean to them. Erickson, who has been hot and cold on Trump, said he'd vote for him in 2020 despite the tariffs and other disagreements if the president opted for the former Notre Dame law professor, who has become something of a Joan of Arc for social and religious conservatives.\n\nHannity, who communicates with the president daily and seems at times his alter ego, also made no secret of his preference for Barrett. So he may have been giving a little bit away when he appeared on Fox's The Five on Monday evening. Hannity told Fox viewers to close their eyes just before Trump revealed his choice so they could imagine who the new justice might be if Hillary Clinton were president.\n\nIn other words, anyone on the Trump short list would be great by comparison to any Clinton pick. It sounded as though Hannity wasn't really expecting his own first choice to win.\n\nOf course, by the time Kavanaugh was official and the reactions were pouring in, the Barrett fans were mostly climbing on board — despite their earlier reservations.\n\nThey really had little choice. The atmosphere in the East Room of the White House on Monday night was celebratory and relieved. Trump himself delivered a brief tribute to Justice Kennedy, and well he might. For by retiring just now, Kennedy has given the president the ultimate political gift — the chance to change the subject, reprise his Greatest Hit (the Gorsuch nomination) and shape the political debate in the months leading into the November midterm elections.\n\nNot so long ago, Trump and the GOP had hoped to ride their tax bill to popularity this year. But the public has remained largely indifferent (or even hostile) to their signature legislation. Trump's get-tough tariff regime has induced anxiety among farmers and manufacturers and may soon worry workers as well. The zero tolerance policy at the southern border has produced heart-rending visuals and a genuine crisis over families of asylum seekers separated and imprisoned.\n\nThe crown jewel of a peace process with North Korea seems to be falling apart before actually achieving anything for the U.S. And the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election continues apace, with 19 indictments so far and Trump's former campaign manager sitting in jail awaiting trial.\n\nYet now, with the Kavanaugh confirmation process underway, Trump can hearken back to Gorsuch. No other action Trump has taken to date has so consistently pleased his base, the party and the broader conservative movement.\n\nAs to resistance from the other side of the political aisle, the objections from Democrats and their constituency groups arrived at least as fast as the praise from the right. But in the end, having some of the talk show hosts and other firebrands a little disappointed by the pick may help Trump and McConnell prevail.\n\nHaving chosen a candidate who will unite nearly all conservatives, Trump and McConnell can now focus on winning over a few Democrats. And Kavanaugh is not a naturally divisive personality, but a rather personable and presentable fellow with many friends, a charming family and a lifelong active church life. (Like the other three finalists, he is a Catholic.)\n\nSome Democrats will still see Kavanaugh as they did a decade or so ago, as a combatant in some of the worst moments of partisan warfare in recent decades. He was a lawyer in the Bush v. Gore case that decided the 2000 election, and before that, a lawyer with the investigation that led to the impeachment of President Bill Clinton in 1998.\n\nWhen Bush first appointed Kavanaugh to the federal bench, the Democrats held up his nomination for years. Sen. Charles Schumer of New York said naming Kavanaugh to the bench wasn't just throwing salt in the wound, it was throwing in the whole shaker. Kavanaugh was re-appointed in 2006 and confirmed.\n\nIn those days, we should note, the minority party could filibuster or threaten to filibuster a presidential nominee. That ended when the Democrats, as the majority, decided to eliminate the filibuster on presidential nominees for all but the Supreme Court. In 2017, McConnell killed the filibuster for Supreme Court nominations as well. Thus Gorsuch was confirmed with 54 votes, and Kavanaugh can be confirmed with as few as 50.\n\nSchumer has said he will again oppose Kavanaugh with everything I have. But he does not seem to have much at this point, barring a defection from the GOP side. Kavanaugh has not said or written anything showing hostility to Roe v. Wade, which was the line drawn in the sand by Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, one of two Senate Republicans to have defended abortion rights. But as a name on the list of 25 from the Federalist Society touted by Trump in 2016, he would have to have impressed some experts as a jurist who might well overturn Roe.\n\nKavanaugh will also have to survive the kind of high-stakes grilling meted out in the Senate Judiciary Committee, which he has not faced in a number of years.\n\nOn the other hand, Kavanaugh will probably have some appeal to at least a few of the 10 Democrats running for Senate re-election this fall in states that voted for Trump. That, and a united Republican Party, should ease his way to the bench in time for the next term to begin Oct. 1.
'Summon Your Conscience': Biden Implores GOP Senators To Wait On SCOTUS Nomination\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Roberto Schmidt/AFP via Getty Images Roberto Schmidt/AFP via Getty Images\n\nDemocratic presidential nominee Joe Biden on Sunday implored Senate Republicans not to act on President Trump's nomination of Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court until after the American people finish selecting their next president.\n\nThere are Senate Republicans out there who know in their hearts that if they shut out the voices of those during a voting period, during an election, they're closing the door on American democracy thereafter, Biden said during a speech in his hometown of Wilmington, Del.\n\nI urge every senator to take a step back from the brink, take off the blinders of politics for just one critical moment, and stand up for the Constitution you swore to uphold, said Biden, a longtime former senator himself. Just because you have the power to do something doesn't absolve you of your responsibility to do right by the American people. Uphold your constitutional duty, summon your conscience.\n\nBiden argued that since voters have already begun participating in the democratic process through early-voting and casting their mail-in ballots, it's crucial to hold off on any consideration of a Supreme Court nominee until the election results are known.\n\nIf we're going to call ourselves a democracy, their voices must be heard, Biden said.\n\nThe Democratic nominee also emphasized the proximity of Barrett's nomination to an upcoming case before the Supreme Court that challenges the Affordable Care Act.\n\nBarrett could cast a pivotal vote in that decision, as she has previously criticized Chief Justice John Roberts for his reasoning in upholding the health care law.\n\nThe Republican Party has been trying to eliminate [the ACA] for a decade. Twice already, the Supreme Court has upheld that law. And the Congress, expressing the popular will of the American people, has rejected President Trump's efforts as well, Biden said. It should come as no surprise that on Saturday, President Trump would nominate Judge Amy Coney Barrett and on Sunday lay out clearly what is objective is: to terminate Obamacare.\n\nTrump tweeted Sunday morning that the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, would be replaced with a cheaper alternative if it is terminated in the Supreme Court.\n\nThis isn't the first time Biden has asked Republican lawmakers to respect the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg's dying wish that she not be replaced until a new president is installed.\n\nSpeaking in Philadelphia two days after Ginsburg's death, Biden called on a handful of Republicans to follow your conscience.\n\nOn Sunday, Biden told reporters he hasn't reached out directly to any Senate Republicans, saying he didn't want to put them in a compromising position.\n\nI concluded that that would put them in a position if they were to vote the right way that they'd be compromised because I called them. I have great respect for a number of my former Republican colleagues and I'm hoping they will do the right thing.

You ready to play?\n\nLOWENSON: Yeah.\n\nSAGAL: Here is your first limerick.\n\nBILL KURTIS: I will bring a new life to this earth. So I'll look like the millions I'm worth. I'm like Meghan Markle with lip gloss and sparkles. I look really glam giving...\n\nLOWENSON: Birth.\n\nSAGAL: Yes, birth. Childbirth isn't just beautiful. It's now fabulous.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nSAGAL: More and more women are getting stylists to come in and get them gussied up for postpartum glamour shots. One New York spa will send a stylist to do your makeup and your hair in the delivery room. It's part of a - it's part of a special beauty package called hey, how did you get in here?\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nBRIAN BABYLON: Now this - does Obamacare cover?\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nSAGAL: Here is your next limerick.\n\nKURTIS: On Mars, there's no planes where the brush blooms. But no life - here a big-fingered hush looms. The rover has found roundish bumps on the ground. And some say those are pictures of...\n\nLOWENSON: Mushrooms.\n\nSAGAL: Yes. Get ready for some Martian risotto, as mushrooms might be growing on Mars. A recent study in the Journal of Astrobiology and Space Science shows photos that they say could be mushrooms growing on Mars.

Thanks to science, bees are now talking to fish. Scientists have devised a way - I'm not kidding - to use robots to translate bee language to fish and vice versa so that in the experiment, the bees and the fish start behaving the same way. The result is Twitter's worst unlikely animal friendship video.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nSAGAL: No, it's easy. It's actually based on the fact that bees and fish have a lot in common. Hey, you guys like moving in a group then suddenly changing direction? Us, too.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nBABYLON: How do you - how do you think the birds feel about this?\n\nSAGAL: Yeah.\n\nBABYLON: Because, you know, for so long...\n\nSAGAL: They're ganging up, man.\n\nPOUNDSTONE: Left out.\n\nBABYLON: ...It was like the birds and bees.\n\nPOUNDSTONE: Yeah.\n\nBABYLON: You know, you have the birds and the bees conversation. And then they're like oh, you talking to these fish, man? What happened to...\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nBABYLON: (Unintelligible).\n\nSAGAL: Bill, how did Janna do on our quiz?\n\nKURTIS: She got them all right. She's a winner and quick.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nSAGAL: Congratulations. Thank you so much, Janna. Thanks for playing.\n\nLOWENSON: Have a good day, guys.\n\nSAGAL: Bye bye.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, WHY CAN'T WE BE FRIENDS?)\n\nWAR: (Singing) Why can't we be friends? Why can't we be friends?

Trump, Post-Mueller\n\nSTEVE INSKEEP, HOST:\n\nOn this Friday morning Americans do not have the Mueller Report. A new survey finds an overwhelming majority want it to be public before they decide what to think. Americans do have a summary by President Trump's attorney general. William Barr says Russia worked to elect the president. He says the investigation found no evidence that President Trump's campaign conspired with Russia, and Barr decided not to charge his boss with obstruction of justice. That was enough for the president to celebrate at a campaign rally in Grand Rapids, Mich.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF RALLY)\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: The Russia hoax is finally dead.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nTRUMP: The collusion delusion is over.\n\nINSKEEP: NPR White House correspondent, Tamara Keith, was in the crowd in Grand Rapids. Tam, good morning.\n\nTAMARA KEITH, BYLINE: Good morning.\n\nINSKEEP: The president sounds triumphant.\n\nKEITH: Absolutely. It was a victory lap last night. In addition to declaring the investigation over, he also started going after his political enemies, mocking Congressman Adam Schiff and Jerry Nadler - they're the heads of two House committees that are investigating the president. And, you know, that belittling had something of a purpose. Both the president trying to make them pay for what he says is two years of overreach, but also trying to undermine their investigations that are still lingering. And if it wasn't clear from the mocking and the nicknames, President Trump also made it quite explicit saying Democrats are quote, defrauding the public with this ridiculous B.S., and he did not say B.S.. And he also sort of mocked the left for hoping that Mueller would give them something.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF RALLY)\n\nTRUMP: Robert Muller was a god to the Democrats, was a god to them until he said there was no collusion. They don't like him so much right now.\n\nINSKEEP: Although we have this new NPR-PBS NewsHour-Marist Poll out this morning which finds overwhelming majorities of Americans are not so sure they're being patient, they want to wait and see what the full Mueller report says whenever it may be made public.\n\nKEITH: Well, it's sort of a mix of things. So part of it is that people still have questions. 56 percent say they still have questions, and only 36 percent say that President Trump is clear of any wrongdoing. But the big headline number - and this includes both Democrats and Republicans who want this - 75 percent said that the full Mueller report should be made public, including a majority of Republicans and including a number of people outside the Trump rally who I spoke to last night. Jack Korkl, 19 years old, is one of the folks I talked to.\n\nJACK KORKL: I think he's innocent. I think that it should be released in full. Personally I thought it was like kind of like they had laid out the groundwork for it in the previous administration and Trump - Mueller, I think he's an honest guy and he did the investigation. And I think now everyone should just move forward.\n\nKEITH: I mean, the fascinating thing is that Republicans, Trump supporters, they want the report out because they think it's going to further vindicate the president. And Democrats want the report out because they don't trust that the attorney general really summarized this hundreds of pages in four pages.\n\nINSKEEP: So while we wait for more of that report to come out, the administration has changed the subject to health care.\n\nKEITH: (Laughter) Indeed they have. And someone might say that the president stepped on his own message. But the Trump administration has sided with a judicial ruling that says that Obamacare should be completely thrown out. And President Trump talked about that last night.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF RALLY)\n\nTRUMP: So we're going to get rid of Obamacare. And I said it the other day, the Republican Party will become the party of great health care. It's good. It's important.\n\nKEITH: The president says that they're going to come up with a plan, he's even tasked some Republican senators to work on it. But there is no plan at this point. And Senate Majority Leader, Mitch McConnell, was asked about this by Politico and he said he looks forward to seeing what the president proposes and can work out with Speaker Nancy Pelosi, which is some Senate shade.\n\nINSKEEP: Yeah. We had Mike Braun, one of the Republican senators, on the program just yesterday. And he was hoping to get past this whole lawsuit, leave Obamacare alone and actually try to focus on more positive Republican proposals. But there is - the question is what would the party actually get behind that could pass?\n\nKEITH: And that's been the problem for the entire Trump presidency.\n\nINSKEEP: Tamara, thanks so much.\n\nKEITH: You're welcome.\n\nINSKEEP: That's NPR White House reporter, Tamara Keith, in Grand Rapids, Mich., today.\n\nCopyright © 2019 NPR.

How To Sign Up For A COVID-19 Vaccine In Your State\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Frederic J. Brown/AFP via Getty Images Frederic J. Brown/AFP via Getty Images\n\nThe COVID-19 vaccines are here, but if it's your turn to get vaccinated, how are you supposed to sign up?\n\nThe answers vary by place, so NPR created a tool to help you understand how things work in your state and connect you with local resources. And we're sharing guiding principles and advice for navigating the process below.\n\nSearch for your state below. (There are a few large cities with their own immunization plans that you'll find on our list as well.)\n\nLoading...\n\nPlease note that the information in this tool is subject to change, as states roll out new processes and new providers get the vaccine. Always check with your state health department for the latest guidance.\n\nAdvice for navigating a patchwork system\n\nIt helps to understand how the system works as you set out to get the vaccine. Here are some tips to keep in mind as you proceed.\n\n1. First, understand the big picture. As you try to navigate the vaccine system in your state, be aware that there are multiple points of entry for those seeking a vaccine. Although the federal government pays for and distributes the vaccines, it's up to state and local health departments and the private sector — hospitals, clinics and pharmacies — to actually schedule and give out the shots.\n\nIn many states, the different systems don't talk to one another. So when it's your turn to get signed up for a shot, you may need to look for available appointments in all three of these separate streams, depending on your state.\n\n2. Keep an eye on pharmacies. In addition to sending vaccines to states, the government is sending vaccines directly to chain pharmacies through the Federal Retail Pharmacy Program, which launched in early February.\n\nFind out which pharmacies in your area are giving out vaccines by using the CDC's VaccineFinder tool, which launched Feb. 24. VaccineFinder is designed to show up-to-date information about which local pharmacies have doses in stock, and you may be able to book an appointment online, directly with the pharmacy, if you're eligible in your state.\n\nIn most states, this tool only shows pharmacies that get vaccine directly from the federal government so there may be additional pharmacies with vaccine — check your state in our tool for ways to search for those. In Alaska, Indiana, Iowa and Tennessee, you can see the complete list of providers using VaccineFinder, and more states are expected to include complete lists in the coming weeks.\n\n3. Remember the vaccine is free. You can get it if you don't have insurance. If you are insured, your insurance is required to cover the costs of administering the shot. Make sure to have your health insurance info handy in case when looking for an available slot in case that information is needed to register.\n\n4. Be patient and persistent. There are not enough doses available right now for people who are currently eligible and demand is generally high, so you might have to persevere.\n\nIt can certainly be frustrating: Hotlines can be jammed. Sign-ups can fill up the minute they open. Providers don't always schedule second doses, leaving people who succeeded in getting an initial appointment to scramble to set up their second dose within the recommended window.\n\nEven insiders are struggling with the chaotic system. Claire Hannan, who runs the Association of Immunization Managers, could barely figure out how to get a shot for her dad in Maryland. He's on the pre-registered waiting list for our county since Jan. 15, and we haven't heard one thing, she says. Who could possibly be ahead of him? He's 95! (She was ultimately able to get him vaccinated in another county.)\n\nIf you're feeling exasperated, remember that because of the patchwork nature of the system, local health departments don't have all the answers.\n\nThey don't universally have access to the systems that tell you where vaccine is within their jurisdiction, explains Adriane Casalotti, chief of government and public affairs at the National Association of County and City Health Officials.\n\n5. Look for local advice. Some tips that can help you find a slot are specific to a local area or state. You can find local guides from the media or places like AARP and GoodRx. Follow your state and local government on social media for specific tips where you live and maybe news about mass vaccination sites opening up with available slots.\n\nAlso search for Facebook groups — like this one in South Florida or this one in Oklahoma — and other local volunteer efforts that have sprung up to try to help folks navigate all of this.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Patrick T. Fallon/AFP via Getty Images Patrick T. Fallon/AFP via Getty Images\n\nIs a better system coming?\n\nFrom the current state of affairs, it seems obvious that health officials should have realized that once vaccines were out, they were going to need an effective and equitable way to bring people in to get their shots. But immunization managers across the country had their hands full getting ready to mobilize quickly for the coming vaccines, says Hannan.\n\nThe vaccine distribution patchwork is not easy to fix because it's a reflection of the patchwork health care system, a mix of public providers like health departments and private providers like hospitals and clinics that don't always play nice together.\n\nI can't tell you how complicated it is to have a federally financed vaccine being distributed through a state-based system, with a health care system that's private-sector based, Hannan says. These three things are completely separate and operate in their own kingdoms. So, trying to marry all of this and to track it in real time with data connections? It's incredible that we are where we are.\n\nA central promise of the Biden administration was to offer more assertive federal leadership over the COVID-19 public health response. Recently, officials have acknowledged the confusion and promised they're looking at various options for something more clear and centralized.\n\nThe launch of the CDC-backed VaccineFinder to help people find providers near them with vaccine in stock is helpful, but doesn't solve the sign-up problem — people still need to reach out to each clinic or pharmacy individually to try to book an appointment.\n\nIn all likelihood, the patchwork of public and private sign-up systems will continue. At this point, it's probably too late in the game to set up a system to connect everything, Hannan says. So it's really almost better to just communicate to people: 'Here's where the vaccine's going and here's what you need to do.' [Right now,] we're not even doing a great job of that.\n\nIt is worth noting: the patchwork might not be pretty, but people are getting vaccinated — more than 66 million doses have gotten into people's arms so far. More than a million shots are given on average every day across the country.\n\nAnd more and more vaccine is coming. I feel like we're turning a corner, Hannan says. With a promising production outlook and potentially another vaccine coming on, I feel like we're in a good place — I do.\n\nAudrey Carlsen designed and developed this lookup tool; Rhitu Chatterjee, Deborah Franklin, Maria Godoy, Richard Harris, Pien Huang, Kristen Kendrick, Rosemary Misdary, Yuki Noguchi, Julia Wohl, and Carmel Wroth contributed research and reporting.
Fact Check: 'We Don't Have Health Care In This Country,' Trump Says\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Andrew Harnik/AP Andrew Harnik/AP\n\nPresident Trump gave a eulogy on Thursday for the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare.\n\nObamacare is collapsing. It's dead. It's gone, Trump said in a news conference with Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos.\n\nThere's nothing to compare it to because we don't have health care in this country, he went on.\n\nThat left some Obamacare customers scratching their heads — figuratively — on Twitter.\n\nDoktor Zoom, for example, wondered why he's still paying a premium.\n\nIn fact, we do have health care in this country — quite a lot of it. The U.S. spent about $3.2 trillion on health care in 2015, or nearly $10,000 per person. It accounts for 17.8 percent of GDP.\n\nBut the president wasn't talking about health care per se. He was talking about Obamacare, which Republicans are trying to replace with legislation currently in the hands of the Senate.\n\nEven the picture of the current health law isn't as bad as Trump tried to paint it, though. In the years since the Affordable Care Act went into effect, the uninsured rate fell to about 10 percent, the lowest level in U.S. history. About 10 million people have bought insurance through the exchanges created by the health care law. Another 10 million got coverage through the expansion of Medicaid.\n\nThat's not to say the Obamacare marketplaces aren't struggling. In some states insurers are pulling out of the markets because they're losing money, as Trump pointed out.\n\nAetna just pulled out. Other insurance companies are pulling out, he said.\n\nThat's true. Aetna pulled out of all the Obamacare exchanges. In some states — Tennessee and Iowa, for example — there are areas that risk having no insurer at all. And premiums have been rising across the country.\n\nStill, the overall Obamacare picture isn't so stark.\n\nStandard & Poors, for example, said last month that insurance companies that offer health plans on the exchanges are losing less money than ever, and the markets are becoming more stable. The Kaiser Family Foundation says more than half the population has the choice of three or more insurers if it wants to buy a policy on the exchanges. And most people who get insurance through the Affordable Care Act receive subsidies to offset the rate increases.\n\nSeveral insurance companies, however, have said the uncertainty caused by Republican efforts to repeal the law have led them to either pull out of the markets or raise their rates for next year.\n\nSo when Trump says, as he did today, Obamacare is a fallacy. It's dead, that's not exactly true.\n\nBut he hopes to help make it so.
What Comes Next Now That The Government Is Open Again\n\nThe government is open, and negotiators have three weeks to reach a border security deal or risk another shutdown. The White House is downplaying the economic and political fallout from the shutdown.\n\nAUDIE CORNISH, HOST:\n\nFederal employees are back to work today now that the longest government shutdown in U.S. history is over. But this return to normal could be temporary. Members of Congress have just three weeks to strike a deal on border security or risk another shutdown. NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson joins us now to talk about what comes next. Mara, welcome to the studio.\n\nMARA LIASSON, BYLINE: Glad to be here, Audie.\n\nCORNISH: So next steps - what's supposed to happen on Capitol Hill?\n\nLIASSON: What happens is that conferees from both parties, both houses of Congress, meet for the first time on Wednesday. Democrats have not specifically ruled out spending any money for border barriers. They don't want the president's wall, but they are open to other kinds of barriers. Donald Trump gave an interview to The Wall Street Journal where he was a little bit pessimistic. He put the odds at getting a deal that was acceptable to him at less than 50/50, and he is continuing to talk about getting his wall done one way or another, meaning that if he doesn't like the deal Congress comes up with, he could declare a national emergency and spend on unobligated Pentagon funds...\n\nCORNISH: Right.\n\nLIASSON: ...On his own to build a wall.\n\nCORNISH: And then you had White House press secretary Sarah Sanders. She was asked about the prospect of a repeat shutdown today. Here's what she said.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF PRESS CONFERENCE)\n\nSARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS: The president doesn't want to go through another shutdown. That's not the goal. The goal is border security and protecting the American people.\n\nLIASSON: That being said, the president did tell The Wall Street Journal that shutting down the government remains an option. But everyone I've talked to on both sides of the aisle thinks that another shutdown is not likely given the financial and political costs of the one we just went through. It's hard to imagine the president would say, sure, let's go back to long lines at airports, no IRS checks, federal workers at food banks. More likely, according to most of the people I've talked to, is if Congress can't come up with a deal acceptable to him, then he would declare a national emergency.\n\nCORNISH: And the stakes are high, right? I mean, we now know more about the political and financial costs. What have we learned?\n\nLIASSON: What we learned is that the Congressional Budget Office has calculated what it thinks the shutdown costs. This is CBO Director Keith Hall.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nKEITH HALL: There is a permanent loss, however, right? You lose the government output for five weeks. That's never made up. So we think on net, we're still going to be about $3 billion short on GDP.\n\nLIASSON: So what Hall is saying is that according to his projections, the shutdown cost the country $11 billion over the first two quarters of this fiscal year, but 8 billion of that can be replenished. Now, White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow disagrees with the CBO's findings. He says in a $20 trillion economy, the shutdown will not cause permanent damage; it's a very, very tiny fraction.\n\nCORNISH: Now, what about the political costs? I mean, at this point, how much damage was done to the president politically?\n\nLIASSON: Well, he definitely took a hit not just because he didn't get the wall because he still might and because for many immigration restrictionists, the wall isn't even their top priority. But Republicans who are disappointed in the president are disappointed because he went into this macho standoff and lost to Madam Speaker. And he looked incompetent. It looked like he didn't have a strategy.\n\nBut most Republicans I've talked to say although he's - has been hurt in the short run, his approval ratings have gone down - in the long run, if he can still show his base that he's fighting for the wall, he can come out of this. This is still very early in the 2020 cycle, and we have seen in the past a shutdown's political effects can evaporate. In 2013, the Republicans shut down the government, took a huge hit. And then that story was completely forgotten when the Obamacare website debuted and crashed. So the - I guess the best thing for the president is that this happened very early in this year.\n\nCORNISH: That's NPR's Mara Liasson. Mara, thanks for your reporting.\n\nLIASSON: Thank you.\n\nCopyright © 2019 NPR. All rights reserved.

Wall Street Rebounds After Donald Trump's Victory\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Spencer Platt/Getty Images Spencer Platt/Getty Images\n\nU.S. stocks closed up Wednesday. It was a dramatic reversal from the deep losses in overnight trading. Investors were concerned that Donald Trump's unexpected victory would create uncertainty and damage the overall view of the U.S. economy. Overnight financial markets reacted with fear as Hillary Clinton's loss became apparent.\n\nThroughout the summer and into the fall, U.S. markets had behaved quietly, as investors became confident of a Clinton victory. In late October, when it appeared the FBI would reopen an inquiry into Clinton's email, stocks began a steady fall.\n\nBut with the election settled, each of the major indexes closed up by more than a point on Wednesday. A closer look reveals that investors poured money into sectors that could potentially benefit from the Trump presidency.\n\nShares of most oil and gas producers, energy companies, construction and pipeline operators rose while crude oil prices also went up.\n\nThe market's basically looking at old economy stocks coming back ... and those stocks did pop up today, says Juli Niemann, an analyst with Smith Moore and Co.\n\nThis rally was nothing more than Alka Seltzer bubbles relieving election pain and fizz. Now the ulcers are developing nicely: Isolationism and protectionism.\n\nHealth care companies did poorly, with the anticipation that the Obamacare insurance coverage law will end. And tech stocks dipped. That's the new economy, she continues, and [investors think] this is not going to be a new economy kind of president.\n\nFinancial stocks were up in part because analysts believe interest rates will rise because the dollar is declining. Europe and Asia are worried about the Trump presidency, and their investment money could potentially move out of U.S. markets.\n\nWe're not alone in this [new economy],  says Niemann, So this rally was nothing more than Alka Seltzer bubbles relieving election pain and fizz. Now the ulcers are developing nicely — isolationism and protectionism.\n\nOne of the sectors facing uncertainty is automotive. Auto stocks were mixed upon news of the election, with car companies — one of the industries Trump criticized during the campaign — vowing to work with the president-elect. The Detroit News looks how the auto industry is reacting to the impending Trump presidency.
Supreme Court Nominee May Be Hard To Pin Down On Obamacare\n\nBrett Kavanaugh, the president's Supreme Court nominee, will have a chance to leave his mark on a series of health care cases — and specifically the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare.\n\nRACHEL MARTIN, HOST:\n\nIf Judge Brett Kavanaugh is confirmed to the U.S. Supreme Court, he will likely hear several cases related to health care - specifically, the Affordable Care Act. President Trump and congressional Republicans have been trying for years to dismantle the health care law, and many of their actions have ended up in court. But NPR's Alison Kodjak reports that based on Kavanaugh's record, his decisions could please President Trump in some cases, and in others, he may surprise the president.\n\nALISON KODJAK, BYLINE: Appeals court Judge Brett Kavanaugh had the chance to rule that the individual mandate, the core of the Affordable Care Act, was unconstitutional. But Kavanaugh didn't take the opportunity.\n\nCHRIS JACOBS: Judge Kavanaugh basically said that the court should not decide the mandate case because Congress could easily fix the mandate prior to it taking effect.\n\nKODJAK: That's Chris Jacobs, a conservative health policy analyst and founder of Juniper Research. In the same ruling, he says, Kavanaugh laid the groundwork for the Supreme Court to later uphold the law. He argued that if Congress treated the mandate's penalty like a tax that people could choose to pay if they didn't want insurance, then it would pass constitutional muster. Congress didn't change the law, but the Supreme Court bought the argument.\n\nJACOBS: That was the argument that Chief Justice Roberts adopted in 2012 at the Supreme Court.\n\nKODJAK: That opinion by Kavanaugh makes some conservatives worried about how he'll rule if he's confirmed to the high court. And it also shows that when it comes to the Affordable Care Act, Kavanaugh may be hard to pin down. Sara Rosenbaum is a professor of health law and policy at George Washington University.\n\nSARA ROSENBAUM: The cold, hard truth is, of course, there's no one thing as the ACA, right? The ACA was a bundle of changes to many, many U.S. laws. I think it's actually very difficult to say with any kind of certainty where someday maybe Justice Kavanaugh would be.\n\nKODJAK: There are several ACA-related cases winding their way through the courts, like one in Kentucky related to Medicaid. A federal judge less than two weeks ago ruled that the Trump administration was wrong to allow Kentucky to require Medicaid recipients to work for their health benefits. If Kavanaugh hears it, he could well end up siding with the patients over the executive branch.\n\nROSENBAUM: He is somebody who really looks skeptically at agency overreach.\n\nKODJAK: In other Medicaid-related cases, Kavanaugh could go the other way, says Sarah Somers of the National Health Law Program. For example, courts are divided over whether states can block Medicaid from paying for health care services provided by Planned Parenthood, even if they're not abortions. Suppose that case came before Kavanaugh. Somers worries he might not even agree that Medicaid patients have the right to take such cases to court.\n\nSARAH SOMERS: We haven't seen a lot of clear evidence about how Judge Kavanaugh would rule on Medicaid cases, but the general philosophy that, you know, is consistent with his writings and his decisions, you know, makes us wary.\n\nKODJAK: Kavanaugh described himself in his speech last year to the Heritage Foundation as a judge who sticks to the legal text. And that could make it hard to predict exactly how he'll rule on questions of health law, says Nicholas Bagley, a professor at the University of Michigan Law School.\n\nNICHOLAS BAGLEY: Politics matters. You don't want to blind yourself to that. If you have a conservative justice on the court, that's very different from having a liberal justice. But the law also matters, and the law does constrain.\n\nKODJAK: And by all accounts, the Affordable Care Act is a complicated law.

Trump Supporters Cheer Quick Starts On Campaign Promises In His First Weeks\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Marian Carrasquero/NPR Marian Carrasquero/NPR\n\nAlgonquin, Ill., is a Republican stronghold. The growing town of 28,000 is about an hour's drive northwest of Chicago in McHenry County, the only one of six in the metro area to vote for President Trump.\n\nAt Short Stacks, a small diner on Main Street, Ginger Underwood sits at a table with her two adult daughters. She voted for Donald Trump and says that, so far, she is glad she did.\n\nI think Trump is doing exactly what he said he was going to do when he ran for office, she says. So that's fine with me, that he's doing what he's doing.\n\nIt's been 12 days since Trump was sworn into office and between a flurry of executive actions and his choice for the U.S. Supreme Court, it has been a whirlwind of activity.\n\nUnderwood, who does volunteer work for a local environmental group, says she has no worries about the pace of executive actions during Trump's first days — and, in fact, likes them all. But she does say she wishes the president would be more, as she says, tactful, when he does things like imposing restrictions on people traveling from seven predominantly Muslim countries.\n\nNot just suddenly doing it with no notice — not surprising his fellow Republicans, she says.\n\nBoth of Underwood's daughters are independents, and neither voted for Trump. Jessica Underwood, 40, says she's trying to come to terms with the new administration. But the horse trainer says she's not a sore loser.\n\nHe won fair and square, she says. I'm not impressed, but now I feel we have to live with it.\n\nHer sister, Dana, 43, is less accepting.\n\nAll these decisions affect people's lives, the professional musician says. I can't get past the fact that we've elected somebody who deals with conflict by tweeting.\n\nAfter hearing what her daughters had to say, Ginger says she recently decided she's actually a Libertarian; all three agree they would have voted for Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders.\n\nNo more Obamacare\n\nThere's also agreement at a nearby table, where retired teacher Trudy Kirsch, 64, is eating lunch with her son John, 32.\n\nI think he's doing great — absolutely wonderful, Kirsch says.\n\nKirsch says she is pleased with Trump's pick of Neil Gorsuch for the Supreme Court, even though she anticipates strong opposition. She likes Trump's push to get rid of Obamacare and his intention to build a wall at the U.S.-Mexico border\n\nAnd if there was not a problem with people coming over illegally, we would not need the wall, Kirsch says. But if it's broken, then we need to start looking at other options on how do you fix it.\n\nJohn Kirsch, who has owned and run a landscaping business for four years, agrees that Obamacare needs to go, saying that he has struggled with rising health insurance premiums. He also says he appreciated Trump's promise to cut taxes on small businesses and his quick executive action to cut regulations.\n\nHe's changing all the rules, and I love it\n\nAt Anthony's Barbershop down the street, proprietor Anthony Orlandino is joking with a friend while he trims his hair. The 69-year-old has had his shop on Main Street for 14 years.\n\nYou know what he's got going for him — he's got Twitter going for him, Orlandino says. Now he can actually put it out. 'Here's what I got — don't listen to the media, this is what I'm doing.' \n\nAnd Orlandino says he simply likes Trump's style.\n\nHe's a businessman, not a politician, he says. Politicians have gotta talk from both sides of their mouth, gotta please everybody because they want votes. He don't have to. He's saying, listen, this is the way it's going to be. He's changing all the rules, and I love it.\n\nDivided on travel ban\n\nIn the parking lot outside of a Meijer grocery store, a few cars have Obama bumper stickers on them. But Annette Jones, who's helping her granddaughter load groceries into the car, is a Republican who voted for Donald Trump — and she is, as she puts it, ticked about the executive order on travel restrictions.\n\nI thought he was doing good until he stopped all these people from coming in, and had them all at the airport. And I think that's wrong, she says. So now it's like ... wait and see, what else he's going to do.\n\nBut Angela Fletcher, a 36-year-old social worker who also voted for Trump, says that executive order doesn't bother her at all.\n\nI'm happy with him, she says. I know that's not the popular answer, but I like it, and don't have any issues with things he's done so far, I guess.\n\nFletcher, like many Trump voters in this small town, says she appreciates that the president is moving quickly to turn many of his campaign promises into policy.
Trump Suffers Huge Failure As GOP Withdraws Health Care Bill\n\nAccording to White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer, President Trump left it all on the field in terms of his efforts to gain support for the Republican bill to repeal and replace Obamacare.\n\nKELLY MCEVERS, HOST:\n\nNPR White House correspondent Tamara Keith is still on the line with us. And, Tam, as we just heard, Obamacare isn't totally falling apart, right? I mean, it's complicated. But this was the main message that President Trump gave today in his statement. It seems he's betting on Obamacare to fall apart so that he can then force Democrats to work with him on a new plan. What if it doesn't fall apart?\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nTAMARA KEITH, BYLINE: That is a good question. I think that, you know, in politics sometimes it's about branding. And Donald Trump is definitely someone who focuses on branding. You could end up ultimately with something that becomes keep it and fix it but call it something else. And for now, though, they're just planning to move on to tax reform.\n\nMCEVERS: That's right. And what are the prospects of that do you think? I mean given, what we've just seen happen on the Hill and the divisions we see in the Republican Party and the Republicans' inability to unify over this. Is tax reform going to be as easy as they're making it out to seem?\n\nKEITH: Well, Congressman Byrne was right when he just said that this will be harder than repealing and replacing Obamacare. You know, a congressional aide, a Republican aide told me that it's going to take months to draft the legislation, that at the moment the House, Senate and White House don't even see eye to eye on a path forward on tax reform. And, you know, let's just remember that Congress has been trying to do tax reform for decades. Literally, the last time tax reform happened was 1986.\n\nAUDIE CORNISH, HOST:\n\nNPR White House correspondent Tamara Keith. Thank you very much.\n\nKEITH: You're welcome.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF AMON TOBIN SONG, EASY MUFFIN)\n\nCopyright © 2017 NPR. All rights reserved.

The Longest Government Shutdown In History, No Longer — How 1995 Changed Everything\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Greg Gibson/AP Greg Gibson/AP\n\nIt took three full weeks — 21 days — for President Bill Clinton and the Republican Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich to settle an impasse that partially shut down the government in 1995-96.\n\nThat particular moment is a landmark in U.S. political history, birthing a new era of American gridlock that arguably led to the sharp partisanship that has gripped the nation — and delivered a new record for a partial government shutdown, marking Day 22 on Saturday.\n\nShutdowns had been a rare thing in U.S. history. The first one came just over 40 years ago, 200 years after the country's founding. But since that time, the fisticuffs of divided government and spending disputes have become fairly commonplace — if not usually this lengthy.\n\nFirst shutdown was in 1976\n\nThe first partial shutdown came under President Gerald Ford in 1976 when he vetoed a spending bill amid a dispute over the budget for the Department of Health, Education & Welfare (a department that no longer exists in that form or under that name).\n\nA whole slew of them followed over the next two decades. There were five during Jimmy Carter's four years in office, and eight between 1981 and 1989 during Ronald Reagan's administration.\n\nBut the finger-pointing then — and the rhetoric — can feel quite familiar to today. In 1984, President Reagan laid the blame on what he saw as intransigent House Democrats.\n\nThis has been typical of what has been happening since we've been here, he said, and you can lay this on the majority party in the House of Representatives.\n\nEarly shutdowns had familiar rhetoric but unfamiliar priorities\n\nThere are some big differences between those early government shutdowns and what's seen today.\n\nThey tended to revolve around basically bargaining over routine government activities, said Duke University political scientist David Rohde.\n\nThere would be a budget negotiation and maybe a fight over some item large or small — perhaps funding for a new nuclear-powered aircraft carrier (1978) or the MX missile (1982).\n\nThe deadline would pass; the government would partially shut down; but the two sides would continue negotiating, confident that they would find some quick compromise that would get everything up and operating again.\n\nThere was a lot less political heat, Rohde said, and a lot less attention paid by the general public.\n\nThen came the 1990s\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Denis Paquin/AP Denis Paquin/AP\n\nIn fall and winter of 1995 and 1996, Clinton was president and Republicans had control of the House for the first time in 40 years. Gingrich wanted deep budget cuts after Republicans took back the House in 1994 with their Contract with America.\n\nGingrich felt he had a mandate to enact strictures on big government. His contract promised to make government spend less and laid out galvanizing principles for his followers in Congress that also laid the foundation for the Tea Party two decades later — and the modern Republican Party.\n\nPresident Clinton, a Southern Democrat, said he was committed to a balanced budget. But the two sides couldn't agree on which long-term budget projections to use — the White House wanted to use data from its Office of Management and Budget, while Republicans wanted the Congressional Budget Office's. The CBO had a less optimistic view of revenue that would be coming in, thus requiring deeper spending cuts.\n\nClinton accused the GOP of having failed to pass the straightforward legislation necessary to keep the government running without imposing sharp hikes in Medicare premiums and deep cuts in education and the environment.\n\nYouTube\n\nGingrich responded: We think all the president has to do is commit to a seven-year balanced budget with honest numbers and an honest scoring system.\n\nThe language was bureaucratic, but it represented a huge change in how such negotiations were conducted. The dispute wasn't simply a matter of haggling over a specific department budget or a single line item; it was about ideology, getting to the very core of how big the federal government should be and how it should operate.\n\nThe first shutdown that session was five days, followed by a 21-day impasse that had stood until now as the longest government shutdown ever.\n\nNo easy resolution\n\nToday's shutdown continues without a clear way out, short of the president declaring a national emergency at the Southern border and signing spending bills.\n\nThere was no quick and easy solution to the dispute in 1995-96, either. Each side was certain that the public would back them. As it turned out, Gingrich and the GOP lost that particular bet. Polls at the time showed that the public put the blame on the House speaker and his party and that they wanted the government operating again.\n\nCracks formed in the Republican solidarity, and in a session of Congress held on New Year's Eve, Republican Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole of Kansas signaled that the fight was over for his fellow Republicans.\n\nWe ought to end this, Dole said on the Senate floor. I mean, it's gotten to the point where it's a little ridiculous as far as this senator is concerned.\n\nAssociated Press YouTube\n\nThe government reopened days later. It was widely seen as a setback for the GOP, and the shutdown of 1995-96 became known as a cautionary tale for years to come.\n\nTwo decades without a shutdown — for a reason\n\nAfter the political pain that was felt in the mid-1990s over that shutdown, there wasn't another one until 2013, when Republicans used budget negotiations to try to defund the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare.\n\nIt didn't work.\n\nThe shutdown did last 16 days, but, as was the case some 18 years earlier, Republicans failed to win the big prize they had targeted that year.\n\nDemocrats had their own government shutdown defeat early last year. They did so in an effort to force passage of legislation aimed at giving legal immigration status to those granted special DACA, or Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, status, which includes the so-called DREAMers.\n\nIt was a miscalculation, and Democrats backed down quickly when poll numbers were shifting against them.\n\nFast forward to today's shutdown, driven by Trump's demand for $5.7 billion to build a wall along the Southern border with Mexico. Rohde said it's a lot like in 1995, in that it's not a mere budget fight.\n\nBut this impasse is especially difficult because of one major factor.\n\nTrump's calculation politically is not about the center of the electorate, Rhode said. That's the difference.\n\nThe president has said he's worried about losing his hardcore base of supporters. They are anything but the kind of centrist swing voters whose opinion can give one side or another the upper hand in such negotiations.\n\nBut Trump sees them as his key to victory, and he's pushing Republicans who disagree that they need to get on board as well. Small cracks have begun to show among Republicans in Congress, but it's not a gusher.\n\nAnd all of that makes finding a resolution especially difficult.
If Republicans Repeal Health Law, Paying For A Replacement Could Be Tough\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n\nLeading Republicans in Congress have vowed that even if they repeal most of the Affordable Care Act early in 2017, a replacement won't hurt those now receiving benefits.\n\nRepublicans will seek to ensure that no one is worse off, said House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., in an interview with a Wisconsin newspaper in early December. The purpose here is to bring relief to people who are suffering from Obamacare so that they can get something better.\n\nBut that may be difficult for one big reason: Republicans have also pledged to repeal the taxes that Democrats used to pay for their health law. Without that money, Republicans will have far less to spend on whatever they opt for as a replacement.\n\nIt will be hard to have comparable coverage if they start with less money, Gail Wilensky, a health economist who ran the Medicare and Medicaid programs under President George H.W. Bush, said in an interview.\n\nRepealing all the ACA's taxes as part of repeal and delay only makes a true replacement harder, wrote Loren Adler and Paul Ginsburg of the Brookings Institution in a white paper out Monday. It would make it much more difficult to achieve a sustainable replacement plan that provides meaningful coverage without increasing deficits.\n\nThe health law's subsidies to individuals buying insurance and the Medicaid expansion are funded by two big pots of money.\n\nThe first is a series of taxes, including levies on individuals with incomes greater than $200,000, health insurers, makers of medical devices, brand-name drugmakers, people who use tanning salons, and employer plans that are so generous they trigger the much-maligned Cadillac Tax. Some of those measures have not yet taken effect.\n\nHowever, the Congressional Budget Office estimated in early 2016 that repealing those provisions would reduce taxes by an estimated $1 trillion over the decade from 2016-2025.\n\nThe other big pot of money that funds the benefits in the health law comes from reductions in federal spending for Medicare (and to a lesser extent, Medicaid). Those include trims in the scheduled payments to hospitals, insurance companies and other health care providers, as well as increased premiums for higher-income Medicare beneficiaries.\n\nCBO estimated in 2015 that canceling the cuts would boost federal spending by $879 billion from 2016 to 2025.\n\nThe GOP, in the partial repeal bill that passed in January and was vetoed by President Obama, proposed to cancel the tax increases in the health law, as well as the health premium subsidies and Medicaid expansion. But it would have kept the Medicare and Medicaid payment reductions. Because the benefits that would be repealed cost more than the revenue being lost through the repeal of the taxes, the result would have been net savings to the federal government — to the tune of about $317.5 billion over 10 years, said CBO.\n\nBut those savings — even if Republicans could find a way to apply them to a new bill — wouldn't be enough to fund the broad expansion of coverage offered under the ACA.\n\nIf Republicans follow that playbook again, their plans for replacement could be hampered because they will still lose access to tax revenues. That means they cannot fund equivalent benefits unless they find some other source of revenue.\n\nSome analysts fear the money may come from more cuts to Medicare and Medicaid. Medicare and Medicaid face fundamental threats, perhaps the most since they were established in the 1960s, said Edwin Park of the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, in a recent webinar.\n\nRepublicans in the House, however, have identified one other potential source of funding. Our plan caps the open-ended tax break on employer-based premiums, said their proposal, called A Better Way.\n\nHouse Republicans say that would be preferable to the Cadillac Tax in the ACA, which is scheduled to go into effect in 2020 and taxes only the most generous plans.\n\nBut health policy analysts say ending the employer tax break could be even more controversial.\n\nCapping the amount of health benefits that workers can accept free of taxes would reduce incentives for employers to continue to offer coverage, said Georgetown University's Sabrina Corlette.\n\nJames Klein, president of the American Benefits Council, which represents large employers, said they would look on such a proposal as potentially more damaging to the future of employer-provided insurance than the so-called Cadillac Tax, which his group has lobbied hard against.\n\nThis is not a time one wants to disrupt the employer marketplace, Klein said in an interview. It seems perplexing to think that if the ACA is going to be repealed, either in large part or altogether, it would be succeeded by a proposal imposing a tax on people who get health coverage from their employer.\n\nWilensky said that as an economist, getting rid of the tax exclusion for employer-provided health insurance would put her and all the other economists in seventh heaven. Economists have argued for years that having the tax code favor benefits over cash wages encourages overly generous insurance and overuse of health services.\n\nBut at the same time, she added, I am painfully aware of how unpopular my most favored change would be.\n\nRepublicans will have one other option if and when they try to replace the ACA's benefits — not paying for them at all, thus adding to the federal deficit.\n\nWhile that sounds unlikely for a party dedicated to fiscal responsibility, it wouldn't be unprecedented. In 2003 the huge Medicare prescription drug law was passed by a Republican Congress — with no specified funding to pay for the benefits.
FACT CHECK: Who's Right About Protections For Pre-Existing Conditions?\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Drew Angerer/Getty Images Drew Angerer/Getty Images\n\nEnsuring that people with pre-existing health conditions can get and keep health insurance is the most popular part of the Affordable Care Act. It has also become a flashpoint in this fall's midterm campaigns across the country.\n\nAnd not only is the ACA protection, which mostly applies to people who buy their own coverage, at risk. It's also possible that pre-existing condition protections that predate the federal health law could be in play.\n\nDemocrats charge that Republicans' opposition to the ACA puts pre-existing protections in peril, both by their (unsuccessful) votes in Congress in 2017 to repeal and replace the law and via a federal lawsuit underway in Texas.\n\nEight hundred thousand West Virginians with pre-existing conditions [are] in jeopardy of losing their health care, said Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va.\n\nRepublicans disagree. Pre-existing conditions are safe, President Trump declared at a rally in West Virginia for Patrick Morrisey, Manchin's GOP opponent. Morrisey, West Virginia's attorney general, is part of a group of state officials suing to overturn the ACA.\n\nWho's right? Like everything else in health care, it's complicated.\n\nWhat's clear, however, is that voters want protections. Even majorities of Republicans told pollsters this summer that it's very important that guarantees of coverage for pre-existing conditions remain law.\n\nHere are some key details that can help put the current political arguments in perspective.\n\nPre-existing conditions are common\n\nPre-existing conditions are previous or ongoing medical issues that predate health insurance enrollment. The problem is that the term is a grab bag whose limits have never been defined. It certainly applies to serious ongoing conditions such as cancer, heart disease and asthma. But insurers also have used it to apply to conditions like pregnancy or far more trivial medical issues such as acne or a distant history of depression.\n\nThe Kaiser Family Foundation estimated in 2016 that more than a quarter of adults younger than 65 — about 52 million people — have a pre-existing health condition that very likely would have prevented them from purchasing individual health insurance under the pre-ACA rules. (Kaiser Health News is an editorially independent program of the foundation.)\n\nProtections vary by the kind of insurance you have\n\nBut what protections people with pre-existing conditions have depends on how they get their coverage. For that reason, it's not right to say everyone with health problems is potentially at risk, as Democrats frequently suggest.\n\nFor example, Medicare, the federal health program for seniors, and Medicaid, the federal-state health plan for low-income people, don't discriminate in either coverage or price on the basis of pre-existing conditions. The two programs together cover roughly 130 million Americans — nearly a third of the population.\n\nThe majority of Americans get their coverage through work. In 1996, Congress protected people with pre-existing conditions who have employer-based coverage by passing the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, known as HIPAA.\n\nHIPAA was intended to eliminate job lock, or the inability of a person with a pre-existing condition (or a family member with a pre-existing condition) to change jobs because coverage at the new job would most likely come with a waiting period during which the condition would not be covered.\n\nHIPAA banned those waiting periods for people who had maintained continuous coverage, meaning a break of no more than 63 days, and the law limited waiting periods to one year for those who were previously uninsured. In addition, it prohibited insurers from denying coverage to or raising premiums for workers based on their own or a family member's health status or medical history.\n\nHIPAA was less successful in protecting people without job-based insurance. It sought to guarantee that people with pre-existing conditions leaving the group market could buy individual coverage if they had remained continuously covered. But the law did not put limits on what individual insurers could charge for those policies. In many cases, insurers charged so much for these HIPAA conversion policies that almost no one could afford them.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act, passed in 2010, built on those 1996 protections and specifically sought to help people buying their own coverage. It barred all health insurers from excluding people because of pre-existing conditions, charging them higher premiums and imposing waiting periods for coverage of those conditions.\n\nWhile the protections were mostly aimed at the individual insurance market, where only a small portion of Americans get coverage, the ACA also made some changes to the employer market for people with pre-existing conditions, by banning annual and lifetime coverage limits.\n\nWill protections on pre-existing conditions become collateral damage?\n\nIn 2017, the GOP-controlled House and Senate voted on several versions of a bill that would have dramatically overhauled the ACA, including its protections of pre-existing conditions. Under the last bill that narrowly failed in the Senate, states would have been given authority to allow insurers to waive some of those protections, including the one requiring the same premiums be charged regardless of health status.\n\nIn February, 18 GOP attorneys general and two GOP governors filed suit in federal court in Texas. They charge that because Congress in its 2017 tax bill eliminated the ACA's penalty for not having insurance, the entire federal health law is unconstitutional. Their argument is that the Supreme Court upheld the ACA in 2012 based only on Congress' taxing power, and that without the tax, the rest of the law should fall.\n\nThe Trump administration, technically the defendant in that case, said in June that it disagreed that the entire law should fall. But it is arguing that the parts of the law addressing pre-existing conditions are so tightly connected to the tax penalty that they should be struck down.\n\nClearly, if the lawsuit prevails in either its original form or the form preferred by the Trump administration, pre-existing protections are not safe, as the president claimed.\n\nEven more complicated, the protections written into HIPAA were rewritten and incorporated into the ACA, so if the ACA in whole or part were to be struck down, HIPAA's pre-existing condition protections might go away, too.\n\nRepublicans in Congress have introduced a series of proposals they say would replicate the existing protections. But critics contend none of them cover as many situations as the ACA does. For example, a bill unveiled by several Republican senators in August would require insurers to offer coverage to people with pre-existing health conditions, but not require coverage of the conditions themselves.\n\nThat hasn't stopped Republicans from claiming that they support protections for pre-existing conditions.\n\nMake no mistake about it: Patients with pre-existing conditions should be covered, says Wisconsin GOP Senate candidate Leah Vukmir, who is running to unseat Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin. Health care has been a major issue in that race, as well as many others. Yet Vukmir was recently hailed by Vice President Pence as someone who will vote to fully repeal and replace Obamacare.\n\nMeanwhile, Democrats who are chastising their Republican opponents over the issue are sometimes going a bit over the top, too.\n\nAn example is Manchin's claim about the threat to coverage for 800,000 people in West Virginia. West Virginia's population is only 1.8 million and more than 1 million of those people are on Medicare or Medicaid. That would mean every other person in the state has a pre-existing condition. A recent study found West Virginia has a relatively high level of pre-existing conditions among adults, but it is still less than 40 percent.\n\nKaiser Health News, a nonprofit news service, is an editorially independent program of the Kaiser Family Foundation and is not affiliated with Kaiser Permanente.

As President Trump Nears 100th Day, White House Touts 'Historic Accomplishments'\n\nAs the 100th day of Donald Trump's presidency nears, the White House is touting 28 laws it says Trump worked with Congress to enact. But not all legislation is created equal. NPR has a reality check.\n\nARI SHAPIRO, HOST:\n\nEven though President Trump calls the 100-days measure ridiculous, the White House is still touting what one press release called the president's historic accomplishments, including 28 laws he signed since taking office. They say that number is more than any president since Truman. When I saw that number - 28 bills signed into law - it seemed high to me. I was surprised, and so I asked NPR's Tamara Keith to look into how we get to that number. And she's here in the studio with us. Hi, Tam.\n\nTAMARA KEITH, BYLINE: Hi.\n\nSHAPIRO: Sounds like a big number - is it?\n\nKEITH: It is a big number relatively speaking. Political scientists, though, will tell you, don't measure legislation by adding. Measure by looking at significance. And when it comes to significance, whether these bills change the status quo or introduce a new policy idea, there's less to show for President Trump's first 100 days.\n\nI just want to give you an example, a little piece of audio where Press Secretary Sean Spicer did what he often does - describe the president's accomplishments for the day. And here's the part where he talked about legislation.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF PRESS CONFERENCE)\n\nSEAN SPICER: He also signed House Joint Resolution 42, allowing states to drug test unemployment insurance claims, and H.R. 1362, naming a VA outpatient clinic in Pago Pago, American Samoa.\n\nSHAPIRO: OK, so naming a VA clinic and, for example, repeal and replacing Obamacare would each be one point on the legislative scoreboard, but they're very different kinds of bills.\n\nKEITH: Very different. And 2 of the 28 bills do actually name VA facilities. But 13 of the measures are significant, and they're part of something called the Congressional Review Act. That allows Congress to overturn rules created by federal agencies that haven't yet taken effect.\n\nSo President Trump and the Republican Congress came in, and they said, we want to overturn a bunch of these Obama-era rules. And some of those are significant. This included a stream protection rule. Environmentalists, Democrats say that this is an important environmental protection. Republicans and others say that it was hurting the coal industry.\n\nSHAPIRO: So when you look at the legislative scorecard that the White House puts out now and compare it to the campaign promises that candidate Trump made, how do they compare?\n\nKEITH: They're kind of apples and oranges. When candidate Trump in October put out his contract with the American voter, he said that he was going to introduce and push for the passage of 10 bills. Of those 10 bills, only one has been introduced, and that is the measure to repeal and replace Obamacare. As we know, that is...\n\nSHAPIRO: That didn't pass.\n\nKEITH: It did not. It didn't even get a vote.\n\nSHAPIRO: Right.\n\nKEITH: It may get a vote at some point some time. They don't want to put a timetable on it. And then there's the tax reform measure that isn't a measure yet, that is broad principles that Scott talked about - not a bill yet. But the Trump administration would argue this is not how a Republican president should be judged. A Democratic president wants to create things, wants to make programs. A Republican president wants to undo regulation.\n\nSHAPIRO: They want government to do less. They want it to be smaller.\n\nKEITH: Exactly. And in that respect, the Trump administration says, look; we've done these 13 rule rollbacks. And they say the biggest legislative accomplishment they point to is getting Neil Gorsuch confirmed to the Supreme Court.\n\nSHAPIRO: When we're talking about legislation passed in the first 100 days, it's not only a referendum on the president. This is also about Congress, right?\n\nKEITH: It absolutely is and how the president works with Congress. And even if his party controls both Houses of Congress, things don't necessarily happen quickly or easily. George W. Bush's first tax cut, his No Child Left Behind law - those didn't happen in his first 100 days.\n\nPresident Obama got the stimulus bill passed, but he didn't get Obamacare or Dodd-Frank done until much later. So for President Trump, if at the end of this year he hasn't gotten a significant legislative accomplishment, he will not be judged kindly.\n\nSHAPIRO: NPR's Tamara Keith, thanks for the explanation.\n\nKEITH: You're welcome.\n\nCopyright © 2017 NPR.

Lawmakers In The House Try Again In 2016 To Repeal Obamacare\n\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan announced on Tuesday that the first order of business will be putting a bill on the House floor that would repeal the Affordable Care Act, also referred to as Obamacare.\n\nDAVID GREENE, HOST:\n\nWell, the House of Representatives is now back to work. Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan has already decided on the first order of business, and it's a pretty big one.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH)\n\nPAUL RYAN: The House will put an Obamacare repeal bill on the floor and pass it and put it on the president's desk.\n\nGREENE: Repealing Obamacare. Well, this sets the stage for a showdown with the White House over the president's namesake health care law, and NPR's Scott Horsley is here to talk about this.\n\nHey Scott.\n\nSCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: Good to be with you David.\n\nGREENE: So the House has already voted to repeal Obamacare dozens of times now. Is this vote special in some way?\n\nHORSLEY: David, this is the first time the U.S. Senate has also voted for repeal.\n\nGREENE: They've already voted to repeal it?\n\nHORSLEY: For a long time, when Democrats controlled the Senate they were able to block Republican initiatives like this. And even though Democrats are now in the minority in the Senate they still have a filibuster. So usually it takes 60 votes for the Republicans to do anything, and they don't have that. In this case though, the Senate Republicans were able to use those special reconciliation rules to pass the Obamacare repeal measure with just a simple majority, and so instead of being bottled up like so many other efforts to repeal the ACA, this one has already cleared the Senate and that means today's House vote will send it, as Speaker Ryan promised, to the president's desk.\n\nGREENE: OK so it is special. You've got both chambers that will likely have voted for this. Presumably, the president is not going to go along with this.\n\nHORSLEY: He is not going to go along (laughter). The White House has been very clear that the president will veto this bill. The administration says, to repeal the Affordable Care Act would take health insurance away from some 17 million people who've gotten coverage under the law. They also say it would weaken protection for another 150 million people who still get insurance through their employers. So there's never been any doubt the president would use his veto pen to defend the health care law. In this case, he has an extra incentive to do so because the bill would also strip funding from Planned Parenthood. So two big targets for the president.\n\nGREENE: So what happens after this? We've got this largely symbolic vote by Congress, veto by the president. I mean, does this debate get sort of put to rest at some point?\n\nHORSLEY: Not at all. The Republicans plan to schedule a veto override vote in the weeks ahead. They do not have the two-thirds majority they need to overturn the president's veto, but that'll be another symbolic gesture by the GOP. And this will also help to frame the contrast for the 2016 presidential election. All of the Republican candidates running for the White House have promised to undo Obamacare. All the Democrats have promised to preserve it. So voters will have a chance to weigh in on this debate just as they did in 2012. You remember back then when the Supreme Court upheld the Affordable Care Act, Mitt Romney said, if we want to get rid of Obamacare, we're going to have to put a Republican in the White House. Four years later, that's still the case.\n\nGREENE: So it's going to remain in the political conversation obviously this year. But in terms of substance, process, the chances of this law actually ending - I mean, you've got a lot of Americans, polls show, who have very negative feelings about this health care law. But you've got a law that's been in place now for six years. I mean, could it be undone somehow?\n\nHORSLEY: You know, David, there's been a school of thought for a long time among supporters of Obamacare that once the American people get accustomed to these protections they're going to be very hard to undo, that Republicans would actually be taking subsidies away from people, denying coverage to millions and that that would just be politically untenable. We're seeing right now something of a test case in Kentucky, where the newly elected Republican governor campaigned against Obamacare, but he has softened his rhetoric somewhat since he's actually taken office. At first he wanted to roll back the state's expansion of Medicaid, which was very widespread in Kentucky. Now he's talking about modifying it instead. However, there's been no such softening of the rhetoric in Congress or on the White House campaign trail. So Republicans insist they still want to get rid of this law root and branch.\n\nGREENE: All right. NPR's Scott Horsley talking to us about the vote in the House today to repeal Obamacare. It follows on the heels of a vote in the Senate and expected presidential veto at some point too. Thanks Scott.\n\nHORSLEY: My pleasure David.\n\nCopyright © 2016 NPR. All rights reserved.

The 'Young Invincibles': A Huge Hurdle For Obamacare\n\nYoung, healthy people referred to as young invincibles pose a serious challenge to the success of President Obama's expanded health care coverage, the Affordable Care Act. Kaiser Health's Julie Rovner explains more about this group of uninsured Americans.\n\nFARAI CHIDEYA, HOST:\n\nNow it's time for our regular segment Words You'll Hear, where we try to understand what's happening in the news by parsing some of the words associated with it. This week, our words are young invincibles. We're talking about healthy young people who don't have health insurance. They're not being covered at work, and they're choosing to bypass health care coverage available through the Affordable Care Act. They could be the downfall of the long-term success of President Obama's legacy expanded health care coverage.\n\nJoining us to help explain more about them is Julie Rovner from Kaiser Health News. Hi, Julie.\n\nJULIE ROVNER: Hi. How are you?\n\nCHIDEYA: I'm great. So first of all what are the characteristics of young invincibles? How young are we talking about and what's keeping them from buying health insurance?\n\nROVNER: Well, originally young invincibles were males in their 20s. That was how they were always thought of, you know - young guys who felt like they were invincible, so they didn't need health insurance. They would never get sick. They would never have an accident. More recently, the term has come to describe, I think, what most of us think of as millennials, both young men and young women. But the idea is still the same. They feel like they don't need health insurance because they're not going to get sick.\n\nCHIDEYA: So why is it a problem for insurers and especially for the Affordable Care Act if these folks don't buy insurance?\n\nROVNER: Well, the Affordable Care Act made individual insurance available to people who were older and sicker, and they jumped at the chance to buy it. The hope was that younger people would buy it because they were required to and their lower expenses would help balance out the risk pool, helping them basically subsidize older, sicker people on the theory that someday they'll become older, sicker people and young people will subsidize them.\n\nCHIDEYA: Last week, Aetna at first said that they would be pulling back on coverage in the Affordable Care Act exchanges, saying they were losing money in large part due to these young invincibles, but then another story emerged. So can you walk us through Aetna's move?\n\nROVNER: They're pulling out of most of the places where they are - have been selling insurance. And, you know, they said it was due to losses, and I don't think anybody doubts they have been losing money. But what came out shortly after that announcement was a letter from Aetna to the Justice Department saying that if the Justice Department didn't approve Aetna's merger with Humana, they would therefore have to start pulling out, which is exactly what they did.\n\nSo some people saw that as kind of a threat that, you know, if you don't do what we want, then we're not going to participate anymore, but others point out that, you know, Aetna has an obligation to its shareholders. And even though it makes lots and lots and lots of money in general, it was, in fact, losing money in the exchange markets. Pretty much every insurer is complaining that this has not worked exactly as they had wanted, and it's not just the lack of young people. There are unhealthy young people, and there are healthy older people. But basically they don't have the mix that they had hoped for.\n\nCHIDEYA: So what can policymakers and/or insurers do to convince the young invincibles to actually buy into the coverage?\n\nROVNER: Well, one problem that a lot of insurers have talked about - it's been too easy to buy insurance outside the open enrollment period, which means that you can wait until you get sick to buy insurance. And that's been a problem.\n\nThis year is the first year that the penalty actually goes up to its full amount for not having insurance. So now depending on how much they earn, young people could be responsible for fines that go up to about $2,500. So that could convince some of them that maybe they would like to spend that money on insurance instead. And then, of course, depending on who's elected president and who's elected to control Congress next year, there could be some more changes to try to smooth out some of the bumps that have been seen in the implementation of the law.\n\nCHIDEYA: Julie Rovner covers health policy issues for Kaiser Health News. Thanks for joining us, Julie.\n\nROVNER: Thank you.\n\nCopyright © 2016 NPR. All rights reserved.

'Shame On Ted': Health Care Protests Greet Ted Cruz In Texas\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Cliff Owen/AP Cliff Owen/AP\n\nAt an event Wednesday night, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz was met by about 150 protesters who oppose the Senate's efforts to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. On a hot evening, they stood outside a hotel in McKinney, a north Dallas suburb, shouting shame on Ted and save Medicaid.\n\nThe by-invitation, town hall-style event was held one day after the senator's appearance in McAllen was disrupted by protesters concerned about health care as well as immigration.\n\nCruz is holding several town halls across Texas during the current congressional recess; he will also be in San Antonio and Austin this week.\n\nThe audience Wednesday night was mostly veterans who are friendly to the senator. The event was sponsored by the conservative group Concerned Veterans For America.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Wade Goodwyn/NPR Wade Goodwyn/NPR\n\nThere were just four to five questions from the audience and all were screened in advance. The Texas senator spent much of the event advocating for more health care choices for veterans beyond the VA hospital system. He also reiterated his opposition to the Affordable Care Act but acknowledged that getting the votes in the Senate to repeal it remains a challenge. He was also one of a small group of Republicans to oppose the Senate health care bill, arguing that it didn't go far enough to roll back Obamacare, as the ACA is also known.\n\nCruz said it is critical for Congress to focus on lowering premiums and to honor our promise to repeal Obamacare — it isn't working and people are hurting across the state and across the country.\n\ntoggle caption Wade Goodwyn/NPR\n\nSen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana also faced a confrontational town hall last week. An attendee in Baton Rouge reportedly interrupted his remarks to ask him to vote against that hideous bill. He said he hasn't decided how he will vote on the Senate's health care bill because he wants to judge the final product. Republican Sen. Susan Collins, who also opposed the Senate bill, told reporters in Eastport, Maine, that she's been hearing from constituents who are deeply concerned about the Senate bill.\n\nAt least seven more Republican members of Congress and more than 20 Democrats have town halls planned around the country this week, several of which will focus on health care.\n\nTown halls became popular and contentious venues for voicing concern over health care in the summer of 2009 when President Barack Obama's Affordable Care Act was being debated in Congress. Many of those gatherings turned into shouting matches and, in some cases, physical fights.
Poll: Americans Increasingly Think Their Health Care Will Get Worse\n\nWhen it comes to health care, Americans may be having buyer's remorse.\n\nMore adults approve of the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, than the alternative health care bill passed this month by House Republicans, according to a poll published Wednesday by the Kaiser Family Foundation.\n\nThe numbers come just as members of the Senate are hammering out details of their own health care plan. Republicans are looking to fulfill their years-long campaign promises to repeal Obamacare. It's just not clear that voters want them to do so.\n\nThis is the kind of information that they've been dreading, Joe Antos, a resident scholar at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, says of GOP leaders. They could see the negative reaction that the House bill got, and clearly, they recognize that their job is to come up with something that will work better politically and, ideally, work better for the people that will be most affected.\n\nThe nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said last week that the House Republican bill will result in 23 million fewer people having health insurance than if the Affordable Care Act were left in place.\n\nHere are highlights of the poll, as explained by Mollyann Brodie, senior vice president of Public Opinion Research at Kaiser. It was conducted May 16 to 22, before the latest CBO score was released:\n\nAlmost half of those polled, 49 percent, say they have a favorable view of the Affordable Care Act, while only one-third, 31 percent, say the same about the proposed Republican alternative, the American Health Care Act.\n\nThe division falls along party lines, with 78 percent of Democrats saying they approve of the Affordable Care Act and 67 percent of Republicans favoring the AHCA.\n\nAbout 45 percent of Americans say they expect their health care costs to rise. That is up from 28 percent who said the same in December of last year.\n\nTwo-thirds of respondents, including half of Republicans, say that President Trump and Republicans are responsible for any current and future problems with Obamacare.\n\nAbout 75 percent of those surveyed say the bill passed by the House doesn't fulfill Trump's promises on health care.\n\nFewer than 10 percent of people say they want the House Republican bill passed as is. About 30 percent say it should not be passed at all, while another 26 percent say it needs major changes.\n\nThe survey was conducted from May 16 to 22 among a sample of 1,205 adults living in the United States. The margin of error is 3 percentage points.
More Than Twice As Many Women Are Running For Congress In 2018 Compared With 2016\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Sam Morris/Getty Images Sam Morris/Getty Images\n\nIt was Saturday afternoon, and Abigail Spanberger was in a busy hallway at the Chesterfield County Public Library in Midlothian, Va., minutes away from training a room of about 40 campaign volunteers. She seemed ready for a quick interview, but then abruptly called out to her campaign manager.\n\nHey Dana, Eileen Davis is about to come through. Can you head her off at the pass so she doesn't interrupt the — \n\nShe cut herself off and turned to me.\n\nThat's my mother, Spanberger said, laughing.\n\nHer mom is volunteering for her campaign?\n\nEvidently.\n\nSpanberger didn't know she was coming?\n\nI just saw her walking. I did not know she was coming. But all her friends are in this county, so ...\n\nDemocratic women (even those who don't have a daughter running for Congress) are amped up for 2018. It's visible in Spanberger's volunteers, about two-thirds of whom are women, and in this race's candidates as well.\n\nSpanberger is one of four Democrats, three women, along with one man, vying for that party's nomination in this district. And that miniwave in Virginia's 7th Congressional District is a microcosm of something happening nationwide.\n\nAt latest count, 431 women were running for or were likely to run for the House nationwide — 339 Democrats and 92 Republicans. At this point in 2016, there were fewer than half that: 212. Likewise, 50 women are running for or likely to run for Senate, compared with 25 at this point in 2016. Many have not officially filed for office yet — filing deadlines have not occurred in many states. But thus far, this year is on track to break records.\n\nA largely Democratic phenomenon\n\nWe've never seen anything like this. Ever seen anything like this, said Stephanie Schriock, president of EMILY's List, which recruits and trains female Democratic candidates who support abortion rights.\n\nAt this point in the 2016 cycle, she said, about 920 women had reached out to EMILY's List saying they were interested in running for office. At that time, that was a relatively high number. And it makes this year's total all the more eye-popping.\n\nTo have over 30,000 women raise their hand, it's unprecedented, said Schriock. That figure comprises more than just 2018 candidates, however. Some of those women are interested in running in elections in future years. Others may end up working on campaigns.\n\nWhether it's House, Senate, or governor's races, that energy is largely one-sided, according to Deborah Walsh, director of the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University.\n\nI think it's really being driven on the Democratic side, she said. I think the energy and the excitement and the determination, not just to run but also in terms of who's going to show up to vote, right now, that's on the side of the Democrats.\n\nOne other way Virginia's 7th District parallels national political dynamics: The man they elected last time has energized Democratic women. Republican Dave Brat, who holds the seat, made headlines in January 2017, when a video captured his remarks to a town hall about women opposing his policies.\n\nAnd now, since Obamacare and these issues have come up, the women are in my grill no matter where I go, he said, to laughter from his constituents.\n\nThat comment upset plenty of Democrats. And yet, in Helen Alli's view, Brat is exactly right.\n\nWomen are in his grill. We need to be in his grill, said Alli, the third female Democratic candidate running in the district. The main issue on which she disagrees with Brat is health care. Brat voted for the Republicans' American Health Care Act, which would have undone key parts of the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare.\n\nBrat told NPR that that he was simply using language that he had heard voters use against him. Regardless, the quote has fired up women in the district, according to Spanberger, another Democratic candidate in the district.\n\nIt was a bit of a rallying call for many people, and a funny comment, a funny turn of phrase that he used, she said, but I think it is representative of the fact that there are a lot of people — many of them women — who started this past year, in 2017, really being vocal about what was important to them.\n\nDonald Trump, the gift that keeps on giving\n\nOf course, it's not just Brat firing up women in the 7th District. They, like many women nationwide, are fired up by Donald Trump.\n\nAt one time, when the election happened, and the Women's March, we all just by telepathy just said, 'No we gotta fix this. We're gonna fix it.' And we are, said Alli.\n\nTrump's election and inauguration kicked off a nationwide movement among Democratic women. Women took to the streets by the millions in January 2017, bearing protest signs and wearing pussy hats, in reference to the infamous 2005 Access Hollywood tape, in which Trump bragged about sexual assault.\n\nAnd since his election, Trump has continued to dump gasoline on the already roaring fire of Democratic women's enthusiasm, according to Rutgers' Walsh.\n\nI've often thought that if you were an organizer out there trying to organize what is called the resistance or the women organizing the women who are thinking about running, Walsh said, Donald Trump is the gift that keeps on giving in terms of motivation to stay engaged and stay involved and not lose your enthusiasm.\n\nEverything from policies on health care and immigration to scandals like former White House staff secretary Rob Porter's resignation after allegations of domestic abuse continually combines to keep Democratic women energized, she said.\n\nConservatives are just not included. We're not invited\n\nDemocrats aren't the only ones having a big year when it comes to recruitment. Republican women likewise have seen a surge in candidates, even if it isn't quite as eye-popping a surge as Democrats' numbers. Twenty-one Republican women are running for Senate this year, along with 92 for the House, and 31 for governorships. In all those cases, that's more than in any year at this point since at least 2002, according to figures from Rutgers University.\n\nAccording to Missy Shorey, executive director of Maggie's List, which promotes and trains female Republican candidates, Republican women are excluded from many conversations about gender politics in the U.S. today.\n\nFor so many of those marches, conservatives are just not included. We're not invited, she said. In fact, we're disinvited sometimes. That's fine, if that's the way the left wants [us] to be treated. But ignore us at your own peril.\n\nDespite the Democratic wave, Shorey is optimistic about November. She says Republicans are seeing increased energy as well, though it's different. And Shorey thinks some voters will perceive the newly galvanized Democratic women as too angry.\n\nI think when you see on the left the whole concept of 'the avengers,' I would argue that the avenger is an angry offering that in many areas will be rejected, Shorey said.\n\nOn top of that, she thinks high-profile sexual misconduct allegations against men in Washington will turn voters toward female candidates as a practical matter. She talks about a conversation she had recently with one female Republican candidate.\n\nShe said, 'I have more men coming up to me saying, I'm going to vote for you, because I am sick of the way these men have been behaving, '  Shorey said.\n\nBut then, the sexual misconduct allegations against the president himself, by more than a dozen women, are a major factor pushing Democratic women to run for office.\n\nFor Schriock of EMILY's List, that wave is a silver lining of Trump's election ... but, in her mind, it's cold comfort.\n\nIt is not worth, it was not worth it. I would have taken our 920 who wanted to run [in 2016] to have a different president. I would have taken that.\n\nLoading...\n\nVoting on party, not gender\n\nAn influx of female candidates doesn't necessarily mean more women will be inspired to vote for those candidates. In general, political scientists say, people vote based on party far more than they vote based on gender.\n\nFor Breanne Woodson, a voter from Cumberland County, Va., that's definitely the case.\n\nSince I've been 18, I've never voted Republican. I probably never will, Woodson said.\n\nWoodson met Alli while the candidate was campaigning at a salon in Henrico, Va. Woodson said she wasn't sure whom she might vote for in a primary election. But in the general election, party would mean more than a candidate being a woman.\n\nI don't really care about their gender, as long as they're a decent person and I know they're going to do what they're supposed to do, she said.\n\nThat said, there are some voters who do care about gender to some degree. One is Zahra Lakhani, owner of the salon Alli visited. While Lakhani declined to give her political party, she said she was happy to let a candidate like Alli come and campaign at her salon.\n\nOnly a woman can understand a woman's challenges. And being a mother, being a daughter, a sister, a wife, divorced, single mom, business owner, leader in community as well, it's not just one thing that you do, she said. So a woman is the only one who will understand another woman and their challenges.
How The Democratic Position On Health Care Has Moved To The Left\n\nNPR's Ari Shapiro speaks with Dr. Zeke Emanuel, an architect of the Affordable Care Act about the Medicare for All issue in the Democratic presidential debates.\n\nARI SHAPIRO, HOST:\n\nOver the last two nights in Detroit, the biggest debate among Democrats had to do with health care. Some of the presidential candidates want to completely get rid of private insurance companies. Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts is in that camp.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nELIZABETH WARREN: The basic profit model of an insurance company is taking as much money as you can in premiums and pay out as little as possible in health care coverage.\n\nSHAPIRO: Other candidates, like former Vice President Joe Biden, want Americans to be able to choose their health care coverage.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nJOE BIDEN: No one has to keep their private insurance, but they - if they would like their insurance, they should be able to keep it.\n\nSHAPIRO: Dr. Zeke Emanuel has heard all this before. He was part of the team that drafted the Affordable Care Act during the Obama administration. And he's here in the studio. Hey there.\n\nZEKE EMANUEL: Nice to be with you, Ari.\n\nSHAPIRO: Let's start with terminology because the phrase Medicare for All is being used to describe a lot of different things. In its purest sense, what does true Medicare for All actually mean?\n\nEMANUEL: Well, it is - that's the Bernie Sanders' sense, and that is, we get rid of private insurance. Everyone is in Medicare fee-for-service. And in Medicare fee-for-service, you get to choose your doctor. The government pays the doctor or the hospital, so there's no co-pays, no deductibles; vision, hearing aids and other things that aren't in traditional Medicare packages are covered.\n\nSHAPIRO: Which other Democrats besides Bernie Sanders are on that end of the health care spectrum?\n\nEMANUEL: Well, it appears that Elizabeth Warren is.\n\nSHAPIRO: Right.\n\nEMANUEL: Although, not necessarily all the time.\n\nSHAPIRO: And those are really the only two. Everyone else is sort of on a scale somewhere in between those.\n\nEMANUEL: Right, right. I might say on a scale somewhere in between, that has more government intervention than Barack Obama had in the Affordable Care Act.\n\nSHAPIRO: Yeah.\n\nWARREN: Everyone is further towards more - government taking more responsibility.\n\nSHAPIRO: And I do want to ask you about why the Obama administration went the course that it did. But first, just to understand the facts, right now, when you look at American health coverage, what percentage of Americans get health coverage on the private market as opposed to some form of government-provided health care?\n\nEMANUEL: So you have about 150 to -60 million people have employer-sponsored insurance, and then about another 15 million people have individual coverage or through the exchanges, and that gets you to something like 55 to 60% of the population has private insurance. And then you have another - call it 130 million people who have Medicaid or Medicare coverage. So that's the breakdown. And we have roughly 89, 90% of Americans have health insurance.\n\nSHAPIRO: So when you were working on the law that became known as Obamacare, there was no discussion of totally eliminating private coverage, but there was discussion of giving everybody the option of getting on Medicare, as is known as the public option. Why didn't the Obama administration ultimately go that route?\n\nEMANUEL: Politically impossible. The charge against it was led by Joe Lieberman, a senator from Connecticut, where a lot of health insurance companies were based.\n\nSHAPIRO: He was an independent who caucused with the Democrats.\n\nEMANUEL: Correct. But he wasn't the only one who was opposed to that. There were other Democrats who didn't take the lead the way Senator Lieberman did, and they were opposed. And it became clear we couldn't get that provision enacted and passed the bill. And that, I might remind the audience...\n\nSHAPIRO: (Laughter).\n\nEMANUEL: ...Was with 60 senators in the Senate and...\n\nSHAPIRO: Sixty Democrats - excuse me.\n\nEMANUEL: Sixty Democrats in the Senate, right, and an overwhelming number in the House. There are people who have other views, and they listen to their constituents. And many constituents, whether union members or people with employers who give them good benefits or, I just don't want to think about it, and I'd rather let my employer deal with it, those people actually like their system, even if they have complaints about the insurance companies now and then.\n\nSHAPIRO: So as you point out, this debate about political viability a decade ago is happening with 60 Democrats in the Senate. Right now Democrats don't even control the Senate. We don't know what the situation will be in 2020. But what do you think the political calculus is in this moment? I mean, do you think that a public option has become more politically viable in the last decade?\n\nEMANUEL: Absolutely. I think it is...\n\nSHAPIRO: Even without a supermajority in Congress?\n\nEMANUEL: I think both Republican and Democratic voters recognize that they want to have security, and a public option does communicate that security to them. It will always be there, and the government will stand behind it. And I do think that tells you - we learn from experience. If the marketplace isn't working, let's try something else. And I think that has to be the motivating factor behind any Democratic bill. We're aiming for universal coverage, and as we learn, we've got to revise and reform the system based upon how it's performing, not based upon some ideological commitment.\n\nSHAPIRO: So how much is the debate that we're seeing this week among Democrats just about the difference between what it takes to win a Democratic primary and what it takes to actually get legislation through Congress?\n\nEMANUEL: I think most of what we're hearing is about trying to differentiate your candidacy on health care from other candidates running. I might also say, one of the things that's been bothering me about the quality of the debate we have is it really is focused on coverage, and I think a much bigger element is affordability. We haven't had so much talk about the affordability argument, and that really has gotten a very small amount of the debate, and it needs a lot more of that debate.\n\nSHAPIRO: Dr. Zeke Emanuel, one of the architects of the Affordable Care Act, Obamacare, and is now at the University of Pennsylvania. Thanks for coming in today.\n\nEMANUEL: Thank you, Ari. It's been a pleasure.\n\nCopyright © 2019 NPR. All rights reserved.

Presidential Contenders Use Primary Debate To Try To Highlight Differences\n\nSTEVE INSKEEP, HOST:\n\nPut 10 Democratic presidential candidates on a single stage and you challenge all of them to say why they are unique.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF MONTAGE)\n\nBERNIE SANDERS: I am the only person up here...\n\nCORY BOOKER: I think I'm the only person on this stage, even though...\n\nKAMALA HARRIS: I am on - and I think the only person on this stage...\n\nELIZABETH WARREN: I think I'm the only person on this stage who...\n\nJOE BIDEN: I'm the only one up here who's ever beat the NRA.\n\nINSKEEP: So we've established that each candidate was the only one to do something, and the contest on ABC did highlight some genuine differences. While it's hard to say that anybody won a debate so far ahead of the voting, we can learn something about those differences. So we've called up a couple of viewers. Republican strategist Scott Jennings was watching in Prospect, Ky. Welcome back to the program.\n\nSCOTT JENNINGS: Thank you. Good morning.\n\nINSKEEP: And we're also joined by Democratic strategist Jennifer Palmieri, who was watching in Missoula, Mont. Good morning.\n\nJENNIFER PALMIERI: Good morning, Steve.\n\nINSKEEP: And, guys, I think it's fitting that you both know Washington really well, but you're both way outside Washington where sometimes the same image on the same TV screen can just look or feel different. And, Jennifer, let's start with you. What sounded like it would play well in Missoula?\n\nPALMIERI: I do think that Joe Biden sounded like he would play well in Missoula. You know, the - my big takeaway from the debate was that if you want to beat Biden, you're going to have to do it on the ground in Iowa. I think people thought there might be a debate where he really performs badly, and, you know, people are looking for a moment where his support starts to collapse. And I think it's kind of evident at this point that's unlikely to happen. And debates are interesting, but we have to keep in mind they're all headed to Iowa. And that was my big takeaway was that's where you're going to have to - that's where you're going to have to beat him.\n\nINSKEEP: So Biden, who's been the front-runner in polls, held it together. How did look from Kentucky, Scott?\n\nJENNINGS: Yeah. I have a similar sentiment as Jen. I think that nobody in this debate, or, frankly, any other debate, had a moment that drains support away from the rest of the crowd. So that means you have to build a real campaign organizationally to turn out the people that are for you. Biden's, you know, bebopping along at 30%. I don't think he's going to go up or down. Warren and Sanders are still fishing off the same pier. They're fragmenting that wing of the party. And nobody is really moving fast. So at this point, I don't know that we learn much from the debates. What I'm more anxious to find out now is, are they actually building campaigns to turn out the voters who support them? Nobody's got a dominant lead. So it's all really coming down to campaign tactics. And can you get out what you've got?\n\nINSKEEP: Biden bebopping - I guess that's political consultant jargon.\n\nJENNINGS: (Laughter) To his record player, to his record player.\n\nINSKEEP: Oh, he did make a reference to people, and we could have a big discussion about that. That was a discussion about race. He was saying that he encouraged parents to be playing records to their kids. We could discuss that, but let's discuss health care for a moment if we can. We have Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren standing on either side of Biden. Sanders and Warren both favor Medicare for All. Biden kept saying that is too expensive, and he highlighted his support of Obamacare. Let's listen.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nBIDEN: I think - I know that the senator says she's for Bernie. Well, I'm for Barack. I think the Obamacare worked. I think the way in - we add to it, replace everything that's been cut, add a public option, guarantee that everyone will be able to have affordable insurance.\n\nINSKEEP: OK, guys. Biden suggests, look, your taxes are going to go up in this Medicare for All scheme. The others are saying, look, your overall costs are going to go down. Let me just ask you - what are the politics of each argument? Scott, you first.\n\nJENNINGS: Well, the politics here are, for Republicans, when you hear the more radical health care plans, what we hear is we're coming to raise your taxes. I mean, if you hear the Bernie Sanders-Elizabeth Warren plans and the more radical plans in the field, we just hear about massive tax increases and losing your private insurance. I thought it was noteworthy that the more not-socialist candidates in the field were more critical of the Medicare for All plans last night. But what we see across the board is just plans to raise taxes, take away private insurance and really change - radically change health care in a system where, frankly, most people like the plan that they currently have.\n\nINSKEEP: Jen Palmieri, having been in a White House that struggled with the health care issue, to say the least - politically struggled with it - is it wise for Democrats to be going for such big change in an election they're desperate to win?\n\nPALMIERI: Well, you know, both Biden and then - on one side and Warren and Sanders on the other, are going for different voters within the Democratic primary electorate. And Warren and Sanders are going for the voters that are looking for very big change, and Biden is going for the voters who want to beat Trump as their No. 1 priority.\n\nAnd I think what - you know, Warren is the really interesting one here. And besides Biden, she's the one who impressed me the most last night. She continues to play her own game. And other than that one time with Biden that you just played, people didn't really try to go after her. And she's had a slow and steady but very steady rise. And no one's really been able to disrupt that yet. And she could end up being as a real force. And not everyone in the Democratic primary electorate is where she is on health care. But there is, you know, a sizable enough amount of voters that that's what they are looking for.\n\nINSKEEP: Very briefly, do you worry about someone like Warren making an argument that works in the primaries and doesn't work in November of 2020?\n\nPALMIERI: Well, that, my friend, is the story of Democratic presidential primaries from the very beginning. And this is the process by which - the primary process is the process by which the Democrats decide where they stand on the biggest issues and who they want that standard bearer to be. And, you know, sometimes that makes our case more difficult in the general election, but that is what this process is about. But she does continue to impress me with how - you know, running your own race and not getting dragged in to debates that you don't want to have, it's a tough skill, and she's got it.\n\nINSKEEP: Scott Jennings, did any of the trailing candidates a little bit lower in the polls make an impression on you?\n\nJENNINGS: Yeah. I was watching Beto O'Rourke last night. I don't think he's got a chance to get the nomination, but he is moving the field further left on the gun issue just the way Warren and Sanders are moving the field left on health care. So to your point and your question to Jen, I'm anxious to see if he stays in long enough to continue to move that field far away from where most people are, which is probably for some kind of gun reform but not for the government showing up and confiscating your guns, which is now the motivating issue for the Beto campaign.\n\nINSKEEP: Oh, which is what O'Rourke said. He said I will take your AK-47 away. Jen Palmieri, did anybody at the bottom end impress you, very briefly?\n\nPALMIERI: Harris. You know, Harris had memorable lines - can be just that, just memorable lines from the debate if they don't translate into rise in the polls in Iowa. But I thought Harris had a particularly great opening in her direct - that she directed directly at Trump. I thought that was very effective.\n\nINSKEEP: And also compared the president to the Wizard of Oz at one point. Jen Palmieri, thanks so much.\n\nPALMIERI: My pleasure.\n\nINSKEEP: She was communications director for the Hillary Clinton campaign, served in the Obama White House. Scott Jennings was an adviser in the George W. Bush White House. Thanks to you.\n\nJENNINGS: Thank you.\n\nCopyright © 2019 NPR. All rights reserved.

Tuesday's Elections Show Impeachment Might Not Boost GOP As Much As It Hoped\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Susan Walsh/AP Susan Walsh/AP\n\nTuesday's statewide elections in Kentucky and Virginia were a big night for Democrats. And the results tell us a few things about national politics, consequential issues and President Trump.\n\nIn Kentucky, Democrat Andy Beshear, the son of former Gov. Steve Beshear, claimed victory Tuesday night and narrowly leads incumbent Gov. Matt Bevin by about 5,000 votes. Bevin has not yet conceded the race.\n\nIn Virginia, Democrats took over both chambers of the state legislature and now have full control of the state's political apparatus, a sweeping change from a decade ago when Virginia was considered the nation's bellwether.\n\nRepublicans kept hold of the governorship in Mississippi, but the margin — 5 percentage points — was far smaller than Trump's 18 points in 2016.\n\nHere are seven lessons from Tuesday night's results:\n\n1. Impeachment did not help Republicans fire up conservatives in rural areas\n\nRepublicans have been saying that impeachment would backfire on Democrats and enthuse Trump's rural base. But that didn't pan out Tuesday in Kentucky and Virginia. Democratic voters in urban areas, on the other hand, are clearly fired up.\n\nThey showed up, especially in Kentucky, in higher-than-usual numbers, while voters in rural areas didn't. Trump, who only won 46% of the national popular vote in 2016, needs every last one of the people who voted for him then to come out again, especially as he has done almost nothing to try to win over persuadable voters this time around. Kentucky and Virginia could be warning signs that impeachment, even though the Trump campaign has raised lots of money off it, simply isn't the issue Republicans hoped it would be with voters.\n\n2. Trump won't like this\n\nYou can't let that happen to me! Trump said at his Kentucky rally Monday night, imploring Kentucky voters to go to the polls for Bevin. He did not want the the narrative to be: Trump suffered the greatest defeat in the history of the world.\n\nWell, it wasn't the greatest defeat in the history of the world. But it is bad news for Trump, despite his campaign dismissing the loss as the result of problems with Bevin's campaign. So what will the results mean for his mood and state of mind, as congressional investigators keep asking questions in their impeachment inquiry?\n\n3. The suburbs remain a warning sign for Republicans\n\nRepublicans want to dismiss the results in Kentucky as Bevin being unpopular and acerbic, and that is a point to consider, especially considering that Republican candidates swept all of the other statewide races, mostly by double-digit margins. But Bevin's unpopularity does not explain the results in Virginia.\n\nThe fact is what we've seen in election after election since Trump has been in office is Democrats outperforming prior performances — and that strength has been rooted in the suburbs. Remember, Republicans lost the House in 2018 because suburban voters turned on Trump and the GOP — and Republicans haven't fixed that problem.\n\n4. Governing still matters\n\nKentucky is a state Trump won by 30 points. So this should have been a layup for any generic Republican candidate. But Bevin is no generic Republican. He picked fights with all kinds of constituencies in the state.\n\nWe've seen it time and again — take Kansas, for example — that when a governor governs ideologically, they wind up in political trouble. And the opposite is true, too. The three most popular governors in the country are Republicans in liberal states: Charlie Baker in Massachusetts, Larry Hogan in Maryland and Phil Scott in Vermont. That should be a lesson that the GOP pays attention to.\n\n5. Kentucky likely does not mean much for Mitch McConnell's and Trump's chances in the state in 2020\n\nSure, Bevin was unpopular, and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is unpopular in his home state, too. And, yes, Trump was not quite able to drag Bevin across the finish line Tuesday night.\n\nBut that does not mean either Trump or McConnell is in trouble in Kentucky next year. Over the past decade, McConnell has often been among the least popular senators with his constituents and yet has comfortably won reelection each time. He and Bevin have different brands in the state, and a McConnell protégé won handily for attorney general.\n\nWhat's more, having Trump on the ballot will help McConnell. It's important to remember that while turnout was up substantially from the last governor's race in 2015, it was still down about 35% from the presidential election. Expect those numbers to shoot back up in 2020.\n\n6. Virginia is now officially a blue state\n\nMy, how times change and can change quickly. The results Tuesday night in Virginia mean Democrats in the state now control the legislature and every statewide elected office — governor, lieutenant governor and attorney general.\n\nVirginia has outpaced the rest of the country, is no longer a swing state and is moving to being reliably Democratic. And that shift came in a year when the top trio of elected Democrats in the state faced a variety of scandals that hobbled their ability to campaign for down-ballot candidates.\n\n7. The politics of health care and guns may be moving left\n\nBefore Bevin came into office, Kentucky had one of the best-run Affordable Care Act (aka Obamacare) exchanges in the country. It also expanded Medicaid under Gov. Steve Beshear, a Democrat.\n\nBevin took a very different approach. He tried to institute work requirements for Medicaid, which would have resulted in tens of thousands of Kentuckians losing health insurance. That was hotly divisive, and his loss Tuesday proves that once you give people the benefit, it is very difficult to take it away.\n\nThat has long been the argument Democrats have made in favor of the Affordable Care Act even when it was unpopular. And guess what? As predicted, it has grown more popular, and without an alternative, Republicans have struggled to figure out what to do about it.\n\nIn Virginia, guns were a top issue after a raft of mass shootings nationally and in the state. Gun-control groups outspent the National Rifle Association by about $500,000, and Tuesday's Virginia results showed that with a concerted effort, lots of money and focused activism, the tide could be turning on gun policy.
Trump Chooses Rep. Tom Price, An Obamacare Foe, To Run HHS\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption J. Scott Applewhite/AP J. Scott Applewhite/AP\n\nRep. Tom Price, a Georgia Republican, is President-elect Donald Trump's pick for Secretary of Health and Human Services. He is currently chairman of the powerful House Budget Committee.\n\nPrice, an orthopedic surgeon for nearly 20 years before coming to Congress, has represented the northern Atlanta suburbs in the House of Representatives since 2005.\n\nIf confirmed by the Senate, Price would likely have a central role in the Republicans' stated plans to dismantle the Affordable Care Act and design a replacement. He has repeatedly introduced legislation to repeal and replace the ACA and is one of hundreds of Republicans who have voted dozens of times to repeal the federal health care law since it was enacted in 2010. Those efforts either didn't make it to President Obama's desk or were vetoed by him.\n\nHealth Care Obamacare Ruling Moves Debate To Presidential Race, Rep. Tom Price Says Obamacare Ruling Moves Debate To Presidential Race, Rep. Tom Price Says Listen · 3:55 3:55\n\nAs HHS secretary, Price would not only oversee Obamacare as it currently exists, but also run the government's largest social programs, including Medicare, Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program. He would also have authority over the Food and Drug Administration, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the National Institutes of Health and other major health agencies.\n\nHHS employs nearly 80,000 people and is the largest source of funding for medical research in the world.\n\nPolitically, Price is conservative. He opposes abortion rights, receiving a 2016 rating of 0 by Planned Parenthood and 100 percent by National Right to Life. He has voted against legislation aimed at prohibiting job discrimination based on sexual orientation; for a constitutional amendment to define marriage as between one man and one woman; and against the bill that would've ended the don't-ask-don't-tell policy regarding disclosure of sexual orientation in the military.\n\nHe has also voted against:\n\nfederal funding for abortion;\n\nfunding for groups like Planned Parenthood;\n\na law that now requires the FDA to regulate tobacco as a drug; and\n\na bill that would have provided four weeks of parental leave for federal employees.\n\nIn 2007, Price voted in favor of a bill that would have granted the so-called pre-born equal protection under the 14th Amendment.\n\nIn 2015, Price wrote the language for a bill that is now seen as one of the main paths forward to repeal portions of the ACA. It would employ the same budget reconciliation rules Democrats used to originally pass the law in 2010, but instead the GOP plan would defund Obamacare.\n\nThis reconciliation option would leave in place the basic structure of the ACA, including the insurance exchanges and rules that require insurers to cover existing conditions and permit young adults to stay on their parents' insurance policies until age 26.\n\nBut without funding, the exchanges are likely to see an exodus of insurance companies, particularly if expensive requirements are kept in place.\n\nPrice, 62, lives in Roswell, Ga., with his wife Betty. He received his medical degree from the University of Michigan.
Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson Reacts To State of the Union Address\n\nTo get a sense of how President Trump's first State of the Union address was received in different parts of the country, NPR's Mary Louise Kelly speaks with Arkansas' Republican Gov. Asa Hutchinson.\n\nMARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST:\n\nTo get a sense of how the president's State of the Union address was received in different parts of the country, we've called on two governors. Elsewhere in the show, we'll hear from Colorado Governor Democrat John Hickenlooper.\n\nNow we go to Arkansas, where for more than a year we've been checking in with the state's Republican governor, Asa Hutchinson. And he is back on the line with us now from Blytheville, Ark. Welcome, Governor.\n\nASA HUTCHINSON: Great to be with you today. Thank you.\n\nKELLY: Now, you're out on the road today. I mentioned we've reached you in Blytheville. Is that right?\n\nHUTCHINSON: That's right. This is Blytheville. It's in Mississippi County, extreme northeast part of Arkansas. And it's right on the Mississippi River. The steel industry employs about 3,000 people here in this county, and so it's been a good day of talking about the steel industry and workforce training.\n\nKELLY: And as you were out and about talking to people, were they watching the speech? What are you hearing?\n\nHUTCHINSON: I did. Generally the response is very good and favorable. I think it caught people off-guard that it was like, this is a President Trump that understands the unique role the president can do in bringing people together. And utilizing the State of the Union address is something that not only speaks to Congress but also speaks to the nation. And they like the message that they heard.\n\nKELLY: Well, let me ask you about a couple of the specific topics that the president touched on in the address last night. One that struck me because it was so short in this speech is health care, the Affordable Care Act, which of course was a huge focus of Republican time and energy last year - the effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act. Last night, the president devoted precisely one line to it.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF 2018 STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS)\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: We repealed the core of the disastrous Obamacare. The individual mandate is now gone, thank heaven.\n\n(CHEERING, APPLAUSE)\n\nKELLY: So Governor Hutchinson - mission accomplished?\n\nHUTCHINSON: Well, I think it was important to emphasize that's a very dramatic change from what happened under Obamacare with the repeal of the individual mandate. But I think it's really practical recognition, too, that while we've done something significant, it's going to be hard to go back to health care whenever it's an election year, whenever the agenda is limited in Congress and you want to do infrastructure and you want to do so many other things that he outlined, that he emphasized what has been done.\n\nKELLY: The president did give a - devote a big chunk of his speech last night to talking about immigration. And when we have spoken to you in past, you have been skeptical about his plans to build a wall. For example, you've said, we should be realistic in our discussions about this. So let me ask you. Is the president now being realistic?\n\nHUTCHINSON: I do believe he has adopted a very realistic stance in terms of border security. I've always supported border security. I question the realism of having a physical wall across the entire southern border, and he's recognized that there are some areas that just doesn't work. So I think he's taken a very forward-leaning approach to it recognizing that we can address the DREAMers if we have that high level of border security that he's advocating. It's a good position to be in. It's something that we ought to have bipartisan support for.\n\nKELLY: You said you support the outline of this, the framework of this. But as you know, as a politician, the devil is in the details. Where do you see this snagging?\n\nHUTCHINSON: Well, this is the first time that I believe that the president has really engaged in a leadership position on a specific issue. On many of the other, like health care reform, he said, Congress, let's get it done, and he left them to work that out. So this is really a - him staking out his own leadership position here and his own framework. So the ball's in Congress's court right now to say, we can do that and to hammer out those details. I think he's shown the leadership that the American people expect and we appreciate in a president.\n\nKELLY: Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson - Governor Hutchinson, thanks so much for taking the time and joining us once again.\n\nHUTCHINSON: Thank you. It's good to be with you.\n\nCopyright © 2018 NPR. All rights reserved.

Democrats Make Final Push Before Midterms\n\nRACHEL MARTIN, HOST:\n\nIt is the final push, the last weekend before a midterm election that could see a power shift in Washington, And Both parties are making their last pitches to voters. New Mexico Congressman Ben Ray Lujan is responsible for leading that messaging for the Democrats. He chairs the Democratic Congressional strategy group, or the DCCC, which recruits candidates, raises funds and organizes races. When we talked yesterday, I asked him how much of Tuesday's election is about President Trump as Democrats try to pull the House back from Republican control.\n\nBEN RAY LUJAN: You might be surprised by this, Rachel, but our candidates are not talking about the president very much. You know, to be honest with you, no one's going to talk about Donald Trump more than Donald Trump. And he will remind the American people of every investigation that he is the subject of, of every ugly, disgusting tweet that he engages in. So look, we don't need to talk about him much. What our candidates are talking about are the economic challenges that the American people are facing.\n\nMARTIN: But I have to tell you - myself, my colleagues, we've been around the country, and we've heard people talk about the economy and they're feeling pretty good. And you ask them, are you better off than you were a couple years ago? And even if they don't say unequivocally yes, they say, maybe not necessarily, but I feel like Donald Trump is making change and eventually it'll get better. How do you make the case to those voters?\n\nLUJAN: What voters have told us is that while they see the economy doing better that they know that we had to come out of the greatest recession that America had experienced back in 2008 going into 2009. And they credit President Obama just as much as anyone else for doing everything we could to bring the country out of that Great Recession. And so again, I just don't think our Republican colleagues have the strong argument to make that they are purporting to on this subject, especially when they're suggesting that Medicare, Social Security, Medicaid - these safety net programs - should be gutted to pay for their tax scam, as well.\n\nThe American people have been clear to me when they say that their wages and salaries are not keeping up with the cost of living. And we need a strong agenda that's built around the people. When people ask Democrats, what do we stand for? It's very clear. We stand for the people. And that's why we're moving a strong agenda forward.\n\nMARTIN: Where are Democrats vulnerable in these elections?\n\nLUJAN: Well, if you're asking what keeps me up at night and where, you know, the vulnerabilities exist, remember this. We're running in gerrymandered districts across America. President Trump won 70 percent of the districts that we are running in. When you look at our battlefield, which is 111-deep. So that's what concerns me very much.\n\nAlso what we're seeing with the influx of outside super PAC money and, really, some of the most racist ads that we have seen run in congressional districts in the history of American politics. And so those are things that concern me as we close this out.\n\nMARTIN: So that was my conversation with the chair of the Democratic congressional strategy group, Congressman Ben Ray Lujan. We're joined now in studio by Democratic strategist Jamal Simmons to talk more about the Democrats' closing argument. Jamal, thanks for coming in.\n\nJAMAL SIMMONS: Thanks for having me.\n\nMARTIN: So we just heard Representative Lujan say Trump is not the backbone of the Democratic strategy. Is that true from the campaigns that you've seen out there this season?\n\nSIMMONS: I think Trump is absolutely playing a role in Democratic strategy in that he is the biggest issue on the ballot right now. I mean, I do a bunch of interviews for Hill TV, and I was just down in Florida. I was just down in Georgia. And voters are very fired up about saying something to oppose Donald Trump's view of America...\n\nMARTIN: So that's hard for...\n\nSIMMONS: ...Of anti-immigration America and an America that doesn't mean that all of us get to participate. And that's true not just of people of color. It's also true of white voters who don't see the America that's so harsh as Donald Trump's.\n\nMARTIN: So when we hear Congressman Lujan saying, no, we're talking about the economy. We're talking about health care. You're admitting there that, listen, there are people who are voting because it's an anti-Trump vote. Democrats and some Republicans and Democrats need to be able to leverage that to some degree.\n\nSIMMONS: Absolutely. But they also want to hear from Democrats about what their agenda is. And I think health care is incredibly important because not only do we want to get access to health care, we've got to figure out how we lower the cost to health care. And a lot of voters want to hear about that. And Democrats are talking about it, and it's resonating.\n\nIt's amazing now that you have Republicans who have voted dozens of times to kill Obamacare now saying they're standing up for pre-existing conditions. That is something that the Democrats have stood on for a generation. And it's time in this election, I think, for voters to get the sense of Republicans being against it.\n\nMARTIN: Let's talk about immigration. President Trump believes, clearly, immigration is a winning issue for him. He continues to make these provocative remarks, recently making promises about changing asylum rules and birthright citizenship. How should Democrats manage those remarks? Do they respond? Do they counter? Do they stick to health care?\n\nSIMMONS: Donald Trump is trying to get Democrats to chase a - you know, like a beagle chasing a bird down a different alleyway. Voters in this election care a lot more about these issues of health care. And then broadly speaking, they do care about Democrats who are going to be willing to stand up against Donald Trump.\n\nListen. We saw Oprah Winfrey yesterday out in the campaign trail in Georgia talking about why America is better when we all row in the same direction than it is when we're fighting each other. And I think that's the America that people want. And we are seeing not just a blue wave, but I would argue it's a red, white and blue wave because people are standing up for American values and reasserting the country that we had in place when Barack Obama was president.\n\nMARTIN: We've heard from many voters the last few weeks on our air who feel like moderate voices have been pushed to the side. Donald Trump has pushed the GOP to the right, and he's pushed the Democrats to the left. Is that true, and is that a good thing?\n\nSIMMONS: I look at this as 3D politics. It's not just left-right. It's also inside-out. The people who are on the outside of the political system are fighting the people who are on the inside the political system. And frankly, there are some Democrats who are in jeopardy of being taken down in that wave. We have got to have people fighting for those who are outside the system to have a say in their own futures.\n\nMARTIN: Democratic strategist Jamal Simmons. Thank you so much.\n\nSIMMONS: Thank you.\n\nCopyright © 2018 NPR. All rights reserved.

Lightning Fill In The Blank\n\nAll the news we couldn't fit anywhere else.\n\nPETER SAGAL, HOST:\n\nTime for our final game, Lightning Fill In The Blank. Each of our players will have 60 seconds in which to answer as many fill-in-the-blank questions as they can. Each correct answer now worth two points. Bill, can you give us the scores?\n\nBILL KURTIS: I sure can. Peter has two. Roxanne and Roy each have three.\n\nSAGAL: All right.\n\nSAGAL: So that means Peter is in third place. And you're up first.\n\nPETER GROSZ: Great.\n\nSAGAL: The clock will start when I begin your first question, Peter. Fill in the blank.

G7.\n\nSAGAL: Right.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF BELL)\n\nSAGAL: In order to redirect around a 65-foot-long road closure, officials in Britain blanked.\n\nGROSZ: Gave up.\n\nSAGAL: No. They created a 41-mile-long detour.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nSAGAL: On Sunday, Francis Ford Coppola joined Martin Scorsese in criticizing the blank movie franchise.\n\nGROSZ: Marvel.\n\nSAGAL: Yes.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF BELL)\n\nSAGAL: On Tuesday, former President blank was hospitalized with a fracture after falling in his home.\n\nGROSZ: Jimmy Carter.\n\nSAGAL: Right.

And when police attempted to arrest him, he gave the cops a fake name. That probably would have worked if Bushman did not have his full name tattooed in giant letters on his neck. It also didn't help that he was also wearing a nametag from a recent forgers convention...\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nSAGAL: ...That said, hello, my name is guilty.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nSAGAL: Bill, how did Peter do on our quiz?\n\nKURTIS: Real good - six right, 12 more points, total of 14.

One of those...\n\nSAGAL: No.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nSAGAL: They had students - during this test to keep them from cheating, they had students wear cardboard boxes on their heads. A recent picture showed university students taking an exam while wearing these cardboard boxes with small cut out eye holes presumably to keep students from looking to their left or right and cheating off the person next to them. Or maybe just every student had ended up with a bad Halloween costume. The school has since apologized for doing this to their students. They say that when it comes to future ideas for preventing cheating, they'll try and think outside the box.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nSAGAL: Bill, how did Roy do on our quiz?\n\nKURTIS: He got three right, six more points, total of nine.

Examining Health Care Spending Since Obamacare\n\nNPR's Noel King talks to David Wessel of the Hutchins Center at the Brookings Institution about health care spending since the Affordable Care Act was signed into law 10 years ago.\n\nNOEL KING, HOST:\n\nSince the Affordable Care Act - Obamacare - became law in 2010, the number of Americans without health insurance has fallen by more than 40%, which seems like a success. Right? But meanwhile, overall health care spending continues to rise, which is maybe not such a success. So where are we with Obamacare?\n\nSince we're coming up on the end of the year, we thought it would be a good time to look at how it's doing. We're with David Wessel. He's director of the Hutchins Center at the Brookings Institution. Good morning, David.\n\nDAVID WESSEL, BYLINE: Good morning, Noel.\n\nKING: OK. So let's start with the big picture here. Over the past 10 years, what is the trend in health care spending?\n\nWESSEL: America still spends more on health care than other countries without getting better results. And overall, health care spending continues to grow faster than the economy does. But the 2010s are a decade in which national health care spending grew more slowly than it has in the recent past. So health care accounted for 17.3% of GDP in 2010; 17.7% percent of GDP in 2018.\n\nThat increase of four-tenths of a percent is, as my colleagues at Brookings Matt Fiedler and Christen Young point out, smaller than it has been in any previous eight-year period. They say over previous eight-year periods, spending grew five times as fast. And that's interesting because it coincides with a reduction in the number of Americans, as you said, who are uninsured. That's gone for about 15% without insurance in 2010, when the ACA was signed into law, to about 9% today.\n\nKING: OK. So it's really obvious that the ACA reduced the number of people who don't have insurance. We know that. But what role did it play, then, in health care spending?\n\nWESSEL: I would say it played a small role in that. And here's where it made a big difference. Average annual growth in Medicare spending per person has slowed significantly since the ACA was passed. And that's simply because the ACA said we're going to pay doctors and hospitals and other health providers less. But what the ACA didn't do is slow the pace of spending increases by the private sector, which has been growing much faster than government spending programs. And that's partly because we've seen a lot of hospital mergers and other consolidations that allow these providers to raise prices. The private sector - private insurers, the employers - have to pay those higher prices. The government, because it sets prices, doesn't pay them.\n\nKING: I want to ask you about something that we hear from people all the time, which is people saying flat-out, I am paying more for health care every year. Are they right?\n\nWESSEL: Yes, most of them are right. Here's why - because the rate of increase is slowing but spending is still rising. And two-thirds of American adults under age 65 get insurance through their employers, or a small number buy it from insurers directly on the Affordable Care Act exchanges. And the cost of employer-provided health insurance has increased.\n\nAnd on top of that, workers are paying an increasing share of the costs. You hear a lot about higher copays and deductibles. Or they have the workers have to pay a higher share of premiums. And then there are the well-publicized increases in the price of some prescription drugs. So a lot of people are paying more for their health care.\n\nKING: It's been 10 years since the ACA was signed into law. Republicans admit trying to undo it ever since. Has it become more or less popular over the last 10 years?\n\nWESSEL: Well, some provisions of the ACA have always been very popular, like the ban on insurance companies denying coverage due to preexisting conditions. But when pollsters asked a general question - do you have a generally favorable or unfavorable opinion of the health reform law? - the public has been and remains deeply divided. But interestingly, since President Trump took office with his attacks on the ACA, the fractions of Americans who say they have a favorable opinion of the Affordable Care Act has risen from 41% to 52%.\n\nKING: Interesting. David Wessel of Brookings. Thanks.\n\nWESSEL: You're welcome.\n\nCopyright © 2019 NPR. All rights reserved.

STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:\n\nThe Senate plans a different sort of summer. Instead of going home this August, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell canceled the recess, says he wants to approve more of President Trump's judicial nominees, who face Democratic resistance. The resisting Democrats include Hawaii's Mazie Hirono. She's the Senate's only immigrant, and its first Asian-American female senator. Here's NPR legal affairs correspondent Nina Totenberg.\n\nNINA TOTENBERG, BYLINE: Even in Hawaii, Mazie Hirono is viewed as the, quote, good girl of politics - polite, never in your face, not a boat rocker. But in the last year and a half, as one Hawaii columnist put it, she's become, quote, a bad ass.\n\nMAZIE HIRONO: I always was. I just wasn't very noisy about it. I've been a fighter all my life. I just don't look like that.\n\nTOTENBERG: Hirono recalls a breakfast in 1994 when Ben Cayetano, who was running for governor, was trying to talk her out of running for lieutenant governor because he said she wouldn't help the Democratic ticket.\n\nHIRONO: And I said, well, that's all fine and good, but it's all [expletive] and I'm running. And by the time the primary election comes, people will know who I am.\n\nTOTENBERG: They did. What's more - in the general election, Hirono actually got significantly more votes than Cayetano.\n\nHIRONO: If I had to wait around for somebody to pick me for lieutenant governor, I would never have been picked.\n\nTOTENBERG: In the U.S. Senate, she's known as a workhorse, not a show horse as one of her colleagues put it. But she's the only senator who asks every nominee for any position if they've ever been accused of sexual misconduct and if they've ever signed a nondisclosure agreement. For years, she refused requests for interviews from the national media, seeing little purpose in it, but after a while, she figured out it would help her advance causes she cares about.\n\nHIRONO: I have said to my staff for many years now people are getting screwed in our country every single second, minute, hour of the day. And by our efforts, if we can decrease that number, we will be making a difference. We will be doing our jobs.\n\nTOTENBERG: In fact, Mazie Hirono plays the political game with a quiet rage, bred of personal experience. Born on a rice farm in Japan, she lived with her mother and three siblings in harsh conditions. Her father, an alcoholic and gambler, left the family with his parents, and by the time Hirono was 7, her mother was plotting an escape for herself and her children. They would eventually travel by ship in steerage for a week to Hawaii. There, they lived in a boarding house crowded into one room and sharing a stove and refrigerator with the other boarders. Hirono's mother supported them by working low-wage jobs.\n\nHIRONO: No job security, no health care, no nothing - I don't remember ever going to a doctor in those years. And my greatest fear was that my mother would get sick.\n\nTOTENBERG: After graduating from college and law school with honors, she practiced law and was elected to the state legislature. Her activism in politics sprang from the Vietnam War and from a book, The Feminine Mystique.\n\nHIRONO: Literally, the light bulb went on, and I thought, why do I think that some guy is going to take care of me? What? Where do I get that from?\n\nTOTENBERG: Indeed, she was 42 when she finally took the plunge, marrying Leighton Kim Oshima. Her friends were shocked by her choice of mate because she'd broken up with Oshima 13 years earlier, and as she puts it...\n\nHIRONO: It was one of these breakups where I burned all his pictures and stuff like that (laughter).\n\nTOTENBERG: Hirono, a Democrat, sees herself today as strategic and able to build bridges. In fact, in the Senate, the first bill she got enacted into law was with the help of then-Senator, now-Attorney General Jeff Sessions, a man she agrees with about, well, almost nothing. Hirono was trying to move a bill out of committee and onto the Senate floor, and because it involved a charitable tax provision to help victims of a typhoon in the Philippines, there was a deadline.\n\nHIRONO: I'm on the floor about 11 p.m. or so, and I see Jeff Sessions come walking in, and I know he's there to object.\n\nTOTENBERG: A single senator's objection would doom the bill, so she did something unusual. She went to the Republican cloakroom.\n\nHIRONO: I began to talk with him, and I said, why is your caucus so against this bill?\n\nTOTENBERG: Sessions explained that the Republicans felt they had to be consistent in opposing this sort of special tax provision.\n\nHIRONO: And I said, let me tell you why this is important. And then I think what did it was I said I am speaking to this.\n\nTOTENBERG: You're gesturing to your heart.\n\nHIRONO: Yes. And we often don't communicate that way.\n\nTOTENBERG: Sessions did officially object that night but made clear he would work out a compromise.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nJEFF SESSIONS: That would accomplish the senator's goals without offending the budget niceties.\n\nTOTENBERG: With Sessions' willingness and Hirono's doggedness, the bill was enacted into law the day before the deadline. Four years later, however, Hirono went to Sessions to tell him she could not support his nomination to be attorney general. Hirono's interactions with Sessions are an example of her soft heart and hard head. She's needed both in the last year. Diagnosed with kidney cancer, she's undergone two major operations. After the second one, a teeth-grindingly painful operation to remove five inches of her rib, she was out for 10 days but back on the Senate floor in time for the big vote on repeal of Obamacare. She had not planned to speak, had no prepared remarks, and she was uncharacteristically emotional.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nHIRONO: I was born at home in rural Japan. I lost a sister to pneumonia when she was only 2 years old. She died at home, not in hospital where maybe her life could have been saved. It's hard for me to talk about this. I think you can tell.\n\nTOTENBERG: Then she turned to her kidney cancer and the treatment enabled by having health insurance that was saving her life.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nHIRONO: When I was diagnosed with kidney cancer and facing my first surgery, I heard from so many of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle who wrote me wonderful notes sharing with me their own experience with major illness in their families. You showed me your care. You showed me your compassion. Where is that tonight?\n\nTOTENBERG: Hirono's voice is rarely that openly passionate. Indeed, she can often have a rather flat affect, an unassuming, even cool, public presence that is in sharp contrast to her earthiness and colorful language in private. After a long, hard day, I asked her why her skepticism about Trump judicial nominees is any different from Republican skepticism about Obama nominees. She said that what she cares about is that judges are fair, qualified and care about individual and civil rights.\n\nHIRONO: If that's considered liberal as opposed to what I call justice and fairness, as I'm wont to say, [expletive] them.\n\nTOTENBERG: Nina Totenberg, NPR News, Washington.\n\nCopyright © 2018 NPR.

2020 Affordable Care Act Health Plans: What's New\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg via Getty Images Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg via Getty Images\n\nDuring Wednesday night's Democratic presidential debate, candidates touched on Medicare for All, Medicare for all who want it and other ways to reform the American health system.\n\nBut in the backdrop, it's once again sign-up season for Affordable Care Act health plans.\n\nDespite repeated efforts by Republicans in Congress to undo the ACA, the controversial law's seventh open-enrollment period launched earlier this month to relatively little fanfare. It ends Dec. 15.\n\nIndividual plans for 2020 are cheaper — premiums are lower, on average, and in some areas, people who qualify for government subsidies could end up with no monthly payment. Do check the fine print of your policy; in some cases, the patient's share of other costs may have gone up.\n\nMeanwhile, a pending court case threatens to overturn the entire law, with no clear replacement plan in the works. The result has been a cloud of confusion and misunderstanding — some even say misinformation — about the availability of this health coverage.\n\nHere's what consumers need to know.\n\nThe ACA is intact — at least for now\n\nThe Affordable Care Act is still the law of the land.\n\nThe GOP-led Congress gutted a key part of the law — the penalty for the individual mandate — that required everyone to have coverage. But other key tenets of the ACA remain in place, including the individual marketplace it created where people can shop for health coverage.\n\nYou might not hear much about that this year. The Trump administration has dramatically scaled back its outreach and marketing budget for open enrollment — allotting about $10 million for such efforts, compared with the more than $100 million the Obama administration spent.\n\nLack of outreach, combined with Republican efforts to overturn or undermine the law, could give consumers a wrong impression, says Katie Keith, a health policy consultant who frequently writes about the health law.\n\nSo far, about 930,000 people have signed up for coverage. That's still slightly lower than where things were last year — and first-day website glitches may have played a role, suggests Sabrina Corlette, a research professor at Georgetown University's Center on Health Insurance Reforms.\n\nIn the second week of the sign-up period, enrollment was about 10% below what it was in last year's second week — but the number of new customers has gone up.\n\nThe irony is, things are really stable, and depending on your state, you can really save, Keith says. Without advertising and information, folks are going to miss out on the deals they could get.\n\nYou can get a cheaper plan this year, but it will probably require a bit of work\n\nThose deals can be pretty significant. On average, premiums are down 4% nationally over last year for silver-level plans sold through the federal marketplace. In some states, they're even cheaper.\n\nMany people don't realize that if their incomes are below 400% of the federal poverty level (just under $50,000 for an individual or about $103,000 for a family of four) they qualify for federal subsidies — tax credits that help them pay for individual marketplace plans, Corlette says. The federal government has an online calculator that indicates whether you fit into this bracket.\n\nThat tax break can make it easier to find affordable, comprehensive coverage, Corlette says, and she recommends that people who already have 2019 ACA plans shop around the marketplace to make sure they get the best deal going into 2020. (How much plans charge can change each year.)\n\nPeople who bought coverage last fall and don't shop around will be automatically reenrolled in those health plans — which may not be the best for their needs and may be more expensive than other options.\n\nAlso worth noting: Federal courts recently blocked a rule that would have penalized recent legal immigrants who use those subsidies. Known as the public charge rule, it would have counted that subsidy against people looking to stay longer in the United States.\n\nThe court ruling means that, at least for now, legal immigrants should also be able to purchase subsidized health insurance with no penalty, Corlette says.\n\nIf you have concerns or are worried, you should consult an immigration attorney. But assuming you are a legal resident, nothing has changed in terms of your entitlement, she says.\n\nNot everything that looks like an ACA plan actually is one\n\nConsumers should be wary of plans that look like they meet ACA standards but actually fall short.\n\nThe Trump administration has loosened restrictions on non-ACA policies — short-term plans — so that they can last up to 12 months. (Previously they lasted only three months and were treated as bare-bones, stopgap insurance.)\n\nPitched as a cheaper alternative to ACA coverage, they are allowed to factor in preexisting medical conditions — and can deny insurance to people because of their medical history. They also generally cover a much narrower range of benefits. Some have lifetime caps on benefits, and they typically don't cover prescription drugs.\n\nThese plans are not eligible for federal subsidies.\n\nIf you were to Google something like 'ACA plan' or 'Obamacare plan,' the first results will return insurances that are not ACA coverage, Corlette warned. A lot of it is going to be junky, skimpy coverage.\n\nOne easy way to distinguish ACA-compliant plans from others: Make sure you're shopping through HealthCare.gov or an alternative set up by some states. Consumers who work with an insurance broker should be sure to communicate their desire to choose an ACA-compliant plan.\n\nMeanwhile, federal courts are weighing a legal challenge that could strike down the ACA\n\nIt's not clear what would happen if that attempt to overturn the federal health law succeeds. But, for now, the case shouldn't affect your coverage decisions, all sides agree.\n\nA group of Republican attorneys general and governors filed a lawsuit in 2018 that argues that since the Supreme Court upheld the ACA in 2012 specifically because its individual mandate was deemed a valid exercise of Congress' taxing power, reducing that tax to zero — as Congress did — makes the entire law unconstitutional. It's an argument that many legal experts say is shaky, but a federal judge in Texas agreed with those who brought the suit.\n\nThe case, known as Texas v. Azar, is awaiting a ruling from the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals. The Trump administration, meanwhile, has declined to defend the federal health law. A group of Democratic attorneys general has stepped in, in its stead.\n\nIf the appellate court sides with the trial judge to overturn the ACA, the decision would likely be stayed and the case appealed to the Supreme Court. That could drag things out until next summer at the earliest.\n\nThe administration hasn't indicated what it might do if the health law is struck down — a scenario that would gut the individual marketplace and eliminate the ACA's consumer protections. But most experts agree it is also not likely to affect the 2020 coverage year.\n\nEarlier this month, Joe Grogan, who heads the White House's Domestic Policy Council, reiterated that the administration will be prepared after that decision comes down — adding that nothing's going to happen immediately.\n\nThis will surely go to the Supreme Court, Grogan said. It may or may not be decided — probably not decided — before the election.\n\nBut it's unclear what a White House response would involve. Neither President Trump nor Republicans in Congress have put forth a health care proposal that would maintain the protections the Affordable Care Act put in place.\n\nThat could be worrisome down the line, Keith and Corlette say. But any impact is far enough away that it shouldn't influence the way consumers choose health insurance for the next year.\n\nNothing will change right away, and it shouldn't affect anybody anytime soon, Keith says. Go enroll. Pay your premiums.\n\nEmmarie Huetteman contributed to this report.\n\nKaiser Health News is a nonprofit, editorially independent program of the Kaiser Family Foundation.

Employees Start To Feel The Squeeze Of High-Deductible Health Plans\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Nick Krug/Los Angeles Times Nick Krug/Los Angeles Times\n\nWorkers with a steady paycheck already know that wages have been stubbornly slow to rise. Meanwhile, those who get health insurance through a job have seen their deductibles shoot up. In fact, says Noam Levey, a health care reporter for the Los Angeles Times, deductibles have, on average, quadrupled over the last dozen years. As a result, even some people who have health insurance are having trouble affording medical care. We talked with Levey about his latest reporting into how the issue is affecting workers and their families.\n\nInterview Highlights\n\nOn why he decided to embark on this project:\n\nWe've spent so much time fighting about Obamacare over the last 10 years and talking about the uninsured that I think we lost sight of this quiet revolution that's happened with health coverage for the tens of millions of Americans who have coverage through an employer. These are the people who've seen deductibles rise astronomically — rising four times in the last dozen years from about $350 on average to $1,350 on average. In some cases, people are seeing $4,000, $5,000, even $6,000 deductibles that they have to pay out of their own pocket before their health insurance kicks in. Needless to say, many, many Americans can't afford those kinds of bills.\n\nOn what he heard in talking to people:\n\nWe heard some really heartbreaking stories. So we did a nationwide poll with the Kaiser Family Foundation as part of this project. One of the things that we found was that half of Americans who get job-based coverage say they or an immediate family member in the last year have put off going to the doctor, not filled the prescription or delayed some other kind of medical care because of concern about cost. We found one in five had depleted their savings to pay a medical bill in the last year and one in six reported that they have had to make some kind of difficult sacrifice in order to pay a medical bill.\n\nSome of them were really gut wrenching. We talked to a 27-year-old chef in western Virginia trying to start a family with his young wife. His wife had a miscarriage. They got such huge medical bills he had to take two extra jobs and was working from 5 a.m. until 11 p.m. some days.\n\nThese are people with health insurance. This used to be something we heard about all the time for people who didn't have health insurance, but in many cases these are middle-class people making $75,000 or $100,000 a year. But if they get a $5,000 or $6,000 medical bill — a family of four, kids in school — it's hard for a lot of people to come up with that kind of money.\n\nOn what's coming next in his reporting\n\nWe're going to be looking particularly at how these high deductibles are problematic for people who have serious medical conditions — diabetes, heart disease, even cancer. One of the things we found particularly troubling is that these people who should be going to the doctor, even they are cutting back on their treatment.\n\nWe're going to be looking at how these high-deductible plans are exacerbating inequality at a time when this is a major issue for Americans about who's getting the gains in our economy. If you're living paycheck to paycheck and you get sick, it's really tough for that group of people.\n\nOne of the other things that's amazing, and I know NPR has looked a little bit at this, is that the growth of online charities and crowdfunding sources like GoFundMe is being driven in large part by people seeking to pay medical bills. And one of the amazing things about those people is that many of them have health insurance.\n\nNoam Levey reports for the Los Angeles Times and can be found on Twitter: @NoamLevey.
If The ACA Falls, Protecting Preexisting Conditions Could Be Harder Than It Sounds\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Evan Vucci/AP Evan Vucci/AP\n\nPresident Trump has tried to get rid of the Affordable Care Act since the first day of his presidency, but there's one part of Obamacare that he wants to preserve.\n\nWe will always protect patients with preexisting conditions — always, Trump told a campaign crowd on Sunday in Londonderry, N.H. It's a message he has shared repeatedly in the final days and weeks before the presidential election.\n\nHe said it again in an interview with CBS' Lesley Stahl that aired Sunday on 60 minutes: We won't do anything — and no plan — unless we have preexisting conditions covered.\n\nA preexisting condition refers to any health issue someone has before they sign up for a health insurance policy — from high blood pressure to pregnancy to allergies. Before the Affordable Care Act, it was perfectly legal for health insurers to deny coverage to people with such conditions.\n\nAn estimate from the Kaiser Family Foundation suggests that about 54 million people have conditions that — without legal protections — could prompt health insurers to deny them policies. Polls show this is one of the most popular provisions of the law, across the political spectrum.\n\nAlthough Republicans failed to repeal the ACA in 2017, Trump now has another chance to strike it down; his administration will argue that the law must fall at the Supreme Court on Nov. 10, just one week after the election. The addition of Justice Amy Coney Barrett to the court could make this Supreme Court challenge more likely to succeed than two previous attempts.\n\nIf the law does fall, Congress and the administration would have to act fast to protect people with preexisting conditions. But actually making a law that does that is harder than it sounds. Here's why it's so tricky and how Trump might look to address the problem if he's elected for a second term.\n\nHow things worked, pre-ACA\n\nTo understand this problem, you have to time travel to pre-ACA times, says Sabrina Corlette, co-director of the Center on Health Insurance Reforms at Georgetown University.\n\nBefore the ACA, one of the essential business models for health insurance companies was to discourage risky people from buying into their plans and get as [many] healthy people as they could, she explains. That way, they could get the premium revenue and not have to pay out as much in medical claims.\n\nWhen you applied for a private health plan as an individual — as opposed to getting insurance through your job or a public plan like Medicare — insurers would usually require you to fill out a questionnaire and ask for permission to look through your medical records.\n\nIf they found a health condition that concerned them, Corlette explains, there were three things they could do.\n\nThe first tool they could use was to simply deny you a policy and just say, 'I'm sorry, we can't cover you.'  The second tool was to issue you a policy but to say, 'We won't cover any care related to your preexisting condition — we see that you have asthma, so we won't cover anything related to an upper respiratory condition.' \n\nA third tool would be to simply say, 'We will cover you, but we're going to essentially charge you a higher premium because we think you're a riskier person — we normally charge people $100 a month, we're going to charge you $150 a month,'  Corlette explains.\n\nThe ACA fix\n\nTo stop insurance companies from doing this, the Affordable Care Act needed to come up with a way to keep enough healthy people in the market to balance out the cost of covering more expensive, sick people.\n\nThink about fire insurance, says Larry Levitt, executive vice president for health policy at the Kaiser Family Foundation. If you let people insure their house once it's already on fire, everyone's going to wait until their house is on fire to buy insurance. It's a similar problem in health care: If you tell people with preexisting conditions that they're guaranteed access to insurance, people who are healthy will tend to wait to buy insurance until they get sick.\n\nIf the insurance market is made up of sick people who need lots of medical care, premiums skyrocket into what's known as a death spiral, he says.\n\nSo, the people who crafted the Affordable Care Act came up with incentives to get more healthy people into the insurance pool. The ACA had a carrot and stick, says Levitt. The carrot was subsidies provided to low- and middle-income people that made insurance a good value, and the stick was the individual mandate.\n\nIn 2017, Republicans in Congress changed the individual mandate's penalty to $0 as part of the tax bill. (The fact that the penalty is zero dollars is the basis for the legal challenge soon to be argued before the Supreme Court.)\n\nEven without the threat of a fine for not having insurance, though, the carrot of the subsidies is still in place and has been very effective at keeping premiums stable, Levitt says.\n\nAs Trump pointed out during Thursday's debate, premiums are down, everything's down. Enough healthy people are buying plans in the private market to keep premiums from skyrocketing, although critics still argue that high plan costs price people out of the market.\n\nThe challenges of alternate solutions\n\nSo without the ACA, how would Trump and his allies prefer to approach the problem?\n\nWe don't know where the president is on this, says Douglas Holtz-Eakin, president of the American Action Forum, a conservative think tank. Trump did sign an executive order related to preexisting conditions in September, but all it did, Holtz-Eakin says, was to say very firmly that the [health] secretary is going to have to figure this out.\n\nThere are other ways to incentivize healthy people to pay for health insurance. For Republicans, the leading alternative approach has been continuous coverage provisions, Holtz-Eakin says. This idea has been part of Republican ACA replacement bills before — people could be charged a fee and potentially be locked out of the market if they have a break in coverage, thus presumably motivating the young and healthy to stay consistently insured.\n\nHoltz-Eakin says the promise of this model is that an insurer has a stake in more than one year of your life — so there are now incentives to cover prevention more than there would be otherwise. Critics have argued that could actually disincentivize healthy people who don't have coverage from joining the market and hurt low-income people who already have trouble finding and maintaining health insurance.\n\nAnother Republican idea is to go back to high risk pools, which were common before the ACA. This divides the market into healthy people and sick people. That way, healthy people can pay lower premiums, but the pool for sick people gets expensive fast. Monthly premiums — even if they're very high — from the limited pool of sick people would not pay for all their care, meaning the government and insurance companies would have to step in to cover costs.\n\nOf course, on the other side of the political spectrum, there's the idea of Medicare for All, where everyone is covered in a government-funded plan. That would ensure people with preexisting conditions can be covered, says Levitt, but that's an idea the Trump administration would never go for.\n\nWhat could happen?\n\nIf the Affordable Care Act is fully struck down by the Supreme Court without a replacement, the preexisting condition protections go away, Corlette says, along with the insurance marketplaces, Medicaid expansion, premium subsidies and more. As a result, a recent Urban Institute analysis projected that 21.1 million could lose health coverage, a nearly 70% increase in the number of uninsured.\n\nAnother concern: COVID-19 might be considered a preexisting condition by insurance companies. That could mean millions more people affected by changes to these rules because of the pandemic.\n\nThere are a lot of outstanding questions. Would the Supreme Court justices give Congress a few months to come up with a fix to the ACA or pass a new law to prevent the coverage losses? Would the court make a narrow ruling that kept most of the law intact? Would it rule against the challengers, keeping the ACA as it is?\n\nWithout the ACA or another federal law requiring insurance companies to cover everyone regardless of their health, they would almost certainly revert back to their business model of yore, says Corlette. The incentives for them to start underwriting again and getting rid of high cost, high risk people are too strong.\n\nAs an example, if you're an insurance company in a city with two competing insurers, and you're the only one that is still taking sick people and enrolling them, you will quickly find yourself with the highest premiums, the fewest enrollees, and and you'll be losing money compared to your competitors, she says.\n\nThis is not what insurance companies want. Insurance industry group America's Health Insurance Plans submitted an amicus brief to the Supreme Court arguing that the ACA should not be struck down.

Ted Kaufman, a Delaware Democrat, who was appointed to Joe Biden's seat when Biden was elected vice president. Kaufman's 22-month term in office will end next Monday when Chris Coons is sworn in.\n\nROBERT SIEGEL, Host:\n\nSenator Kaufman, good to talk with you again. Welcome back.\n\nTED KAUFMAN: Hey. Thanks for having me.\n\nSIEGEL: And I'll ask you about securities fraud and the state of the republic in a moment, but first, what's it like to go from being the career staffer - briefing, planning, hiring, firing for someone else - to be the guy who's having all that done for him?\n\nKAUFMAN: Well, it's - I always thought it was a gigantic change, and I used to - you know, I taught about it. I've been teaching about it for 20 years at Duke Law School about the Congress, and I always used to say about, you know, there's - that the staff people are like - it's like volleyball where the staff people are the setters and the senators are the spikers. And it doesn't mean one is better than the other. You can't get by with either one of them. But I did find it's an incredible experience to be a United States senator. And it's - one of the reasons is that when you're a chief of staff, especially, you spend a lot - I remember one time a chief of staff introduced himself to a group and said I'm so-and-so's chief of staff, and my job is to worry.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER)\n\nKAUFMAN: And I think when you're a chief of staff, you really do. You worry about everything. And if you don't wake up one or two nights a week, staring at the ceiling, worried about something, then you're not really doing the job. But as a senator, not once did I ever wake up in the middle of the night worried about things.\n\nSIEGEL: A senator can sleep soundly at night knowing that someone else isn't.\n\nKAUFMAN: A senator can sleep soundly...\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER)\n\nKAUFMAN: ...exactly right, exactly right.\n\nSIEGEL: Now, one thing that you pressed for was a tougher crack down on Wall Street.\n\nKAUFMAN: Right.\n\nSIEGEL: And here back in April, you talked about the prosecutions you expected to come. A civil suit was brought by the SEC against Goldman Sachs, which was settled for half a billion dollars.\n\nKAUFMAN: Right.\n\nSIEGEL: But, you know, I read yesterday that the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority fined Goldman another $650,000...\n\nKAUFMAN: Right.\n\nSIEGEL: ...I think the equivalent of my getting a parking ticket.\n\nKAUFMAN: Exactly.\n\nSIEGEL: Is it fair to say that the market crash of 2008 has essentially passed without prosecution?\n\nKAUFMAN: No, I don't think we're done yet. I have had two hearings after we passed the bill that gave the Justice Department more FBI agents and more prosecutors, and it takes a while. These are very complex cases to run. They've had a number of civil rulings, and they've gotten rulings on, you know, Bank of America and Citigroup and others. This has not all played out, but, you know...\n\nSIEGEL: But...\n\nKAUFMAN: ...I don't think this is over.\n\nSIEGEL: But to cases that are brought three and four years after the fact...\n\nKAUFMAN: Right.\n\nSIEGEL: ...do they have any deterrent value if they...\n\nKAUFMAN: Oh, yeah.\n\nSIEGEL: ...(unintelligible)?\n\nKAUFMAN: When you commit fraud on Wall Street or endanger it, you have good attorneys around you to kind of clean up after you. So they clean up as they go. And then when you actually go to trial, these are very, very, very complex cases. But I still think we will have some good cases. And I also think that if isn't a deterrent, they will continue to do that. And I think we have the people in place now at the Securities Exchange Commission and the Justice Department to hold them accountable.\n\nSIEGEL: Think back to the 1970s, when you were first working in Senator Biden's office, does the conventional wisdom that the Senate is a very different place, a less civil place today than it was then, does it check out for you, or is it pretty much the same?\n\nKAUFMAN: Do people like legislation? They may not. And do some people wish that we could have - like I did - think to be good if we had a health care bill that had the public option in it? Absolutely. But you can't say it's dysfunction or gridlock when you passed such an incredible amount of legislation.\n\nSIEGEL: By the way, based on your lifelong experience of the legislative process in Congress, would you say that the health care bill is pretty much immune to legislative attack now, or that it's extremely vulnerable and it could well be undone in Congress?\n\nKAUFMAN: Look, every time we - this is one those things - every time we passed major legislation, I don't care what it is, we spend the next few years, you know, fixing it. So we're going to be changing health care reform, and I think it's healthy that we do.\n\nSIEGEL: No, but I mean undoing. I mean, people who have come to town saying let's repeal Obamacare, very frequently heard from Republican candidates.\n\nKAUFMAN: Now, do we want to - you know, they don't even know it's in there. What's going to have to happen, I think, is people are going to have to go back and actually look at the bill and say okay, this is what we want to do. And when they do, I think they're going to find that most of the things that are in that bill, when it comes to be actually litigated, most Americans really, really will like.\n\nSIEGEL: Well, Senator Kaufman, thanks a lot for talking with us once again.\n\nKAUFMAN: Thank you, Robert.\n\nSIEGEL: That's Senator Ted Kaufman, a Democrat of Delaware, whose time in the Senate ends next Monday.\n\nCopyright © 2010 NPR.

Meet Freshman Democratic Rep. Lauren Underwood Of Illinois\n\nSteve Inskeep talks to Democratic Rep. Lauren Underwood, who was elected from a formerly red district, about how she frames policy, and her place as the youngest black woman ever elected to Congress.\n\nSTEVE INSKEEP, HOST:\n\nWhen Representative Lauren Underwood welcomed us into her office, she was just finishing lunch at her desk. She's a new member of the House, and she's one reason Democrats won control last fall. She captured the 14th District of Illinois, which had been reliably Republican. Her reward is a modest office space near the Capitol and a chance to share a Washington apartment with a roommate, another House freshman, California's Katie Hill.\n\nAre you living this kind of insane sort of grown-up college life of working odd hours...\n\nLAUREN UNDERWOOD: It is not even that glamorous. We are scheduled from, like, 7:30 a.m. to probably 10, 10:30 p.m. So we both get home very late. I'm like, do you remember that meeting that happened at 10 a.m.? Wasn't that so crazy? And she is like - yeah, girl.\n\nINSKEEP: Not that glamorous, maybe. But Underwood is among the young, diverse House freshmen who've made a lot of this year's political news. She met us in the brief downtime between her Caesar salad and a press conference. She's 32 - born in 1986, a former nurse.\n\nUNDERWOOD: I am black. I know I'm black. The people in the 14th know I'm black, and I am a millennial, and I'm a woman. And so do I have an interesting perspective on issues that impact those demographic groups directly? Sure.\n\nINSKEEP: Although, Underwood says, she can represent people who identify differently. She faces a different situation than her outspoken fellow freshmen Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who represents a safely Democratic district in New York. Underwood is more typical of the Democrats who flipped seats in 2018. She's from a Midwestern district of suburbs and farms with a minority of people of color. Its congressman was once Republican House Speaker Dennis Hastert. In 2016, the district voted for President Trump. The reason we visited Underwood was to hear how a Democrat works to fit that district.\n\nI want to note that you're doing something that, in American politics, was really rare until recent years. And that is, you are African-American - you identify as African-American - and you're representing an overwhelmingly white district.\n\nUNDERWOOD: Yeah. I mean, we hadn't seen that happen in the Congress. And yet, in this 116th Congress, I'm not the only one. And so representation is important. And the idea that only certain folks can be representatives is one that I think that we have worked to completely redefine.\n\nINSKEEP: Her district extends from Chicago's suburbs to the Illinois prairie. And she says she is as determined to support mostly white farmers as anybody else.\n\nUNDERWOOD: Well, I think that there's a lot of issues that help communities of color that also help our community.\n\nINSKEEP: She campaigned by saying she would better stand up for the district's interests than the Republican incumbent. When President Trump's trade war affected Illinois farmers, she brought it up. She noticed the separation of migrant families at the border captured her district's attention. So she brought that up, too.\n\nUNDERWOOD: In this district that the Cook Political Report rated as an R+5 and was a lean-Republican until the weekend before the election, we won every county - even the most rural. There are people who supported us who have never voted for a Democrat before. We have people who will never, ever, ever, ever call themselves a Democrat.\n\nINSKEEP: People who voted for Donald Trump voted for you, do you think?\n\nUNDERWOOD: A hundred percent - hundred percent. And this is about representation and values. And for us, that issue was so illustrated with health care and what happened in the spring of '17 around Obamacare repeal and, you know, our prior representative's votes on the American Health Care Act.\n\nINSKEEP: Do you think you're to the left of the average voter in your district when it comes to health care?\n\nUNDERWOOD: Hmm.\n\nINSKEEP: You've said, if I'm not mistaken...\n\nUNDERWOOD: I don't...\n\nINSKEEP: ...You might like Medicare for All if it could be done. But I bet the average Republican would not like that.\n\nUNDERWOOD: I don't think so. I would challenge that statement because I believe that health care is a human right. And based on conversations - and I had many of them, mind you - throughout the year-and-a-half that I ran that a lot of people believe that as well.\n\nINSKEEP: Do you need to talk about health care in a particular way to avoid those kind of, you know, hot-button phrases that set people off?\n\nUNDERWOOD: I think that the words we use matter. And I've cautioned a lot of my colleagues here about literally the words that we use to talk about issues that we care about. Right? Student loan debt is an issue that is not partisan, it is very clear. And it's impacting so many individuals and families. If you start calling things free or for all, we lose some people.\n\nWe can talk about the solutions in a way that's inclusive. Right? So what if we talk about creating a modern financial aid system where we have Pell Grants that reflect the true cost of college and we have subsidized student loans that fill that gap? Some people might call that free college for everybody or whatever. But the people that speak in these, like, hashtaggy-type (ph) phrases do not always have lots of solutions underneath it. And...\n\nINSKEEP: The hashtag is the polarizing thing. It may draw some support to the idea, but it also drives people away.\n\nUNDERWOOD: Right. And I'm into solutions. And I am happy to speak in paragraph statements to talk about the solutions because - guess what - problems are not always illustrated in 140 characters, and solutions are not always illustrated in 140 characters.\n\nINSKEEP: This lawmaker, who carefully considers what to say, chose to say very little about another lawmaker's choice of words. The day we met Lauren Underwood was the day last week when the House voted to criticize anti-Semitism. The resolution answered remarks by Underwood's fellow freshman Ilhan Omar of Minnesota. That issue divided Democrats, and Underwood was determined not to give it any more fuel.\n\nDid she go too far?\n\nUNDERWOOD: I don't have a comment on that.\n\nINSKEEP: You don't?\n\nUNDERWOOD: I don't.\n\nINSKEEP: You've been pretty frank on every other issue. What makes...\n\nUNDERWOOD: That's why I'm being frank on this one.\n\nINSKEEP: Then why - what do - you mean you don't know what to think about it? Or...\n\nUNDERWOOD: I said I don't have a comment on it.\n\nINSKEEP: In the end, Lauren Underwood, like other Democrats, voted for the resolution condemning anti-Semitism and other forms of hate. But as she represents what is now a swing district, one expected to be competitive next year, she is not wasting many words.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF EUCHAETA'S PIANO LOOPS 001: LAUGHTER)\n\nCopyright © 2019 NPR.

White House Deputy Press Secretary Discusses Trump's Pick For Supreme Court Justice\n\nLULU GARCIA-NAVARRO, HOST:\n\nIt is official - Judge Amy Coney Barrett is President Trump's choice for the Supreme Court.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nAMY CONEY BARRETT: And that institution belongs to all of us. If confirmed, I would not assume that role for the sake of those in my own circle and certainly not for my own sake. I would assume this role to serve you.\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: That's Barrett speaking yesterday during a ceremony in the White House Rose Garden, where she praised the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg and spoke admiringly of the late justice she once clerked for, Antonin Scalia.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nBARRETT: His judicial philosophy is mine, too. A judge must apply the law as written.\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: If she is confirmed, she will cement the Supreme Court's conservative majority. Barrett is likely to face a contentious, partisan confirmation hearing. Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden tweeted last night, the Senate shouldn't vote until the American people do. Brian Morgenstern is the White House deputy press secretary, and he joins me now. Hello.\n\nBRIAN MORGENSTERN: Hi. Good morning. Thank you for having me.\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: It is a pleasure to have you. Briefly, why did President Trump choose Amy Coney Barrett?\n\nMORGENSTERN: Well, I appreciate the question. Thank you. Judge Barrett is an exceptionally well-qualified judge. Her academic record is sterling. Her professional record is sterling. She is on - just on a personal level, she's a wonderful person. She's a compassionate working mother from the heartland of America. And she is a constitutionalist. She believes in our country and the importance of our Constitution. And so for all of these reasons, she's an outstanding choice for the Supreme Court.\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: I'd like to play a clip of the president talking yesterday about the cases she will decide if confirmed. Let's listen.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Rulings that the Supreme Court will issue in the coming years will decide the survival of our Second Amendment, our religious liberty, our public safety and so much more.\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: That's a pretty partisan list. And she will decide other things, too, important to the other side. He's been clear on her stance on Obamacare and Roe v. Wade. He'd like them overturned. Is this the woman to fulfill that for the president?\n\nMORGENSTERN: Well, I just want to make it very clear, first of all, that, you know, the right to bear arms, the freedom of speech, freedom of religion, our Fourth Amendment rights - these are not partisan issues. These are in the Bill of Rights. These are important issues, really, for all Americans. The president has made clear his policy preferences. That's his job as a policymaker. But in choosing judges, it's very important he doesn't give anyone a litmus test. He would never ask a nominee their particular views on any hypothetical case. That would be inappropriate, and we would never want to put a nominee in that position.\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: But she has ruled on two abortion-related cases, both times favoring restrictions on access to abortion. Barrett also criticized Justice John Roberts in 2012 on his Obamacare ruling. So there is something there that shows how she might rule on issues that are of extreme importance.\n\nMORGENSTERN: But the judge's record is extensive, and she has always upheld the Constitution in terms of any particular cases. She's not prejudging something that might come before her, the Obamacare writings that you're referencing or about an issue that is different from anything that might currently be in the pipeline. But the bottom line is she is someone who will uphold the Constitution. She'll follow the law. She has testified already in front of Congress that it's not about her personal policy beliefs or any kind of personal opinion of hers. It's about upholding the Constitution and the rule of law. And that's really...\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: Let me ask...\n\nMORGENSTERN: ...All we should ask for.\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: Let me ask you this. Yeah. The president asked the Senate to confirm her. We should remind our listeners that Republicans refused to even consider President Obama's pick, Merrick Garland, seven months before the election in 2016. We are now just over a month away from November 3. People are already voting. Why should Democrats consider Barrett at all at this time?\n\nMORGENSTERN: Well, last time around, I remember the Democrats saying #DoYourJob. The president and the Senate Republicans are doing their job. It is - it's following precedent last time with a divided government during an election year. This time, it is a united government. And throughout history, presidents have always nominated a justice 29 times in an election year. And when the party of the White House and the Senate are aligned, I believe there are 18 vacancies, 19 nominations. Seventeen of those were confirmed, so it certainly in...\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: But there is an unseemly rush. I mean, the polls show the majority of Americans think the winner of the election should fill the seat. Fifty-six percent of respondents in the latest New York Times/Siena College poll have said to wait. Do the public's opinions not matter in this?\n\nMORGENSTERN: Well, you can find a poll - there are a lot of opinions. Just before Justice Ginsburg passed away, there was a poll that about two-thirds of Americans wanted the seat to be filled this year even if it were close to an election. But there are a number of justices who have been confirmed in far less time. John Paul Stevens was - I believe it was 16 days from nomination to confirmation. Justice Sandra Day O'Connor was...\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: But not so close to an election, which I think is the point that this is about. We do have to leave it there. I'm so sorry. Thank you so much, Brian Morgenstern, White House deputy press secretary. Appreciate your time.\n\nMORGENSTERN: Thanks for having me. Have a good day.\n\nCopyright © 2020 NPR. All rights reserved.

Secret To Maine's Touted High-Risk Pool? Enough Money\n\nAs the GOP health bill moves to the U.S. Senate, many consumers and lawmakers worry that people who have pre-existing conditions won't be able to find affordable health coverage if the bill becomes law.\n\nThere are a number of strategies under consideration, but one option touted by House Republicans borrows an idea that Maine used several years ago. It's called an invisible high-risk pool — invisible because people in Maine didn't even know when they were in it.\n\nThe program existed from 2012 until 2014, closing with the advent of the Affordable Care Act's insurance exchanges.\n\nThe Maine pool earned higher marks than most state high risk pools because it had a key ingredient: enough money.\n\nThe problem is that in order to do the Maine model — which I've heard many House people say that is what they're aiming for — it would take $15 billion in the first year and that is not in the House bill, Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, told Politico. There is actually $3 billion specifically designated for high-risk pools in the first year.\n\nMaine's program worked like this: When a resident applied for health insurance, they had to fill out a questionnaire. If they had certain medical conditions known to be costly, their application was flagged for the high-risk pool. To consumers, it was seamless. They paid regular premiums and got the same sort of coverage as any other enrollee in their chosen health plan.\n\nAs Mitchell Stein, an independent health policy consultant in Maine, explains it, the cost of these patients' more expensive health bills was paid by a nonprofit entity set up by the state — the Maine Guaranteed Access Re-insurance Association, or MGARA.\n\nThe money to pay for these high-cost patients came from two sources: the insurance policy premiums paid by patients within that high-risk pool, and a $4-a-month surcharge on all policyholders in the state.\n\nThis invisible high-risk pool was just one part of a larger health reform law in Maine, Stein says, and that makes a straight-up assessment of how well the strategy worked difficult. But it's a great theory, he says, and can be an appropriate way to handle these things.\n\nEric Cioppa, superintendent of Maine's Bureau of Insurance, agrees with Stein. In Maine, for the period of time it was operating, it worked very well, Cioppa says.\n\nThough only in effect for a brief period, Cioppa says, the invisible high-risk pool did keep costs down in the individual market, where Anthem was the largest insurer.\n\nWithout the invisible high risk pool, Cioppa says, Anthem would, by its own estimates, have increased rates more than 20 percent. Instead, the rates went up less than 2 percent.\n\nBut Steve Butterfield, policy director of the Maine-based advocacy group Consumers for Affordable Health Care, cautions that there was a crucial aspect of Maine's invisible high-risk pool that fueled its success: It was well-funded. The version proposed in the House GOP health bill, he says, is not.\n\nAn analysis that was done on what this program would need showed that it would need $15 billion to $20 billion per year to have any kind of reasonable impact on premiums, Butterfield says.\n\nThe GOP bill does allocate about $15 billion to $20 billion — but that is for almost a full decade, not per year.\n\nOne of our concerns, Butterfield says, is if the feds are going to put this in place and only kick in a token amount of money, is it going to be up to the states to pick up the slack — pick up the tab, and pay into this thing to make it work?\n\nFurthermore, Butterfield says, as the law stands now, under the Affordable Care Act, there's no need for high-risk pools of any sort. The idea to use invisible high-risk pools is a solution to a problem that the GOP health care bill creates. Right now people can buy insurance regardless of their health status, whether or not they have a pre-existing condition. It's the GOP bill that would allow states to opt out of that Obamacare rule.\n\nI don't understand, Butterfield says, why it would be a good idea to, on the one hand, say, 'Well, we're worried about pre-existing conditions, so we're going to throw not enough money at a problem we're creating. At the same time, we're going to allow insurance companies to charge sick people more.' \n\nAnd the invisible high-risk pool, says Stein, is just one small proposal within the larger health bill.\n\nThere's nothing inherently wrong with it, Stein says, but it doesn't really fix all the other problems of the bill.\n\nThose, he says, include cuts to Medicaid, and potential changes to what have been, under Obamacare, a guaranteed set of essential benefits.\n\nThis story is part of NPR's reporting partnership with local member stations and Kaiser Health News.
'Chief' Explores The Motivations And Impact Of SCOTUS Justice John Roberts\n\nDAVE DAVIES, HOST:\n\nThis is FRESH AIR. I'm Dave Davies, in for Terry Gross who's away on a special project today. In February, President Trump predicted that lawsuits challenging his emergency declaration to fund a border wall may succeed in lower courts but that when the matter gets to the U.S. Supreme Court, he will prevail. Our guest, veteran legal affairs correspondent Joan Biskupic, says the president may be misreading the thinking of Chief Justice John Roberts, who voted to uphold Trump's travel ban.\n\nIn a new biography of Roberts, Biskupic says his conservative beliefs have had a profound influence on American law but that he's also determined to protect the court's reputation for impartiality. Biskupic's book explores the roots of Roberts' conservatism and its impact on decisions involving voting rights, affirmative action, campaign finance and abortion. She also examines his vote upholding the Affordable Care Act, which enraged conservatives.\n\nJoan Biskupic was a legal affairs editor for Reuters and the Supreme Court correspondent for The Washington Post. A Pulitzer Prize finalist and the author of books on Sandra Day O'Connor, Antonin Scalia and Sonia Sotomayor. She's now a legal analyst at CNN. Her new book is The Chief: The Life And Turbulent Times Of Chief Justice John Roberts.\n\nWell, Joan Biskupic, welcome to FRESH AIR. Tell us a little bit about John Roberts' background. It was an affluent background, right? His dad was an executive at a steel company. He graduates from this prep school, goes to Harvard and works really hard there. He seems to have always been a really serious and focused young man. What did he sacrifice in return for all those efforts?\n\nJOAN BISKUPIC: His wife, Jane, told me that when he was at Cambridge - studying at Harvard, which he got through as an undergrad in just three years and then did law school in three years - he only went into Boston once or twice, that he was so devoted to his schoolwork. And she told me that he later regretted that he didn't get out and about more.\n\nThe other thing I want to mention is that his roommate said that he was rarely, you know, without a bottle of Pepto-Bismol. He tended to be good at fighting his nerves, but he did get a nervous stomach. And one consistent theme that I found throughout is that, as much as he presents himself so well and he seems to be such a fine speaker, he can get really nervous.\n\nAnd you know, those early episodes that people told me about when he was anxious about how he would do in school translated, then, to when he was an oral advocate. And everyone regarded him as so sterling, but colleagues would say his hands would shake almost uncontrollably before he would step up to the lectern to argue a case. So he became quite skilled at putting himself at ease and delivering in a way that really made his name in Washington.\n\nDAVIES: So he goes to Harvard Law School. He's on the Law Review, does great things and then ends up with a couple of clerkships out of law school, one of them with Supreme Court Justice William Rehnquist. What kind of influence did Rehnquist have on Roberts?\n\nBISKUPIC: At the time that John Roberts worked for William Rehnquist, Rehnquist was an associate justice. And he was at the far-right wing of the court and often alone. In fact, his clerks got him a little doll of the Lone Ranger because he often dissented alone. But William Rehnquist, in those years - in the late '70s and early '80s - was known for sowing seeds of legal reasoning that could then be picked up and turned from dissenting opinions into majority opinions, laying the groundwork for future rulings that would move the court in a more conservative direction.\n\nDAVIES: So in an opinion which may or may not go your way, you assert that such a certain legal principle has been established and recognized and then, four years later, call upon that assertion in another case.\n\nBISKUPIC: That's right. That's right. And just to flash forward to John Roberts' tenure as chief justice, we've seen him do that in the context of voting rights in a 2009 case to a 2013 case.\n\nDAVIES: The early years of his legal career were in the 1970s in which there were a lot of really contentious issues about, you know, affirmative action and school integration through busing, etc. In 1980, Ronald Reagan is elected. He was enthusiastic about Reagan. And he ends up getting a job at the Justice Department. What does he do?\n\nBISKUPIC: Yes. John Roberts had almost perfect timing throughout life. You mentioned that he came of age in the 1970s when, you know, there - you know, era of civil rights tension; liberalism is still dominant in America. But just as John Roberts is finishing his judicial clerkships, Ronald Reagan is elected. And conservatism suddenly is in ascendance. And John Roberts hears Ronald Reagan's inaugural speech in January of 1981. And he says - I felt the call; I wanted to be part of that.\n\nAnd he goes right from the clerkship with William Rehnquist to the Reagan Justice Department. And there he is, for the first time, with so many like-minded attorneys who want to roll back liberal-era policies. And he writes to one of his mentors, Judge Henry Friendly, who he clerked for on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit - and he writes to him and he says, this is an exciting time, when so much that has been taken for granted for so long is being seriously reconsidered.\n\nAnd John Roberts really found a home among other Reagan lawyers and was more than just an employee in the administration. He took up the call.\n\nDAVIES: One of the issues that he addressed in the job as deputy attorney general were - was issues of the Voting Rights Act and affirmative action. What kinds of positions did he take?\n\nBISKUPIC: John Roberts, almost immediately in coming to the Justice Department in 1981, joined the opposition to a broad interpretation of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. He believed that many of these issues of discrimination should be handled on the local level by the states and that judges shouldn't be as involved and that the federal government shouldn't be involved. And he became a strong lieutenant to then-Attorney General William French Smith to try to narrow the protections of the Voting Rights Act. And so many of the memos he wrote in those days, in 1981 and 1982, have themes that have translated into his rulings now on the Supreme Court.\n\nDAVIES: Can you think of an example of that?\n\nBISKUPIC: Yes. At a time when - Congress was looking at renewal of the Voting Rights Act - some very important provisions. And the Reagan administration was far to the right of where Congress was at the time, and Attorney General William French Smith was the public face of this position. And he was laying out the administration's position on renewal of the Voting Rights Act and how it shouldn't go as far as Congress wanted it to go. And he was trying to pull it in so, as I say, there wouldn't be as much federal enforcement in what Reagan officials felt would be matters better left to the states.\n\nDAVIES: And if I can just interject here - I mean, a lot of this involved provisions in the Voting Rights Act, which required changes in voting procedures in certain states with a history of discrimination - to have them reviewed by federal officials before they were enacted, right?\n\nBISKUPIC: Yes. There were two provisions that were on the table in late 1981 and 1982. But the core one that required renewal was what was known as Section 5. And that's the part of the Voting Rights Act that covers states and other jurisdictions with a history of discrimination. And those cities, states, municipalities were required to obtain Justice Department approval before changing any kind of electoral practices. That was to ensure that anything that they put in place - maybe a change in voting times, a new voting location, new voting district maps - that they wouldn't be discriminatory. So there was that screening preclearance process that was very important to enforcement of the Voting Rights Act and protecting African-Americans and Latinos from discrimination - essentially getting out ahead of it rather than another section of the Voting Rights Act, Section 2, which addresses discrimination after a policy is actually in place.\n\nSo John Roberts believes that - at this time, he's, as I say, trying to buck up Attorney General William French Smith. But he also feels that the Reagan administration's position on Voting Rights Act is being mischaracterized in the press. He was watching all the coverage. And he was also furious when anyone broke ranks from the Reagan administration position and would often write to his superiors about that.\n\nDAVIES: A lot of these writings would certainly be illuminating of Robert's views on some key legal issues and might be of issue when he later is appointed to the court or other positions. Was he concerned about whether these issues would be publicly available?\n\nBISKUPIC: He was, and this is part of John Roberts' great skill of looking ahead, always being many steps mentally ahead of either his colleagues or his adversaries. And he seemed to express some trepidation at the - about the possibility that some of his memos might soon be open. The Presidential Records Act of 1978 had been passed after the Watergate scandal, and that allowed disclosures of executive branch material 12 years after a president had left office, which, in Reagan's case, would end up being about 12 years from 1989.\n\nNow, again, he, is just, you know, in his late 20s at the time this is all going on, but he is seeing so far into the future that he starts talking - he starts encouraging officials in the Reagan administration to try to amend that act. And he writes a memo in 1985 that says, just think, any member of the public will only need go to the Reagan Library and see any internal White House deliberative document they want to see, unless we change things. And he refers to the, quote, pernicious effect of the statute; that's the Presidential Records Act of 1978.\n\nAnd he writes - this is - now, again, he's just a young man at this time. He writes, 12 years is a brief lifetime in public life. Many of the personalities who are now candidly discussing sensitive White House materials and certainly many of the authors of the memoranda - perhaps he's even thinking of himself, Dave - you know, will still be active 12 years from now, and how correct he was. John Roberts likely anticipated, without knowing exactly how it would happen, that his once confidential writings could one day be revealed and potentially used against him, as they sort of were in 2005.\n\nDAVIES: Right, a man who knows he is going places. So did all this material eventually become public when he was nominated to the Supreme Court in 2005?\n\nBISKUPIC: Yes, in 2005, once he's nominated to, first, succeed Sandra Day O'Connor, but then, of course, to succeed Chief Justice William Rehnquist, who has passed away, all these materials come out. And we see what he is saying about the Voting Rights Act, and we see what he's saying about, you know, reining in the core provisions I referred to earlier that were supposed to, you know, fight the disenfranchisement of African-Americans and Latinos at the ballot box.\n\nAnd so (laughter) he's faced with these memos, and they all come back to him. And it's especially, you know, Democrat Ted Kennedy of Massachusetts, Democrat Dick Durbin of Illinois and several others on the left are laying them all out to him and saying, why did you write this? Why did you write that?\n\nDAVIES: And he says, hey, I had a client; I was doing what my client wanted?\n\nBISKUPIC: That's exactly what he said.\n\nDAVIES: Joan Biskupic's new biography of Supreme Court Justice John Roberts is called The Chief. We'll talk more after a short break. This is FRESH AIR.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF CUONG VU AND PAT METHENY'S SEEDS OF DOUBT)\n\nDAVIES: This is FRESH AIR, and we're speaking with Joan Biskupic. She's done legal affairs reporting for Reuters and The Washington Post. She's currently a legal analyst for CNN. Her new biography of Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts is called The Chief.\n\nI want to take this discussion of the Voting Rights Act and the federal government's role in ensuring equal access to the ballot and the debate about that and fast forward to when many, you know, decades later, when he is the chief justice of the Supreme Court, and these same issues arose again. And in particular, there was - there were a couple of cases involving Seattle and Louisville, I believe, which really kind of drew this debate into sharp focus and created some really heated divisions within the court. You want to tell us what that was about and what Roberts' position was, as it emerged?\n\nBISKUPIC: So John Roberts gets on the court in 2005, and just a couple years later, a very important case involving school integration efforts comes before the Supreme Court. This is at a time when public school districts were creating programs to try to maintain integration gains of earlier decades or try to restore them after they've slipped away. And the Supreme Court gets two cases - one from Seattle and one from Louisville.\n\nAnd in both, school districts are trying to set up assignment schemes that allow for more integration of districts, and that's to fight national housing trends, where, you know, people start, you know, locking into segregated areas, and, you know, it turns out that black student population is in a particular area, and the white student population is concentrated in another, and for racial and ethnic diversity, school districts try all sorts of placement programs that would merge the two races.\n\nAnd two of these programs come before the Supreme Court, from Seattle and Louisville in 2007, and John Roberts takes the lead to strike these down. He thinks that they fly in the face of the guarantee of Brown v. Board of Education, which, of course, had rolled back the separate but equal principle. He doesn't like any kind of government policies that classify people based on race, even if they're trying to remedy segregation, even if they're trying to bring out more diversity.\n\nObviously, diversity has been seen as a compelling governmental interest in prior Supreme Court rulings. But he finds that these measures in Seattle and Louisville should be struck down, and his position is so far to the right that Anthony Kennedy breaks off and says, you are undermining the principles of Brown v. Board of Education. But John Roberts, in his statement for the Supreme Court, says that he really sees Brown v. Board as forbidding not just the kinds of policies that kept blacks in separate schools, but policies that would bring blacks and whites together in integration efforts.\n\nDAVIES: And sees them as equally harmful, right?\n\nBISKUPIC: Yes. He sees those measures as equally harmful and as both violating the equal protection guarantee of the Constitution.\n\nDAVIES: He seems to have held the position throughout his career, from a young man to the chief justice, that the way to stop discriminating on the basis of race is for the government to stop making any distinctions in policy based on race.\n\nBISKUPIC: Well - and this is the case where he offers a statement that is one of his strongest statements against racial remedies. And it's constantly echoing through his opinions, and it's constantly opposed by liberal justices. And this is when he says, the way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race.\n\nDAVIES: You wrote about how he worked as an assistant in the Justice Department of Ronald Reagan and was a strong advocate for conservative views. He also worked in the White House counsel's office for Reagan. He did some private practice and then was a - worked - I guess, a deputy solicitor general in the George H.W. Bush administration. And he, again, pursued a lot of conservative views, which were then reflected later in his judgments on the Supreme Court.\n\nLet's talk about a few. The issue of abortion came up often enough. What were his - how did he act on that issue?\n\nBISKUPIC: Yes. And just to take people back, he was working for Ken Starr at the time. Ken Starr is the solicitor general. And John Roberts comes in, and he's quite young. And he, again, just launches right in.\n\nAnd he helps the administration in its opposition to abortion rights, both in the core opposition to the right itself but also in terms of protecting the rights of abortion protesters who - at this time, if you remember in the early 1990s, Operation Rescue is blocking all sorts of clinic access. And that was an important issue for him, as was just the core issue of abortion rights. And he signs onto a brief that encourages the overturning of the 1973 landmark Roe v. Wade.\n\nDAVIES: And as Supreme Court justice, he pursued a similar course.\n\nBISKUPIC: Yes. John Roberts has continued to oppose abortion rights, but he has never had to face yet an up or down vote on whether to overturn Roe v. Wade as a justice.\n\nDAVIES: And do his opinions offer a clue as to whether he would welcome such a challenge?\n\nBISKUPIC: You know, Dave, this is what I would say about that. Yes. On one hand, his opinions reflect a continued opposition to abortion rights and the Supreme Court's precedents in this area. But as chief justice now, he is very mindful of the court's stature and the court preserving precedent. So I think there is real tension there that we will see play out in upcoming years when the Court has before it, squarely, a question of whether Roe v. Wade should survive.\n\nDAVIES: Joan Biskupic is a legal analyst for CNN. Her book is The Chief: The Life And Turbulent Times Of Chief Justice John Roberts. After a break, she'll talk about Roberts' concern for the court's reputation and his controversial decision on the Affordable Care Act. Also, Maureen Corrigan reviews the new novel by Laila Lalami. I'm Dave Davies, and this is FRESH AIR.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF BILL EVANS TRIO'S MILESTONES)\n\nDAVIES: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Dave Davies, in for Terry Gross who's away on a special project today. Our guest is CNN legal analyst Joan Biskupic who's written a new biography of U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts. She's previously written books about Sandra Day O'Connor, Antonin Scalia and Sonia Sotomayor. Her new book is The Chief: The Life And Turbulent Times Of Chief Justice John Roberts.\n\nDuring his confirmation hearings, he was emphatic about saying that, you know, judges aren't politicians. We don't make partisan decisions; we're umpires calling strikes and balls. You know, it's the right thing to say when you want to get confirmed. To what extent is it a deeply held belief on his part?\n\nBISKUPIC: I think he does believe that to an extent, but I also think it was very much of a slogan. He used it when in his interview with President George W. Bush when he was being interviewed for the job, and the president responded to it very well. And the public responded to it when John Roberts was there. But there is no strike zone in judging. You know, there - all sorts of factors are built into it, and John Roberts knows that. It's not just, you know, an easy set of measures on whether something is constitutional or not. A lot of interpretation is there. A lot - there's a lot of judging in judging.\n\nAnd we know from his record that he's looking at many things. He's not just looking at the black-letter law. So I think it was a convenient slogan to use at the time, but judging is much different than being an umpire.\n\nDAVIES: Right. And I think there's a related thing that arises in the political context of the day, which is that, you know, this is a time when partisanship was growing and has continued to grow. I wondered, was he concerned that the court not be an agent of partisanship, that it moderate debate rather than, you know, making it more extreme and contentious?\n\nBISKUPIC: Dave, right from the start, that was one of his main messages - that the judiciary is different from the elected branches. In one of his first speeches, he talked about that. When people would ask, what do you want folks to understand most about the Supreme Court? He said, the most important thing for people to understand is that we are not part of the political branches. He wanted to separate the court from the executive branch and the Congress, in effect, put it above the other two to say, we are not going to respond to constituencies. We're going to rule the way the law dictates. And in one early appearance, he said, you know, basically, if people don't like it, there's not much they can do, short of impeachment.\n\nDAVIES: One way to implement that as a justice is to rule narrowly on issues rather than broadly. I mean, don't look for opportunities to make sweeping changes in policy, right?\n\nBISKUPIC: That's right. Kind of a companion view to his idea that judges are different, that they're above the politics of the day is that they're going to move incrementally. And early on, he talked about trying to build consensus among his colleagues so that they could have not just a lot of 5-4 rulings but as many justices as possible to sign on. And he said the way to do that is to rule narrowly and not move the law much.\n\nYou might remember during his confirmation hearings he talked about trying to avoid jolts in the law, and he advocated measured steps. Now, in some areas of the law, he has done that. In other areas of the law, he has actually not done that. But those are two of his main messages. You can't label us Republican or Democrat. You can't label as Bush judges or Trump judges. And we are going to try to have more consensus here than divisions.\n\nDAVIES: And yet there is a record, clearly, of the court under Roberts kind of pushing policy in the direction - in conservative directions on voting rights and on money and politics. I mean, the Citizens United decision had a profound effect on the way campaigns are financed in the country.\n\nAnd you also point out - and I'd forgotten this - but there was this case that came out of West Virginia where a coal company executive had donated $3 million to a committee supporting a state Supreme Court justice which then cast the deciding vote on a $50 million jury verdict affecting that coal company. It certainly seemed like a case of conflict of interest. Roberts said no, it's OK. Where do his views about the influence of private money in politics come from?\n\nBISKUPIC: He has said that he is the strongest First Amendment justice there. He believes that more speech, more money is for the better. Let everyone have his or her say, and you have his or her say through money. And that West Virginia ruling that you referred to - he was in the minority. Anthony Kennedy was the one who wrote the opinion saying that that West Virginia judge should have recused because of a conflict of interest. And John Roberts took the lead for the dissenters. So that was a case that had the intersection of his view that there's no problem with money in politics but also his view that there should be public confidence in judicial integrity. And we shouldn't be second-guessing it, even when the facts are that West Virginia matter certainly undercut it.\n\nDAVIES: Conservatives found a lot to like in John Roberts as chief justice. And then there was the case challenging the Affordable Care Act. And this is a really fascinating chapter of the book. I mean, the justices held three days of oral arguments - right? - which is quite unusual. And it appeared that Roberts was going to join the majority in striking down the act. What happened?\n\nBISKUPIC: OK. So they go into their private conference - no secretaries, no assistants, no law clerks - just the nine. What we find out first is how they vote. We find out in late June of 2012 that he has joined the liberals in this stunning decision to uphold President Barack Obama's signature domestic act. And everyone thinks, how did that happen? But no one realizes at the time that actually what went on behind the scenes is that he had switched his vote. In fact, he switched his vote twice. But he had initially voted to strike it down. And behind the scenes, he started to have second thoughts. And he comes up with an alternative rationale based on Congress's power to tax.\n\nDAVIES: In other words, because the individual mandate was, you know - the penalties for violating the individual health care mandate were collected by the IRS, so you could treat it as a tax. And that was a way for him to uphold it?\n\nBISKUPIC: That's right. So much of the focus early on, Dave, had been on Congress's power to regulate interstate commerce. And in that view, John Roberts remained insistent that Congress had overstepped its power. And as I say, he changed his vote not just on the individual mandate but this other critical provision involving Medicaid.\n\nAnd the end result was a lot of anger among the conservatives on the court - that they felt betrayed by him - and some puzzlement on the part of the liberal justices about why he would do this. And, you know, I talked to a majority of the justices at the time this happened. And then I talked to a majority of the justices as I was working this out to try to figure out, why did John Roberts do this? And I can't give you a single answer, but I think intertwined with all of this is his concern for the legitimacy of the Supreme Court, perhaps his own legacy.\n\nHe knew about the problems with the health care system. He had represented insurance companies. He was aware of how long it had taken Congress to pass this kind of law. And he moved in this direction, I think, with many factors in mind. And it has certainly affected the public's view of John Roberts.\n\nDAVIES: Right. So he thought, it's a big economic issue, a big public health issue. Congress's will ought to have some weight. And he didn't want the court to look like a partisan hammer.\n\nBISKUPIC: That's true. We were in an election year in 2012. This looked like a battle between Republican appointee John Roberts and Democratic President Barack Obama. He didn't want that. He felt that if there was any way that the court could uphold this - and he found a way through Congress's taxing power - it should go that route.\n\nBut it does add another dimension to this man who insists that he's deciding cases only based on the law and only calling balls and strikes as an umpire would. But it was not without cost in terms of distrust among his brethren on the right wing. The positive side is that it has given him a reputation in the public mind of being more moderate. And I know that people still approach him and thank him for doing that because we know how important health care is to Americans.\n\nDAVIES: Joan Biskupic's new biography of Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts is called The Chief. We'll talk more after a short break. This is FRESH AIR.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF STEFANO BOLLANI, ET AL.'S ALOBAR E KUDRA)\n\nDAVIES: This is FRESH AIR, and we're speaking with Joan Biskupic. She's done legal affairs reporting for Reuters and The Washington Post. She's currently a legal analyst for CNN. Her new biography of Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts is called The Chief: The Life And Turbulent Times Of Chief Justice John Roberts.\n\nIt's a different Court now. You know, most - for most of his tenure as chief justice, Justice Anthony Kennedy was there, who was sort of a swing vote between the conservatives and the liberals. He has now been replaced by Brett Kavanaugh, so it's a more conservative court. And it was interesting to hear President Trump say about his controversial, you know, emergency funding for the border wall that he expected, you know, there would be a lawsuit and he would lose in the trial court but sooner or later it would get to the Supreme Court. And he was essentially saying, you know, like, that's my home court. It's, you know, game, set, match there; they're going to - I'm going to win there. Is he right?\n\nBISKUPIC: No. And in fact, the more he says that, I think it's more - the more Donald Trump talks about how the court is on his side, the more he's going to drive John Roberts to the left because the last thing John Roberts wants to do is to appear that he's reinforcing Donald Trump's notion that judges will automatically rule in the favor of the president who appointed them. We saw John Roberts come out with his rebuke of Donald Trump last November when he said, you know, we do not have Obama judges or Trump judges, Bush judges or Clinton judges. What we have are dedicated judges trying to do their best irrespective of who appointed them.\n\nJohn Roberts has new control without Anthony Kennedy. He had to negotiate with Anthony Kennedy, had to appease Anthony Kennedy. He spent a lot of time trying to twist his arm on cases because Anthony Kennedy held this key vote. But with (laughter) - with his new control comes a new dilemma. How he votes is going to determine how outsiders - the public, the other branches - see this Supreme Court. So that's a new burden on him. And for a man who from day one wanted to say, we are not political, now in the mix is probably an effort to counter the stereotyping that Donald Trump has done with the federal judiciary.\n\nDAVIES: You have some fascinating stories in the book about Justice Roberts' disputes with Justice Sotomayor and particularly her willingness to talk about her roots as a Latina growing up in the Bronx and how it gave her an understanding of the effects of ethnic and racial discrimination. And you know, one of the things that occurred to me as I read your book is how diversity matters and background matters.\n\nI mean, John Roberts grew up in a - you know, in an affluent background. And it seems that he excelled because he worked hard, and he was mostly in an atmosphere with other white students. But he did better than they did because of his own hard work and dedication and perseverance. So I think his own experience tells him, I didn't get any breaks; I earned what I have. This business about, you know, discrimination - there's a sense which I wonder if it just doesn't correspond to his experience intuitively whereas Justice Sotomayor says, yeah, I mean, I feel this. And I'm just wondering - I don't know - if you reflected on that and whether it argues for more diversity in the judiciary.\n\nBISKUPIC: You know, I think you just nailed something there, Dave. I don't know if you recall from the book where I write about a 2013 speech that John Roberts has given back at his prep school, La Lumiere.\n\nDAVIES: Right.\n\nBISKUPIC: And he talks about the importance of persistence. And he says, the single most important key to success is persistence. You just have to have the drive to press on. It's more important than money, than looks, than talent, than skill. Persistence will get you where you want to go. And I thought, first of all, he had all those other things. And he certainly was persistent.\n\nBut as you draw the contrast with Sonia Sotomayor, she'd probably say, well, I don't think a lot of people I knew in the Bronx could solve all their problems merely based on persistence. So I do think you have two different attitudes about what it takes and what the benefits and disadvantages are as somebody is trying to succeed. Their differences generate lots of tension at the court.\n\nDAVIES: You know, there's an interesting journalistic question for me here as I read the book. I mean, there's all - an awful lot of public material that you drew on. But you sat down with Justice Roberts, like, several times - what? - six or seven times.\n\nBISKUPIC: Eight times in the end.\n\nDAVIES: OK, OK, and a lot of it, I gather, was off the record. You wanted the benefit of his thinking on any basis. But I'm just kind of wondering how you worked that out, how you let it seep into your insights without betraying the terms of a conversation that's off the record.\n\nBISKUPIC: Yes. He let me visit him in chambers a total of eight times over many hours. It turned out to be, you know, about 20 hours. And they were tough conversations because he was so incredibly guarded. There were a lot of negotiations over what I could use, what I couldn't use that sort of reinforced my idea of him as certainly very controlling.\n\nBut I wanted to - I went in there with two goals - two overriding goals. One is I wanted to find out more about his life. I mostly wanted to find out about his - you know, his childhood, the influences on his life, his mother and his father, just what he thought of things. But then I also wanted to run by him what I had gotten from the other justices in my conversations with them, and I wanted to let him know some of my conclusions and where I was going so that I could get him to respond. And I wanted to, you know, test his views, you know, on race, which is a big part of this book. I wanted to test his views on, you know, what had happened in the Obamacare dispute, which is part of this book.\n\nSo I was seeking information, but I was also trying to understand him better. So even though the bulk of the conversations were off the record, they still helped me understand him and tried to get into his head as much as I could with someone who was so guarded. But as a journalist, I don't prefer obviously off-the-record or on-background conversations because I can't take the information out into the public sphere and test it. I often think that it's almost a license to get a subject to, you know, sort of steer me in a wrong direction.\n\nDAVIES: You're asking for spin (laughter).\n\nBISKUPIC: Yes, exactly. So what I would do - you know, I was constantly trying to assess the information I was gathering in these sessions, you know, trying to test out theories with other justices and with the record and with former clerks. So it was - let me just put it this way. When I was with Antonin Scalia for that biography, I had 12 on-the-record interviews, and everything was very straightforward. He owned everything he said. You know, what you see was what you got.\n\nWith Chief Justice John Roberts, he was a much tougher subject start to finish, but I wanted to get in and see him on whatever terms he would let me in. And in the end, Dave, he said to me - he ended up cooperating far more than he had anticipated, but there was still so much that I couldn't use. You know, I certainly couldn't use things as quotations, and I couldn't use some information from childhood that I wanted and some of his responses on these cases. But spending time with him one-on-one over so many hours was instructive.\n\nDAVIES: I can't resist asking you what you told him that other justices said about him that surprised him.\n\nBISKUPIC: Oh, well, I had to be so careful. I had to (laughter) - because of course you (laughter) - I would write at the top of my notepad, Dave, remember; you're there to get information, not to reveal information because he is such a skilled lawyer, obviously, that I knew he was trying to draw out from me, you know, who I had spoken to, what I had gotten from individual justices - that I - you know, I wasn't going to reveal who the source was of different things. So there was a real dance going on there (laughter) between us.\n\nDAVIES: Joan Biskupic, thanks so much for speaking with us.\n\nBISKUPIC: Thank you.\n\nDAVIES: Joan Biskupic is a legal analyst for CNN.

What The Man Who Ran Obamacare Thinks About The Republican Health Care Plan\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Evan Vucci/AP Evan Vucci/AP\n\nAndy Slavitt understands the inner workings of the U.S. health care system better than most. From 2015 to 2017, he ran the Affordable Care Act, sometimes called Obamacare, as head of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Since leaving that post in January, he's been an outspoken critic of the Republican proposals to dismantle it.\n\nYesterday, shortly after the release of the Senate bill, he tweeted, It's the ugly step-sibling of the House bill. And this morning his message was, We must start over. It's too important.\n\nSlavitt spoke with All Things Considered host Kelly McEvers about the latest Republican plan, called the Better Care Reconciliation Act, and where the Affordable Care Act goes from here. This interview has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nInterview Highlights\n\nFair to say there isn't anything you like in this new plan?\n\nWell, it's hard to say that you like the uniforms of the team that's got the guns pointed at you, trying to kill you. And I don't mean to exaggerate, but in the main, it's very hard to be supportive of something that takes health insurance away from 20 million or so Americans. The details that we've seen, at least so far, aren't particularly good for people with lower incomes. They're not particularly good for people who are sicker, and they're not good for people who are older.\n\nSupporters of the Republican plan say the Affordable Care Act's individual mandate forced people to do something they often didn't want to do. And that this new proposal would allow people to have more choice. True?\n\nWell, the individual mandate is about as popular as vegetables are with my kids. We know that. And we know that there needs to be something that helps keep healthy people in the pool, because if we leave people to their own devices to buy health insurance when they get sick, that will just drive the cost up for everybody.\n\nThere are choices and trade-offs made within [the Senate] bill that we should acknowledge. If you are a 27-year-old person who makes $70,000 a year and has no illness, this is a good bill for you. If you are younger and don't get your insurance through your employer, your insurance will be cheaper. It will cover a lot less, but that may not be a problem to you. You may be OK with that.\n\nThe challenge of course is that if you're over 50, or if you're sick, or if you live in rural areas and if your income is low, you pay the price. In fact, people who are over 50, many of them would be asked to pay as much as 50 percent of their income [for health insurance], and that's all in order to make the policies cheaper for younger people.\n\nThe problem our country has is how to help people who are in the lowest economic straits, who have the most health challenges, get access to affordable coverage and, indeed, get well. The problem we don't have is how to help 27-year-olds get cheaper insurance. That's just not a national concern for us right now.\n\nYou've talked about how the Affordable Care Act isn't perfect. If the Republican proposal does not pass, what could and should be done to strengthen what's already there?\n\nThis is really an interesting question because I actually am a big believer in bipartisanship, in large part because I don't think our country deserves to go through the back-and-forth of changing our health care system every election cycle.\n\nBut the only way bipartisanship happens is if partisanship fails. If this legislation fails in the Senate, I do think we'll have an opportunity.\n\nThere are a number of things that we can work on constructively to make insurance more affordable for people, to make insurance more competitive.\n\nI think if the people who drafted the ACA had it to do over again, there may be some things that would have been done differently. I think people would have liked to have had more enforcement of competition, more affordability for people in the middle class. I think there are plenty of practical solutions. The hard part is getting people to trust each other once again.\n\nJessica Deahl edited this story for broadcast.
Zinke Out, Mulvaney In (For Now) In Busy Weekend Of Presidential Tweets\n\nLULU GARCIA-NAVARRO, HOST:\n\nThe president has been spending this weekend on Twitter. He named his new interim chief of staff, announced the resignation of the interior secretary, celebrated a sweeping ruling by a federal judge deeming the entirety of the Affordable Care Act unconstitutional and complained about the investigation into his campaign's contacts with Russia. NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson is with us to tick through the tweets. Good morning, Mara.\n\nMARA LIASSON, BYLINE: Good morning, Lulu.\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: So Ryan Zinke is the interior secretary. And he's out. Budget director Mick Mulvaney is going to be acting chief of staff. So aside from the palace intrigue, what interests you about these moves?\n\nLIASSON: What interests me about Zinke is just how sensible it was. The White House wanted to cut their losses. Zinke was under several ethics investigations. And he would have been a prime target for Democrats in January. The interesting thing to me about the chief of staff search are the people who said no - Nick Ayers, 36 years old, former chief of staff for Vice President Pence. In any other world, no 36-year-old, ambitious guy would turn down the second-most powerful job in Washington. Chris Christie - someone who was competent, politically experienced, had the kind of stature that a chief of staff usually has, a big supporter of the president - also turned it down. I think it just shows that the president right now looks like a party of one. He's isolated just as he's starting his third year in office, lot of staff turmoil. And he still doesn't have a chief of staff.\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: Yeah. I think they all wanted to spend more time with their families...\n\nLIASSON: (Laughter).\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: ...Which is code.\n\nLIASSON: Yes.\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: The Obamacare lawsuit - let's talk about that. It hit just before last night's deadline to sign up for insurance on healthcare.gov. But there's no injunction included in it, right? So nothing changes for the...\n\nLIASSON: Right.\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: ...Moment. But after a midterm campaign in which Republicans really tried to soften their health care messaging, this is a reminder that the Republican Party is still trying to get rid of Obamacare, which I think seems risky considering what a big issue it was in this past election.\n\nLIASSON: Yes. But the president was tweeting triumphantly about this ruling, even though a lot of legal scholars think it won't be sustained on appeal. But I suppose if you are a Republican who wants to hasten the day when we get single payer or Medicare-for-all - of course, there are no Republicans who want that - you might like this ruling because I think this ruling, if upheld, could help accomplish that. But remember, in the 2016 campaign, Donald Trump didn't just say he would get rid of Obamacare. He said he was going to replace it with something better and cheaper for everyone. But Republicans were never able to pass an Obamacare replacement law. And as time went on, Obamacare got more and more popular. So I think this ruling goes under the beware of what you wish for - you just might get it - category.\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: I want to talk about the investigations into Donald Trump, of course, and the sheer volume of them. You know, even before Democrats take control of the House next month, as The Washington Post headline put it, nearly every organization Trump has led is under investigation. CNN's John King rattled off the list at the top of his show on Friday. Let's listen.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nJOHN KING: The Trump campaign, the Trump transition, the Trump inauguration, the Trump administration, the Trump Organization and the Trump Foundation are all under investigation.\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: That's a lot of Trump. There is a difference between smoke and fire. But, Mara, that's a lot of smoke.\n\nLIASSON: That's a lot of smoke. It means, at the very least, the White House will be distracted. They haven't staffed up to deal with all of these investigations. The president is very focused on this. He tweets about it a lot. So you know that it's consuming his time and energy. And all of this is going to be highlighted and expanded on by a new Democratic House with subpoena power in January.\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: Just briefly, you know, these are different, right? You have domestic stuff, allegations of tax fraud, campaign finance violations. But there are also accusations of foreign influence and collusion. What do you think threatens the White House more?\n\nLIASSON: Well, right now just on a purely legal basis, the campaign finance and tax law violations are a bigger threat. And don't forget, they're not part of the special counsel's investigation into whether Trump conspired with Russia to influence the 2016 elections. They're coming from Trump's own Justice Department. But that's why you hear the president's supporters in Congress saying, well, it's just campaign finance, just tax law - kind of like a parking ticket. And you hear the president's lawyer Rudy Giuliani saying, no one got killed. No one got robbed.\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: That's NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson.

If Pelosi Returns As Speaker, So Would The GOP Playbook Against Her\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption J. Scott Applewhite/AP J. Scott Applewhite/AP\n\nFor nearly a decade, Nancy Pelosi was the GOP's not-so-secret weapon.\n\nTying a congressional candidate to the Democratic leader and raising the specter of another would-be speakership was a Republican's silver bullet for much of the past decade.\n\nBut in 2018, that strategy failed — badly. Democrats flipped control of the House and are on pace to pick up as many as 40 seats with their biggest popular-vote margin since the Watergate scandal, and Pelosi is hoping to become speaker of the House again as her fellow Democrats take a first vote Wednesday.\n\nIn part, Republicans say Democrats successfully distanced themselves enough from Pelosi in 2018 to convince voters of their independence. But with many of them coming around to voting for her for speaker again, don't count on the Pelosi strategy among the GOP to go away any time soon.\n\nI still think she's a toxic figure and and an unpopular figure to definitely tie Democrats to, said GOP strategist Andrea Bozek, a former communications director at the National Republican Congressional Committee. That's why you had a lot of Democrat incumbents and candidates during the campaign say that they weren't going to vote for her, which is sort of unprecedented.\n\nPelosi has once again shown her political prowess in wooing even skeptical lawmakers and wavering freshmen to her side. A formal vote for speaker won't be held until January, but enough possible defections have now petered out that it looks as if the California Democrat will claim the gavel again.\n\nCoalescing support\n\nOn Tuesday, a group of 20 freshmen — including some who were lukewarm about her on the campaign trail — released a letter explaining their rationale for backing the 78-year-old Pelosi now.\n\nThe incoming class of first-term members is younger and more diverse than ever before. A proven leader like Leader Pelosi will be a valuable resource as we, ourselves, step up to lead, and as we work to make life better for the people we represent, the letter reads.\n\nOne of those signatories, Rep.-elect Angie Craig of Minnesota, admitted that she campaigned saying she would consider new leadership but said Tuesday during a panel discussion on bipartisanship that you can't beat something with nothing and that she was supporting Pelosi after meeting with her and talking about taking action on several issues she stressed during her campaign.\n\nOther possible Pelosi challengers also backed down. Ohio Rep. Marcia Fudge was a possible alternative, but she announced last week that she would support Pelosi after squeezing concessions from the leader and being granted a position leading a revived panel on election administration. New York Rep. Brian Higgins, who had earlier signed an anti-Pelosi letter, also reversed course.\n\nAccording to a list by NBC News, there were at least 58 incumbents or candidates during the cycle who said they either wouldn't support Pelosi or had signaled they were open to new leadership, far more than the number that would be required to block her path if they all opposed her.\n\nRep.-elect Lauren Underwood of Illinois was one of those on the fence. But she also said Tuesday that she eventually realized that people in Washington were focused on Pelosi but said flatly people at home don't care.\n\nUnderwood said she was asked by reporters regularly during the campaign about Pelosi but argued we are missing so much of the other issues that voters care about with the intense focus on the Democratic leadership race.\n\nStill a lightning rod?\n\nDemocratic strategists say their winning strategy in 2018 proved that Pelosi isn't the motivating factor she once was for that very reason, with their more issue-focused ads on things like health care and entitlements showing voters want solutions and not just rhetoric about who will be in leadership.\n\nThis is an old, tired playbook they've really been trying since dating back to 2006, said Democratic consultant and ad-maker John Lapp. Republicans ran it in districts across the country, and it really fell flat in some ways, and in some ways, I would say it backfired.\n\nRepublicans have long tried to use the San Francisco lawmaker as the embodiment of the ideals that Republicans knew were anathema to much of middle America — a liberal, coastal elite whom they could paint as wanting to raise taxes and inflate the deficit.\n\nSome Democrats argue that the way Republicans tried to use Pelosi as a political weapon this year was especially tone-deaf, as white women in suburban districts revolted from the GOP.\n\nThere's a huge element of sexism here. Usually [Pelosi] looks like she's screeching or yelling and has an angry face in all of these ads. It's sort of symbolic of women's power in workplace and women's leadership, but for some voters, that is threatening, said Democratic pollster Anna Greenberg. Suburban, professional, well-educated women are very, very supportive of women in leadership, and Pelosi is very popular among them.\n\nThere were signs even before Election Day that there were cracks in the GOP's strategy. An internal Republican poll obtained by Bloomberg News in September showed that voters were more likely to back a Pelosi-aligned candidate that once endorsed by President Trump by 5 points.\n\nRepublican groups still ran ads wielding Pelosi in some of the races that Greenberg worked on this past cycle, including Democrat Lizzie Pannill Fletcher's victory over Texas GOP Rep. John Culberson.\n\nYouTube\n\nGreenberg said she ultimately never saw the numbers move that much after such an attack. However, other Republicans privately say that if they did not try to use Pelosi again in some races and make her a villain nationally, they could have lost even more seats.\n\nFletcher was another incoming freshman who signaled during the campaign that she wouldn't necessarily support Pelosi as speaker. But she is among those who have since come around and say they will back the California congresswoman for the position — something even Republicans give Pelosi credit for as evidence of her political skills and negotiating prowess.\n\nOther Republicans admit the reason making Pelosi a boogeyman didn't work this year is simple: Democrats had a bigger one this time around.\n\nIt begins and ends with Trump, said GOP strategist Doug Heye. Pelosi does motivate Republican base voters. But clearly Democrats had a whole lot more they were motivated about than Republicans.\n\nHeye was communications director at the Republican National Committee in 2010 when the Affordable Care Act passed while Speaker Pelosi led the Democratic House majority, and he helped lead the GOP's Fire Pelosi initiative that would ultimately be successful in that year's midterm elections as Republicans were swept into power. But as Heye explained last week in a Daily Beast op-ed, there was one clear reason Republicans were so focused on getting rid of Pelosi.\n\nNancy Pelosi, we believed, had to go precisely because she was so effective. Had Speaker Pelosi not been able to get Obamacare through, our campaign had no rationale, Heye wrote.\n\nFreshmen like Fletcher and Underwood who remained uncommitted to voting for Pelosi, or some who remain outright opposed to her, did somewhat inoculate themselves from political attacks. Republicans say that in a March special election around Pittsburgh, in which Democrat Conor Lamb was able to flip a GOP-held seat, the moderate Democrat provided a playbook for distancing himself from his party's leader that others were able to replicate.\n\nAnd on a micro level, perhaps the Pelosi strategy did work. Republicans credit it with helping them save another special election last year in Georgia's 6th District. But when things go macro, it's harder to stop the bleeding. After all, that same district in the Atlanta suburbs fell into Democratic hands in the midterms.\n\nEven with less-than-stellar results this year by doubling down on Pelosi, not all Republicans are ready to abandon that strategy in the future. And with freshmen in swing seats reversing course and backing Pelosi, Republicans are eager to get that footage of them casting their voice vote for speaker in January that can be used against them.\n\nDemocrats opposed to Pelosi also argue she's putting these new members in a tough spot on their first vote in Congress.\n\nSome in the GOP point out that, with Democrats partially controlling one branch of government, a Speaker Pelosi could actually help Trump, with his easily making her a scapegoat in a way that voters might believe easier now that Democrats have some power back.\n\nAnd if he can build her into even more of a drag, don't be surprised if Republicans revive their Pelosi strategy again in 2020.\n\nNPR congressional editor Deirdre Walsh contributed.
Trump Decision to End Insurance Subsidies Sparks Outrage, Lawsuits\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Drew Angerer/Getty Images Drew Angerer/Getty Images\n\nThe reaction has been swift since President Trump announced late Thursday that he was cutting off Affordable Care Act subsidies to insurance companies.\n\nThe White House argues that the payments are illegal.\n\nBased on guidance from the Department of Justice, the Department of Health and Human Services has concluded that there is no appropriation for cost-sharing reduction payments to insurance companies under Obamacare, the White House said in a statement. In light of this analysis, the Government cannot lawfully make the cost-sharing reduction payments.\n\nMany analysts and advocacy groups say this is just part of an ongoing campaign by the Trump administration to undermine the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare.\n\nHealth Care White House Actions Could Undermine ACA's Insurance Markets White House Actions Could Undermine ACA's Insurance Markets Listen · 3:12 3:12\n\nHere's what's happened so far.\n\n1. Lawsuits\n\nNew York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman says he is joining peers in California and several other states in filing a lawsuit to protect the subsidies. Schneiderman says the lawsuit will argue that the subsidies are codified under the ACA, and therefore, they must be paid as long as the health care law remains in force.\n\nEliminating the subsidies is breathtakingly reckless, he said. This move is unacceptable, it's cruel, and it is unlawful.\n\n2. Surcharges\n\nCovered California, the state's health care exchange, told insurers to add a 12.5 percent surcharge to their silver-level policies to offset the loss of subsidy payments.\n\n3. Doctors' opposition\n\nSix physician organizations, including the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Academy of Family Physicians, said in a joint statement they're alarmed by the administration's move. The decision stands to hurt the most vulnerable individuals and families, raising cost for them and the federal government.\n\n4. No dice on legislative fix\n\nWhite House Budget Director Mick Mulvaney says the president won't support a bipartisan effort led by Sen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., and Patty Murray, D-Wash., to fund the subsidies along with other changes.\n\nIs the president interested in continuing what he sees as corporate welfare and bailouts for the insurance companies? No, Mulvaney said in an interview with Politico on Friday.\n\n5. Reassurance\n\nInsurance companies tried to reassure their current customers that things have not changed, yet.\n\nThe trade group America's Health Insurance Plans and Blue Cross Blue Shield Association said in a joint statement that the payments aren't bailouts: These benefits help real people every day. The insurers said they will fight to keep the subsidies.\n\nDaniel Hilferty, CEO of Independence Blue Cross in Philadelphia, sought to ease the worries of his customers. We want to assure our members that their coverage remains in effect and unchanged.\n\nThen he added, We are currently evaluating what this announcement may mean for individual consumer plans in the future.
Former Rep. John Dingell, Longest-Serving Member Of Congress, Dies At 92\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n\nUpdated at 10 p.m. ET\n\nThe man who served in the U.S. Congress longer than anyone else in history has died.\n\nJohn Dingell, a Democrat who represented Michigan in the U.S. House of Representatives starting in 1955 until January 2015, died Thursday at the age of 92, his wife, Rep. Debbie Dingell, confirmed. John Dingell served for 59 years in Congress and cast more than 21,000 roll call votes. He was undefeated in 30 elections.\n\nDebbie Dingell wrote, It is with a heavy heart that we announce the passing of John David Dingell, Jr., former Michigan Congressman and longest-serving member of the United States Congress. Congressman Dingell died peacefully today at his home in Dearborn.\n\nHe was a lion of the United States Congress and a loving son, father, husband, grandfather, and friend. He will be remembered for his decades of public service to the people of Southeast Michigan, his razor sharp wit, and a lifetime of dedication to improving the lives of all who walk this earth, she said.\n\nEvery now and then, you hear the expression somebody is a 'living legend.' That doesn't even begin to describe John Dingell, then-House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said as Dingell began his retirement in 2015.\n\nWhen he came to Congress, Americans had Dwight Eisenhower as president, Brooklyn had its champion Dodgers baseball team, and Elvis Presley had his first gold record, said Rep. Steny Hoyer, D-Md., the No. 2 House Democrat. But what I will point out is what Americans did not have. Americans did not have the Civil Rights Act or the Voting Right Act.\n\nDingell supported both of those landmark pieces of legislation. They were, he said, his most important votes.\n\nHe also championed the Clean Air and Water acts; Medicaid and Medicare; and like his father, John Dingell Sr., who served before him, he introduced a national health care bill every session until the Affordable Care Act came along.\n\nIt meant success. It meant people were no longer going to confront the problems they faced on health care, Dingell said about the ACA just before leaving office. It was a very humane and necessary thing.\n\nOne Democrat in Congress opined that Obamacare should be called Dingellcare.\n\nA life in Congress\n\nJohn Dingell's time in the House predated his election. The son of a representative, he was working as a page in the House chamber in 1941 when former President Franklin Delano Roosevelt delivered his famous speech declaring a day of infamy following the attack on Pearl Harbor.\n\nDecades later, Dingell recalled watching Roosevelt in leg braces, struggling with the effects of polio as he moved to the podium to speak that day.\n\nHe actually walked ... and he was supported by 10 pounds of iron — he had these frames that held him, Dingell said.\n\nWhen he turned 18, Dingell enlisted in the armed forces, but he never saw combat. College and law school at Georgetown University followed, with help from the GI Bill. He then worked a stint as a county prosecutor in Detroit.\n\nDingell came to Congress at age 29 after winning a special election in 1955 following his father's death.\n\nHe rose to the chairmanship of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, wielding great power and commanding great respect.\n\nA fierce advocate for the U.S. automobile industry, Dingell was often at odds with environmentalists, though they also applauded his work on conservation, clean air, water and protecting endangered species.\n\nIn 2008, when General Motors and Chrysler were seeking a government rescue amid the financial crisis, Dingell fought for a bailout.\n\nI'm here to tell you this is too big a disaster for us to invite. Imagine a nation with double-digit unemployment. That's what we're going to be talking about, Dingell told NPR's Morning Edition.\n\nLate in his career, Dingell bemoaned the rise of the Tea Party and the bitter partisanship that he said made compromise so difficult.\n\nI am sad to leave the Congress. I love the Congress. I will observe that my sadness is ameliorated by the poisonous atmosphere that we see in Congress today, he said during a speech at the National Press Club in 2014.\n\nWhen Dingell retired, his wife won election to his seat — meaning southeast Michigan has been represented by a Dingell in Congress continuously since 1933. Debbie Dingell was re-elected to a third term in 2018.\n\nRetirement did not mean John Dingell disappeared. He became a regular presence on Twitter, with a feed that weighed in on everything from University of Michigan football to the current political scene.\n\nDingell was playful and pointed into his 90s. In April 2018, during the runup to the midterm elections, he tweeted: To my Republican friends in Congress: Retirement is a blast. Naps. Snacks. Join me.
GOP Candidates Mount Costly House Race In Tenn.\n\nThe most costly House race this election cycle is in west Tennessee, where two doctors and a farmer are spending millions just to win the GOP nomination. They're vying for an open seat. Rep. John Tanner is retiring from the seat he's held for two decades in an area that has been represented by Democrats for a century. Republicans see a potential takeover target and have invested heavily in the primary fight, which has taken on a negative tone.\n\nMELISSA BLOCK, host:\n\nYou're listening to ALL THINGS CONSIDERED from NPR News.\n\nNow to this election season's most costly House primary. For more than a century, a Democrat has represented the farm towns and suburbs of west Tennessee. Over the last two decades, it's been John Tanner, a fiscally conservative Blue Dog Democrat. But now he is retiring and Republicans see an opportunity.\n\nFrom member station WPLN, Blake Farmer reports on the three candidates vying for the Republican nomination.\n\nBLAKE FARMER: Two doctors and a farmer have shelled out more than $5 million between them buying ad time in Memphis and Nashville and stuffing all the mailboxes in between\n\n(Soundbite of a political ad)\n\nUnidentified Woman #1: One candidate stands out: George Flinn. He's the only...\n\nFARMER: As his ad in heavy rotation suggests, Flinn does stand out. He's a radiologist by trade and made his money owning more than 40 TV and radio stations. Flinn has outspent his opponents three to one by putting in nearly $3 million of his own fortune.\n\nDr. GEORGE FLINN (Republican Congressional Candidate): I didn't get it donated from so-and-so. I made it myself, and I'm spending it to get the message out because my kids, my grandkids deserve better than they're getting.\n\nFARMER: While the big spender, even Flinn's own polls show him trailing the other two GOP candidates. Out front has been Stephen Fincher.\n\nMr. STEPHEN FINCHER (Republican Congressional Candidate): I'm from Frog Jump, Tennessee. I'm a farmer.\n\nFARMER: Working a room of Republican voters, Fincher lays into the party in power and plays up his common man credentials.\n\nMr. FINCHER: You know, I didn't graduate college, and I'm afraid some people with more education than I have will think I'm not smart enough. And I had a fellow asked me one day, he said, well, I don't think that's an issue. And he said, you're smarter than Nancy Pelosi and Barney Frank, aren't you? And I said yeah. He said...\n\nFARMER: Fincher is the National Republican Congressional Committee's pick. The NRCC has helped the political novice's campaign and raised money.\n\nDr. RON KIRKLAND (Republican Congressional Candidate): My question is what does he owe them in return? I don't owe them anything.\n\nFARMER: Ron Kirkland criticizes Fincher both as connected to Washington but also inexperienced. The first time Fincher traveled to Washington was to meet with the NRCC. Kirkland is a physician from Jackson, whose name is better known because of his brother Robert who cofounded the Kirkland's chain of home decor stores. That brother is running something of a shadow campaign. He spent more than a million dollars on an independent expenditure, airing ads that slam Kirkland's opponents.\n\n(Soundbite of political ad)\n\nUnidentified Woman #2: How about a radio mogul whose station promotes gang violence, drug abuse and insults women? Well, George Flinn is that man.\n\nFARMER: Negative ads have come from every direction in a race where all three Republicans want to repeal what they call Obamacare. Ron Kirkland has been jabbed for lobbying for direct payments to doctors under the health care overhaul. Since he's calling for spending cuts across the government, he's had to backtrack.\n\nDr. KIRKLAND: I can't then turn around and say except for the things that I was for when I was a doctor and in charge of American Medical Group Association. I have to be sincere enough, have to be meaningful enough to say let's cut the group that I represented too.\n\nFARMER: Kirkland has tried deflecting the attention toward the millions of dollars Fincher has received over the years in farming subsidies. Fincher says he has no choice. He's also playing defense for a voting in Democratic primaries as recently as this year.\n\nDr. FINCHER: If you want to vote in Crockett County in local elections, we've never had anything but Democratic primaries.\n\nFARMER: It shows just how entrenched the Democratic Party still is in Tennessee's 8th Congressional District, even though voters here have turned more Republican over the last two decades. The winner of this week's high-spending primary will still have a hill to climb in the general election - a minister-attorney and well-liked state senator named Roy Herron is sitting on a million dollars waiting to meet the GOP nominee on the other side of election night.\n\nFor NPR News, I'm Blake Farmer in Nashville.\n\nCopyright © 2010 NPR.

Sunday Politics: No Slowdown In 2020\n\nLULU GARCIA-NAVARRO, HOST:\n\nAs we close out 2019, let's acknowledge one fact. It's been a year, friends. And while we don't know what President Trump's New Year's resolution is, he's certainly keeping up his Twitter habit while on holiday, including reposting a tweet that mentioned the name of the alleged whistleblower who launched the impeachment inquiry.\n\nWe have national political correspondent Mara Liasson with us here at the end of the year. Hi, Mara.\n\nMARA LIASSON, BYLINE: Hi, Lulu.\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: So Mara, these retweets included a post that not only names the alleged whistleblower but also accuses the whistleblower of perjury. What are the ramifications? Aren't there federal whistleblower protection laws?\n\nLIASSON: There are federal whistleblower protection laws, and they are supposed to protect the identity of the whistleblower. The whistleblower law that pertains to the intelligence community says that the president is supposed to protect the identity of the whistleblower, but of course, the president doesn't believe the whistleblower protection laws apply to him. He doesn't believe, in general, most laws apply to him. He said, famously, Article II of the Constitution allows him to do whatever he wants.\n\nBut the big question - and this is the question that always arises when the president shatters another norm - is what, if anything, Congress will do about this. What, if anything, will Republicans in Congress say about this? We haven't heard a word, including from Chuck Grassley, Republican senator of Iowa, who wrote many of the whistleblower laws and co-founded the Senate Whistleblower Protection Caucus. Nobody - we haven't heard a word from him, although people have reached out to him for comment from various news organizations.\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: OK. Now, in 2018, the voters decided that they wanted a divided government. They wanted a check on the president, and they elected a Democratic House. Did they get what they wanted? Is this what happened?\n\nLIASSON: They certainly got a check on the president. The House just impeached President Trump. If - whether that's the check the voters wanted, we'll find out. But voters generally vote for divided government for two reasons. One is to stop the president from doing things they don't like. In this case, in 2018, many voters went to the polls because they didn't like the president's border wall or the tax cuts for the wealthy or his attempts to get rid of Obamacare. But they also vote for divided government because they want both sides to work together. And at year-end, we did get a kind of split-screens finish where even though the president was impeached in the House, the House also voted to approve the new NAFTA, the USMCA...\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: Right.\n\nLIASSON: ...Trade deal. And so that is something that voters wanted. The president was willing to make some concessions to Democrats to get it through the House - more labor and environmental protections.\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: So this is all happening at a time when we have the Democratic primary at the end of the year. So where are we there?\n\nLIASSON: This year ended much the way it started in the Democratic primary. Joe Biden is still the front-runner. He's still at the top of the polls. He's still a vulnerable front-runner, but he hasn't been pushed aside. There has been a lot of movement in the race. Elizabeth Warren has moved up and down. Kamala Harris flamed out. Cory Booker never got traction.\n\nBernie Sanders surprised everyone by being the oldest candidate in the field in either party, having a heart attack and also not losing any ground. Maybe it's a little bit like Donald Trump and all the outrageous things that pundits said would be the end of his political career. Sanders' heart attack did not dent his position in the polls, and Biden's stumbling speech and his age have also not seemed to have mattered as much as we thought they might.\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: All right. What are you watching for as these - as the - you know, the voting's going to be pretty imminent.\n\nLIASSON: The voting is pretty soon. What I'm watching for is, will there be a clear winner out of Iowa, someone who can develop some momentum to win New Hampshire and go on to win other states, or will we get a muddled result either - all four top contenders - Warren, Sanders, Biden and Buttigieg - coming out of Iowa with a point or two of each other, or maybe a different person wins Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada. And then Mike Bloomberg, who is sitting there in the wings, having spent $100 million so far on advertising, waiting to make his mark in the big Super Tuesday states - does he take advantage of that? I think the other thing I'm looking for is, can Biden place very close to the top in Iowa? I think that's the first hurdle for him.\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: That's NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson. Happy New Year.\n\nLIASSON: Happy New Year to you.\n\nCopyright © 2019 NPR.

Biden Names Health Secretary, COVID Czar, Other Key Members To Health Team\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Stephen Lam/Getty Images Stephen Lam/Getty Images\n\nPresident-elect Joe Biden on Monday announced the team he would like to lead his response to the nation's greatest public health crisis in a century once he takes office in January.\n\nBiden said in a statement that he will nominate Xavier Becerra to lead the sprawling Health and Human Services Department. Becerra is California's attorney general and has led prominent legal fights against President Trump's efforts to dismantle the Affordable Care Act. Becerra would be the first Latino to lead HHS, the Biden transition team said in a statement.\n\nBiden said he would nominate Dr. Rochelle Walensky as the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Walensky is chief of infectious diseases at Massachusetts General Hospital and a Harvard Medical School professor.\n\nBiden selected Jeff Zients to be the White House coordinator of the coronavirus response, a point person for efforts by agencies and state and local governments on vaccine distribution and supply chain issues. Zients, a veteran of the Obama administration with extensive business ties, is known for having spearheaded the work to fix the healthcare.gov website used to sign up for Obamacare after its disastrous rollout in 2013.\n\nBiden also said he would nominate Dr. Vivek Murthy as surgeon general. Murthy has been a key coronavirus adviser to Biden, regularly briefing him on the pandemic during his campaign and the transition. Murthy was surgeon general during the Obama administration.\n\nMurthy faced pushback when Obama nominated him for the job after the National Rifle Association raised alarms about his support for an assault weapons ban. In his confirmation hearing, when asked about this, Murthy insisted he intended to use his platform as surgeon general not to push for gun control but to draw attention to obesity prevention.\n\nDr. Marcella Nunez-Smith, director of the Equity Research and Innovation Center at Yale School of Medicine, will lead a new task force aimed at reducing disparities in response, care and treatment for COVID-19, the Biden team said.\n\nThe appointments help round out Biden's team charged with addressing the pressing COVID-19 crisis. On Thursday, Biden announced that Dr. Anthony Fauci would continue his role as director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases while also serving as his chief medical adviser on COVID-19.
Judge Who Invalidated Obamacare Has Been A 'Go-To Judge' For Republicans, Critics Say\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg/Getty Images Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nU.S. District Judge Reed O'Connor has a history of siding with Republicans on ideologically motivated lawsuits. His ruling last week, in which he sided with the GOP on a challenge to the Affordable Care Act, was not a one-off.\n\nIn fact, critics say, his history is ultimately why that case was before him in the first place.\n\nBy all accounts, O'Connor's ruling is sweeping. It says the entire health care law became invalid when Congress zeroed out, in 2017, the tax penalty for Americans who don't have health insurance — a penalty that had been tied to what's known as the law's individual mandate that nearly everyone have insurance.\n\nI think he went too far in rejecting the entire law, says Josh Blackman, a conservative legal scholar and professor at the South Texas College of Law in Houston. I think he could have stopped short and simply severed the Obamacare mandate.\n\nWhile O'Connor's decision may seem a bit extreme to some legal scholars, it wasn't surprising.\n\nJustin Nelson, a law professor at the University of Texas, Austin, says if you know anything about O'Connor's past rulings, this was predictable.\n\nIn case after case, Nelson says, what he has shown is that he has tended to side with the Republican attorneys general who are bringing ideological suits.\n\nNelson recently ran an unsuccessful campaign to oust Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, who led this multistate legal challenge to the health care law. Nelson says Paxton and the other Republican attorneys general have filed lawsuits in the U.S District Court for the Northern District of Texas because they know there's a good chance they'll get O'Connor as the judge.\n\nJudge O'Connor has been the go-to judge for Ken Paxton and Republican attorneys general who want to file ideological suits in any court across the country, Nelson says. Reed O'Connor is their best shot to get a ruling that they like.\n\nO'Connor, who did not respond to NPR's requests for comment, was a Republican staffer on Capitol Hill before he was nominated to the federal bench by George W. Bush in 2007. So far, he has had to weigh in on at least a couple of contentious issues.\n\nFor example, O'Connor is known for striking down an Obama-era rule that protected transgender students. In that case he also sided with Paxton, who filed that legal challenge.\n\nThey've done this over and over again on the hope that Judge O'Connor would rule on behalf of an ideological agenda, Nelson says. And I don't think that is proper. I don't think that is right.\n\nPaxton has filed lawsuits in other courts, too. He filed challenges to Obama-era immigration laws in a court in South Texas, which also has a reliably conservative judge on the bench.\n\nHowever, Blackman believes criticism of this practice is overblown.\n\nAll lawyers generally file the case where it leads to the best chance of success, Blackman says. And to the extent that [there's a] criticism — that's criticism of the attorney general and not of the judge. The judge doesn't control which cases come to him.\n\nFurthermore, because O'Connor is getting a lot of ideological lawsuits brought to him, it's making his voting record more controversial, Blackman adds.\n\nI think by virtue of the attorney generals' form selection, he says, Judge O'Connor's had a greater share than average of hot-button issues.\n\nHowever, Blackman says he is concerned that criticisms of controversial opinions are increasingly shifting toward the judges who issue the opinions — instead of toward the decisions themselves.\n\nPresident Trump does this all the time, Blackman says. Politicians do it all time. And usually this happens to Supreme Court justices, but here it is being done to a district court judge in Fort Worth — who, 99 percent of his docket no one will even know about.\n\nNo matter how controversial O'Connor's ruling on the health care law, Blackman says, the decision over the Affordable Care Act will now pass to another judge, as the case moves on to a higher court.\n\nThis story is part of a reporting partnership with NPR, KUT and Kaiser Health News.
Republicans Who Have A Say In Impeachment Trial Witnesses\n\nNPR's Michel Martin speaks with Jennifer Rubin, a columnist for The Washington Post, about key Republicans that may determine if the Senate allows new witnesses during the impeachment trial.\n\nMICHEL MARTIN, HOST:\n\nNow we'd like to turn our focus to key Republicans whose votes may impact how the trial moves forward. Four senators - Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski from Alaska, Lamar Alexander of Tennessee and Utah's Mitt Romney - have either stated or hinted a dissatisfaction with the Senate leadership's approach to the trial. But given the hyper-partisan, hyper-personal climate in which the trial is taking place, this has gotten us wondering if certain Republicans really might be movable on this issue and if so why.\n\nWe've called on Jennifer Rubin for this. She is a conservative opinion columnist for The Washington Post, and she's had her own moments of difference with the Republican Party and conservative movement in the current era. She's with us now by phone.\n\nJennifer Rubin, thanks so much for joining us once again.\n\nJENNIFER RUBIN: My pleasure.\n\nMARTIN: A few weeks ago, you wrote an open letter to Alaska Senator Lisa Murkowski, published in The Washington Post, in which you urged her to vote for new witnesses. Why her? And what was your argument to her?\n\nRUBIN: Well, I could have actually addressed it to really any of the individuals you listed because you're right. There are a few on the fence. But I think because she had indicated publicly that she was amendable to this and because she has an independent streak. She hasn't toed the party line on, for example, Justice Kavanaugh's confirmation or on the repeal of Obamacare.\n\nBut essentially, the argument is that ultimately, if you want to vote to acquit the president, and you want to get the benefit, if you will, of an exoneration, you have to present at least the appearance of fairness, at least the appearance of a real trial.\n\nAnd what we've seen over and over again in polls recently - in the Washington Post poll, 66% of the people want to have a real trial. Other polls show even higher numbers - that in order to accomplish that, even if you want to acquit the president, it really behooves you to go through the steps, have witnesses come up. Then you can vote however you please at the end of the process. But to cut it off now really doesn't even serve her own interests.\n\nMARTIN: Republicans have proposed a witness trade. Democrats get witnesses they want, such as former national security adviser John Bolton, in exchange for witnesses that some of the Republicans say they want, such as the former vice president, Joe Biden, and his son, Hunter. Now, I have to say that the Democrats have rejected this, and Joe Biden has said absolutely not. But what do you think of that proposal?\n\nRUBIN: I think it's a bluff because the Republicans in the worst way do not want to hear from John Bolton. They don't want to hear from Mick Mulvaney. They don't want to hear from these people, nor do they want to have documents put forward. So I think jokingly some of the Democrats were saying, why don't we just call their bluff?\n\nBut I don't think they want to get into that sort of game. I think they want to make a clean argument that there are certain witnesses who have relevant evidence - they should come forward - and certain ones who do not. And if they're all that interested, and they think either Joe Biden or Hunter Biden has done something wrong, the Senate can have hearings till the cows come home to investigate those allegations if they have allegations.\n\nSo I think they're trying to take a somewhat principled line, which is they're not going on a fishing expedition. The Republicans shouldn't go on a fishing expedition. But if you're going to say the president's been exonerated, you have to have the best witnesses available. And there are some witnesses who could shed some light on this.\n\nMARTIN: And before we let you go, as I mentioned, that you have been a conservative columnist for a number of years now, but you've had many disagreements with this president, and you've also been critical of those who have followed him without expressing differences of opinion when you think that they were warranted and when people sort of have indicated that they actually have those differences of opinion. I just want to ask, what is that like? I mean, what is it like to feel you have to set yourself apart at a time like this?\n\nYou know, people have made kind of arguments based on what they say their responsibility is to their constituents and their oath and the Constitution. But all these people are human. And, you know, it's uncomfortable. And I just wanted to ask what your experience has been when you've taken positions that have been at odds with people who had been your allies on so many issues.\n\nRUBIN: Well, one thing that Adam Schiff said on Friday night really hit home in a very personal way, which is it's hard to break with people who have been your friends, have been your allies, have been your peers. But at some point, you have to be able to live with yourself. You have to be able to say, what am I doing, and why am I doing it? My purpose as a journalist is to inform and to, I think, persuade that certain values are important. So what's the point of doing it if you're simply going to be, in essence, a hack for the Republican Party?\n\nSo although it has been certainly a transformation, I have to say it has made me appreciate more than ever that principle and partisanship often divide, and that we all have to make a choice. In my case, perhaps I've had a luxury. I work for a wonderful journalistic outlet, The Washington Post, so it hasn't cost me my job. It hasn't cost me my livelihood. But it certainly has severed relationships and brought on quite a fit of hate mail.\n\nBut I think that's sort of the price of doing what's right, and there is a satisfaction. There is a joy. There is a sense of even reward in making the right enemies and doing what you think is right. So it's been a stressful time for many of us, but in many ways, the most rewarding part of my career.\n\nMARTIN: That was Jennifer Rubin, opinion columnist for The Washington Post. She covers politics and policy. Jennifer Rubin, thanks so much for talking to us today.\n\nRUBIN: My pleasure.\n\nCopyright © 2020 NPR. All rights reserved.

Decorum Goes Out The Window In 1st Trump-Biden Presidential Debate\n\nRACHEL MARTIN, HOST:\n\nThe first presidential debate between President Trump and Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden was unlike any other. The orderly 90-minute debate format broke down into chaos quickly. Despite moderator Chris Wallace's warnings, debate decorum was thrown out the door. Instead, there were interruptions, cross-talking, name-calling, shouting. Here's a sample.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF MONTAGE)\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I'll tell you, Joe, you could never have done the job that we did. You don't have it in your blood. You could have never done that.\n\nJOE BIDEN: The fact is that everything he's saying so far is simply a lie. I'm not here to call out his lies. Everybody knows he's a liar...\n\nA single thing...\n\nTRUMP: As you might know but probably don't, Obamacare is no good, Joe.\n\nCHRIS WALLACE: Gentlemen, you realize if you're both speaking at the same time...\n\nTRUMP: And China ate your lunch, Joe. And no wonder...\n\nWALLACE: You get the final word, Mr...\n\nBIDEN: Well, it's hard to get any word in with this clown.\n\nMARTIN: So with all that, it meant that voters who were hoping to get a clearer understanding of the candidates' policy positions, they were pretty much out of luck. I talked to Democratic strategist Karen Finney and Republican strategist Scott Jennings yesterday about their expectations for the debate, and they are back with us this morning.\n\nHey, guys. Thanks for being here.\n\nSCOTT JENNINGS: Good morning.\n\nKAREN FINNEY: Good morning.\n\nMARTIN: You survive last night? And I use that language particularly because it was just - it was - felt like a real battle. It was at times oppressive to watch. So I will let you two, though, describe it in your own words. Karen, you go first.\n\nFINNEY: It was distressing to watch and chaotic to watch. I mean, look; you know, if you were watching to try to understand something regarding policy, you didn't get that answer. But you got - what you saw was a president who - he just felt - it felt out of control. And the back-and-forth particularly with the moderator, it felt very childish, particularly when you had, you know, Chris Wallace saying, you know, Mr. President, Mr. President, you're going to really like this next question as a way to kind of calm him down. That just was - the lack of decorum and respect and dignity really was beneath the office of the presidency.\n\nMARTIN: Scott, did you think President Trump came off looking strong after that or not?\n\nJENNINGS: No, I didn't. And, you know, we talked yesterday and predicted that he would be aggressive with Biden in an attempt to get him to crack under the pressure and maybe make some misstatements. The trouble is he went from being on offense to being offensive, and he never let the strategy breathe. He never gave Joe Biden that chance to be rattled because Donald Trump never stopped talking for the entirety of the debate. So, no, I didn't think he looked particularly strong.\n\nAnd I look at this through the lens of audiences. You know, who does Donald Trump have to recapture from the 2016 coalition to win in 2020? And I think about women, who are crushing him in the polling right now. And I think about senior citizens who don't seem to be as hot on him this time around. And I'm not sure either of those audiences picked up in a positive way on anything the president did last night.\n\nMARTIN: I want to play a moment - there were lots of them last night. But I want to focus in on this exchange. Moderator Chris Wallace asked President Trump if he would condemn white supremacist groups. Let's listen to this.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nTRUMP: Who would you like me to condemn?\n\nBIDEN: Proud Boys.\n\nWALLACE: White supremacists and right-wing militia.\n\nTRUMP: The Proud Boys, stand back and stand by. But I'll tell you what, I'll tell you what, somebody has got to do something about antifa and the left because this is not a right-wing problem.\n\nMARTIN: So, Scott, he said stand back, stand by. That's not a condemnation. In fact, the far-right group then pledged allegiance to the president after those comments. Why is he incapable of condemning racist groups?\n\nJENNINGS: Yeah, really, really bad moment. There's only one answer to that question, and that is I condemn them. I condemn anyone in our cities who's causing violence, and nobody comes in my name and causes violence and should expect me to support that. There's only one answer. You're the commander in chief. And if you want to look strong on public safety and law and order, as he calls it, you have to condemn all of these groups no matter what form they come in. He failed it. He missed that question last night, and it's going to be the most talked about issue coming out of the debate because he whiffed it.\n\nFINNEY: But it also...\n\nMARTIN: What do you make - oh, go ahead, Karen.\n\nFINNEY: Well, if I may, I mean, as a Black woman, I mean, I was sickened and terrified, just terrified. It literally made me think his - particularly given the tone of the way he was saying it made me think of those old stories from the '60s about dealing with the Bull Connors of the world. I mean, the - he was so incapable of just saying the word, and there's no reason not to be able to say, I denounce white supremacy or white supremacist violence, for heaven's sake. And it was - you know, it was such a sickening feeling and such a alienating feeling as if I am on my own in this country if my own president doesn't understand why it's important to say that. And the fact that he then went on in part of that exchange to talk about - to say that teaching, you know, racial tolerance or sensitivity is teaching people to hate the country - that means - you know, that we're teaching people the history of, you know, the people in my family who built this country as slaves, teaching the truth about that, that somehow that's inappropriate and then that's something disgusting and despicable is the way he described it. It was beyond the pale and beneath the dignity of the presidency.\n\nMARTIN: May I ask you, Scott, what do you make of the president's continued attempts to undermine the integrity of the election? He did it again last night, refusing to say that he would accept the outcome of the election. He urged his supporters to go to the polls to, quote, watch very carefully what happens. I mean, does that endear him to independents or people he needs to win?\n\nJENNINGS: Well, he continues to conflate various issues. I mean, look; there have been some reported issues with the mail ballots in some places. Pennsylvania is a good example where some folks are actually having trouble figuring out how to turn them in. And so these are real issues, and so that's one set of things.\n\nMARTIN: It's nothing out of the ordinary. This isn't a widespread problem.\n\nJENNINGS: Well, it is for Pennsylvania, which has no demonstrable history of voting by mail. And my fear for a state like that is several people who think they voted are not going to have their votes counted. And I don't think that's right for people who think they voted to not be counted. But the point is he's conflating those kinds of issues with voter fraud. And when you conflate all of it, I think it confuses the situation, and it does reduce confidence in the overall election. And he's been doing this for several weeks. And no, I don't - look; I think his attacks on the system may be causing some of his own supporters to question their own ballots and to question their own methods for voting. And I'm not sure that's going to help him get the votes he needs.\n\nMARTIN: Are either of you optimistic about the remaining debates in terms of helping voters make a choice? Scott, I'll let you go first. Karen, I'll let you finish.\n\nJENNINGS: Look; I think the town hall format is drastically different than a moderated format, so that could change the tone of this. But unless he lays out a second-term agenda, I mean, the president in either of these next two debates, I don't suspect they'll change the trajectory of the race (ph).\n\nMARTIN: Karen, real quick.\n\nFINNEY: I don't think we're going to see much different in these dynamics. I think you're going to keep seeing that behavior that's unpresidential.\n\nMARTIN: Republican strategist Scott Jennings and Democratic strategist Karen Finney. Thanks to you both.\n\nFINNEY: Thanks.\n\nJENNINGS: Thank you.\n\nCopyright © 2020 NPR. All rights reserved.

Biden Revokes Trump Abortion Policy, Takes Steps To Shore Up Affordable Care Act\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Eric Gay/AP Eric Gay/AP\n\nUpdated at 2:10 p.m. ET\n\nPresident Biden signed two executive actions Thursday that are designed to expand access to reproductive health care and health insurance through the Affordable Care Act and Medicaid.\n\nThere's nothing new that we're doing here other than restoring the Affordable Care Act and restoring Medicaid to the way it was before [Donald] Trump became president. Because by fiat, he changed — made [it] more inaccessible, more expensive and more difficult for people to qualify for either of those two plans, Biden said in a brief Oval Office signing ceremony.\n\nI'm not initiating any new law, any new aspect of the law, Biden stated. This is going back to what the situation was prior to Trump's executive order.\n\nAn executive order Biden signed instructs the Department of Health and Human Services to open a special enrollment period for the Affordable Care Act through HealthCare.gov, the federally run health insurance marketplace. The enrollment period will run from Feb. 15 to May 15, giving Americans who have lost their employer-based health insurance because of the coronavirus pandemic an opportunity to sign up for coverage.\n\nAs we continue to battle COVID-19, it is even more critical that Americans have meaningful access to affordable care, a White House fact sheet reads.\n\nThe measure also orders federal agencies to reexamine current policies that may undermine the Affordable Care Act and the health insurance exchanges created under the law. Biden is also requesting a review of policies that could make it more difficult for Americans to enroll in Medicaid.\n\nHis second executive action aims to protect and expand access to comprehensive reproductive health care by rescinding the Mexico City policy, also known as the global gag rule. This policy, reinstated and expanded by the Trump administration, bars international nongovernmental organizations that provide abortion counseling or referrals from receiving U.S. funding.\n\nBiden on Thursday called the gag rule an attack on women's health access.\n\nAffordable Care Act\n\nBiden's executive actions will undo some of the Trump administration's efforts to undermine the ACA.\n\nLast November, the Trump administration and several Republican-led states argued at the U.S. Supreme Court that the program should be voided, which would have eliminated popular elements of the law such as protections for those with preexisting conditions.\n\nThe Supreme Court will hear a case that could decide the legality of work requirements for Medicaid recipients. The Trump administration granted waivers to several states to allow work requirements for Medicaid, though some of those waivers have not been implemented and others have been blocked by courts.\n\nBiden is reversing course and directing federal agencies to reconsider those work requirement rules. He is also asking agencies to review policies that undermined protections for people with preexisting conditions, including complications related to COVID-19.\n\nThe Trump White House also refused to advertise the ACA as an option for the millions of Americans who have lost their jobs and health insurance during the pandemic. The administration faced pressure to open HealthCare.gov for anyone to enroll in the Affordable Care Act in response to the pandemic, but it never did.\n\nGlobal gag rule\n\nFor decades, Democratic and Republican presidents have alternately rescinded or reinstated the global gag rule, with Democrats, such as Biden, opposing the policy. Republicans have argued that the rule would reduce the number of abortions.\n\nHowever, a study released in 2019 suggested the policy failed to reduce the rate of abortions and ultimately had the opposite effect. The study said the rate of abortions increased by about 40% in the countries studied — most likely because the funding ban caused a reduction in access to contraception and a consequent rise in unwanted pregnancies.\n\nUnder the actions announced on Thursday, the president is telling federal agencies to review a Trump-era rule that limited the use of Title X federal funds meant for family planning and reproductive health services for low-income patients. Under this program, organizations that provided abortions or abortion counseling could not have access to those federal funds.\n\nThe White House said, Across the country and around the world, people — particularly women, Black, Indigenous and other people of color, LGBTQ+ people, and those with low incomes — have been denied access to reproductive health care.\n\nAlana Wise contributed to this report.
President-Elect Biden Has A Plan To Combat COVID-19. Here's What's In It\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Drew Angerer/Getty Images Drew Angerer/Getty Images\n\nUpdated at 6:49 a.m. ET\n\nAs coronavirus cases surge around the country, President-elect Joe Biden says voters have given him a mandate to take action.\n\nDaily cases are skyrocketing, Biden said in remarks Friday evening in Wilmington, Del., as the nation waited for the election to be called. I want everyone — everyone — to know on Day 1, we're going to put our plan to control this virus into action.\n\nEarly Monday, Biden announced a 13-member Transition COVID-19 Advisory Board, to be led by former Food and Drug Administration commissioner Dr. David Kessler, former Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy and Dr. Marcella Nunez-Smith of the Yale University School of Medicine.\n\nMany of the voters who helped propel Biden toward the presidency ranked the pandemic as the most important issue facing the United States, according to AP VoteCast data.\n\nSo how will Biden deliver on their hopes?\n\nSpecifically, Biden's plan calls for empowering scientists at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to help set national, evidence-based guidance to stop outbreaks as well as making significant investments in vaccine distribution, testing and the creation of a public health workforce to carry out contact tracing and other services.\n\nWe have to function as one nation. That means having a national plan, Murthy, a key adviser to the Biden campaign, told NPR recently.\n\nMurthy said Biden will focus on helping Americans get what they need to keep themselves and their families safe. What you're going to see is a laser focus on ensuring that people get ... adequate testing and clear information, he said.\n\nMurthy said a Biden administration will have a unified message and strategy on how to proceed. Rebuilding public trust is about communication. It's about following the science, he added.\n\nEzekiel Emanuel, a physician and University of Pennsylvania professor who has briefed Biden on health policy, told NPR he got to see how Biden works during the Obama administration's economic recovery efforts in 2009, which Biden managed as vice president. You're going to have rigorous evaluation and constant refinement of policies and strategies, he said.\n\nWhile working on the Recovery Act, Emanuel said, Biden was constantly asking, 'Are we doing the right thing?'  and looking to adjust midcourse, if necessary. He's a very practical guy, Emanuel said.\n\nHere's a summary of Biden's proposals:\n\nThis report is drawn from a more extended analysis of the Biden pandemic plan published on Oct. 28.\n\n1. Set shared guidance for slowing community spread\n\nUnder Biden's plan, the CDC will be directed to provide specific guidance — based on the degree of viral spread in a community — for how to open schools, open businesses, Emanuel says, or when to impose restrictions on gathering sizes or when stay-at-home orders may be called for.\n\nIt would create a national pandemic dashboard to share this information with the public. This is a strategy recommended by a top group of public health experts, who released a framework for assessing community risk.\n\nAnd Biden says he'd work with every governor to make mask-wearing in public mandatory in their state. Many states already have mask mandates, but though research suggests that universal masking could save more than 100,000 lives, there's currently no nationwide coordination or requirement.\n\n2. Seriously ramp up testing\n\nThe Biden campaign has said the goal is to ensure that all Americans have access to regular, reliable and free testing. His administration will work to double the number of drive-through testing sites and invest in next-generation testing, including home tests and instant tests.\n\nIt's not enough to know in seven days or five days or three days whether or not you have COVID, Biden recently said on CBS' 60 Minutes. If there's a long lag time, a person may spread the disease unwittingly while waiting for results.\n\nThere are currently several home test kits that give quick results without being sent to a laboratory in development, but none are yet approved by the Food and Drug Administration. While there has been a significant expansion in testing, testing is still not available and affordable to all people across the country, Murthy told NPR.\n\n3. Hire thousands of public health workers\n\nThe Biden team pledges to mobilize 100,000 Americans to work with local organizations around the country to perform contact tracing and other health services for populations at high risk for COVID-19.\n\nThe idea is to empower local communities and health departments to assist people with challenges such as food insecurity and affordable housing.\n\nImagine a public health workforce that was also helping train school officials in how to reopen safely, Murthy told NPR. Or helping run public education campaigns about a vaccine and how to stay safe in the pandemic. Think about a workforce that was diverse, that looked like the country that we're trying to serve, Murthy said.\n\n4. Help people get health insurance\n\nMillions of American have lost health insurance during the pandemic. Biden's coronavirus plan proposes to have the federal government cover 100% of the costs of COBRA coverage for the duration of the crisis. So when people lose their employer-based health insurance, they can stay on that insurance, given the moment we are in, Stef Feldman, Biden's national policy director, told NPR.\n\nIn addition, Biden will push to strengthen the Affordable Care Act, expanding coverage by making more people eligible for premium subsidies. Biden hopes also to push for expansion of Medicaid in states that have yet to do so, and he has proposed making Medicare coverage available to Americans beginning at age 60 (instead of 65).\n\nDuring the pandemic, several governors asked the Trump administration to reopen the federal Obamacare marketplace for a special enrollment period. Feldman has told NPR that Biden would do so immediately after his inauguration to allow those who've lost insurance to sign up for new plans. She called it a basic step that President Trump has refused to do.\n\n5. Create a caregiving workforce\n\nDuring the pandemic, Biden says many families are struggling to find affordable care for their children, aging relatives or loved ones with disabilities. At the same time, professional caregivers have either lost their jobs or continue to work while putting their lives at risk without sufficient pay, his campaign plan noted.\n\nBiden plans to work with states to speed up waiting lists for Medicaid-paid care in homes. In addition, the president-elect supports a variety of steps to expand caregiving, including ensuring access to preschool for 3- and 4-year-olds and supporting caregivers through job training and improved benefits and protections.\n\nExpanding opportunities in the female-dominated caregiving workforce would play a dual role in both helping families, and helping improve women's employment outlook, said Sherry Glied, dean of New York University's Robert F. Wagner Graduate School of Public Service, noting that this pandemic-fueled economic crisis has hit women harder.\n\n6. Boost vaccine distribution and personal protective equipment production\n\nStates will need a lot of money to distribute a vaccine and make sure it gets to everyone who wants it. There are complex logistics that will require planning and resources. Currently state governors are asking for more guidance and financial assistance.\n\nThe Biden team proposes investing $25 billion in a vaccine manufacturing and distribution plan that will guarantee it gets to every American, cost-free.\n\nThe president-elect also wants to solve the shortages of personal protective equipment that have plagued the U.S. health care system since the pandemic began. The Biden team says after the inauguration, it will work to make sure more of these critical supplies are produced and distributed rather than leave states, cities, tribes, and territories to fend for themselves.\n\nBiden says he'd use the Defense Production Act to increase production of masks, face shields and other personal protective equipment so that supply exceeds demand.
Republican Gun Store Owner And Legislator Campaigns For Medicaid Expansion In Idaho\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Phil Galewitz/Kaiser Health News Phil Galewitz/Kaiser Health News\n\nState Rep. Christy Perry pledged her full support for President Trump while standing next to her SUV, which has NRA on the license plate and is parked outside a Boise, Idaho, gun shop she co-owns.\n\nHe's doing a good job, said Perry, a four-term Republican member of the Idaho Legislature who has voted for a litany of conservative causes, including weakening labor unions, restricting abortion and boosting charter schools.\n\nWith those credentials, Perry hopes for another big win on Election Day — one that puts her at odds with Trump and GOP orthodoxy.\n\nShe's helping lead the drive to persuade state voters to expand Medicaid — a central tenet of the Affordable Care Act, the 2010 law embraced by Democrats and derided by many Republicans.\n\nPerry has been pushing for Medicaid expansion the past several years in the state legislature, but the efforts were thwarted by top leaders in the state House. Now there's a ballot initiative called Proposition 2 that puts the matter before Idaho voters.\n\nPerry said Medicaid coverage is desperately needed by people struggling in low-wage jobs, and the economics make sense for the state given the federal government will pay 90 percent of the cost. An expansion would reduce or eliminate the need for other Idaho-funded programs to help the uninsured, she said, and the added coverage would help more people get back to work. Employers need every able body, she said.\n\nShe said the state can't wait any longer.\n\nThe longer you wait, the more people die (from lacking health insurance), she said. Idaho is a conservative, Christian and right-to-life state, and Medicaid expansion fits right in with our morals and values we have. It's about doing the right thing.\n\nIf successful on Nov. 6, about 62,000 Idaho adults would be added to the state-federal health insurance program that covers 73 million low-income Americans. It would be a major advance for Obamacare into one of the most conservative parts of the country.\n\nIdaho is one of 17 states where GOP lawmakers are in control of legislatures that have steadfastly resisted expanding Medicaid.\n\nBut voters in Idaho, Nebraska and Utah will decide next month whether to buck their political leaders and go forward with the expansion. The issue is also on the ballot in Montana, which expanded Medicaid in 2016. There, residents will decide whether to continue it past 2019.\n\nOf those states, Idaho is arguably the least politically hospitable for Medicaid expansion. Trump carried Idaho by the largest margin — nearly 32 percentage points in 2016.\n\nLast year, Maine became the first state to approve expanding Medicaid via a ballot referendum, although the GOP governor has stalled implementation.\n\nUnlike Maine, where political power has been split between Democrats and Republicans in recent years, Idaho, Utah and Nebraska are solidly GOP territory.\n\nTrump and Republican congressional leaders have vowed to repeal the health law, which makes the expansion possible by providing the bulk of the funding for those who qualify for new coverage.\n\nPerry, 50, doesn't see a problem getting Trump voters to back the expansion. She said that the Republican failure to repeal the law last year opened the door for conservative states to go forward.\n\nI think people here listen to that and it now falls to states to go ahead with expansion, she said.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Phil Galewitz/Kaiser Health News Phil Galewitz/Kaiser Health News\n\nSupporters of the referendum were successful in garnering 70,000 signatures to put the vote on the ballot, but they face a steep challenge educating the electorate about the complexities of Medicaid financing.\n\nTim Dunnagan, dean of the College of Health Sciences at Boise State University, said few Idaho voters know that most states — including neighboring Oregon and Washington — have already expanded Medicaid. Because the issue can be confusing, he said, voters may gravitate to their long-held concerns about paying more taxes and government overreach.\n\nThere is a strong sentiment that if the federal government is involved, it is not a good thing, he said. There's a fierce individualism out in the West.\n\nPerry and the broad coalition endorsing the referendum — including teachers, employers, county sheriffs and the health industry — seek to remind voters that they are already paying for the health law's provisions through their federal taxes and the expansion would bring $400 million in federal funds into the state.\n\nThe expansion would cover residents with incomes below 138 percent of the federal poverty level, or nearly $17,000 a year for an individual. Currently, Idaho adults who do not have children and are not disabled are not eligible for Medicaid. Those with children can only qualify with incomes up to 26 percent of the poverty level, or $3,156 a year.\n\nThe expansion also would eliminate a gap for residents whose income is too low to qualify for government subsidies to buy private coverage but earn too much to qualify for Medicaid.\n\nOn a recent evening, about 20 volunteers in favor expansion gathered about 10 miles east of downtown Boise, where a field organizer gave them voter lists and instructions on how to approach homeowners.\n\nTracy Olson, 54, a nurse turned real estate agent, and Jill Galanter, 55, a physical therapist, went to an upper-income, planned community. About two-thirds of the people they met said they support expansion and most of the rest had not heard about it. Only a couple of people said they oppose the ballot question.\n\nIn their one-minute pitch, Olson and Galanter explained the coverage gap for low-income residents and the millions in federal dollars the state can gain by expanding. They didn't mention the ACA. That's not an oversight, organizers said.\n\nObamacare has a negative connotation here, Perry said.\n\nMike Brown, 50, an engineer, told Olson he didn't know the issue but added that his health costs have soared in recent years. He nodded as Olson explained whom the expansion would help.\n\nI can sympathize, he said. They recorded him as a leaning yes.\n\nRichard Rapp, 75, a retired head of the career center at Boise State University, said he will support the expansion out of humanitarian reasons. Too many people don't have adequate coverage, and that ends up costing us all, he said.\n\nLater that week, another volunteer, Lauren Necochea, also found support in the Nampa area, west of Boise.\n\nNorm Holm, 67, listened to her pitch. It makes sense to me, said Holm, a registered Republican. Everyone deserves a decent shot at health care.\n\nAsked if he knew that the Medicaid expansion is part of the ACA, Holm shook his head. If they can't do away with it, maybe this is a way to make it better, he said, adding that he believes the health law has good and bad parts.\n\nIn contrast, opponents of the referendum stress how Medicaid expansion is part of what they call the failed Obamacare.\n\nThe Idaho Republican Party and the conservative Idaho Freedom Foundation are fighting the ballot initiative. Foundation officials say it would divert money that could be spent on roads and education.\n\nMedicaid expansion is a cornerstone of Obamacare, which has failed to cover everyone and has led to increasing health costs, said Fred Birnbaum, vice president of the foundation.\n\nHis group plans to run radio commercials, use social media and circulate flyers.\n\nLawmakers opposed to expanding Medicaid have argued the state could not afford its share of the cost without raising taxes. Under the law, the federal government pays about 90 percent of the costs for expansion and states cover the rest.\n\nBut a state-funded report this year found it would cost Idaho relatively little — $105 million over 10 years, which includes savings from state and county funds that would no longer be needed to help the uninsured. Idaho's annual budget tops $3 billion per year.\n\nBrad Little, the GOP nominee for governor who is widely expected to win in November, said he would abide by the will of the voters.\n\nPerry is not the only Republican state lawmaker who has come out in support of expansion, but she is one of the most prominent. Perry tried — and failed — to get lawmakers to expand Medicaid. She is not running for re-election.\n\nChristy [Perry] is well-known among GOP women and well-liked, said Toni Lawson, vice president of government relations at the Idaho Hospital Association, which supports the initiative. She said persuading GOP women to vote for expansion will be key to a victory.\n\nKaiser Health News is a nonprofit news service covering health issues.

Progressive Activists Focus On Denying Former VP Biden Presidential Nomination\n\nProgressive activists see 2020 as a chance to take control of the Democratic Party. Their energy has become focused on denying former Vice President Joe Biden the presidential nomination.\n\nMARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST:\n\nProgressive activists say this is finally their time. Many in the Democratic Party have embraced their agenda. Several presidential candidates are promoting parts of it, like college debt forgiveness and Medicare for All. Progressives, though, are focused on another candidate - Vice President Joe Biden. They do not think his more centrist stance is the way for Democrats to defeat President Trump. NPR political correspondent Asma Khalid reports.\n\nASMA KHALID, BYLINE: Justin Krebs says he is not interested in hearing about electability.\n\nJUSTIN KREBS: Because exactly four years ago right now, there was a messy, crowded primary with too many candidates, people who were totally unelectable - and Donald Trump was one of them and ended up winning.\n\nKHALID: Krebs works with the advocacy group MoveOn. I met him at the annual Netroots Nation convention in Philadelphia this past weekend. It was a huge gathering of some 4,000 progressive activists. The folks at Netroots pointed out that many Democrats thought Barack Obama was unelectable until he started winning. They say this word electability is used to scare voters into choosing a safe candidate. And nowadays, it's being used to promote former Vice President Joe Biden. Allegra Dengler, an activist from New York, actually shuddered when I asked her about Biden.\n\nALLEGRA DENGLER: Why is he so popular? I have no idea. He's like a corporate Democrat from Delaware, which is, like, the corporate headquarters of everything.\n\nKHALID: A lot of activists say Biden is the worst option. They warn that if he's the nominee, the Democrats could see a repeat of the 2016 election. Maria Urbina with the group Indivisible did not single Biden out by name. But she said whoever the nominee is, he or she has to energize young black and Latino voters.\n\nMARIA URBINA: We need to be able to build a base of voters - a coalition of voters that are excited, that are going to turnout in historic levels. And we can't rely on it just being based on Trump being on the ballot. That won't be enough.\n\nKHALID: Progressives insist 2020 is going to be all about the base, which means there is no point in trying to win over moderate voters. Democrats need an inspiring candidate.\n\nYVETTE SIMPSON: (Laughter) Do you feel inspired by moderation?\n\nKHALID: That's Yvette Simpson with Democracy for America. I met her after she wrapped up a panel about how Biden is the least electable Democrat in 2020. She says people, right now, are not motivated by incremental change. They want progressive ideas.\n\nSIMPSON: I do believe that there are people who can afford for the world not to change. And I think if you can afford for the world to change, you take the slow approach. And so if you're a privileged few that can wait for Medicare for All, then maybe you can be a moderate, but we don't have time for that.\n\nKHALID: Earlier today, Biden unveiled his health care plan. In a video, he explained he would build on the Affordable Care Act by expanding Medicaid and a public insurance option.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF POLITICAL AD, WE HAVE TO PROTECT AND BUILD ON OBAMACARE)\n\nJOE BIDEN: I understand the appeal of Medicare for All. But folks supporting it should be clear that it means getting rid of Obamacare, and I'm not for that.\n\nKHALID: But the goal, progressives say, is not just maintaining the ACA. It's about establishing universal health care. Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders has proposed a Medicare for All plan that's been leading the Democratic debate this year. It's now endorsed by a number of other Democratic presidential candidates. Lanae Erickson, with the centrist think tank Third Way, thinks that's a mistake. She says the biggest concern for voters is the cost of health care. Overhauling the system isn't the answer.\n\nLANAE ERICKSON: It gives a huge window for Donald Trump and Republicans to label Democrats as socialists and have that label stick.\n\nKHALID: Erickson also doesn't think the party needs a candidate who promotes policies like Medicare for All in order to win.\n\nERICKSON: There's no question you need to both energize your base and persuade people if you're going to win an election. But Donald Trump is the best energy the left base will ever need.\n\nKHALID: That's the approach Democratic leaders took in 2018, and it worked in competitive House districts. But the thing is, a Democratic primary is different. And Bernie Sanders is not going to let his opponents forget that. On Wednesday, he's planning a major address in D.C. to, quote, confront the opponents of Medicare for All.\n\nAsma Khalid, NPR News.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)\n\nCopyright © 2019 NPR.

CHART: Who Wins, Who Loses With Senate Health Care Bill\n\ntoggle caption J. Scott Applewhite/AP\n\nSenate Republicans on Thursday unveiled their plan to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act — also known as Obamacare. The long-awaited plan marks a big step toward achieving one of the Republican Party's major goals.\n\nLoading...\n\nThe Senate proposal is broadly similar to the bill passed by House Republicans last month, with a few notable differences. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who has been criticized for drafting the bill in secret with just a dozen Republican Senate colleagues, says the proposal — which he calls a discussion draft — will stabilize insurance markets, strengthen Medicaid and cut costs to consumers.\n\nWe agreed on the need to free Americans from Obamacare's mandates. And policies contained in the discussion draft will repeal the individual mandates so Americans are no longer forced to buy insurance they don't need or can't afford, McConnell said.\n\nInstead, the bill entices people to voluntarily buy a policy by offering them tax credits based on age and income to help pay premiums.\n\nThis bill is better designed than the House version, according to Avik Roy, founder of the Foundation for Research on Equal Opportunity, because it offers more help to older people who can't afford insurance while making coverage cheaper for young healthy people.\n\nThe bill will encourage a lot more of those individuals to buy health insurance, Roy says. That, in turn, will make the risk pool much healthier, which will also lower premiums. And the tax credits in the bill will also be better-designed.\n\nBut Caroline Pearson, a senior vice president at the consulting firm Avalere Health, says the bill bases its tax credits on lower-quality insurance.If you're paying a similar percentage of income, you're getting a less generous product under this new plan, she says.\n\nThe plan keeps some popular parts of Obamacare. It allows parents keep their children on their policies until age 26 and requires insurers to cover people with pre-existing conditions.\n\nBut it then allows states to opt out of that requirement.\n\nThe protections around pre-existing conditions are still in place in the Senate bill, but the waiver authority gives states options that could include limiting coverage for people with pre-existing conditions, says Pearson.\n\nThose waivers would allow state to drop benefits required by Obamacare, such as maternity coverage, mental health care and prescription drug coverage.\n\nBoth bills would eliminate most of the taxes imposed by the Affordable Care Act.\n\nAnd they would bar people from using tax credits to buy policies that pay for abortion and also block Planned Parenthood from getting any money from Medicaid for a year.\n\nPerhaps the most sweeping move, however, is that the Senate plan follows the House lead in completely changing how the government pays for health care for the poor and the disabled — and goes even further.\n\nToday, Medicaid pays for all the care people need, and state and federal governments share the cost.\n\nBut Medicaid has been eating up an ever-larger share of federal spending. The Senate Republicans' plan puts a lid on that by rolling back the Obama-era expansion of the program and then granting states a set amount of money for each person enrolled. Republicans also want to change the way the federal government calculates payments to the states starting in 2025, reducing the federal government's contribution to the states.\n\nThe Medicaid cuts are even more draconian that the House bill was, though they take effect more gradually than the House bill did, Pearson says. So we're going to see very significant reductions in coverage in Medicaid and big cuts in federal funding that will result in significant budget gaps for states.\n\nSeveral Republican senators have already said they oppose the bill, at least as of now. Senate leaders are aiming for a vote before July 4.
'Piety & Power' Considers The Life And Ambition Of Vice President Mike Pence\n\nPolitical reporter Tom LoBianco has covered Pence in both Indiana and Washington, D.C. He describes the vice president as a man of faith who is willing to put political ambition ahead of his beliefs.\n\nTERRY GROSS, HOST:\n\nThis is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. The House of Representatives impeachment inquiry into President Trump will have far-reaching impacts, and one of them may be to increase public interest in the man who would occupy the White House if the president were to depart, Vice President Mike Pence. Pence has been a loyal but largely invisible figure in the Trump administration.\n\nOur guest, veteran political reporter Tom Lo Bianco, has covered Pence in Indiana and Washington for two decades for the Associated Press, CNN and the Indianapolis Star. He has a new book about Pence's political career. He says while Pence holds conservative views and deeply religious convictions, he's shown a willingness to set them aside as circumstances require to pursue his political ambitions.\n\nLoBianco describes Pence as the ultimate political shapeshifter. FRESH AIR's Dave Davies spoke to LoBianco yesterday about his book Piety & Power: Mike Pence And The Taking Of The White House.\n\nDAVE DAVIES, BYLINE: Tom LoBianco, welcome to FRESH AIR. You know, we're speaking as, arguably, the most serious threat to Donald Trump's presidency has emerged in the form of a formal impeachment inquiry over his dealings with the government of Ukraine. What are you hearing about how the vice president and his team are reacting to this?\n\nTOM LOBIANCO: I think to understand where Pence's team is right now, it helps to understand what happened with the Russia investigation. They really dodged a bullet that first go around. If you'll remember, Pence was almost like a ghost through that investigation. You didn't really hear a lot about him. He didn't come up, but here he has had a meeting with the Ukrainian president, Zelenskiy, and made this argument that is at the centerpiece of this - the impeachment push right now, this anti-corruption argument that Trump and the - his people are making.\n\nPence has already answered some questions about this, but I suspect we'll have more questions because we need to know what happened in that meeting he had with Zelenskiy. He's already said - earlier this month, he said, did he bring up Joe Biden in that meeting with Zelenskiy? And he said, no, that did not come up. Two, what did they discuss? Well, they discussed anti-corruption measures.\n\nLook. What he's doing right now is what he's always done within the administration. He's carrying the water on the messaging. But in a serious way, he is more overexposed than he has ever been inside this White House.\n\nDAVIES: Right. You know, it's interesting that in your biography, you point out that during the 2016 campaign, when the Access Hollywood tapes emerged that showed Donald Trump, you know, bragging about grabbing women by their privates, there was talk then of forcing Trump from the ticket and replacing him with Mike Pence. How did Pence respond then to that chatter?\n\nLOBIANCO: So my reporting - and I'd heard about this before, and we've seen this reported out there before that there was an effort to remove Trump from the ticket. Now, based on my reporting, what happens is Marty Obst, who's the chief political aide to Mike Pence - he fields phone calls.\n\nSo this is - what? - Friday, Oct. 7, 2016. And Marty starts fielding these phone calls from the Republican donors saying that they are speaking on behalf of Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus and that they are ready to remove Trump from the ticket and replace him at the top of the ticket with Mike Pence.\n\nNow, Reince Priebus has said that never happened. What I do know is this based on my reporting. There had been discussed a contingency plan on what would happen if something exactly like Access Hollywood were to come out. You know, the chatter, previously, had been around Mark Burnett, the Celebrity Apprentice, when Trump was a reality TV star that he used the N-word on these hot mic moments. And that's what they were worried about.\n\nAnd they come to Marty Obst, and they say, look. We're ready to replace him on the ticket. All Mike Pence - Mike Pence doesn't even have to say yes. We're just ready to do it to save the party.\n\nSo Marty says no. And he says no for a very important reason. They're thinking about running in 2020 in their own right because they don't expect that Donald Trump is going to win. Nobody expects that Trump is going to win. And Marty - they've already been lining up political donors for the run for the Republican nomination for '20, for to take on - presumptively, to take on Clinton.\n\nAnd they've been telling people behind the scenes, get on the Pence train early and you'll have a good seat at the table when he is the prohibitive front-runner. And he knows that the Republican Party base, the base which will carry him forward in a future run has already moved to Trump. He can't have anything to do with it.\n\nSo - and this really, to me at least, informed a lot of thinking going forward. It really answered a lot of questions about how - you know, why does he sit there with Trump? Why does he - you know, people laugh about it. Why does he take the water bottle off the table when Trump takes the water bottle off the table? It's just because of this. He's playing the long game. He's a - he wants to be the nominee. He wants to be the president in his own right.\n\nDAVIES: In this 2016 campaign, when the Access Hollywood tapes emerge and there is a crisis, Pence doesn't want to be seen as trying to push Trump off the ticket. He's got his own plans for the future. As you have looked at his political career, how long has he been thinking about being president?\n\nLOBIANCO: Since 2008. This is - I - based on my reporting, based on everything I can see, this is when he gets bit with the White House bug, the presidential ambition bug. He doesn't have it before then.\n\nBut what happens in 2008 is immediately after the election, the Council for National Policy, a big umbrella group, comes out and they get together - conservative umbrella group - and they say, we need to find somebody to take on Mitt Romney. What about Mike Pence? He is beloved by the movement conservatives anti-abortion groups, pro-life - however we want to term it - religious conservatives.\n\nAnd what happens - you see - in that moment, you see Mike Pence move from being a guy who is positioning himself for a rise within the House of Representatives to a guy who starts building out - building out networks of donors. His first run for governor - ultimately, he decides to run for governor.\n\nHis run for governor is all about positioning. His first year as governor is positioning. After winning, he joins the vice presidential ticket. He joins Donald Trump as his running mate. It's all about positioning. 2008 is the moment he moves from being a guy who's climbing the ranks in the House of Representatives to a guy who's running for president.\n\nDAVIES: This is FRESH AIR, and our guest is veteran political reporter Tom LoBianco. He's covered the career of Vice President Mike Pence for many years in Indianapolis and Washington. He has a new biography of Pence called Piety & Power: Mike Pence And The Taking Of The White House.\n\nSo let's talk about Mike Pence a bit. He grew up in Columbus, Ind., a middle-class family. What kind of a kid was he?\n\nLOBIANCO: Fairly, I guess, normal so to say (laughter).\n\nDAVIES: Gifted talker...\n\nLOBIANCO: Look, he's...\n\nDAVIES: ...Right?\n\nLOBIANCO: Yes, he was. Pence's older brother Greg, who's now a congressman, is born 1956. Then comes Ed, Jr. And then comes Mike Pence in 1959. And then comes Tom Pence. Four boys within the space of about four years. Twelve years later is when they have two daughters. And they're almost raised as not different families, but you know how it is. It's - it's sort of - so Pence is in the - is the middle child of the four boys.\n\nAnd he points this out. You know, I was researching a lot through his early congressional races, his first two runs at office in 1988 and 1990. He talks a lot about this. He talks about how he was the fat kid. And he said he was - I think he said he was a real pumpkin in a pickle patch - is the way he put it. And his brothers were very athletic. And he's kind of a little quiet, a little more reserved, but he finds this talent.\n\nIt's the St. Columba - the Catholic school he's going to, he starts to find this talent for public speaking. And then he transfers to the public high school, Columbus North High School.\n\nAnd what happens is he loses 55 pounds the summer after his sophomore year. And he comes back into school and, you know, his peers don't even know who he is. And he gets - he starts to get popular. He starts to go out there more. He blossoms. He's a champion on the debate team. By the time he leaves high school, he's a popular kid in a way that he wasn't before.\n\nDAVIES: He goes to Hanover College, a relatively small college, becomes involved in a religious group there. He was Catholic but becomes friendly with a lot of evangelicals. Gets into Republican politics at the ground level and then runs for Congress twice in 1988 and in 1990, fails to unseat a Democratic incumbent and ends up heading a conservative think tank and a newsletter, and then gets a radio show. And this is when conservative talk radio was becoming a big thing. And Rush Limbaugh is a big thing. Limbaugh, of course, was brash and provocative. What was Mike Pence's radio persona like?\n\nLOBIANCO: (Laughter) He was neither brash nor provocative (laughter). But he was very conservative, certainly. He likes to joke. And this is a little bit of misdirection that he uses. OK.\n\nI first saw this when he talked about the cornfield in his backyard. He would deflect questions about his presidential ambitions that say - by saying he was a kid who grew up from a small town in southern Indiana with a cornfield in his backyard. And, you know, I saw the cornfield.\n\nAnd the reason the cornfield was there was not because it's, you know, some small, one-stop town in the middle of a cornfield. Columbus is sort of a - it's cosmopolitan. It's a small metropolis. It's almost like a - like, Annapolis, Md. Like, it's a good mid-sized city. The reason there was a cornfield in his backyard was because he lived in the newest subdevelopment that was eating into the cornfields, on the outskirts of town.\n\nAnd I saw this as a theme throughout his career. He says that he's like Rush Limbaugh on decaf. That's technically right but, you know, he's not brash. He was not brash on air. In the limited number of radio tapes that we've been able to find, they don't show somebody who's a Rush Limbaugh. What they do show is somebody who's a good listener. He's very good at taking and absorbing. And he develops - ironically enough, he's no longer running for anything at this point. He's not running for the statehouse, city council, Congress, whatever. He's not running for anything, but he is developing political instincts.\n\nHe is starting to get a sense of - people call in from around the state because he's syndicated in these small towns like Shelbyville and Richmond, Ind. And they're calling in and they're talking about Bobby Knight, the coach of IU, do they love him or hate him? They're talking about class basketball - right? - the basis of Hoosiers, the movie. And this is what they're interested in. He's developing a sense of where the public is in a way that he hasn't before. That is what he gets from his radio career.\n\nDAVIES: Right. And his good listening also was very helpful in fundraising. People felt flattered and attended to by him. He - it might be this - might be a good point to ask what he stands for. I mean, he became a fiscal conservative as the Tea Party arose. And he was an evangelical Christian, even though he was a Catholic. Tell us a little bit about his religious views and how they informed his politics.\n\nLOBIANCO: Sure. Well, let's start from - he has a - his salvation experience happens in 1978, in a place called the Ichthus Music Festival in Wilmore, Ky. It's right near Lexington. And this is where he feels the experience of Jesus dying on the cross. This is where he understands that Jesus is his personal savior.\n\nBut he doesn't start going to an evangelical church. He doesn't really leave the Catholic Church until the mid-'90s. So this is a 16-year expanse. And I think this is a misconception that's out there about him. He doesn't start out as, like, a Christian right culture warrior, and he doesn't fully embrace it, either. Best I can tell, based on the reporting, he plays to these groups, but he's not firmly ensconced with them. He's not like a Pat Robertson, per say.\n\nDAVIES: Tom LoBianco's book is Piety & Power: Mike Pence And The Taking Of The White House. We will continue our conversation in just a moment. This is FRESH AIR.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)\n\nDAVIES: This is FRESH AIR, and our guest is veteran political reporter Tom LoBianco. He's covered the career of Vice President Mike Pence for many years in Indianapolis and Washington. His new biography of Pence is called Piety & Power: Mike Pence And The Taking Of The White House.\n\nAfter 12 years in Congress, in 2012, he has a choice to make. He has ambitions of running for president. Turns out, there's - it's a strong Republican field. He doesn't do that. He sets his sights on running for governor of Indiana, where he would be replacing a very well-regarded Republican governor, Mitch Daniels.\n\nI'm interested in how, both when he was running for governor in 2012 and when he was serving in Congress, how his religious views, particularly on social issues like gay rights, where in the past, he had advocated for restricting funding for AIDS research if it supported, quote, dangerous lifestyles - how those sorts of religious convictions played out in both his positions in Congress and how he ran for governor. Was he a man who stuck to those principles?\n\nLOBIANCO: Yeah, he - that's really important. And I think that's where - that period from 2010 to 2011 where he makes the decision to run for governor, this is where we start to see that - the ambition taking over, the ambition taking over the faith. And he suppresses the - sort of the Christian right principles that he's been, you know, pushing for the last decade or so.\n\nAnd he decides that, no, I'm going to run as Mitch Daniels 2.0. And this is what his advisers tell him to do. The fundraisers who are helping, they help clear the field for him. And they all tell him, you cannot run as a culture warrior. You will lose this race. They want him to be Mitch Daniels 2.0.\n\nAnd what do I mean by that? I mean that they want him to be a technocrat in the form of Mitch Daniels. Mitch Daniels sort of eschewed the social conservative policy. Not completely - he didn't completely call for a truce. That's a misconception that's out there about him. But he pushes it aside in favor of things are a little more anodyne, like fiscal policy.\n\nAnd you see Pence make this change. Pence tries to live within the Tea Party but not get wrapped into some of the more social stuff. He doesn't get wrapped into the birtherism, for instance. He tries to keep it very tight on fiscal policy. So by the time he's running for governor, he is running as somebody who's not a culture warrior.\n\nDAVIES: He served one term as governor of Indiana from - yeah - got elected in 2012, up to the 2016 election. And it's clear that he still had his eyes on the White House. He traveled abroad. He talked about national issues. He still had to run the state. Was he good at the statecraft of being a governor, dealing with the legislature, being on top of policy?\n\nLOBIANCO: No. No, he was - objectively, I can tell you that he is a terrible government manager. It's - I've - have seen other governors work, and this is not a comment on his policy or his politics but just on his handling of the building. He was not dialed in with the lawmakers. He did not have a sense of things.\n\nAnd let me give you the best example of this, which is he's so focused on running for president and building out his national network of donors that he doesn't see the religious freedom battle coming in 2015. He doesn't see how that can bite him. And he has nothing to do with it. Remember, this is the thing that, you know, basically ends his career in that moment in 2015.\n\nDAVIES: In 2015, a group of legislators develop a piece of legislation. This is when gay marriage is becoming more accepted. They come up with this piece of legislation, the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which says that, I guess, no businessperson has to participate in a gay marriage if it violates their religious beliefs. Doesn't get involved in drafting the legislation - how does he respond to this?\n\nLOBIANCO: The headwinds look fine for him politically in this moment. He doesn't see the backlash that he saw the previous year with the same-sex marriage ban that they were trying to put into the Constitution, and he decides, well, it looks safe. He sticks his head up out of the bunker. And he says, well, I'm going to sign it, and I'm going to take credit for it, which is something he often liked to do - things that he didn't work on - the classic politician, right? - things he didn't work on. You know, it was Reagan that said that, you know, success has, you know, a thousand fathers and, you know, failure is an orphan. So here we go. Here's, you know, one of the thousand fathers for this.\n\nAnd he kind of pops up. It's at the exact same time that the Comic Con convention is in Indianapolis. And what lights this on fire - and this is something that is incredible. It's a Facebook post from George Takei, Mr. Sulu. He says - and he - I think he's out at this point. He says that he knows exactly what this law is that Mike Pence is signing because he saw it in the internment camps that his family lived in, and he sees it now with the bigotry towards him and his - and other LGBT residents.\n\nThis just catches on fire. And it becomes something that Pence doesn't know - he's never experienced before - it becomes a viral moment. Online, it catches on fire and just catches him flat-footed because he thought it was safe. He had no idea what he was getting into. And this brings them into this fateful interview with George Stephanopoulos, where he goes on air, and he tries to defend this legislation that, ironically enough, he had nothing to do with creating, you know? But he tries to take credit for it.\n\nAnd he goes on there, and he - basically, it sounds like he's supporting discrimination in Indiana. And it just wrecks his career. That's the end of it. After that, like, it's - you know, nobody's even talking about him running for president anymore. After that interview on March 30, 2015, they're talking about whether he can survive a bid for re-election as governor.\n\nGROSS: We're listening to the interview FRESH AIR's Dave Davies recorded yesterday with Tom LoBianco, author of the new book Power & Piety: Mike Pence And The Taking Of The White House (ph). After a break, they'll talk about the conversation with Trump that helped secure the vice presidential nomination for Pence, why Pence's wife Karen was angry when the ticket won the election and whether members of Trump's family have been angling to bump Pence from the ticket in 2020. Also, Justin Chang will review the new biopic Judy starring Renee Zellweger as Judy Garland. I'm Terry Gross, and this is FRESH AIR.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)\n\nGROSS: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. As the House impeachment inquiry gets underway, we're listening to the interview FRESH AIR's Dave Davies recorded with veteran political writer Tom LoBianco about the man who is in line to occupy the Oval Office if President Trump were to depart, Vice President Mike Pence. LoBianco has a new book about Pence's career called Piety & Power.\n\nWhen they left off, they were talking about Pence's decision in 2012 to postpone his ambition to run for president and instead run for governor of Indiana.\n\nDAVIES: He barely wins the general election and takes office as governor in 2013. And his - when he moves into capital, his wife, Karen, has an office there and a phone that rings on his desk. What was her role in his administration and, I guess, in his political career generally?\n\nLOBIANCO: I used to think that there was a small circle of - an inner circle for Mike Pence that consisted of three people - Mike Pence, his longtime chief of staff Bill Smith and Karen Pence. And that was my conception for years. And in reporting this book, I found out that it's even smaller than that. It is only Karen Pence and Mike Pence in this inner circle. They're the ones who make decisions together.\n\nYou know, when the Trump campaign was vetting Pence, they had no problems picking him out. They had no problems getting information on him, felt like they had a great sense of who he was. They couldn't find anything bad about him, really. They could not find information about Karen. And I've - to be honest with you, as a reporter, I understand why because it took me a long time to find out how she moves the needle.\n\nI'll give you two examples from inside the State House. Number one was the expansion of Medicaid. She was very important in pushing the idea that the infant mortality rate was too high and that they needed to address that. That was a big item for her. That informs him on this decision. The other one is starting a pre-K program in the state. You know, a couple of state senators go to meet with him, and these are conservative state senators very much in line with where he is. And they say, you know, Mike, we don't want to pay for this. You know, there's no money in the budget. You know, we just don't want to do that. And he looks at them. He says, you know, guys, look. Karen wants me to do it, so I'm going to do it.\n\nDAVIES: So she often controlled access to him. It sounds like, in terms of policy, she pushed him more to - in a more progressive direction, spending money on social services.\n\nLOBIANCO: In that instance, yes. Absolutely. Yeah. I think that - here's something I learned in this process. They are not the caricatures that are out there about them. Yes, they are 100% conservative. And, you know, look. They 100% oppose abortion and will do everything they can to repeal Roe v. Wade. That's very clear. But in terms of - are they fiery theocrats? You know, are these like a Jerry Falwell type? I don't - that's not right, and I think there's a reason that you don't see them knocking it down. This goes to the politics of it.\n\nIt helps them to have that caricature out there because it keeps that politicized evangelical base with them, and it keeps them from going someplace else, like a Nikki Haley or some other political opponent. So these caricatures are actually politically beneficial to them.\n\nDAVIES: So 2016 rolls around. Mike Pence can run for reelection as governor. He would love to enter the presidential race, but it's a strong presidential field - decides he'll go ahead and seek reelection as governor. And then this prospect of joining the ticket with Donald Trump arises. Why did the Trump camp look to Mike Pence?\n\nLOBIANCO: So they're having trouble getting moderate Republicans - or any Republicans, really - to join the ticket. By the beginning of July, it's down to Chris Christie, Newt Gingrich and Mike Pence. Paul Manafort, who is running the campaign in this moment, and Reince Priebus, who has taken on more of a role - certainly as it became clear that Trump would become the nominee - are both arguing extensively for Pence for two different reasons. They see - Manafort sees a delegate uprising led by the - by Cruz and his supporters. Ironically enough, Ken Cuccinelli, now the acting human - acting DHS secretary in the administration and some others are trying to block the nomination of Trump or, you know, deny the nomination on the floor in a delegate battle in the Republican National Convention in Cleveland. Priebus sees a different reason for wanting him. He sees that Pence can bring back your evangelical voters.\n\nAnd let me point this out because this is really important. Trump already has the support of televangelists - Jerry Falwell, Jr., for instance - people who have already gotten on board with Trump. So if the televangelists already support Trump, why do you need the evangelical voters? Because those televangelists don't represent all of your politicized evangelical vote. It's not a monolith. They know - Priebus knows that Pence, in his different style of evangelicalism - his more quiet, Midwestern style - can bring back these quiet, Midwestern voters and help boost the margins in the Rust Belt, in places like Wisconsin and western Michigan.\n\nSo they want him for different reasons. The problem they face is trying to convince Trump to sign up with this guy. Trump sees a loser. That's how he views him. And he doesn't like - he thinks that he's weird with the religion. Trump's just - he just doesn't like Pence at all, so it's kind of vexing for them.\n\nDAVIES: So there's an interesting moment here when it's coming down to the end and Donald Trump has just a few choices - former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, Chris Christie, the governor of New Jersey who very much wants to be on the ticket and then Pence. And a weird thing happens. The Trump campaign wants to make - is going to make a short stop in Indianapolis, but the plane has a flat tire. Why does this end up mattering?\n\nLOBIANCO: That flat tire - it ultimately changes history. It's July 12, 2016. They land. It pops a flat under the right fuselage of the Trump campaign plane. It strands Trump in Indianapolis. In this moment, one week before the nominating convention, Newt Gingrich has the upper hand, based on my reporting. Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump are with Gingrich in New York in Trump Tower. They like Gingrich. They like the way that he meshes with their father. They like that he's a big ideas person. Christie has a good line directly in with Trump, but Kushner doesn't like Christie because Christie helped put his father in jail.\n\nSo there's - Pence's in the mix, but he is not the top candidate in this moment. What that flat tire does - it basically relocates the entire campaign to - for about 48 hours to Indianapolis. And it forces Trump to seriously consider and spend time with Mike Pence in a way that he hadn't before.\n\nSo they stay overnight in Indianapolis. They get up the next morning. Their families have breakfast at the governor's mansion, and what's important here is that Jared and Ivanka have not met Mike Pence. This is their first time meeting them. And they go downstairs after breakfast in the governor's mansion for a meeting in the bunker, and it's this family room that's in the basement.\n\nAnd Donald Trump is sitting across from Mike Pence - and this is the brass tacks moment - and Trump looks at him, and he says, Mike, I need killers. He says, why do you want this? I need killers. Are you going to be a killer? He holds up his phone, and there's the missed phone calls from Chris Christie. He's like, look. Chris Christie, he's a killer. And Pence looks at him, and he says, I am not a killer. I can't be that. Look. I can help you govern. I can help you lobby Congress. I will help you with conservative voters, evangelical voters in the Rust Belt. But I'm not a killer, and if you want a killer, you should find somebody else, and I will support you and whoever else that is in your effort to change America, but I don't need this.\n\nAnd Trump is gobsmacked, and afterwards, after this, it's the first time that Trump seriously considers Mike Pence as a possible running mate. And Marty Obst meets with Pence afterwards, and he's just astounded. He's like, Mike, that was incredible.\n\nDAVIES: Tom LoBianco's book is Piety & Power: Mike Pence And The Taking Of The White House. We will continue our conversation in just a moment. This is FRESH AIR.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF JON CLEARY'S DYNA-MITE)\n\nDAVIES: This is FRESH AIR, and our guest is veteran political reporter Tom LoBianco. He's covered the career of Vice President Mike Pence for many years, both in Washington and in Indiana, for several media outlets. He has a new biography of Pence called Piety & Power: Mike Pence And The Taking Of The White House.\n\nYou have a remarkably personal detail in this book, and that's on election night. After Trump surprises everyone and wins and Hillary Clinton calls and concedes, you say that Mike Pence leans in to kiss his wife Karen, quote, but she rebuffed him and says, you got what you wanted, Mike. Leave me alone. The - I looked in this - in the back of the book, you cite former campaign - Trump campaign aides as a source for this. What do you make of this interaction?\n\nLOBIANCO: Well, when I first heard this, I thought to myself, wow. She is really angry at Trump and having to be stuck with Trump. But then I realized something. The more I understood about her influence in their trajectory, their political - their joint political career, it wasn't that she was angry at Trump. She was angry at Pence. What happened when he signed on - when they both decided to sign on - with Trump was they took a gamble, and they never take gambles in their political career. They take a gamble that it's only going to be four months at Trump's side, and that...\n\nDAVIES: And he'll lose, and then he can run for - run in 2020, right?\n\nLOBIANCO: Exactly, and they lose. They lose. In that moment, they lost that bet. And now he's gone from four months of having to carry the water for a guy who talks about, you know, serially molesting women to four years of that, possibly eight years of that. And she knows that it's going to ruin his image because has developed a very clean image in his career trying to - so that's why she's angry. Politically, they lost. They lost that bet on election night.\n\nDAVIES: So I think you say that in the early months of the administration, he tried to be in every meeting he could in the West Wing and got into a lot of them but never said anything. Talk about his role in the administration, and in particular, the perception that he would actually mimic the president's moves just physically.\n\nLOBIANCO: (Laughter) He kind of takes on other people's dynamics. He takes on other people's properties. One source told me that he's like a Zelig character. He takes on their mannerisms. You know, you see he does the wink and the nod like Reagan used to do. He does really good George W. Bush impersonations. He does Trump impersonations every now and then.\n\nSo to your question, I think this is a central question that people have about Pence. You know, look. I've seen two tropes out there about him. One is he is a, quote, unquote, shadow president. Let me just say he doesn't secretly run things inside there. If there's anyone who's a shadow anything, it would be Karen Pence, who is a shadow vice president, and I think as we're putting this out now, is not really shadow anymore.\n\nBut then the other version - and you see a little bit more of this reported out in the Bob Woodward book where Gary Cohn and Rob Porter have a big say in things - is Mike Pence is sort of a glorified coat rack. And this is to your question - right? - the guy who shows up, nods, you know, solemnly furrows his brow a little bit and, you know, smiles and, you know, pats everyone on the back but don't really do anything. I think that kind of misses it, too.\n\nWhat Pence is - he falls in between those two. Those are your extreme caricature goalposts for him, and what you really have is a guy who - he works hard on anti-abortion, social conservative policy, you know, the updates of the gay marriage fight, which beat this religious freedom fight that continues. And you also have him in a - with a deep hand in the Health and Human Services and trying to repeal or curb Obamacare within that department. But he stays within his lane. He's not forceful. He's not somebody who pushes the president because, remember, ultimately, this is about survival. He has to survive until 2024, so he's not going to do anything that endangers his political viability.\n\nDAVIES: So we're - you know, he and Trump clearly are not close, and there have been reports that Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner would like to bump Mike Pence from the ticket for 2020. What's your sense of that?\n\nLOBIANCO: Let me start by saying that Jared and Ivanka's people deny this, but what I heard is that they talk about trying to find a woman to run with Trump to help them win back the suburbs. This is the major political calculation for them. You know, look. They've also kind of pushed aside Pence's operatives within the Trump reelection, keeping them out of decisions.\n\nThere's a great anecdote I write about where they go out in the field - the Trump campaign goes out in the field with some polling, and they try to hide it from Pence's team, in part, because the poll comes back and it shows that Pence's favorable numbers are much better than Trump's favorable numbers. And Pence's aide has to go out and actually use a mole within his own campaign to get a copy of one of these polls. It was 14 battleground state polls.\n\nIt's - they see that Trump or that Pence is not helping them. And the other part of this calculation is that they feel like Trump has a solid lock on the evangelical vote writ large, so they don't need Pence anymore, and they can dump him from 2020. That's - I think that misreads it. And this is what Pence's people say.\n\nCertainly, his allies say that no, the evangelical vote is not a monolith. It's not just the televangelists who are 100% onboard with Trump. It's these other voters that - which is the reason they needed him to begin with.\n\nHere's why I'm confident that this is a real thing. And it's not so much the chatter or the rumors and whatnot, it has more to do with the actions of Pence. And you saw this really - this tough July that he had - July 2019 where he goes - he gets yanked back from this weird trip to New Hampshire that's unexplained. Then he gets a - a few weeks later, he gets sent down to a detention camp and - one of the border detention camps. And it's just, you know, just terrible scene, you know - men and women, cages. It is just a horrible scene.\n\nAnd what one of Pence's advisers and friends was telling people was that this is another Trump loyalty test. It's another way of him yanking on the leash. And they hate it. They really feel like this is too demeaning. It's too - it's not - it's - why should you have to constantly - Pence is just completely loyal. Why should he always have to be taking these loyalty tests? And that goes to this effort by Jared and Ivanka to find somebody else. Now, are the - you know, will they actually replace Pence? Most people think probably not, but they are testing it.\n\nDAVIES: You know, we've just - the House Democrats have just embarked upon a formal impeachment inquiry. And obviously, we don't know where this will go and will take some time to play itself out. But I feel I should ask you since we have you here that if it comes to it, if Donald Trump leaves the presidency, what would a Mike Pence presidency look like?\n\nLOBIANCO: Great question. I think that it would look very - like a very conservative George W. Bush presidency. Expect a return to sort of pre-Trump policies for the most part - neocon policies, neo conservative policies, certainly in foreign policy, fiscal policy. Expect more - I would expect more fiscal restraint than you've seen under Trump. I don't know that you'd see a return to free trade.\n\nLet me tell you a little bit about his people that will be in there. You know, Kellyanne Conway is still very important in Pence's orbit. She would be a key player in a Pence White House, you know, whether that's through impeachment or in 2024, whenever. Marc Short - still, perhaps, the most important player in Pence's orbit.\n\nBut I don't know that he would be a fiery theocrat the way that a lot of folks on the left present him as. Because I think that, ultimately - and this is something that his people told me - so let's say he does get impeached, and they remove him. He wants to win the presidency in his own right. And he wants it to be a victory that sort of cements him in U.S. history. I think he'd revert back to that - the ambition, the shapeshifter. It's not a guarantee that he would be an ideologue. It's all about winning. It's all about being a political opportunist.\n\nDAVIES: Well, Tom LoBianco, thanks so much for speaking with us.\n\nLOBIANCO: Thank you.\n\nGROSS: Tom LoBianco spoke with FRESH AIR's Dave Davies. LoBianco's new book is Piety & Power: Mike Pence And The Taking Of The White House. After a short break, Justin Chang will review the new biopic Judy, starring Renee Zellweger as Judy Garland.

Pelosi Rejects 'Socialist' Attacks On Her Prescription Drug Bill\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Claire Harbage/NPR Claire Harbage/NPR\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi unveiled legislation this week that would give the federal government sweeping new authority to regulate and lower the cost of prescription drugs. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., declared the bill dead on arrival and told Politico it amounts to socialist price controls.\n\nIn an exclusive interview with NPR, Pelosi suggested McConnell was in the pocket of the pharmaceutical industry and noted that President Trump shares her view that negotiating drug prices is good policy. As the president said in the course of his run for office and since: 'We're going to negotiate like crazy. We're going to negotiate like crazy.' So perhaps Mitch is talking about the president, as well.\n\nThe speaker distanced herself from the central health care policies of two leading candidates for the 2020 Democratic nomination for president.\n\nSens. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts are advocating for eliminating private insurers in favor of a government-run health care system for all. Asked if she believed that was the right direction for her party to take on health care, Pelosi was succinct: No, I do not.\n\nThe speaker is leading her party's efforts in Congress on prescription drugs. On that front she said that if she and the president can cut a deal, Trump will be able to get the votes necessary to pass the bill. If the president says he supports a path similar to this, you will see some of the Republicans come around, she said.\n\nMost Republicans and the drug lobby oppose the House bill, and McConnell's socialist line of attack echoes the broader argument Republicans are trying to make against the Democratic Party ahead of the 2020 elections. Pelosi pushed back on this line of attack, noting that the government in some cases already directly negotiates drug prices.\n\nFor instance, she noted the Department of Veterans Affairs is legally allowed to negotiate drug costs, but Medicare is not. We are not intervening in the free market. We believe in the free market, Pelosi said. But we do not believe that the free market should have the exploitation of consumers in our country with the support of the government by banning the ability for the secretary [of health and human services] to negotiate for lower prices.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Claire Harbage/NPR Claire Harbage/NPR\n\nPelosi emphasized that health care was the leading issue in the last election. Pressed on what Democrats should do instead of Medicare for All, Pelosi said she supports expanding the Affordable Care Act to include a public option that can compete with the private market. The speaker was a chief architect of the health care law.\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden is campaigning on a similar policy. Democrats tried and failed to include a public option in the original version of Obamacare. We believe that the path of the Affordable Care Act is the way to go, Pelosi said.\n\nPelosi praised the Democrats who are advocating for Medicare for All and said she shares the goal of universal coverage, but it's not the practical way to get it done. Again I salute them, and if that's what they believe, God bless them for that, but that is I think not the practical path to getting something done.
Trump Threatens Congress' Health Care; Senate Republicans Don't Seem Too Worried\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n\nSenate Republicans don't appear to be too worried about President Trump's latest round of threats.\n\nIf a new HealthCare Bill is not approved quickly, BAILOUTS for Insurance Companies and BAILOUTS for Members of Congress will end very soon! Trump said on Twitter over the weekend. He followed that tweet with a similar threat Monday, writing, If ObamaCare is hurting people, & it is, why shouldn't it hurt the insurance companies & why should Congress not be paying what the public pays?\n\nAnd yet, the Senate is clearly moving on from health care — at least for now. Tuesday, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell laid out his short-term priorities: confirming presidential nominees and passing bills related to the Department of Veterans Affairs and the Food and Drug Administration. In September, McConnell says, the Senate will turn its attention to a tax bill.\n\nIn other words: not health care.\n\nUnderscoring the end of the deadline-driven push for repealing the Affordable Care Act: Sens. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., and Patty Murray, D-Wash., announced the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions would begin holding health care hearings in September. The hearings won't focus on a broad repeal of the current health law, but rather on smaller-scale measures needed to stabilize Obamacare marketplaces.\n\nWhat bailouts was Trump referring to? The insurance company bailouts are known as cost-sharing reductions, or CSRs. As NPR's Alison Kodjak explains, the federal government's monthly payments reimburse insurance companies for discounts the law requires them to give to low-income people who buy insurance through the Affordable Care Act exchanges. The federal money that goes to insurers in these payments ... offsets the money insurers lose by lowering the deductibles and co-payments they require of these policyholders.\n\nThe Trump administration decides whether to make these payments on a monthly basis, and White House officials have repeatedly threatened to cut them off. Many Republicans are urging them not to. It's absolutely essential that the cost sharing reductions be continued, said Maine Republican Sen. Susan Collins. When I hear them described as an insurance company bailout, that is just not an accurate description. The reason we have CSRs is to help low-income people.\n\nAs for the congressional bailouts — that's a bit more complicated. The Affordable Care Act required members of Congress and their staff to receive their health insurance through Obamacare exchanges. But an unintentional loophole in the language initially threatened to drive up costs for lawmakers and staffers by substantial margins, compared to other federal employees.\n\nIn 2013, the federal Office of Personnel Management ruled that lawmakers and the tens of thousands of affected staffers would continue to receive the same cost-sharing benefit as before: The government would fund 75 percent of health insurance costs, with the employee paying the rest.\n\nIn other words, congressional staff and lawmakers would purchase insurance on the District of Columbia insurance market, but continue to effectively receive the same employer contribution that most people covered by their workplace use to pay for the bulk of insurance costs.\n\nSo technically, the Trump administration could order the Office of Personnel Management to reverse that ruling, and leave lawmakers and staffers to fully fund their health insurance costs themselves.\n\nMost lawmakers dismissed the tweet. I'm not exactly sure what he's talking about, said South Dakota Republican Sen. Mike Rounds. Asked whether he thinks Trump would follow through on the threat, Rounds said: I don't know. You'd have to ask the president. I respect the office of the presidency and know he has a number of tools available to him.\n\nRounds pushed back against Trump's suggestion that Senate Republicans are quitting on Obamacare repeal. Just recognize that we really are trying to get to someplace where we help people that are going to be hurt if we don't do something to stabilize and bring these premiums down, he said.\n\nTrump's threat did get support from an occasional GOP critic: South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham. We should pay a price for not passing a repeal bill, Graham said. We haven't tried all our options yet.\n\nThe idea that Congress should pay a price for failing here probably resonates with 90 percent of the country, so I think he's on to something.\n\nBut with Senate leaders making it clear they're moving on to other issues, the question is now whether Trump follows through on his threat.
With Biden In Place, The 'Resistance' Tries To Pivot From Defense To Offense\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Shannon Finney/Getty Images Shannon Finney/Getty Images\n\nWhen Ezra Levin and his wife, Leah Greenberg, founded the progressive group Indivisible in 2016, they widely circulated a handbook on resisting the Trump agenda. It took tactical lessons in grassroots politics from the Tea Party, which had prominently resisted President Barack Obama's agenda.\n\nThere's another lesson Levin now thinks progressives can take from the conservative Tea Party: It's easier to oppose a policy than to advance one.\n\nWe saw this from the Tea Party themselves during the Obama years, he said. After Obama lost his House majority and then the Senate majority, the House passed a repeal of the Affordable Care Act literally dozens of times.\n\nThen in 2016, Republicans won the House, the Senate and the presidency and still couldn't pass an Obamacare replacement — a loss for the GOP and a win for groups such as Indivisible that opposed it.\n\nThey were met by Indivisible groups and others pushing back against it, making it as difficult as possible to do politically, and they ultimately failed, Levin said.\n\nNow, with Democrats controlling the White House, the House and — by the slimmest possible margin — the Senate, Indivisible has updated its handbook, telling its nationwide network of groups how to be most effective in their advocacy. The goal: Turn from resisting one agenda to assisting in shaping a new one.\n\nAnd they're not alone. A wide swath of organizations that came to be known as the Resistance are facing the question of how to go from defense to offense.\n\nThat pivot is tough, says Dana R. Fisher, a professor of sociology at the University of Maryland and author of the book American Resistance.\n\nBasically, there's historic precedent that when Democrats win, movements die, she said. I mean, they call Democratic successes the graveyards of progressive movements and campaigns.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Jim Young/AFP via Getty Images Jim Young/AFP via Getty Images\n\nA defining characteristic of the Resistance was its breadth in terms of what different groups cared about. The initial Women's March featured people advocating for a broad range of causes, including abortion rights, racial justice and transgender rights. The March For Our Lives brought together young Americans in favor of gun control. The Sunrise Movement fought for climate protections.\n\nThat massive range of interests managed to be unified because they were all in opposition to former President Donald Trump.\n\nIt was really easy to maintain this fragile coalition, Fisher said, because specifically, they were basically playing defense: 'Do not roll back health care.' 'Do not roll back environmental regulations.' 'Do not try to deport Americans,' you know, etc., and so forth. So that was very easy, and everybody worked very well together.\n\nTo be clear, Fisher says, it's not just groups on the left that experience a difficult transition once the party they favor takes power.\n\nIf we look back to the Tea Party, which is the most recent movement that we could look at, a lot of people talked about how the Tea Party really was defanged once Tea Party candidates were elected to Congress, she said.\n\nNow, progressive groups' strategies will shift as they try to represent their own unique constituencies.\n\nI suspect policy advocacy will be more of a role in all progressive organizations [than it was] over the last couple of years, said Rachel Carmona, who's executive director of the Women's March. I think, you know, we have not essentially experienced a petitionable government in the last four years.\n\nBut not every group has the same priorities.\n\nFor their part, Women's March proponents think that COVID-19 relief is immediately important, particularly for women of color. Carmona pointed to the fact that Black and Latina women accounted for all of the nation's job losses in December.\n\nWe have to be thinking about, what is the long-term effect of COVID on women and work, basically, in addition to women in health? she said. So right off the bat, we know we are in a situation where we need to deal with the current conditions — first things first.\n\nMeanwhile, Indivisible's Levin mentioned pro-democratic reforms like Washington, D.C., statehood and the John Lewis Voting Rights Act as important priorities. And Black Lives Matter is pushing the BREATHE Act, which would shift funding from areas like incarceration to other areas like education.\n\nIt's also not clear which of these policies Congress and President Biden might agree on. And while Biden is pursuing further COVID-19 relief, it's unknown what other policies he will choose to spend political capital on. (He just outlined a big immigration bill.)\n\nOne additional difficulty is just keeping up energy around a cause. Patrisse Cullors, co-founder of Black Lives Matter, says the group's goals gained attention during last summer's protests but then were swallowed up by other concerns.\n\nWhen something is not readily in the media, folks move towards apathy or get distracted, she said. So this is not just a question for our electeds, but it's a question for everybody who protested with us last summer — for the millions of people who showed up, keep showing up.\n\nCullors says she considers Black Lives Matter part of the anti-Trump resistance but also more than a Resistance group, as it existed well before the Trump administration.\n\nBLM has also made its own political pivot in recent months, starting Black Lives Matter PAC in fall 2020. That gives it a more formal footprint in the political world, one where it and other groups may be fighting for oxygen in coming months.
Democrats Strategize For Midterms\n\nConor Lamb, a centrist Democrat, is the apparent victor in this week's Pennsylvania congressional election — a big win for Democrats going into the midterms. But can their strategy survive long term?\n\nSCOTT SIMON, HOST:\n\nDemocrats are celebrating this week after Conor Lamb's apparent victory over Republican Rick Saccone in a Pennsylvania congressional district that voted overwhelmingly for President Trump in 2016. Democratic leaders say that proves the party can be a big tent for centrists and progressives. But many already wonder if that strategy can survive long-term. NPR's congressional reporter Kelsey Snell joins us now. Kelsey, thanks so much for being with us.\n\nKELSEY SNELL, BYLINE: Thanks for having me.\n\nSIMON: Democrats have more candidates than they've ever had before. It's a midterm year, so they don't have to worry about a presidential candidate at the top of the ticket. Why can't they just run their own races?\n\nSNELL: Well, Democratic leaders say they absolutely can, and that's what they're going to do, and that's going to be their not-so-secret formula to take control of the House this year. They're for the first time in a really long time managing races where they get to fine tune and make sure that the candidates fit the district where they'd be representing in a way that they haven't in a really long time.\n\nI just got back from Illinois, where they have a primary next week, and a centrist more like Lamb could lose out to a progressive. It's a safe district for Democrats, but the incumbent is Dan Lipinski. He is one of the last anti-abortion Democrats in the country, and he voted against issues like Obamacare. So I was out there talking to a lot of voters, and even some of his own supporters say having a primary is a good thing because Democrats are, for the first time in a long time, debating a lot of issues. So here's Mary Ann Quinlan (ph). She's a substitute teacher and a volunteer for Lipinski's challenger, Marie Newman.\n\nMARY ANN QUINLAN: We have not had a choice - a real choice - at least in 14 years. So that's - not having a choice makes everybody feel limited, so that's just not healthy.\n\nSIMON: Republicans, and even some centrist Democrats, say that the party runs the risks of being split between two wings, kind of as the Tea Party did to the Republicans.\n\nSNELL: Right. And Democrats I talk to say that's a false question because Democrats have always had a strong and vocal progressive wing, and that just happens to be a bigger part of the party right now. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi was asked about this at a press conference recently. She gave a long answer that was summed up by saying, welcome to the Democratic Party. And here's how she described it.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nNANCY PELOSI: It's what we're used to. It's our strength. We're not a rubber stamp. And that's just the way it is. We will never be a rubber stamp.\n\nSNELL: She went on to say that those tensions are kind of essential to the decision making she's overseen, at least since she's been part of leadership since 2003. But it's also been their downfall at times. The dynamics that help Democrats get elected in off years can sometimes make it really difficult to govern or to have strong leadership at the top or unify around a single candidate a few years later when they need to pick somebody for president.\n\nSIMON: Democrats have a lot of movements in the party now - the Resist movement, immigration advocates, gun control advocates, people who just have a distaste for President Trump. Where does the party go from here?\n\nSNELL: It's important to look at two main constituents here, and that's women and black voters. I talked to Emily Cain, and she's the executive director of EMILY's List. They're a group that works to elect pro-choice women candidates. She told me she thinks 2018 is just the start of really big things to come, in particular when it comes to women in the party. Here's what she said.\n\nEMILY CAIN: 2018 is not just a moment. 2018 is the start of a sea change because while we have already launched more than 60 women in campaigns for Congress across the country, there's another 60 or a hundred behind them getting ready to run in 2020 or 2022.\n\nSNELL: So that's who's on the ballot. But when you look at who Democrats need to actually show up and vote on Election Day, one key group is black women. They helped deliver a victory for Democrat Doug Jones in Alabama, and they were a key part of getting President Obama elected. This week, we spoke to one African-American political scientist who said she was concerned that the energy of the Resist movement could cause party leaders to ignore the need to address the needs of African-American voters and other minorities within the party.\n\nSIMON: NPR's congressional reporter Kelsey Snell, thanks so much.\n\nSNELL: Thank you.\n\nCopyright © 2018 NPR.

5 Ways Nixing The Affordable Care Act Could Upend U.S. Health System\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Bastiaan Slabbers/NurPhoto via Getty Images Bastiaan Slabbers/NurPhoto via Getty Images\n\nIf last Friday's district court ruling that the Affordable Care Act is unconstitutional were to be upheld, far more than the law's most high-profile provisions would be at stake.\n\nIn fact, canceling the law in full — as Judge Reed O'Connor in Fort Worth, Texas, ordered in his 55-page decision — could thrust the entire health care system into chaos.\n\nTo erase a law that is so interwoven into the health care system blows up every part of it, says Sara Rosenbaum, a health law professor at the George Washington University School of Public Health. In law they have names for these — they are called superstatutes, she says. And [the ACA] is a superstatute. It has changed everything about how we get health care. (That concept was developed by Abbe Gluck, a professor at Yale Law School.)\n\nO'Connor's decision is a long way from implementation. He still must rule on several other aspects of the suit brought by 18 Republican attorneys general and two GOP governors. And a group of state Democratic attorneys general has promised to appeal O'Connor's decision, which would send it to the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals and, possibly, the U.S. Supreme Court. The high court has rejected two previous efforts, in 2012 and 2015, to find the law unconstitutional.\n\nMeanwhile, here are five ways that eliminating the ACA could upend health care for many, if not most, Americans:\n\nMillions could lose coverage directly\n\nMore than 20 million Americans who previously were uninsured gained coverage from 2010 to 2017. Some of that was due to an improving economy, but many also gained the ability to buy their own coverage, thanks to the law's federal subsidies to defray the cost of insurance. Other provisions of the Affordable Care Act played a significant role, including its ban on restrictions for people with pre-existing medical conditions, expansion of the Medicaid program to more low-income adults and allowing adult children to stay on their parents' health plans until reaching age 26.\n\nIf the law were reversed, federal funding for Medicaid and individual insurance subsidies would stop, and insurers could once again refuse coverage to or charge more for people who have health problems.\n\nFundamental changes to the health care system could be stymied\n\nThe impact of eliminating the ACA could be felt well beyond those people who are the direct beneficiaries of the law.\n\nGail Wilensky, who ran the Medicare and Medicaid programs under President George H.W. Bush, says such a change would be very disruptive because so much [of the ACA] has affected the way health care is organized and delivered, and the way insurance is provided.\n\nFor example, says Rosenbaum, the increase in health coverage meant that suddenly it became possible for health care systems to care for, by and large, an insured population.\n\nPreviously many hospitals, doctors and other health providers spent considerable time and effort figuring out how to treat — without going broke —people who lack insurance.\n\nAfter the ACA kicked in, these providers began to worry less about whether they would get paid. And the federal government started pushing them to create new initiatives aimed at improving the quality of care.\n\nThose include, for example, measures that base some federal payments on patients' health outcomes rather than on each individual procedure performed. Under the ACA, the government also encouraged strategies that improve health across the U.S. — like improving the availability of healthful food, bicycle paths and preventive care.\n\nIf millions of people lost insurance, Rosenbaum says, those health providers would have to go back to wondering how they will be able to pay their bills.\n\nMedicare and Medicaid would be dramatically altered\n\nThe popular Medicare program, which covers an estimated 60 million seniors and people with disabilities, was a major focus of the ACA.\n\nElimination of the federal health law would take away some popular benefits the ACA conferred — everything from free preventive care to the closing of the doughnut hole in Medicare's prescription drug coverage. The doughnut hole refers to a coverage gap that had previously exposed large numbers of beneficiaries to thousands of dollars in drug costs.\n\nThe law also changed the way Medicare paid for hospital, home health and outpatient care. Many current payment policies are based on authority provided by the ACA, and if it went away, Medicare would have to rewrite those payment regulations. Millions of beneficiaries belong to accountable care organizations that were created under the health law, and it is unclear how their care would be affected.\n\nThe biggest change in the Medicaid program would be the elimination of the expansion of coverage. Loss of the ACA would also roll back a 23-percentage-point boost in Medicaid prescription drug rebates, which has saved states billions of dollars, according to Cindy Mann. She ran Medicaid under President Barack Obama and is now a partner at the health consulting firm Manatt Health.\n\nThe ACA required states to calculate Medicaid eligibility differently — changing what counts as income — so all the work states did to alter their information systems would have to be recalculated, she says.\n\nWide array of health programs at risk\n\nShorthand descriptions of the health law often stop at its provisions providing consumer protections and expanding Medicaid. But the ACA included sweeping changes to other parts of the health system that rarely get mentioned.\n\nFor example, it created the first pathway for Food and Drug Administration approval of generic copies of expensive biologic drugs, by incorporating the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009. Biologic drugs are more difficult to reproduce than other types of medications.\n\nAlso hitching a ride on the ACA was a long-delayed bill providing permanent spending authority for programs provided by the Indian Health Service, which serves Native Americans.\n\nAnd the law included a series of grant programs to help train more health professionals who would be needed to treat the millions of newly insured Americans.\n\nAll those programs would be thrust into doubt by invalidating the law.\n\nLoss of the ACA also would impact a popular program that predates Obamacare: the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA.\n\nThe ACA's protections for pre-existing conditions — banning insurers from charging people with health problems higher premiums or refusing to sell to them altogether — built on similar protections for people with employer insurance. Congress included those protections in HIPAA, which was enacted in 1996. And far more people are touched by HIPAA than by the ACA, because far more people get health insurance through their employer than through the individual market.\n\nHowever, when Congress wrote the ACA, it incorporated HIPAA safeguards into the pre-existing-condition provision. That means if the ACA is struck down, the HIPAA protections might disappear as well.\n\nEven the Trump administration's health agenda could be compromised\n\nPresident Trump has railed against the health law, but his Department of Health and Human Services has a priority list that relies in some significant ways on the continued existence of the ACA.\n\nFor example, efforts to address the opioid epidemic — one of the administration's top health challenges — could be seriously set back if the Medicaid expansion were to end. Medicaid is the largest single payer for mental health and substance abuse treatments.\n\nMuch of the president's effort to limit drug prices flows through the Center for Medicare & Medicaid Innovation, which was created by the ACA and would lose its legal authority if the law became invalid.\n\nSimilarly, the administration is using this center to pursue bundling payments for certain surgical procedures — an effort to try to get more value for dollars spent.\n\nKaiser Health News, a nonprofit news service, is an editorially independent program of the Kaiser Family Foundation and not affiliated with Kaiser Permanente.

Trump Wades Deeper Into Alabama Primary At Campaign Rally — With Some Hesitation\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Brendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty Images Brendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty Images\n\nPresident Trump traveled to Alabama Friday night to stump for his chosen candidate, Sen. Luther Strange, ahead of Tuesday's bitter GOP Senate primary.\n\nBut even he acknowledged his alliance with the appointed senator was somewhat strange given the fact that so many of his allies — such as former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon, former national security aide Sebastian Gorka and former vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin — are all backing Strange's opponent, former state Supreme Court Chief Justice Roy Moore.\n\nI'll be honest, I might have made a mistake, Trump acknowledged at one point, before pointing to how much Strange's poll numbers have surged since he tweeted out his endorsement for him. Still, he bemoaned that if Strange loses, he'll be unfairly blamed in the press for the defeat.\n\nI think you're gonna come back and you're gonna kick everyone's ass, the president predicted to Strange.\n\nBut, if it's Moore who wins on Tuesday — as most public polls project — I'm going to be here campaigning like hell for him, Trump promised.\n\nTrump did underscore an argument that GOP strategists backing Strange have been making — he's the most electable come December's general election race against Democratic nominee Doug Jones. Ultimately, they worry that if it's the controversial Moore — twice removed from the bench for defying federal court orders over a Ten Commandments monument and the Supreme Court's gay marriage decision — who wins the GOP nomination, a race that shouldn't be contested could be put in play, even in deep red Alabama.\n\nIf [Luther] wins, that race is over, Trump said. If somebody else wins, I will tell you, that's gonna be a very tough race.\n\nAnd Trump tried to give Strange cover from the attacks he's gotten over the $9 million a superPAC aligned with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has spent in the race. But even at times, some of those assertions seemed downright implausible.\n\nHe doesn't even know Mitch McConnell, Trump claimed at one point. In his introduction of Trump, Strange himself claimed he would stand up to the Senate majority leader if he's elected. Strange was appointed earlier this year to fill the seat of Trump's now-Attorney General Jeff Sessions.\n\nLuther wants to end business as usual, stop the insider dealing, and Luther Strange is determined to drain that swamp, Trump said.\n\nIt's the circumstances of Strange's appointment that are handicapping his chances — as the state attorney general, Strange's office was investigating the then-governor, under fire for a sex scandal he allegedly used his office to cover up. The governor eventually resigned.\n\nTrump reiterated throughout the night the reason he was backing Strange was because he was loyal to his agenda, especially on health care. Trump recounted how, on efforts last spring to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, he tried to wine and dine senators to vote for the bill, and many wanted something in return or for him to meet their families.\n\nBut Strange called him up and said he was with him right from the start, something the president said left him in disbelief.\n\nI went home and told my wife, that's the coolest thing that's happened to me in six months, Trump said.\n\nStrange is hoping that Trump's appearance on his behalf — and a subsequent visit by Vice President Pence on Monday — can be the boost he needs to get over the finish line in the primary. At a debate with Moore on Thursday, Strange couldn't mention enough that he was Trump's chosen candidate. And in a state that went heavily for Trump in the primary and general and gave him some of his biggest rally crowds, he's hoping that support for Trump will translate into support for his candidacy with voters.\n\nBut Moore has been arguing he's the one who can best drain the swamp, and after the debate held his own rally with some of Trump's most fervent backers, where they lamented that Trump had gotten bad advice in deciding to back Strange over Moore.\n\nThe swamp is trying to hijack this presidency, said Palin. The swamp is trying to steal the victory that we worked so hard for.\n\nThe majority of Trump's speech — a nearly hour-and-a-half long stemwinder — didn't even focus on Strange, though, and saw the president much more in his campaign trail element. At times, he'd weave back in praise of Strange, but his most animated moments were talking about some of his pet issues.\n\nWhen mentioning his vanquished 2016 opponent Hillary Clinton, familiar refrains of lock her up rang out.\n\nYou gotta speak to Jeff Sessions about that, Trump smirked.\n\nBuoyed by chants of build the wall, he talked about the need to have a see-through wall at the southern border so that drug traffickers couldn't throw bushels of drugs over and hit people on the other side on the head.\n\nTrump boasted of his week at the UN and how he was standing up to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, reviving and adding to his nickname for him — now little Rocket Man.\n\nHe belittled the Russian hoax theory that his campaign had colluded with the country to influence the 2016 election.\n\nAnd when Trump alluded to the biggest news of the day — that the latest effort to repeal Obamacare had met its possible demise after Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., announced he wouldn't vote for the bill — the crowd booed each time the 2008 GOP presidential nominee was mentioned.\n\nStill, Trump promised to the crowd, we're going to do it eventually, on repealing and replacing Obamacare despite repeated setbacks.\n\nA new tirade of the president's — in a very football-minded state — was against the NFL and recent protests by players, started last year by then-San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick for refusing to stand during the national anthem.\n\nWouldn't you love to see one of the NFL owners when somebody disrespects the flag, to say 'Get that son of a bitch off the field'? Trump said to cheers. The president said maybe they should use the catchphrase he made famous as a reality TV star — You're fired.
Senate Will Hold Another Health Care Vote Next Week\n\nWhat options do Senate Republicans have left in their effort to undo the Affordable Care Act, which is also known as Obamacare? The stakes seem much bigger than just health care.\n\nDAVID GREENE, HOST:\n\nThe only thing that appears certain in the Senate when it comes to health care is that there will be a vote next week. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell made that clear after a senators-only lunch with President Trump at the White House.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nMITCH MCCONNELL: Well, it's pretty obvious we've had difficulty in getting 50 votes to proceed. But what I want to disabuse any of you of is the notion that we will not have that vote next week.\n\nGREENE: Some double negatives there, but it sounds like what McConnell is saying is that there will be some kind of vote next week. What will be voted on? Let's ask NPR congressional correspondent Susan Davis, who has been covering this. Good morning, Sue.\n\nSUSAN DAVIS, BYLINE: Hey, David.\n\nGREENE: So what options are left for Mitch McConnell right now? What could they vote on?\n\nDAVIS: There's really three options on the table. And the first one, and the one that seems most likely at this stage, is failure. They still simply don't seem to have the votes it takes to pass a piece of legislation. The two pieces of legislation on the table are one option that would essentially just repeal much of the Affordable Care Act in the short term and give Congress a two-year delay period to try and find something to come up with to replace it with. And then the other option is a repeal-and-replace companion, where they repeal much of the law and, at the same time, institute a new system for people to purchase insurance on the individual market.\n\nGREENE: But this is very complicated - right? - because weren't there senators who voted for just repeal a couple years ago but are now saying they don't want to vote for just repeal? I mean, there's a lot of nuance and complexity here.\n\nDAVIS: Health care is complicated...\n\nGREENE: (Laughter) To say the least.\n\nDAVIS: ...As our president once said. You're absolutely right. You know, what gets some combination of moderate senators back on board is likely to knock a couple conservatives off the team and vice versa. So I think there is a deep amount of pessimism going into the vote next week, but I don't think you can underestimate sort of the push party leaders and the White House are making to try and get there.\n\nGREENE: What is the push? What is happening behind the scenes?\n\nDAVIS: You know, at this stage, it's really one-on-one meetings. We know that there's an orbit of about four to six senators that are holdouts that have deep concerns about the bill. Vice President Mike Pence has been very personally involved, as has Seema Verma, who is the White House's top Medicaid official. They're trying to figure out what these senators' concerns are and if there's a way to get there. One option they're looking at is putting more money back into the bill to fund Medicaid.\n\nGREENE: Sue, the stakes here feel like they might be higher for this party than just about health care. I mean, is it a stretch to say this is sort of a pressure test on Republicans and their ability to govern?\n\nDAVIS: That's not a stretch at all. You know, Ted Cruz was on Fox News last night, and he talked about the stakes. And this is what he had to say.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nTED CRUZ: If we get this right - if we follow through on Obamacare repeal, it sets this up for this to be the most productive Congress in decades, whereas if we're paralyzed, we could blow an historic opportunity. I don't want us to blow this opportunity.\n\nDAVIS: When he talks about blowing the opportunity, the concern I hear the most from Republicans on Capitol Hill is that if health care collapses - if they cannot deliver on what has been their signature campaign promise, the infighting and the bad blood that it will generate will make it almost impossible for Republicans to move forward on their other legislative priorities. That includes overhauling the tax code and that long-promised infrastructure bill that the president and Republicans and some Democrats in Congress say that they want the most.\n\nGREENE: All at a time, of course, when Republicans have both the White House and Congress, so a lot of pressure on them to actually govern. NPR's congressional correspondent Susan Davis in our studios this morning - Sue, thanks.\n\nDAVIS: Thank you.\n\nCopyright © 2017 NPR. All rights reserved.

Former Rep. John Dingell Dies At 92\n\nFormer Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., the longest-serving member of Congress in history, has died at age 92. The Democrat was an advocate for national health care and the auto industry.\n\nRACHEL MARTIN, HOST:\n\nAnd now we remember the man who served in the U.S. Congress longer than anyone else. John Dingell represented Michigan in the U.S. House starting in 1955, ending in 2014. During that time, he became one of the legislative body's most powerful members. Dingell passed away at the age of 92. Here's NPR national political correspondent Don Gonyea.\n\nDON GONYEA, BYLINE: The numbers alone are jaw-dropping - 59 years in Congress, undefeated in 30 elections, more than 21,000 roll-call votes cast. Here's how Nancy Pelosi described John Dingell as he began retirement at the start of 2015.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nNANCY PELOSI: Every now and then, you hear the expression, somebody is a living legend. That doesn't even begin to describe John Dingell.\n\nGONYEA: That same day, Democratic Congressman Steny Hoyer put it this way.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nSTENY HOYER: When he came to Congress, Americans had Dwight Eisenhower as president. Brooklyn had a champion Dodgers baseball team. And Elvis Presley had his first gold record. But what I will point out is what Americans did not have. Americans did not have the Civil Rights Act or the Voting Rights Act.\n\nGONYEA: Dingell supported both of those landmark pieces of legislation. They were, he said, his most important votes. He also championed the Clean Air and Water acts, Medicaid and Medicare. And like his father, John Dingell Sr., who served before him, he introduced a national health care bill every session he served until the Affordable Care Act came along.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nJOHN DINGELL: I have the curious belief that health care is a right and not a privilege. And I believe that we've waited too long to see to it that that's a reality.\n\nGONYEA: One Democrat in Congress opined that Obamacare should really be called Dingellcare (ph). John Dingell's time in the U.S. House actually predated his election. The son of a congressman, he was working as a page in the House chamber in 1941 when President Roosevelt delivered his famous Day of Infamy speech following the attack on Pearl Harbor. Decades later, Dingell recalled watching FDR that day in leg braces, struggling with the effects of polio as the president moved to the podium to speak.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nDINGELL: So he actually walked. And he was supported by 10 pounds of iron. He had these frames that held him.\n\nGONYEA: When he turned 18, Dingell enlisted but never saw combat in World War II. College and law school followed with help from the G.I. Bill, then a stint as a county prosecutor in Detroit. He came to Congress at age 29, winning a special election in 1955 after his father's death. Dingell rose to the chairmanship of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, wielding great power and commanding great respect. He was a fierce advocate for the U.S. automobile industry. That sometimes put him at odds with environmentalists, though they also applauded his work on conservation, clean air and water and protecting endangered species. Here's Dingell in 2008, when GM and Chrysler were seeking a government rescue amid the financial crisis.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nDINGELL: I'm here to tell you this is too big a disaster for us to invite. Imagine a nation with double-digit unemployment. That's what we're going to be talking about.\n\nGONYEA: Late in his career, John Dingell bemoaned the rise of the Tea Party and the bitter partisanship that he said made compromise so difficult. In the summer of 2014, he spoke at the National Press Club.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nDINGELL: I am sad to leave the Congress. I love the Congress. I will observe that my sadness is ameliorated by the poisonous atmosphere that we see in American politics today.\n\nGONYEA: When John Dingell retired, his wife, Debbie Dingell, won election to his seat, meaning southeast Michigan has been represented by a Dingell in Congress continuously since 1933. With his passing, he leaves a legacy both in terms of legislation and in time of service that may never be equaled. Don Gonyea, NPR News.\n\nCopyright © 2019 NPR. All rights reserved.

News Brief: Boeing 737 Max, Spending Bill, Purdue Pharma Bankruptcy\n\nBoeing will suspend production of 737 Max jets in January. Both parties tout key wins in spending bill. And, Sackler family withdrew billions before Purdue Pharma filed for bankruptcy, records show.\n\nDAVID GREENE, HOST:\n\nBoeing says it will temporarily suspend production of its troubled 737 Max passenger jet beginning next month.\n\nSTEVE INSKEEP, HOST:\n\nYeah. All the Max series aircraft have been grounded for the past nine months. That already happened following two crashes that killed 346 people in Indonesia and Ethiopia.\n\nGREENE: And let's bring in NPR's David Schaper in Chicago, who's been following this story. Hi there, David.\n\nDAVID SCHAPER, BYLINE: Morning.\n\nGREENE: So what's the reasoning behind Boeing's decision here?\n\nSCHAPER: Well, Boeing was facing a couple of hard realities. First is that the Federal Aviation Administration, an agency once accused of being too cozy with Boeing, is now sternly warning Boeing's CEO to stop with the unrealistic expectations for when this plane could be allowed back into service. The agency safety experts will be taking all the time that they need to get their evaluation and analysis done right. And the FAA's head says he won't be rushed into making a decision. And I'm hearing that that means that the plane will likely remain grounded until at least February or March.\n\nThe second hard reality is that Boeing has been burning through cash at a rate of, according to some estimates, about $2 billion a month. The company did slow production a bit back in April, reducing the number of planes produced from 52 a month to 42. But it now has about 400 finished jets just sitting in storage. And it cannot deliver them to customers to get final payment. Richard Aboulafia is an aerospace industry analyst for the Teal Group.\n\nRICHARD ABOULAFIA: It's been really painful for Boeing. They've been maintaining production and not bringing in any revenue. This is very painful from a balance sheet perspective.\n\nGREENE: OK. Painful for the company. What about the people who work for the company? I mean, the 737 Max is built at a plant outside Seattle. There are, like, 12,000 employees working there..\n\nSCHAPER: Yeah.\n\nGREENE: Are they going to be laid off, furloughed? What's going to happen?\n\nSCHAPER: Well, Boeing says no at this point. So the company says it doesn't expect any layoffs for workers at this time anyway. The statement announcing the decision to suspend production says the company plans to have the affected workers continue 737-related work or be temporarily assigned to other plants in the area.\n\nBut there's still a fair amount of anxiety in and around the plant. We had Ashley Gross of our member station KNKX ask around about the impact. And she talked to Veronica Medina, who, with her family, owns a Mexican restaurant called Torero's at a strip mall called the Landing across the street from the huge 737 plant in Renton.\n\nVERONICA MEDINA: Well, obviously being right here at the Landing, it's very significant. We get a lot of lunch crowds. We get, you know - Renton in general very dependent on Boeing's well-being.\n\nSCHAPER: Medina says that even if Boeing employees aren't laid off, if they aren't going in and out of that factory across the street, her business may suffer.\n\nGREENE: But, David, I mean, the reality here is there can be a ripple effect in the economy from a decision like this. I mean, there's a whole supply chain that feeds the production of the Boeing 737 Max, right? I mean, could this have a big economic impact overall?\n\nSCHAPER: Yeah. This is where the shutdown could be felt more deeply. And it won't be so much in Seattle but in places like Wichita, Kan., where Boeing supplier Spirit AeroSystems makes the fuselage and other parts for the 737 Max and in Evendale, Ohio, where CFM International makes the engines for the planes.\n\nThere are hundreds of companies that supply parts to the 737. And Boeing may do something to help soften the blow for them a little bit. But those companies still may be forced to lay off workers. Here again is Richard Aboulafia of the Teal Group.\n\nABOULAFIA: It depends how long it lasts. If we're talking about just a few weeks or a month or two, it's not going to be the end of the world. If this is a three-month stoppage or conceivably even longer, yeah, the broader economy would very definitely feel some pain.\n\nGREENE: So a lot of question about timing here. And you said this could, go, like February, March? Or does anyone really know?\n\nSCHAPER: Yeah, or even longer. It all depends on when the plane is recertified by the FAA. And the FAA wants to work with its counterparts around the world to time the putting the plane back into service.\n\nGREENE: All right. Big decision from Boeing. And our reporting this morning from NPR's David Schaper. David, thanks.\n\nSCHAPER: My pleasure.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)\n\nGREENE: All right. So there's border security funding. There is research to address gun violence, a 3.1% pay raise for people serving in the military and for federal workers. These are just a few of the items that make up this massive $1.3 trillion spending package that Congress has agreed to.\n\nINSKEEP: Lawmakers released details of the deal yesterday and are expected to vote on it today in the House. Both Democrats and Republicans are claiming victory after months of stalled negotiations.\n\nGREENE: And we have NPR congressional correspondent Kelsey Snell in our Washington, D.C., studio. Hey, Kelsey.\n\nKELSEY SNELL, BYLINE: Good morning.\n\nGREENE: OK. So impeachment seems to be dominating a lot of what's happening in Congress. But this bill that they agreed to is really important.\n\nSNELL: Yeah. It's actually two bills. It's two huge packages. And it's the result of months of work. It's based on a spending deal that you may remember that they struck way back in July. And this is actually kind of a really big deal because it would fund the government through the end of September next year. You know, it is one of Congress's core responsibilities to do this. But if you'll remember, they kind of have trouble with it year after year after year (laughter).\n\nGREENE: Yeah.\n\nSNELL: This is more than a thousand pages. And they're going through it really, really quickly. But if you talk to the Appropriations Committee chairwoman, Nita Lowey, she's kind of taking this all in the typical spending negotiator stride of saying, it's just their job.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nNITA LOWEY: The Appropriations Committee is charged with one of Congress's most awesome responsibilities, the power of the purse. I'm proud that we have used that power to make investments that will give every American a better chance at a better life.\n\nSNELL: Now, it's important to remember that the House and Senate still have to pass this. And that's not always been easy in the past. But I'm assured that both sides think that they will be able to get it done. And this was negotiated with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. And people in Congress tell me they believe they have the White House's blessing.\n\nGREENE: OK. But there have been moments of surprise at the last minute...\n\nSNELL: (Laughter) That's true.\n\nGREENE: ...Moments like this in recent years. But for the moment, at least, I mean, you have both parties declaring victory. So let's talk that through. Let's start with Democrats. What are they happy about in this?\n\nSNELL: Well, actually, I think it's important to look at some of these bipartisan things, one of which is raising the age for buying tobacco to 21. And that was negotiated by Democrats and Republicans, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Dick Durbin, one of the top Democrats in the Senate. And they're also repealing three taxes meant to support Obamacare but had been widely panned by both parties.\n\nDemocrats, though, are getting funding - $25 million for gun violence research. And they're saying that this is the first time in 20 years that's happened. And they're also getting $425 million in election security and a big boost in funding for the EPA and opioid response.\n\nGREENE: Now, what are Republicans most excited about?\n\nSNELL: Republicans are celebrating the fact that they got $1.375 billion for border fence funding. That is pretty much even with the amount of money that they have right now. Plus, they get the flexibility to move money around for detention beds for a surge.\n\nGREENE: And then we've got another important vote this week. And that's an annual defense authorization bill, which is going to the Senate. What's happening there?\n\nSNELL: Yeah. This is a really big bill - again, really massive, thousands of pages. And it has some major policy initiatives, including 12 weeks of paid parental leave, which is not necessarily something you'd expect to see in a defense bill, but it's something that both sides are really excited about.\n\nGREENE: OK. NPR congressional correspondent Kelsey Snell covering a lot for us. Thank you, Kelsey.\n\nSNELL: You bet.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)\n\nGREENE: So we're learning more this morning about profits earned by the Sackler family from the sale of OxyContin. That's the controversial opioid drug marketed by their privately owned company, Purdue Pharma.\n\nINSKEEP: The company filed for bankruptcy earlier this year, as we've been reporting. But before bankruptcy, the Sacklers withdrew more than $12 billion into their personal accounts.\n\nGREENE: And let's bring in North Country Public Radio's Brian Mann, who follows opioid litigation for NPR. Hey there, Brian.\n\nBRIAN MANN, BYLINE: Morning, David.\n\nGREENE: So it looks like OxyContin made the Sacklers very, very rich. Remind us just the context here. Why is that so controversial?\n\nMANN: Well, it happened at a time when a lot of Americans were dying as the prescription opioid epidemic was going viral across the United States, ravaging communities. The company, of course, faces thousands of civil lawsuits tied to its alleged role spurring this addiction crisis, legal blowback so big it forced the company into this bankruptcy. But as you said, the Sacklers had already pocketed billions of dollars. And in the end, a lot of that money may not ever be forfeited as part of any settlement.\n\nGREENE: And what's new here is some details that we're learning from a new audit of the company. So what exactly is this?\n\nMANN: Yeah. The data submitted to the bankruptcy court on Monday shows that, in all, members of the family withdrew roughly $12.2 billion from their company. And a review by The New York Times found that this really accelerated. The Sacklers began pulling more and more cash out of the company beginning in 2008 - hundreds of millions of dollars every year. Some of that went to pay taxes, but it also went into their personal trusts. And this is drawing particular scrutiny, David - some of it went into offshore accounts.\n\nGREENE: OK. So they have all of this money, it seems. The family has offered to pay something like $3 billion of this personal wealth to settle opioid claims against Purdue Pharma. But state attorneys general are saying that's simply not enough. Is that right?\n\nMANN: Yeah. That is right. The Sacklers have consistently denied any wrongdoing. But they have offered this bankruptcy deal that would mean them paying out billions of dollars of their cash and giving up control of Purdue Pharma. As part of that, they've asked the bankruptcy court to essentially halt all personal lawsuits against them. They would be out of the opioid business but still one of the richest families in the country because of OxyContin.\n\nAnd the coalition of states are pushing back. They're saying that the Sacklers should first give a full accounting of all their personal holdings, even stuff that's offshore in foreign accounts. And those attorneys general want to claw back more of that cash. And this audit is adding fuel to that argument. New York's Attorney General Letitia James issued a statement last night demanding more detailed financial records. She said she wants full transparency into their total assets.\n\nGREENE: OK. And on its face, this doesn't look very good, either. You have this other part of the bankruptcy process - Purdue Pharma's decision to pay out these big bonuses to executives in the company. I mean, what is the court saying about that? Are they going to allow that to happen?\n\nMANN: They are. Judge Robert Drain agreed earlier this month to let the company pay roughly $35 million in bonuses this year to employees. The argument from Purdue Pharma that the court accepted is that key staff, you know, people in the company, needed to keep the firm operating during this turbulent time. Those folks just won't stay on if they're not well-compensated. But, of course, David, that money that's being paid out is money that will never be paid to victims or to communities.\n\nGREENE: Brian Mann covers opioid litigation for NPR. Brian, we appreciate it, as always. Thanks a lot.\n\nMANN: You bet, David.\n\nCopyright © 2019 NPR. All rights reserved.

Planned Parenthood's Cecile Richards Talks 'Finding The Courage To Lead'\n\nThe Planned Parenthood president reflects on her upbringing and career in her new memoir Make Trouble. NPR's Michel Martin talks to her about her time at the helm of the organization.\n\nMICHEL MARTIN, HOST:\n\nAs president of Planned Parenthood Federation of America, Cecile Richards has been at the center of the fight over abortion rights and women's health care for the last dozen years. She was born into that world. Her father was a civil rights attorney. Her mother was the trailblazer, Ann Richards, who served as governor of Texas in the 1990s. Cecile Richards kept up the tradition devoting her adult life to activism from union organizing to working closely with House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi You'll find it all in her new memoir, Make Trouble: Standing Up, Speaking Out, And Finding The Courage To Lead.\n\nThe book arrives as Cecile Richards has announced she will step down as president of Planned Parenthood after 12 years. In the middle of this big move, Cecile Richards joined us from our bureau in New York to talk about her career. And I started by asking her if she thinks her tenure as president of Planned Parenthood has been a success.\n\nCECILE RICHARDS: During this last year of trying to defund Planned Parenthood, we've been at our highest approval rate ever. In fact, I just saw a poll from Fox News, of all places, saying that they had polled all the political entities in the country and Planned Parenthood was the most popular. So, I think that in an interesting way all of the controversy has actually led people to focus more on what we do and how important this work is. And, of course, abortion rights and the access to safe and legal abortion, the support for that in the country is stronger than ever before.\n\nMARTIN: Why is this the time to step down?\n\nRICHARDS: Well, it's always hard to leave. I'll be honest, I've been doing this for 12 years. But one of my commitments as a organizer is to always bring new people into the field and certainly into Planned Parenthood. And I have met, and we've hired, and have worked with some amazing leaders in the reproductive rights and justice movement, and one of the important things I think about a leader, is knowing when it's time to step aside and give over the reins to someone else. And so I decided to do that.\n\nAnd I think that the organization is as strong as it's ever been, more support than we've ever had. And I'll never leave the field. Even if I'm not the president Planned Parenthood, this is my life - Is social justice and working for the rights of all people and I'll continue to do that in some way just not as the president of Planned Parenthood. And that's, OK.\n\nMARTIN: One of the things you talk about in the book is your work with House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi. Some Democrats, including the newly elected Conor Lamb, who was recently elected in Pennsylvania special election, are saying it's time for her to step down. I mean, as a person who's worked closely with her and has been another - I mean, you are, like her, another essential woman in public life. Do you think it might be time for her to step aside as well?\n\nRICHARDS: I actually think that one of the interesting things about Nancy Pelosi - and I do talk about it in the book because so much is, I think, not known and she doesn't - she's not out there bragging about it is that, the reason why I think the Republican Party and the leadership goes after her so much is because she is the most powerful elected official in Washington D.C. And I say that having spent a lot of time up there.\n\nYou know, when I went to work for Ms. Pelosi when she just became a leader - or she was actually at that point the whip, she actually whipped the caucus against the Iraq War and got a majority of the Democrats to vote against the Iraq War. She was the lead sponsor of and the reason why we got the Affordable Care Act or Obamacare, and I was right there alongside with her in the final hours, in the final days to make sure that got passed. I just think she is really one of the most underestimated elected leaders in the country. And I don't think it's just by chance that she's a woman.\n\nMARTIN: There's a record number of women running for office this year. And a lot of them are running in very difficult districts. I mean, that are not favorably inclined toward them. And as a person who not only grew up watching a woman run under very difficult circumstances I mean she is the last elected governor - Democratic governor of Texas, lest we forget. So I guess what I'm saying is you saw it up close from little, you know, how hard this life can be, and you've lived it. I mean, up to and including not just, you know, online death threats but real ones.\n\nI'm wondering if you have advice for other women in public life? And I'm focusing on women in particular just because we know that a lot of women feel that they are running then exposes their children to things that they don't necessarily want them exposed to. You know, what I'm saying? It can be very personal in the way that women are attacked in a way that men are not necessarily. I mean, their appearance their clothing...\n\nRICHARDS: Everything.\n\nMARTIN: ...Everything, their hair, their health. So do you think you have some advice for women who are thinking about this and who are going through this, who are experiencing this now, whatever side of the political aisle they're on?\n\nRICHARDS: Right. Well, I think, look, one of the things that we saw - and this was definitely true in mom's race for governor, and I write about this is that no one ever thought Ann Richards could be elected governor. Everything was going against her. You know, she was divorced. She was a recovering alcoholic. She was a Democrat. She was progressive. She was pro-choice. But actually, that campaign was just your classic example of defying all the odds. And it really was this enormous, sort of, outpouring of grassroots, activity, and energy that pushed her over the top. And so I think we're seeing a lot of that today. I'm sorry mom isn't around to experience this. We're now seeing women win races that no one thought they could win.\n\nYou know, I was in Virginia during the race where the first transgender woman ever won a state, you know, state assembly seat. Even in Texas, the first two Latina congresswomen, I believe, will go to Washington this year as a result of this. And the exciting thing to me is that women are not waiting their turn. They're not waiting for permission. They're not waiting to be asked. They're just running. And I as I say, like, start before you're ready. Even if you don't make it the first time, you will eventually.\n\nAnd there's nothing that's going to be better for our democracy than to have a Congress and have legislatures and governors that actually represent the diversity of this country. As I say, I can't wait until Congress - half of Congress can get pregnant so we can quit fighting about birth control and Planned Parenthood. And I think those days are ahead of us.\n\nMARTIN: Before we let you go, you know I have to ask - you running?\n\nRICHARDS: (Laughter) You know what? Never say never. But that's not my plan. I'm really focused right now on, you know, finishing up at Planned Parenthood and then doing everything I can to get every single woman in this country to go to the polls and vote this November. If we do, we're going to change the direction of America.\n\nMARTIN: That's Cecile Richards. She is the outgoing president of Planned Parenthood. We're talking about her new memoir, Make Trouble: Standing Up, Speaking Out, And Finding The Courage To Lead. She was kind of to join us from our bureau in New York. Cecile Richards, thanks so much for speaking with us.\n\nRICHARDS: Thanks, Michel.\n\nCopyright © 2018 NPR. All rights reserved.

Donald Trump Releases Details Of Health Care Plan\n\nDonald Trump has promised to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, and now he has released some more details of how he would do that on his website.\n\nAUDIE CORNISH, HOST:\n\nLast night, Donald Trump released details of his health plan. No surprise - he wants to repeal Obamacare. NPR's Alison Kodjak reports that the other proposals on Trump's website include many Republican favorites and some that both liberals and conservatives find troubling.\n\nALISON KODJAK, BYLINE: When Trump was asked about his health care proposal in the debate last week broadcast on CNN, this is mostly what he talked about.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nDONALD TRUMP: We have to get rid of the lines around the states so that there's serious, serious competition.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MODERATOR: But Mr...\n\nKODJAK: What he meant was that he wants to allow insurance companies to sell policies across state lines. It's a popular idea among Republicans, but beyond that, Trump was criticized because he had little more to offer. Now that's changed. The Trump campaign has posted a seven-point health plan on his website. It includes getting rid of those lines around the states, and it adds a handful of other provisions that are mainstays in conservative health care circles. Joe Antos is a scholar at the right-leaning American Enterprise Institute.\n\nJOE ANTOS: He mentions things that, depending on how you interpret them, could really fit well within traditional Republican views.\n\nKODJAK: Among those items, Trump calls for people to deduct their health insurance premiums from their taxes and use tax-free health savings accounts to pay for out-of-pocket costs. He proposes changes to Medicaid, the government health insurance for the poor and disabled. He'd give a fixed amount of money to each state rather than using today's cost-sharing formulas. Trump's plan leaves a lot up to interpretation. Antos likes the tax provision because he's assuming Trump would ensure they be structured to benefit low-income people, but other conservatives see it differently. Jeffrey Anderson is a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute. He looks at the proposals for deducting premiums and health savings accounts and sees a huge giveaway.\n\nJEFFREY ANDERSON: It creates a new tax loophole by providing an open-ended tax break on the individual side.\n\nKODJAK: Anderson agrees with Trump's goal to repeal the Affordable Care Act, but her worries about Medicaid. Trump's plan says, quote, we must review basic options for Medicaid and work with the states to ensure that those who want health care coverage can have it. Anderson says that sounds to him like a huge Medicaid expansion. That's the conservative discussion. Liberals are interpreting Trump in yet another way. Igor Volsky is deputy director of the American Progress Action Fund. He says Trump wants to simply ditch Obamacare.\n\nIGOR VOLSKY: It gets rid of Obamacare but doesn't talk about coverage expansion, doesn't talk about cost controls. And so we're left in the world where a lot of people are losing the coverage they currently have under Obamacare and they don't actually get anything in return.\n\nKODJAK: We asked the Trump campaign to clarify some of these provisions. A spokeswoman said via email, quote, the plan speaks for itself. Alison Kodjak, NPR News.\n\nCopyright © 2016 NPR. All rights reserved.

Trump Administration Suspends Insurance Payments Under Affordable Care Act\n\nMichel Martin speaks with New Mexico Health Connections founder, Dr. Martin Hickey and Wall Street Journal reporter Anna Mathews about the suspension of billions of dollars in payments to encourage insurers to participate in Obamacare.\n\nMICHEL MARTIN, HOST:\n\nThe Trump administration plans to suspend billions of dollars in payments that had been expected by health insurers under the Affordable Care Act or Obamacare. The administration said Saturday that this is necessary to comply with a judge's order that found the formula for distributing the payments was flawed. Now, these are so-called risk adjustment payments paid by insurers to other insurers to help fund sicker patients who cost more to insure. Health insurers say, without the money, the health insurance market will be disrupted, premiums could rise and fewer plans could be available.\n\nWe're joined now by Dr. Martin Hickey. He's founder of the cooperative health plan New Mexico Health Connections, which sued the government over the payments. We reached him in Albuquerque.\n\nDr. Hickey, thanks so much for speaking with us.\n\nMARTIN HICKEY: Happy to do so.\n\nMARTIN: Your organization sued because you view the way the money was distributed as unfair. Can you try to help us understand this?\n\nHICKEY: Yes. Essentially, what it comes down to is that the formula that the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services chose to implement favors large and established plans. Under the ACA, CMS was directed to administer the exchange and also to institute the co-ops to develop more competition. And, since its inception, these large, established plans have been the vast receiver of these monies, and small plans and new plans have had to pay out lots of money and, in fact, has been a major factor in forcing 19 co-ops to go out of business since they were developed by the ACA back in 2014.\n\nSo we think this is actually very good for consumers because it will allow more new entrants to come into the marketplace. And, as we know, the more competition, the lower the prices, so we view this as a very beneficial ruling for consumers throughout the United States.\n\nMARTIN: I'm glad you raised that because I understand that your intention in bringing this suit was to see the formula adjusted in a way that you considered to be more fair. But were you concerned or are you now concerned that the administration won't restore this money at all and that no health plans will be funded under the program? Now, some advocates or activists are saying that this is a way to sabotage the Affordable Care Act. I mean, the administration and many Republicans in Congress have made no secret of their desire to scrap it and start over. So are you concerned that there might be no money being distributed at all?\n\nHICKEY: What I would like to see is for this to play out in the courts if necessary. I would be concerned if CMS did not address and change the formula so that it was fair to all health plans that participate in the exchange.\n\nMARTIN: That was Dr. Martin Hickey. He's founder of the cooperative health plan New Mexico Health Connections. We reached him in Albuquerque. Dr. Hickey, thanks so much for joining us.\n\nHICKEY: Thank you.\n\nMARTIN: Now, we wanted to get a sense of what this would mean for the health insurance marketplace more broadly, so we've called Anna Wilde Mathews, a reporter at The Wall Street Journal who broke the story. She's with us now.\n\nAnna, thanks so much for joining us as well.\n\nANNA WILDE MATHEWS: Thank you.\n\nMARTIN: So tell us a little bit more about the program - how it has worked to this point.\n\nMATHEWS: The program involves moving money around among insurers. The idea is that insurers that enroll a lot of healthy people who are not going to be very costly pay into the program. And those that enroll a lot of people who have a lot of health conditions and maybe have higher claims costs are supposed to receive money out of the program. The point is to make sure that there's no incentive for insurers to seek out only healthy people.\n\nMARTIN: How much do the major health plans rely on these funds?\n\nMATHEWS: Well, it's a zero-sum game, so some pay into it and some receive money out of it. For 2016, for instance, the money involved in the program represented approximately 11 percent of the premiums in the individual market. So that's a large percentage of the market and a meaningful sum. For the 2017 plan year, which are the payments that would've been going out this fall, the total was going to be about $10.4 billion.\n\nMARTIN: So what will the suspension of this program mean for insurers and for members and what they pay for premiums? Do we have any sense of that?\n\nMATHEWS: The insurers that are currently in the marketplace are complaining that the announcement creates a great deal of uncertainty for them right now. It's very vague about exactly how long the suspension could be or what could trigger the end to it. It's vague about how it will play out in the future. So that creates a lot of uncertainty at a time when insurers are currently making decisions about rates and offerings for the Affordable Care Act plans for 2019.\n\nMARTIN: And I note in your story that the administrator of the program, Seema Verma, said in a statement that the administration is disappointed by the court's recent ruling. But it's also true that this is an administration that has not been supportive of the Affordable Care Act. Do you think that the administration is, in fact, going to try to adjust the formula and release these funds at some point?\n\nMATHEWS: It's not clear that they have legal authority to simply end the program. The judge in the New Mexico case disagreed with a factor of the formula that was used to implement the program, but I don't believe that his ruling implied that the entire program was unacceptable or the concept behind the program was unacceptable. And the program is part of the law. It's hard to tell how this will play out. The insurers too are not clear.\n\nMARTIN: That's Anna Wilde Mathews. She's a reporter for The Wall Street Journal.\n\nAnna, thanks so much for speaking with us.\n\nMATHEWS: Thank you.\n\nCopyright © 2018 NPR. All rights reserved.

How Is The Shutdown Affecting America? Let Us Count The Ways\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Michael Brochstein/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images Michael Brochstein/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images\n\nUpdated Jan. 10 at 3:50 p.m. ET\n\nThe U.S. government has been operating under a partial shutdown since Dec. 22. The shutdown, driven by a political battle over President Trump's demand that Congress approve funds for a wall along the border with Mexico, is touching the lives of Americans in myriad ways.\n\nNine federal departments (and some smaller agencies like NASA) are affected, at least in part, by the lapse in funding: Agriculture, Commerce, Justice, Homeland Security, Housing and Urban Development, Interior, State, Transportation and the Treasury. Approximately 800,000 federal workers have been furloughed or are being required to work without pay.\n\nCongress had already passed appropriations bills funding about three-quarters of the federal government, including Health and Human Services and Veterans Affairs, so those departments and agencies remain operational.\n\nLots of important things are not affected by this shutdown: Medicare, Medicaid, and the Health Insurance Marketplace (aka Obamacare). Social Security, disability checks and veterans' benefits. Getting a passport. And the U.S. Postal Service, an independent agency whose operations are funded by sales of postage and services, not taxes, keeps delivering mail.\n\nBut other aspects of American life have become complicated, scarce or messy since the shutdown started. Here's a look at how it's affecting the country.\n\nAir safety\n\nThe Transportation Security Administration is part of the Department of Homeland Security. Many of its workers are considered essential, so many are working without pay — though a greater number than usual have been calling in sick. So far, lines at airport security have not been significantly longer.\n\nTSA employees are among the lowest-paid federal workers.\n\nIf there's no check on the 26th, I have no idea what we're going to do, 36-year-old Jacinda, whose husband is a TSA officer in Portland, told NPR. Our rent is due, the electric bill is due, our cellphones are now past due. ... I'm scared and I'm trying to be OK because I can't be sad every day for my kids, and I can't be stressed out because it affects how I parent. She said her husband is stressed out too — and that he has been given instructions on how to file for unemployment, though he's still working 40 hours a week.\n\nAlso affected: air traffic controllers, who are working unpaid.\n\nIt's a very high-stress job and you need to be on your game at all times, says Mick Devine of the National Air Traffic Controllers Association. There is a concern that as this goes on, the human factors aspect of this shutdown will take a toll on the psyche and concentration level of our members.\n\nMany planes are not being inspected and pilot training is not being certified, says Capt. Dennis Tajer, a pilot for American Airlines and a spokesman for the Allied Pilots Association.\n\nThat's because many of the FAA safety inspectors aren't working.\n\nWe are able to maintain a margin of safety and security, but every day another player is pulled off the field and it comes some point where the game cannot be played properly, Tajer told NPR.\n\nWe are another layer of safety, inspector Troy Tomey told the Miami Herald. We're the last check of the box. Taking us out of it, mistakes can happen.\n\nFood inspection\n\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration furloughed about 40 percent of its staff since the government shutdown. FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb said that the agency has suspended all routine inspections of food processing facilities in the U.S., The Washington Post reports. He said he hopes to be able to bring inspectors to high-risk facilities as early as next week.\n\nThat puts our food supply at risk, Sarah Sorscher with the Center for Science in the Public Interest says in a statement. Regular inspections, which help stop foodborne illness before people get sick, are vital.\n\nFood stamps\n\nThe Department of Agriculture has announced it will continue to fund SNAP (food stamps) through February. The USDA says it can keep paying SNAP benefits up to 30 days beyond the expiration of the most recent government funding resolution. That means SNAP recipients will actually get their February benefits early, on or before that spending authority expires on Jan. 20. About 1 in 10 Americans relies at least partly on SNAP benefits to buy food.\n\nThe USDA's other major nutrition assistance programs have enough funding to continue operations into February.\n\nScientific research\n\nClimate scientists from all over the world are meeting in Vancouver this month, as the lead authors of the next international climate science report. But at least seven U.S. climate scientists who were supposed to help write it aren't there — scientists for NOAA, NASA and other federal agencies can't work or travel for work because of the shutdown.\n\nAir-quality monitoring is also affected: The Environmental Protection Agency manages sensors all over the country that detect various kinds of air pollution, such as ozone, industrial chemicals and smog. Usually, this data is released to the public right away, but because the EPA isn't operating at full strength, that's not happening. Air sensors run by state agencies and private institutions are still working, however.\n\nCoast Guard\n\nWhile the other branches of the military are part of the Defense Department, the Coast Guard falls under Homeland Security. After some maneuvering, the government found a way to pay its military members on Dec. 31. The nearly 42,000 active duty members of the Coast Guard are still working, as they are considered essential personnel, but it's not clear whether they will get a paycheck on Jan. 15.\n\nFormer Coast Guard Commandant Thad Allen described a wide range of operations that continue during the shutdown: search and rescues along the nation's coastlines, efforts to stop drug smugglers, even the piloting of an icebreaker to Antarctica to break the ice around McMurdo Station.\n\nI think it's pretty bad, Allen told NPR. I think when you have people providing emergency services to this country without pay, I think we ought to take a serious look at how we're governed.\n\nNative American communities\n\nThe shutdown has meant that 2,295 of the Bureau of Indian Affairs' 4,057 employees are subject to furlough. Phone calls to the bureau go unanswered.\n\nThe Indian Health Service, which is funded by Interior, provides health services for approximately 2.2 million of the nation's estimated 3.7 million American Indians and Alaska Natives. Most of its funds are appropriated for Native Americans who live on or near reservations in the western U.S., though some funding goes to those who live in urban areas.\n\nAnd the IHS is being hit especially hard by the lapse in funding. As NPR has reported, its only services that can continue are those that meet immediate needs of the patients, medical staff, and medical facilities.\n\nIHS clinics are open during the shutdown and many staffers are reporting for work because they're considered essential, but they aren't being paid. Grants to support tribal health programs and preventive health clinics are currently suspended.\n\nImmigration courts and enforcement\n\nThe country's immigration courts are closed, and they already had a huge backlog even before the shutdown. Member station KPCC/LAist reported last month that Los Angeles alone had fewer than 40 judges and nearly 74,000 pending cases.\n\nWith the courts now closed, the people who were due in court have their cases moved to the back of the line and must have them rescheduled, which could add two or three years to their wait.\n\nIt's not like when we come back, we can absorb the cases, Judge A. Ashley Tabaddor, president of the National Association of Immigration Judges, told KPCC/LAist. There's no magical way to tell thousands of people to just come to their court hearings two weeks later so that the ones that were not heard can be heard.\n\nThe shutdown has also halted E-Verify, a federal program that aims to prevent immigrants from working in the U.S. illegally.\n\nThere's an irony there, Julie Pace, an attorney specializing in employment and immigration law at the Cavanagh Law Firm in Phoenix, told NPR. We have an electronic wall for E-Verify that should be being used, that the government has not funded.\n\nFederal courts\n\nThe federal judiciary continues to operate during the shutdown, using court fee balances and other funds. Its employees are reporting to work and remain fully paid, and it estimates it has enough money to sustain paid operations until Jan. 18.\n\nIf the funds run out before new appropriations are received, essential work in the federal courts will continue. Each court would determine the staff necessary to support its mission critical work, the judiciary said in a statement on Jan. 7. In response to requests by the Department of Justice, some federal courts have issued orders suspending, postponing, or holding in abeyance civil cases in which the government is a party for a limited period, subject to further consideration, or until appropriated funds become available.\n\nCriminal cases are expected to continue without interruption.\n\nThe arts\n\nAfter staying open for the first few days of the shutdown, the museums and institutions that make up the Smithsonian have all closed.\n\nThe National Endowment for the Arts says it will honor its fiscal year 2019 grants and that it's currently accepting applications for 2020, though during the shutdown, nobody is working at the agency to answer any questions.\n\nAnd some arts organizations receive federal grants on a reimbursement basis, which means they aren't sure when they will get back the money they paid upfront.\n\nAs you can imagine, any nonprofit cultural organization struggles with cash flow, as they really need to expend funds before funds are received, Dorothy Ryan, managing director of Brooklyn theater company Theatre for a New Audience, told NPR. And the question about when the National Endowment for the Arts will be distributing funds really hits home for us.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Mario Tama/Getty Images Mario Tama/Getty Images\n\nNational parks\n\nMany national parks have stayed open through the shutdown, though without staff or servicing. While in some places other parties have stepped in to help — state or local governments, tourist bureaus, or volunteer groups — not all is well.\n\nTwo weeks into the shutdown, NPS announced it will dip into entrance fee funds to pay for staff and service at some parks — an unprecedented and controversial move, as entrance fees are earmarked for visitor services, not operations and basic maintenance.\n\nAt California's Joshua Tree National Park, which has stayed open without rangers, visitors drove off-road through parkland, creating new, unsanctioned roads, and destroyed some of the park's Joshua trees. After first saying the park would close on Jan. 10, the NPS reversed course and announced that by using fee revenue, Joshua Tree will remain open with additional staff to deal with sanitation issues and protection of park resources.\n\nFormer NPS Director Jonathan Jarvis believes the national parks have been kept open to avoid the public outcry that occurred over their closure during the 2013 shutdown. In an opinion piece for The Guardian, he warns of an array of ugly consequences of leaving the parks open: human waste in waterways, overflowing trash attracting wildlife and increasing human/bear encounters, poaching, artifact theft, and damage to fragile natural features.\n\nOne site where you can find NPS rangers during the shutdown? The tower of the Old Post Office – the building leased to the Trump International Hotel. The building is owned by the General Services Administration. As NPR reports, the rangers were furloughed when the shutdown began. But then the GSA found some money to pay their salary, and the rangers returned.\n\nRep. Betty McCollum, incoming chair of a House subcommittee that oversees the NPS, told NPR that she has a lot of questions about the arrangement: The fact that it's a short-term agreement, the fact that it was a scramble to do it during a government shutdown, just has all the makings of, you know, why did this happen? Is it legal? Is it ethical?\n\nOil and gas drilling\n\nThe oil and gas business is booming, but much of that drilling is on federal lands and operators worry about a slowdown, Cooper McKim of Wyoming Public Media reports. The Bureau of Land Management says it is still processing online applications to drill; however, it's not clear what's actually happening with those.\n\nCompanies are waiting for leases, said Kathleen Sgamma of the Western Energy Alliance, a group of oil and gas companies. If you don't have the full lease hold, it's hard to do the exploratory work or full development work you're planning on.\n\nThat could be significant in Wyoming, where taxes from oil and gas make up a third of state revenue. More oil and gas lease sales are slated for February and March, but some in the industry worry that if the shutdown drags on, they won't happen.\n\nOne place the shutdown isn't slowing proposed drilling projects is Alaska. BLM is moving ahead with holding public meetings about oil and gas drilling leasing in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, Alaska Public Media reports. The bureau is part of Interior, one of the departments affected by the shutdown.\n\nRaúl Grijalva, the Democratic chairman of the House Committee on Natural Resources, wrote a letter to the acting secretary of the Interior, asking how these hearings are happening while so many other essential services remain shut down.\n\nBLM told Alaska Public Media that it's using funds from the previous fiscal year to continue working.\n\nThe District of Columbia\n\nWashington, D.C.'s courts are funded through the federal government, and its marriage bureau has been shuttered, leaving some engaged couples in the lurch. So the D.C. Council just passed the LOVE Act (Let Our Vows Endure Emergency Amendment Act of 2019) to give D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser the authority to grant marriage licenses during the shutdown. (As member station WAMU/DCist notes, divorces and trials have continued.)\n\nThe federal government is also the largest customer of DC Water — and it told the utility company it wouldn't be paying $5 million of its quarterly bill during the shutdown, WAMU's Jacob Fenston reports. The DC Water board members joked about how to handle this big unpaid bill, perhaps by turning off the water at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave.\n\nWater is leverage, says DC Water spokesperson Vincent Morris. No one wants to go without it.\n\nColin Dwyer, Elizabeth Blair, Greg Myre, David Schaper, Rhitu Chatterjee, Philip Ewing, Dan Charles, Joel Rose, Rebecca Hersher, Cooper McKim, Ian Stewart, Marisa Peñaloza, Peter Overby, and Shefali Luthra contributed to this report.
Trump Expected To Strike An Optimistic Tone In State Of The Union Speech\n\nTuesday night, President Trump's State of the Union address is expected to stress the economic growth that the United States has experienced in the last year.\n\nSTEVE INSKEEP, HOST:\n\nKelsey Snell, as a reporter who covers Congress, do you get all excited when you have a State of the Union speech coming?\n\nKELSEY SNELL, BYLINE: Well, I would say it is an interesting display of...\n\nINSKEEP: Interesting...\n\nSNELL: Yes.\n\nINSKEEP: That's an interesting choice of words. All right.\n\nSNELL: ...Of the way that Congress and the president interact, because honestly, we don't get to see this kind of in-person interaction very often. It's when you see an inauguration or addresses like these.\n\nINSKEEP: They will virtually all be in the same room. They'll shake hands and so forth - pats on the back in the way in, the way out. Kelsey Snell, by the way, is NPR's congressional reporter, and she's here on the morning of the State of the Union speech. Is Congress - the people in the - that room - are they ready to work with this president?\n\nSNELL: Well, they are looking for guidance from this president. The State of the Union is typically a governing document, an opportunity for a president to set an agenda for the year going forward. And Congress right now doesn't have much of a map for the year going forward. They need to get some basic governing, like passing spending bills, done, and they need to do immigration. But after that, there's not a lot on their agenda that they are really planning for, and this speech could help.\n\nINSKEEP: Oh, because Republicans tried to repeal Obamacare - didn't work out. They've passed a big tax bill. Not a lot of other big ideas that seem passable are out there.\n\nSNELL: Right. There is some conversation about doing an infrastructure bill, but we don't know exactly what that would involve. And that's a difficult and expensive thing to try to do in an election year.\n\nINSKEEP: We're talking here about substance, but what about style? How much does that matter with a televised speech like this?\n\nSNELL: It says a lot to the people watching it, and it says a lot to the people in the room about the way the president views the year going forward and the year he's just had. And it conveys exactly how the president plans to campaign. This - again, it's an election year, and he's going to be working with many of - particularly, the Republicans in this room to try to keep Republican control of Congress. And the tone does a lot for that.\n\nINSKEEP: I'm glad you mention Republican control of Congress. Of course, Democrats'll be on one side of the room, Republicans on the other side. How many of those Republicans are going to be in that room, worried about their jobs?\n\nSNELL: Well, a good number of them. We've already seen a huge number of retirements, particularly among House Republicans. And we are going to watch them see whether or not this is a president they want to run with or run against. Now, that's an ongoing conversation they are having with themselves and within their districts. But a big speech like this where the president is speaking directly to the American people can help establish what his relationship is like with those voters in those districts and in those states.\n\nINSKEEP: Of course, it is the president's speech, but Democrats get a chance to respond. How will they respond?\n\nSNELL: This year, there are five that I count right now - responses.\n\nINSKEEP: Five responses.\n\nSNELL: Yes. So you have your...\n\nINSKEEP: So it's like microblogging for each individual audience - microtargeting, yeah.\n\nSNELL: Well, yeah, there is - that is a lot of what's going on here, and it says a lot about how Democrats view their chances to rebut this president and to speak to this president throughout a campaign year. Got the two more traditional responses - one is from a House member, Joe Kennedy, and the other is from a Virginia delegate, Elizabeth Guzman, who won as big 17 - 2017 sweep. She'll be doing the response in Spanish.\n\nINSKEEP: Oh, the Virginia Democrats won a lot of elections, so...\n\nSNELL: They did. The rest of those speeches, though, are really getting to the left of the center of the party. We're going to see Senator Bernie Sanders doing an address for the progressives, Maxine Waters, who kind of became internet famous in her - a back-and-forth with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin when she was reclaiming her time. She's going to be on BET. And former Congresswoman Donna Edwards will do one for the progressive Working Families.\n\nINSKEEP: Kelsey Snell, always a pleasure when you come by. Thanks very much.\n\nSNELL: Thank you.\n\nINSKEEP: NPR's Kelsey Snell.\n\nCopyright © 2018 NPR. All rights reserved.

Texas Judge Rules Affordable Care Act Unconstitutional, But Supporters Vow To Appeal\n\nA federal district court judge in Texas has threatened the future of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nJudge Reed C. O'Connor struck down the law, siding with a group of 18 Republican state attorneys general and two GOP governors who brought the case. O'Connor said the tax bill passed by Congress in December 2017 effectively rendered the entire health law unconstitutional.\n\nThat tax measure eliminated the penalty for not having insurance. An earlier Supreme Court decision upheld the ACA based on the view that the penalty was a tax and thus the law was valid because it relied on appropriate power allowed Congress under the Constitution. O'Connor's decision said that without that penalty, the law no longer met that Constitutional test.\n\nIn some ways, the question before the Court involves the intent of both the 2010 and 2017 Congresses, O'Connor wrote in his 55-page decision. The former enacted the ACA. The latter sawed off the last leg it stood on.\n\nThe decision came just hours before the end of open enrollment for ACA plans in most states that use the federal HealthCare.gov insurance exchange. It is not expected that the ruling will affect the coverage for those people. The final decision isn't likely to be made until the case reaches the Supreme Court again.\n\nThe 16 Democratic state attorneys general who intervened in the case to defend the health law immediately vowed to appeal.\n\nThe ACA has already survived more than 70 unsuccessful repeal attempts and withstood scrutiny in the Supreme Court, said a statement from Xavier Becerra of California. Today's misguided ruling will not deter us: our coalition will continue to fight in court for the health and wellbeing of all Americans.\n\nIt is all but certain the case will become the third time the Supreme Court decides a constitutional question related to the ACA. In addition to upholding the law in 2012, the court rejected another challenge to the law in 2015.\n\nIt is hard to overstate what would happen to the nation's health care system if the decision is ultimately upheld. The Affordable Care Act touched almost every aspect of health care, including Medicare and Medicaid, generic biologic drugs, the Indian Health Service, and public health changes like calorie counts on menus.\n\nThe case, Texas v United States, was filed in February. The plaintiffs argued that because the Supreme Court upheld the ACA in 2012 as a constitutional use of its taxing power, the elimination of the tax makes the rest of the law unconstitutional.\n\nIn June, the Justice Department announced it would not fully defend the law in court. While the Trump administration said it did not agree with the plaintiffs that the tax law meant the entire ACA was unconstitutional, it said that the provisions of the law guaranteeing that people with preexisting health conditions could purchase coverage at the same price as everyone else were so inextricably linked to the tax penalty that they should be struck.\n\nThe administration urged the court to declare those provisions invalid beginning Jan. 1, 2019. That is the day the tax penalty for not having insurance disappears.\n\nThe protections for people with preexisting conditions was one of the top health issues in the midterm elections earlier in November. While the issue mostly played to the advantage of Democrats, one of the Republican plaintiffs, Missouri Attorney General Josh Hawley, defeated Democratic incumbent Sen. Claire McCaskill. Another plaintiff, West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey, lost to Democratic incumbent Sen. Joe Manchin.\n\nPresident Donald Trump was quick to take a victory lap, and pressed Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and the presumed incoming House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., to fix the problem. The president tweeted Friday night: As I predicted all along, Obamacare has been struck down as an UNCONSTITUTIONAL disaster! Now Congress must pass a STRONG law that provides GREAT healthcare and protects pre-existing conditions. Mitch and Nancy, get it done!\n\nBut congressional leaders were quick to point out that the suit is far from over.\n\nThe ruling seems to be based on faulty legal reasoning and hopefully it will be overturned, said a statement from Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y.\n\nMany legal experts agreed with that assessment. This is insanity in print, and it will not stand up on appeal, tweeted University of Michigan Law School Professor Nicholas Bagley, an expert in health law.\n\nEven some conservatives were left scratching their heads. Congress acted last year to repeal the mandate, but leave everything else in place and the courts should have deferred to that, tweeted former congressional GOP aide Chris Jacobs.\n\nKaiser Health News, a nonprofit news service, is an editorially independent program of the Kaiser Family Foundation, and not affiliated with Kaiser Permanente.
Coronavirus Will Likely Change The Nature Of U.S. Political Debate\n\nWith Congress taking unprecedented measures to respond to the coronavirus pandemic and a deep economic shock to the country, the crisis is poised to deeply reshape political dynamics in the U.S.\n\nNOEL KING, HOST:\n\nThis pandemic could permanently change the way we live. There will almost certainly be more handwashing and more telework in the future. But could it also cause lasting political and policy changes? National political correspondent Mara Liasson has some answers.\n\nMARA LIASSON, BYLINE: There are a lot of people who think the pandemic could reshape politics in profound ways.\n\nANNE-MARIE SLAUGHTER: This crisis is a time machine to the future.\n\nLIASSON: Anne-Marie Slaughter, CEO of the New America think tank, was the former director of policy planning at the Obama State Department.\n\nSLAUGHTER: I think we'll look back and see that this was like the Great Depression or a war and that created political space to make big policy change that seemed just too hard even two months ago.\n\nLIASSON: Big policy changes that could rearrange traditional political divisions. Now that Republicans in the Senate have voted unanimously for policies they've opposed in the past, like paid sick leave, a guaranteed minimum income, student debt relief, protections for renters and for gig economy workers. Of course, this massive package of federal help for ordinary people is only temporary, but Slaughter says it has the potential to permanently change the political debate.\n\nSLAUGHTER: Suddenly, in a crisis like this, people realize across the political spectrum that unless we can provide a floor, the whole economy can crash - that paid sick leave is not about coddling workers. It's about making sure that sick workers don't come to work and infect others. People are equally realizing if workers have no money to spend, the economy can't function.\n\nLIASSON: Democrats have advocated many of these policies for decades. But now that Congress has approved the largest federal intervention in the economy since the creation of Medicare, they see a new opportunity to push for big investments in modern digital infrastructure, like 5G, a better public health system, universal health insurance that doesn't disappear when you lose your job and a stronger social safety net.\n\nAs he endorsed Joe Biden last week, former President Barack Obama was making this argument.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nBARACK OBAMA: The vast inequalities created by the new economy are easier to see now, but they existed long before this pandemic hit. Health professionals, teachers and delivery drivers, grocery clerks, cleaners - the people who truly make our economy run, they've always been essential. And for years, too many of the people who do the essential work of this country have been underpaid, financially stressed and given too little support.\n\nLIASSON: Democrats aren't the only ones who see a political opportunity in the pandemic. The nationalist populist wing of the Republican Party that's been warning about the dangers of globalization has also gotten a boost, says conservative J.D. Vance, the author of Hillbilly Elegy.\n\nJD VANCE: One of the core arguments of the Trump 2016 campaign is that in our supply chains in our manufacturing economy, we had become too dependent on a globalized world, especially China. It turns out that if you want to have an economy that can weather a crisis, you actually have to be able to make some core things for yourself, whether it's wireless technology, whether it's pharmaceutical products, whether it's ventilators and hospital masks.\n\nLIASSON: And that's exactly the argument that you're hearing from Peter Navarro, President Trump's pandemic equipment czar.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nPETER NAVARRO: If there's any vindication of the president's buy American, secure borders and a strong manufacturing base philosophy, strategy and belief, it is this crisis.\n\nLIASSON: On trade, the pandemic gives a clear advantage to the antiglobalists in the GOP led by President Trump. But on domestic policies and the role of the federal government, while Democrats know what they want, Republicans aren't so sure, says Henry Olsen, a fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center in Washington.\n\nHENRY OLSEN: I think the debate within the Republican Party over what it stands for has been heating up, and the pandemic is going to kick it into overdrive. That you've got the people who are holding on to the neolibertarian version of the past but the - you've seen more and more calls for reform, which is moving more in the direction of engaging the Democrats on their core issue, which is how do we help people rather than saying the government can't help people?\n\nLIASSON: There are already lots of splits. Conservative freshman Senator Josh Hawley, for instance, wants to beef up the social safety net. He's advocating a European-style unemployment backstop, where the federal government would pay companies 80% of wages to prevent layoffs. But other Republicans support nothing more than the current temporary emergency measures. And in addition to Tea Party-style protests against the stay-at-home orders, there's also conservative pushback to the exponential increases in federal spending - even temporarily.\n\nBut despite those Republican tensions, J.D. Vance says, it will be hard for the president and his party to continue to argue that popular programs like Obamacare should be eliminated lock, stock and barrel.\n\nVANCE: I think the appetite for small government, everyone-is-on-their-own approach to the welfare state - frankly, it was always pretty small, and it's going to be even smaller, I think, over the next couple of years.\n\nLIASSON: Especially, says Vance, when there are at least 22 million people who've applied for unemployment benefits. How this debate resolves itself depends on how long the pandemic recession lasts and how popular the government rescue programs turn out to be. But until then, the pandemic has given both parties an opportunity to appeal to the vast number of Americans who will need help from the federal government for some time to come.\n\nMara Liasson, NPR News.\n\nCopyright © 2020 NPR.

Progress Report: President Trump's Campaign Promises, 2 Years Later\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Pool/Getty Images Pool/Getty Images\n\nSunday marks the second anniversary of President Trump's inauguration. At the midpoint of his four-year term, Trump has already delivered on some of his campaign promises, such as boosting funding for the military. Other pledges have been all but ignored, like his promise to lead a $1 trillion infrastructure push.\n\nWith many of Trump's promises, however, the record is somewhere in between — not exactly mission accomplished, but not mission forgotten either.\n\nLoading...\n\nDon't see the graphic above? Click here.\n\nHere's a progress report on the president's first two years:\n\nBorder wall\n\nTwo years into his presidency, Trump has not built a wall along the Southern border. And Mexico certainly hasn't paid for it. But the president continues to lobby for a wall, even going so far as to shut down part of the government in an effort to win funding for a 234-mile stretch of border barrier. The president has also pursued other get-tough measures against both legal and illegal immigration.\n\nWe've never had a president who has focused so much attention on immigration policy, said Andrew Selee, president of the Migration Policy Institute, and so uniformly in the direction of trying to reduce the number of people coming here and removing those who are here illegally.\n\nTrump has slashed the number of refugees entering the country, tried to end Obama-era protections for young immigrants living in the country illegally, and after a few rewrites, he ultimately won Supreme Court approval for his travel ban.\n\nTrade\n\nTrump has delivered on his promises to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement and to withdraw from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a big Asian trade deal. The new NAFTA, which Trump calls the USMCA, still needs approval from Congress. And 11 other countries in the TPP are moving ahead with their own agreement, putting U.S. exporters at a competitive disadvantage.\n\nTrump stopped short of labeling China a currency manipulator as he promised. But he has imposed tariffs on $250 billion in Chinese exports. Trade talks with China are ongoing.\n\nThe president has also imposed steep tariffs on steel and aluminum imports and threatened to impose tariffs on imported cars.\n\nThese are all things that President Trump promised to do during the campaign — for better or for worse — and in my view he's very much followed through with a lot of them, said Chad Bown, a senior fellow at the pro-trade Peterson Institute for International Economics.\n\nTrading partners, including traditional allies, have retaliated with tariffs of their own on a variety of U.S. exports. The U.S. trade deficit, which Trump often complains about, has widened over the last two years.\n\nTax cut\n\nThe GOP-controlled Congress passed a big tax cut just over a year ago, and that's contributed to a surge in economic growth. The White House argues that higher growth rates will continue for the next decade. But many other forecasters believe this is a short-term sugar high that will fade in the next year or two.\n\nThere's no debate about the effect on federal revenues. The tax cut has reduced government revenues and contributed to a ballooning federal deficit, expected to reach $1 trillion this year.\n\nWe heard some people claim these tax cuts are going to pay for themselves, said Marc Goldwein, senior vice president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. Certainly, they haven't to date, and there's no evidence they will in the future.\n\nEnergy\n\nTrump promised to promote fossil fuels, and last year the U.S. became the world's largest oil producer. Natural gas production is also booming, thanks to the same fracking revolution.\n\nWhile these trends began during the Obama administration, Trump has definitely encouraged them, said Daniel Yergin, energy historian and vice chairman of IHS Markit.\n\nSometimes it seems that the world's No. 1 natural gas/[liquefied natural gas] salesman is Donald Trump, Yergin said.\n\nTrump has championed oil and gas drilling both offshore and on public lands.\n\nHis support has not sparked a similar boom in the coal fields, however. Coal continues to lose market share for electricity generation in the U.S., partly because of competition from cheap natural gas and increasingly affordable wind and solar power.\n\nAffordable Care Act\n\ntoggle caption Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n\nWhile the president keeps chipping away at the Affordable Care Act, Trump has yet to deliver on his promise to repeal and replace Obamacare.\n\nThe core of the ACA is still standing, said Drew Altman, president and CEO of the Kaiser Family Foundation. It's still there. And politically the law is more popular than it has been.\n\nObamacare's Medicaid expansion has now been extended to 37 states, including several additional red states where voters opted into the program last year.\n\nEnrollment in the federally run insurance marketplaces dipped less than 5 percent this year, even though there's no longer a tax penalty for people who go without insurance, and the administration has fostered a variety of skimpy coverage alternatives.\n\nDemocrats made preservation of Obamacare's protection for people with pre-existing medical conditions a centerpiece of their midterm campaign.\n\nAs a result of the repeal and replace effort, Democrats are on offense now on health care and Republicans are on defense, Altman said.\n\nDeregulation\n\nTrump boasted about his efforts to cut red tape this month in a speech to the American Farm Bureau Federation, telling farmers he'd delivered the biggest cuts in regulations in the history of our country, and we're going further.\n\nThe president, along with a GOP Congress, has moved aggressively to unwind regulations, including rules governing carbon emissions, fuel economy, water pollution and payday lending. (Two big Obama-era rules — on overtime and investment advice — were also blocked by the courts.)\n\nHe certainly has tried to do what he said he was going to do, said Peter Van Doren, senior fellow at the libertarian Cato Institute.\n\nVan Doren cautioned, however, that much of Trump's push for deregulation could be stymied in court, unless the administration can establish a factual rationale for the proposed changes.\n\nYou can't just say you want to change this rule because we won the election, Van Doren said. The law doesn't allow that.\n\nJudges\n\ntoggle caption Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n\nWith the help of a GOP-controlled Senate, Trump continues to put his stamp on the federal bench, seating a second Supreme Court justice in 2018, and bringing his total of confirmed appellate court judges to 30 — more than any other president at this point in his term. (By contrast, Trump lags former Presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush in his pace of seating district court judges.)\n\nAs with the Supreme Court, most of Trump's appellate court picks have replaced judges who were also nominated by Republicans. So Trump's accomplishment is not so much creating a conservative court as locking one in that was already there.\n\nNow, obviously if you replace a 70-year-old, slightly to the right appellate judge with a 45-year-old, fire-brand conservative, you're not trading apples for apples, said Russell Wheeler, who tracks judicial nominees at the Brookings Institution.\n\nWheeler suspects Trump will not have as many appeals court vacancies to fill in the second half of his term. But the judicial appointments he's already made will be delivering on the president's promises, long after Trump leaves office.\n\nDraining the swamp\n\nTrump promised to weed out corruption in Washington by establishing new limits on lobbying by former administration officials. But watchdogs say in some cases, the new limits are less restrictive than ones already in place.\n\nI think the revolving door is operating much as it always has and maybe a little faster and more vigorously than it did prior to President Trump coming in, said Walter Shaub, former director of the Office of Government Ethics.\n\nConflicts abound within the administration, including many officials who now regulate the industries they used to work in.\n\nWhat's more, three of Trump's Cabinet officials resigned in 2018 under ethical clouds.\n\nI think he's been filling the swamp with more alligators, rather than draining it, said Shaub, who's now a senior adviser for the watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington.
McCain And Trump: How 2 Divergent Leaders Collided, Over And Over\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Robyn Beck/AFP/Getty Images Robyn Beck/AFP/Getty Images\n\nJust under a month before Election Day 2008, a woman stood up at a rally and told Republican nominee John McCain a major concern she had about his White House opponent.\n\nI can't trust [Barack] Obama. I have read about him and he's not, he's ... he's an Arab, the woman said of the Democratic presidential nominee.\n\nMcCain started shaking his head before she even finished her question, taking the microphone and pushing back emphatically on her incorrect statement.\n\nNo ma'am, McCain said. He's a decent family man, citizen, that I just happen to have disagreements with on fundamental issues, and that's what this campaign is all about. He's not.\n\nCNN via YouTube\n\nThe response was classic McCain — his trademark straight talk he honed on the campaign trail for nearly four decades, along with his willingness to often take the high road, even if it wasn't politically popular.\n\nHis positive comments about his opponent were met with boos by some in the audience, and perhaps signaled a shift within the GOP that McCain would criticize for the remainder of his life. The Arizona senator died Saturday at 81 from brain cancer.\n\nStraight talk vs. birther conspiracies\n\nContrast McCain's approach with Donald Trump's fast rise in politics, which was driven, in part, by pushing the false narrative that Obama wasn't an American citizen and had forged his birth certificate. That narrative established Trump as one of the leading voices in the birther movement.\n\nTrump would go on to become president by embracing that type of much more combative, confrontational tone that hinged on conspiracy theories and divisive rhetoric. McCain would never make it to the Oval Office, but in the final years of his life, he fully personified his maverick nickname by becoming one of the leading GOP voices against Trump as the two repeatedly clashed.\n\nThe divergent personalities of McCain and Trump were on a collision course from the beginning. McCain represented the old guard of Washington, a lion of the Senate who evoked respect from both sides of the aisle and believed honor was everything. Trump ushered in a new — many would say corrosive — era of American politics, in which insults are hurled at the ready, tribalism is paramount and apologies should never be doled out.\n\nThe son of decorated Navy admirals, McCain followed in their footsteps, graduating from the U.S. Naval Academy and then deploying to Vietnam. It was there that he was captured by North Vietnamese forces when his aircraft was shot down.\n\nTransported to the infamous Hanoi Hilton, he was beaten and tortured. Offered early release because of his father's status, McCain refused unless all the prisoners captured before him were also released. It was 5 1/2 years before he would be freed.\n\nHonest about his failures, he connected with voters on campaign trail\n\nUpon his return to U.S. soil, McCain would become the consummate political insider, spending four years in the House before being elected to the Senate in 1986. He was honest about his failures in office, too, especially after he was ensnared in the Keating Five scandal.\n\nThose missteps made him a campaign finance reform crusader, leading to the landmark bill that bore his name and became law in 2002. The measure was politically unpopular with many in his party, as was his effort to pass comprehensive immigration reform as part of the bipartisan Gang of Eight.\n\nJohn, again, was motivated by doing the right thing. And there were times where he said, 'This is going to cause me huge grief politically, but it's the right thing to do. I'll go for it.' I saw it over and over again, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer recalled to NPR's Michel Martin on Weekend All Things Considered.\n\nA failed 2000 bid for president gave rise to a successful run at the Republican nomination eight years later. In those campaigns, McCain became known for his openness with voters and the press. He thrived in town hall settings, and New Hampshire would kick-start his first bid for the White House and revive his sagging hopes in 2008 after his campaign had been left for dead.\n\nMcCain's controversial choice of Alaska's then-governor, Sarah Palin, as his running mate, in many ways may have opened the door for a candidate like Trump. Palin never seemed to mesh with McCain's more reserved, traditional style, and her hits on the media and giddiness in attacking Obama and others in personal terms seemed to presage a candidate like Trump. So, it was no surprise when Palin endorsed the billionaire businessman during the 2016 cycle.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Carolyn Kaster/AP Carolyn Kaster/AP\n\nMcCain never really slammed the press in the way that Trump revels in. Sure, he may have given plenty of reporters a hard time, but in the wake of his death, countless journalists recalled how he would still gladly speak to them, give a quote and even sometimes apologize if he had hassled them wrongly about a story.\n\nMcCain may have been one of the last presidential candidates to give reporters largely unfettered access to him with regularity. There were no cries of fake news or enemy of the people.\n\nIn a February 2017 interview on NBC's Meet The Press, less than a month after Trump was sworn in and was hurling invectives at reporters on Twitter, McCain told host Chuck Todd, with a glint in his eye: I hate the press. I hate you, especially, but the fact is we need you. We need a free press.\n\nTrump and McCain clash until the end\n\nMcCain's clash with Trump was boiling from the very beginning of the now-president's unlikely rise. After Trump kicked off his campaign in June 2015, McCain made it known he took issue with the reality TV star's characterization of Mexican immigrants as rapists who were bringing crime into the country.\n\nThe biggest flashpoint in their feud happened the next month, at an event in Iowa. With tensions already simmering, Trump disparaged McCain's military service, saying that McCain wasn't a war hero and that Trump preferred people who weren't captured. Trump received multiple education deferments for Vietnam, and then a final one for bone spurs.\n\nMcCain was later under pressure to back Trump once it became obvious he would win the nomination. The Arizona senator had pledged he'd back the GOP nominee, and he was facing a primary challenge from the right during his own 2016 re-election battle. Eventually, he would do so begrudgingly, though he declined to attend the Republican National Convention.\n\nThere was never an outright apology, but Trump would later endorse McCain's re-election bid, saying, I hold in the highest esteem Sen. John McCain for his service to our country in uniform and in public office, and I fully support and endorse his re-election.\n\nBut the détente wouldn't last. In October 2016, McCain was one of many lawmakers who rescinded support for Trump in the wake of the Access Hollywood tape. Their relationship, if it could even be called one by that point, would never be repaired.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption J. Scott Applewhite/AP J. Scott Applewhite/AP\n\nIn his final years in the Senate, McCain seemed almost emboldened to be a check on Trump as he embraced his elder statesman role with a renewed sense of patriotic obligation. The more than 30-year Senate veteran was beholden to no one now, knowing perhaps he had already run his final race even before he would receive his fatal cancer diagnosis in the summer of 2017.\n\nAbsent from the Senate for much of the past year, McCain nonetheless remained a loud voice in statements against the use of torture and on matters of foreign policy — striking a strong tone against Russia all while at the same time Trump would lavish praise on the country and its leader, Vladimir Putin.\n\nThe action that Trump would come to resent the most came in the wee morning hours of July 28, 2017, when McCain gave a dramatic thumbs down to the Senate GOP plan to repeal the Affordable Care Act. Having returned to the Senate shortly after his diagnosis of brain cancer, McCain's decision whether to vote yay or nay remained a mystery even among his own party's leadership.\n\nThen he strode to the floor, stuck out his hand, and cast his no vote, sinking not only the bill's chances but any hopes Republicans might have had of following through on a years-long promise to repeal and replace Obamacare.\n\nThe almost-Shakespearean drama that played out was one Trump would love to re-enact in the coming months to his voracious rally crowds. He'd rarely use McCain's name, but it was clear who the president was talking about even as the senior senator was at home in Arizona fighting for his life.\n\nWe had it done folks, it was done, and then early in the morning somebody turned their hand in the wrong direction, Trump said in a May 2018 rally. The person that voted that way only talked repeal and replace. He campaigned on it.\n\nThose comments came just after it leaked that a White House aide had said they didn't need to worry about McCain opposing their CIA nominee over interrogation techniques, because he's dying anyway.\n\nTrump's final snub of the revered senator came just two weeks ago, when he signed the 2019 military authorization funding bill, which McCain's colleagues had named in honor of the ailing Senate Armed Services Committee chairman. But in the signing ceremony, Trump would never utter McCain's name. And when news came Saturday that McCain had died, the president would issue a single tweet, expressing his deepest sympathy and offering prayers to the senator's family. The Washington Post reported Trump nixed a more laudatory statement praising McCain's military and political service.\n\nMcCain's final message and legacy: humility, cooperation and dependence\n\nIn one of McCain's final Senate floor speeches shortly after he returned following his ultimately fatal diagnosis, the lawmaker opined on the current caustic state of politics and the lack of compromise and he underscored the importance of Congress as a co-equal branch to the president, designed to be a check on the executive branch.\n\nPBS NewsHour via YouTube\n\nI hope we can again rely on humility, on our need to cooperate, on our dependence on each other to learn how to trust each other again and by so doing better serve the people who elected us. Stop listening to the bombastic loudmouths on the radio and television and the Internet. To hell with them. They don't want anything done for the public good. Our incapacity is their livelihood, McCain bemoaned.\n\nAnd even in the midst of bruising political campaigns, McCain often tried to take the high road. The bitter 2000 South Carolina primary against eventual winner George W. Bush was marked by false allegations that he had fathered a black child (when, in fact, he and his wife had adopted their daughter Bridget from a Bangladesh orphanage).\n\nMcCain's aides wanted to respond in kind, but he forbade them. And in one instance where he did bow to political expediency on the issue of whether the Confederate flag should have been taken down from atop the South Carolina House, he later returned to the state to apologize — a rarity in politics even back then, let alone today.\n\nI feared that if I answered honestly, I could not win the South Carolina primary, McCain said, calling for the flag's removal after the fact. So I chose to compromise my principles. I broke my promise to always tell the truth.\n\nBut even personal attacks aside, McCain saw there was something greater than wins and losses, or even words said in the heat of political battle. After all, the two men who ended his White House dreams, Bush and Obama, will reportedly deliver eulogies at his funeral — a final statement of Country First from what seems like a bygone era.
Many Firsts At Confirmation Hearings For Judge Amy Coney Barrett\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Manuel Balce Ceneta/AP Manuel Balce Ceneta/AP\n\nThere will be plenty of firsts on Monday as the Senate Judiciary Committee opens hearings on the nomination of Judge Amy Coney Barrett to the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nIt is the first time that a confirmation hearing is taking place amid a pandemic and with two committee members, both Republicans, recently having tested positive for the coronavirus.\n\nIt is also the first time that a confirmation hearing is taking place at the same time early voting has begun in many states, and in a presidential election year.\n\nAnd while political hardball is not new, Senate Republicans are playing a confirmation game that is wildly more aggressive than at any time in memory.\n\nFour years ago, Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell refused for nearly a year to hold hearings on President Barack Obama's Supreme Court nominee, arguing that it was an election year and that the voters should have a chance to weigh in.\n\nBut now, with a Republican in the White House and the election just over three weeks away, McConnell has scheduled Barrett's confirmation hearing to take place just 16 days after her nomination was announced.\n\nThat's warp speed for modern times. The average time between nomination and confirmation hearing for the eight current Supreme Court justices was 56 days.\n\nA 2016 warning from Barrett\n\nStill, expect plenty of rhetorical mortal combat at the hearings this week because the stakes are so high. If Barrett is confirmed to fill liberal Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg's seat, many of the court's precedents could be at risk.\n\nBarrett herself understood the stakes four years ago, when just five days before the 2016 election, she warned that if Hillary Clinton were elected and had a chance to fill the then-vacant seat previously occupied by conservative Justice Antonin Scalia, the appointment would have the potential to flip the balance on the court.\n\nThat possibility is writ large now because this is President Trump's third nominee to the court. There already is a five-justice conservative majority, and if Barrett is confirmed, conservatives will have a six-justice majority on the nine-justice court, giving conservatives a dominant upper hand not just in the outcome of cases but in crafting far more broadly written conservative decisions.\n\nA threat to the future of abortion rights?\n\nSo this week, the focus will be on Barrett and her judicial philosophy. Would she vote to overrule Roe v. Wade, strike down the Affordable Care Act, give greater powers to the president or limit congressional powers? Just what kind of a justice would she be?\n\nMany of the speeches noted in her Senate questionnaire are no longer available on various websites where they may once have lived. And a website involving a charismatic Christian religious group she has long been involved with appears to have been scrubbed, according to The Washington Post.\n\nAnd on Friday, the Senate Judiciary Committee released an update to Barrett's committee questionnaire that included a lecture, a seminar and an ad she signed criticizing Roe v. Wade.\n\nWalking in Scalia's footsteps\n\nWhen Trump announced her nomination at the White House, Barrett described herself this way: I clerked for Justice Scalia more than 20 years ago, but the lessons I learned still resonate. His judicial philosophy is mine, too.\n\nScalia was a conservative icon who more than any modern legal theorist popularized the concept of originalism — the idea that the Constitution should be read to mean what the Founding Fathers intended at the time it was written and ratified. He was a fervent opponent of Roe v. Wade and the court's gay rights and same-sex marriage decisions, and he was the author of the court's two major gun-rights rulings. So if Barrett is a justice in Scalia's mold, she will move the court decidedly to the right.\n\nThe problem for Democrats is that Barrett is a very accomplished nominee — a star professor at Notre Dame Law School, a mother of seven, including two children she and her husband, Jesse, adopted from Haiti and one child with Down syndrome.\n\nAt the same time, however, many of the features of Barrett's life that point strongly to her conservative views also involve her religion. For instance, in 2006 she signed a two-page ad in the South Bend Tribune declaring that it's time to put an end to the barbaric legacy of Roe v. Wade and restore laws that protect the lives of unborn children.\n\nAccording to The Guardian newspaper, the ad was sponsored by St. Joseph County Right to Life, a group that Barrett and her husband were members of. The group also opposes in vitro fertilization.\n\nBarrett, for her part, has consistently said that a judge should rule on the law, not her personal beliefs. I would never impose my own personal convictions upon the law, she said at her 2017 confirmation hearing for the appeals court judgeship she now holds.\n\nLegitimate inquiry vs. religious test\n\nBut probing that assertion is politically tricky. Democrats who tried in 2017 found themselves branded as anti-Catholic.\n\nSen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., famously asked Barrett this question: I think whatever a religion is, it has its own dogma. The law is totally different, and when you read your speeches, the conclusion one draws is that the dogma lives loudly within you.\n\nRepublicans reacted with fury. It appears that professor Barrett has one big strike against her, and that is her religious faith, said then-Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah. It is despicable.\n\nIt is a theme that Senate Republican leader McConnell picked up 10 days ago, declaring on the Hugh Hewitt Show that discrimination against people of religion is on full display. McConnell went on to say that Senate Democrats need to be reminded there is no religious test for public service in America whatsoever.\n\nSo Democrats in the next few days almost certainly will try to find ways of questioning Barrett that don't directly involve her religious beliefs. Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., for instance, says he will focus on other questions.\n\nWe have an incumbent president, whose reelection is at risk, publicly saying, 'I'm choosing this judge so she can rule on an election dispute if one arises,'  he said, noting that at the same time, Trump is casting doubt on the legitimacy of the election.\n\nCoons, who met with Barrett by phone last week, said she refused to say whether she would recuse herself from an election dispute should it reach the court.\n\nThen, too, there's the Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare, which is scheduled to be argued before the court for a third time a week after the election. Twice before, the court has upheld the health care law by votes of 5-4 and 6-3, but Barrett has been critical of both decisions. And if she is confirmed, she could well be the deciding vote in this latest attempt by the Trump administration to get the court to strike down the law in its entirety.\n\nFor her part, Barrett has made clear that while she believes that the Supreme Court's doctrine of following precedent is important, there are times when it is not. As she wrote in the Texas Law Review in 2013: I tend to agree with those who say that a justice's duty is to the Constitution ... rather than a precedent she thinks clearly in conflict with it.\n\nContributing research for this article were Marisa Manzi, Christina Peck, Timur Akman-Duffy, Emmett Witkovsky-Eldred, Leemah Nasrati, Alexandra Benton, Gabriel A.

Bernie Sanders Knows His Medicare-For-All Bill Won't Pass. That's Not The Point\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Drew Angerer/Getty Images Drew Angerer/Getty Images\n\nVermont Sen. Bernie Sanders will introduce a bill next month to create a government-run, single-payer health care system. And he knows it's going to fail.\n\nLook, I have no illusions that under a Republican Senate and a very right-wing House and an extremely right-wing president of the United States, that suddenly we're going to see a Medicare-for-all, single-payer passed, he said recently, sitting in his Senate office. You're not going to see it. That's obvious.\n\nThe point of the bill, Sanders says, is to force a conversation: Excuse me: why is the United States the only major country on earth not to guarantee health care to all people? Why are we spending far, far more per capita on health care than any other nation? Why do we pay the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs?\n\nSingle-payer was a major policy plank of Sanders' 2016 presidential campaign, and he has been ready all year to put it into legislation. He was just waiting for Republicans to wrap up their effort to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare.\n\nThat means Sanders has been waiting for a while.\n\nDespite President Trump's continued calls for Congress to repeal Obamacare, House and Senate Republicans appear to have moved on to other priorities. That means when Congress returns to Washington, D.C., next month, Sanders will roll out his bill.\n\nThe measure is the latest example of how Sanders is trying to push the Democratic Party — a party he is not formally a member of as an independent — to the left.\n\nSanders and his staff are confident a substantial number of Democratic senators will co-sponsor the measure. But many Democratic Party leaders continue to hold the idea of single-payer at arm's-length. Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez regularly pivots to a broader answer about health care policy when he is asked whether he backs a single-payer plan.\n\nWe believe that health care is a right for all, and not a privilege for a few, Perez recently told NPR. And right now, in Washington, D.C., in the political climate in which we live, preserving the Affordable Care Act is a major victory.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi was more direct earlier this year when she was asked whether Democrats should run on a single-payer platform in 2018.\n\nNo, Pelosi said. I say to people, 'You want to do that, do it in your states.' \n\nThe comfort level with a broader base of the American people is not there yet. Doesn't mean it couldn't be. States are a good place to start, she added.\n\nDemocrats in Pelosi's home state of California tried to pass a single-payer bill this year. The measure passed the state Senate but stalled in the Assembly, despite complete Democratic control in Sacramento, the capital.\n\nThe resistance from Pelosi and other Democratic leaders is tactical, not ideological. It took decades to pass something like Obamacare, and their concern is that, despite what polls might suggest, something as aggressive as single-payer just isn't politically feasible right now.\n\nIn fact, the congressional leaders you hear talking about single-payer are often Republicans, not Democrats. House Speaker Paul Ryan and other Republicans regularly float it as a worst-case Democratic alternative.\n\nUltimately it's very clear that they're more interested in a single-payer system, which means government-run health care, Ryan said during the Senate push to repeal Obamacare. Government-run health care is not in our nation's interest.\n\nSenate Republicans even forced a vote on a single-payer option on the Senate floor last month, hoping to get Democrats on the record supporting the idea.\n\nMost Democratic senators voted present. No one voted yes.\n\nI urged my colleagues to vote 'present' because we are not going to dance to the tune of right-wing Republicans, who of course were not prepared to support a single-payer, Sanders said. For them, it was just a political moment that they thought would be advantageous for them.\n\nPolls show single-payer is gaining support. A recent Pew Research survey showed the number of respondents favoring government-run health care has gone up percentage points this year alone and is 12 points higher than it was in 2014.\n\nIn a more important metric, more than half of House Democrats signed on to co-sponsor a single-payer bill earlier this year.\n\nJeff Weaver, a longtime adviser to Sanders, argues Democrats should be more aggressive on health care after a stretch during which broad swaths of voters organized against the GOP's Obamacare repeal effort. This is a very powerful issue, in that people are prepared to be mobilized in support of their health care, Weaver said.\n\nLike Sanders readily admits, this bill isn't going anywhere any time soon.\n\nThe whole thing is more about political framing — getting Democrats to the point where this would be a top priority whenever the party is back in power.\n\nThat is how progressive activists like Adam Green, the co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, are viewing Sanders' impending bill rollout.\n\nIf we left this debate with 20 senators on the record supporting single-payer, and the entire Senate Democratic caucus uniting around giving every American the option of buying into Medicare if they want to, that would be a wonderful place to land, Green said.
Rep. Tim Ryan Says Biden Is The Candidate To Beat Trump\n\nNPR's Noel King talks to Democratic Rep. Tim Ryan of Ohio about ex-Vice President Joe Biden, who won nine states and beat expectations in others on Super Tuesday. It's pretty much a two-man race now.\n\nNOEL KING, HOST:\n\nJoe Biden won primaries in nine of the 14 states that voted yesterday, Super Tuesday.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nJOE BIDEN: People are talking about a revolution. We started a movement. We've increased turnout.\n\n(CHEERING)\n\nBIDEN: The turnout's turned out for us.\n\n(CHEERING)\n\nBIDEN: That can deliver us to a moment where we can do extraordinary, extraordinary things.\n\nKING: That was Biden speaking last night. He had some help in the form of endorsements from his former rivals, Pete Buttigieg, Amy Klobuchar and Beto O'Rourke. And one more - Ohio Congressman Tim Ryan, who dropped out of the race back in October and endorsed Biden in November. Representative Ryan is on the line now.\n\nGood morning, sir.\n\nTIM RYAN: Good morning.\n\nKING: So you are one of the originals (laughter). You endorsed Biden months ago. Why do you think he's the best candidate to beat Donald Trump in November?\n\nRYAN: Well, it became evident yesterday. He can pull the coalition together in places like Texas but yet still win Maine and Minnesota. I think he's the best person to beat Donald Trump. And then, I think, even in the last couple days, there were the political maneuvers, you know, with Amy Klobuchar, Mayor Pete and Beto.\n\nBut it was also, you know, things like the coronavirus, where you watched President Trump kind of mishandle all of this stuff. People want some steady leadership, and I think it's becoming apparent that that's Joe Biden.\n\nKING: There was a big demographic divide in the vote last night. Overwhelmingly, Latino voters went for Bernie Sanders. The black vote went to Joe Biden. Do you think Joe Biden can win Latino voters? This is a very important demographic and will be very important come the election.\n\nRYAN: I don't think there's any question. I think that, you know, Senator Sanders has some support with, like, Alexandria Ocasio Cortez, who's a huge figure in the Latino community, and others, you know, I think that have helped. But I think at the end of the day, nothing's going to sharpen everybody's mind like the prospect of removing Donald Trump from office. And so I think that the coalition and the Democratic Party and - across the country is going to come together behind Joe Biden, and we're going to beat Donald Trump.\n\nKING: Well, let me ask you the same question - relatively the same question about progressives. We know that there is a progressive bloc in this country that fiercely supports Bernie Sanders. And there are concerns that if Joe Biden wins the nomination, he's not going to be able to capture their vote. Let's talk practical - let's talk in practical terms here. What can Joe Biden do to win over that group of voters?\n\nRYAN: Well, again, I think Donald Trump's going to provide an avenue for us to really articulate why Joe Biden is much better than Donald Trump and why progressives should not want another four years of Donald Trump. But let's get into the values and the rights that we all believe in, I think, as Democrats but most Americans.\n\nJoe Biden believes that health care is a right. And he was instrumental in making sure that everybody in the United States had coverage, working with President Obama to pass the Affordable Care Act. That is not an insignificant thing. You look at where Joe Biden was with gay marriage. You look at him passing the Violence Against Women Act, on the assault weapons ban. I mean, he's got a really long record that will continue to come out that, I think, will make those folks comfortable to come back home...\n\nKING: Yeah, no. Those folks aren't comfortable though. And I want to ask you specifically about health care. I mean, one of their main points - people who support Bernie Sanders - is Joe Biden simply does not go far enough on health care. Now, I hear what you're saying, that people may come around; people will come around. Why are you so sure that they'll come around? Health care is being fiercely debated in this country, and there are people who say Joe Biden simply does not have a plan that we want.\n\nRYAN: Well, you know, (laughter) again, it's, you know, like the vice president says, you know, he's not the almighty, you know? I mean, he's the - he'll be the alternative to Donald Trump. And the fact that Donald Trump has tried, on several occasions, both in the House and the Senate, plans to take 20 million people off of their health care; the fact that he's in the pocket of the pharmaceutical industry when it comes to trying to lower prescription drug prices; you know, the fact that he has no concern for public health - I mean, Joe Biden's looking to expand health care with a public option, building on Obamacare. And he'll come out with, you know, more details as we move forward into the general election. That's a clear choice for anybody who - that believes that health care is a right.\n\nAnd so I think, you know, obviously, we're in the heat of the battle now. This is how it goes. We've all been through these elections, moving from a primary to a general. I think progressives are going to come around. They're going to be comfortable with Joe Biden. He's going to lay out a big vision for the future of this country, and we need his steady leadership. So I think they're going to come around. But, you know, it's hard to say that when you're in the middle of the battle. But he's a clear choice, the much better choice than Donald Trump would be.\n\nKING: Last question for you - does Joe Biden need the support of Bernie Sanders supporters if he's to win in November? Does he need them?\n\nRYAN: No question - I mean, I don't think there's any question. We need to have all hands on deck. You know, you're going to need the progressives. You're going to need the Bernie Sanders supporters, the Elizabeth Warren supporters. You know, everybody's got to help us do this.\n\nAnd the prospects of Donald Trump appointing another, you know, two or three people to the Supreme Court, continuing to roll back environmental regulations - I mean, this is another thing. We need to talk about climate change. The absolute worst thing you could do for climate is have Donald Trump in office for another four years.\n\nSo those supporters are going to come around. We want everybody in our coalition. And we're going to go out, and we're going to beat Donald Trump. And it's going to be a new day in the country. And we're going to have some steady leadership. And we're going to want every single vote that Bernie Sanders has gotten - or Elizabeth Warren - to come on board and help Joe Biden.\n\nKING: Ohio Congressman Tim Ryan, thank you so much for your time.\n\nRYAN: Thanks for having me.\n\nCopyright © 2020 NPR.

Medicare For All Coronavirus Patients? But Who Exactly Qualifies?\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Jim Watson/AFP via Getty Images Jim Watson/AFP via Getty Images\n\nThe Trump administration announced Friday that doctors and hospitals can use federal aid to cover the costs of treating uninsured people who are suffering COVID-19.\n\nThe federal payments, part of a $100 billion aid package to health care providers, will specifically cover COVID-19 care. But some health policy experts say the program will be difficult to administer, because it's sometimes impossible to separate the cost of treating COVID-19 from the cost of treating a patient's other health problems, like kidney failure.\n\nMillions of people who have lost their jobs in recent weeks also face the prospect of losing health coverage. Democrats have called on the Trump administration to open a special enrollment period for those people to sign up for health coverage under Obamacare.\n\nInstead, Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex Azar said health care providers will be reimbursed for COVID-19 care at Medicare rates, and they will be forbidden from billing patients for services directly on top of that.\n\nSabrina Corlette, co-director of the Center on Health Insurance Reforms at Georgetown University, said the new plan raises a host of unanswered questions, because it won't always be clear whether an individual's problems, whether pneumonia or kidney failure, are caused by a coronavirus infection.\n\nWho would qualify for this program? she asked. For what services? Who would be the judge of whether or not you qualify?\n\nCorlette added that it would be far simpler and easier simply to open up a period to enroll in insurance plans on the Affordable Care Act's marketplaces.\n\nIt's like they're twisting themselves into pretzels to avoid anything that has a taint of Obamacare, she said.
Presidential Contenders Make Higher Education Costs A Hot Button Issue\n\nDemocratic presidential candidates want to see who can be the most generous when it comes to alleviating higher education costs. Sen. Bernie Sanders aims to cancel $1.6 trillion in student loan debt.\n\nSTEVE INSKEEP, HOST:\n\nThis week, Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders announced his proposal to cancel American's outstanding student loan debt, all of it - $1.6 trillion worth.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nBERNIE SANDERS: This proposal will make it possible for every person in America to get all of the education they need regardless of their financial status.\n\nINSKEEP: Now, Sanders is one of numerous Democratic presidential candidates promising to address the cost of college in various ways. As we prepare for this week's two-part presidential debate, NPR's Anya Kamenetz has more.\n\nANYA KAMENETZ, BYLINE: In 2016, Bernie Sanders stood out as among the first major contenders for a presidential nomination to call for making college free. In 2020, two Democratic contenders, Sanders and Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren, have released detailed free college and student debt relief plans. Many more of the nearly two dozen candidates - including Joe Biden, Senator Kamala Harris and Senator Kirsten Gillibrand - have voiced support for free college or co-sponsored related bills.\n\nKEVIN CAREY: It seems like we're in an arms race for who can be the most expansive and ambitious when it comes to tackling the problem of the cost of higher education.\n\nKAMENETZ: Kevin Carey directs education policy at the nonpartisan think tank New America. But, he says, there are important differences among the candidates' proposals and, of course, roadblocks along the way.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nELIZABETH WARREN: No country builds a future by crushing the dreams and hopes of its young people.\n\nKAMENETZ: That's Senator Warren in a campaign video.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nWARREN: That's why I'm calling for universal free college and the cancellation of student loan debt of up to $50,000...\n\nKAMENETZ: Although they are often linked, there is one big difference between tuition-free and student debt relief proposals. The federal government runs the student loan program, but it doesn't run our public colleges. States do. That means a president can propose matching funds and incentives - carrots or sticks - but they can't force states to abolish tuition. Kevin Carey at New America compares the situation to what happened when some states refused to increase access to Medicaid despite federal incentives under Obamacare.\n\nCAREY: As we learned from Obamacare and Medicaid expansion, states are apparently willing to leave enormous amounts of federal money on the table if they don't want to expand their own spending.\n\nKAMENETZ: Student loan plans are different from free college. Congress has the power to write off outstanding student debt. That's what Warren and Sanders have called for. They both say forgiving hundreds of billions of dollars in debt will stimulate the economy and allow more millennials to buy homes and start businesses. Senator Elizabeth Warren's student loan debt relief plan is targeted to lower-income people. It would phase out after $50,000 of loan debt. That makes it cheaper than Sanders' plan to write off all student debt.\n\nBoth candidates, by the way, say that they would pay for the plans with new taxes on the wealthy or on Wall Street. But neither Sanders' nor Warren's student debt relief proposals put any money in the pockets of people who never attended college in the first place or who never took out loans to do so. Laura Hanna of activist group the Debt Collective says that's not the point. Full debt forgiveness is a matter of principle, she says.\n\nLAURA HANNA: We think that education is a right and that it should be free to everybody.\n\nKAMENETZ: The Debt Collective has been organizing for cancellation of student debt since the Occupy Wall Street protests in 2012. And they appeared alongside Sanders and several House members at Monday's press conference announcing his debt forgiveness proposal.\n\nHANNA: There's real anger and frustration around it. And it's - this is an issue that candidates aren't going to be able to avoid.\n\nKAMENETZ: Student debt relief and free college proposals have clear generational appeal. And the simpler the proposals are, the better they fit in a campaign poster or into a tweet. But that says nothing about their chances for success.\n\nAnya Kamenetz, NPR News.\n\nCopyright © 2019 NPR. All rights reserved.

Reporter: White House Knew Of Coronavirus' 'Major Threat,' But Response Fell Short\n\nTERRY GROSS, HOST:\n\nThis is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross.\n\nWe're going to talk about how President Trump and some members of his administration have mismanaged the coronavirus outbreak, helping fuel the crisis. My guest Dan Diamond is a reporter for Politico who investigates health care policy and politics, including the Trump administration's coronavirus response. He's written about dysfunction and infighting within the administration and how that's slowed the response to the spread of the virus and led to some counterproductive decisions. The virus has spread to the point where, yesterday, the World Health Organization declared it a pandemic, which is defined as the worldwide spread of a new disease.\n\nDan Diamond, welcome back to FRESH AIR. Tell us your main takeaways from the president's speech last night.\n\nDAN DIAMOND: Well, Terry, I guess we can start with the good, such as it was. On Wednesday night, nearly two months after the first U.S. case of novel coronavirus was detected, President Trump finally treated this outbreak with the seriousness it deserves. He's given press conferences where he said the cases would effectively go away. He has posted tweets, even on Monday where he compared this to the flu. This is not the flu. The flu does not lead the National Basketball Association, the NBA, to suspend its season.\n\nI think it's a positive that the president seems to finally realize the severity of the problem. Unfortunately, his short remarks contained a lot of mistakes and misinformation. The president said that travel from Europe would be suspended for 30 days. That wasn't completely correct. The White House had to immediately walk that back. U.S. citizens and their families and legal permanent residents can still come back. The president said that cargo would be banned from Europe. That would have been a huge blow to the economy, especially given that some crucial medical supplies come from the EU. But it turned out that Trump misspoke again; cargo will still be allowed.\n\nThe president said that health insurers had waived the cost of treatment for coronavirus. That's no small thing. Patients who are afflicted can end up in the hospital for weeks. That could have been a multibillion-dollar decision. But as my Politico colleague Sarah Owermohle first reported, insurers had only waived the cost of testing, and that had already been established in White House meetings.\n\nAnd then the broader moves and the president's language confounded and concerned public health experts. The president repeatedly leaned into phrases like, this is a foreign virus, that Europe is now a source of America's problems. On one level, he's right; the virus came out of China, and that country's leadership has a lot to answer for in how they initially screwed up the response. I think the Trump administration did have good reason to shut down China travel in late January, given the uncertainty about the new outbreak.\n\nBut at this point, the virus is here. It's silently spreading. And locking down more borders may not help us very much and only alienate allies that we need to fight a global war on disease. As I was walking into the studio, Terry, I saw the European Union had put out a statement slamming the U.S. for taking this step without even informing them.\n\nGROSS: What are some of the things you wish he had addressed in the speech that he didn't?\n\nDIAMOND: Well, in his remarks, the president didn't address the biggest problem - that our domestic health infrastructure is not ready for this, partly because of his administration. We're still wildly behind on testing that was botched by the Centers for Disease Control. We don't have enough supplies, like respirators. Our hospitals and doctors are almost certainly going to face real challenges as demand spikes. And I think listeners should be clear-eyed that what's happening in Italy, in Spain, with their hospitals and ICUs totally slammed, that could happen here, too, in the next two weeks.\n\nGROSS: We seem to be entering, like, a new phase of the epidemic. Yesterday, the World Health Organization declared the virus a pandemic. The NBA suspended the season. Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson have been diagnosed with the virus. So have we reached a new stage? And what does that mean?\n\nDIAMOND: Well, in many ways, the World Health Organization was just confirming what public health experts have said now for days or even weeks. This virus is here. It is around the world. It is spreading. It is putting many people at risk.\n\nBut I do think, Terry, we will look back on Wednesday and, in the span of about an hour and a half, remember that moment as the moment when the United States really began to grapple with this virus - between the president's sober remarks; immediately followed by Tom Hanks, famous actor, announcing that he had this virus; the National Basketball Association suspending its season; here in D.C., a senator's office announcing that an aide had tested positive for coronavirus. A lot happened in a short amount of time to bring the virus home to many different people in many different parts of the United States.\n\nAt the same time, there's still a number of folks and perhaps even listeners who will hear this, who will have heard the president's remarks and still shrug it off, and part of that is because of the president himself playing it down and convincing some percentage of Americans, some of his followers, that this was not a big deal until he said so last night.\n\nGROSS: Among the things the president didn't address last night is giving advice to states and cities about, you know, protocols for gatherings, advice to hospitals about how to handle protocol, like, what the protocol should be. Do you know if there are any federal protocols coming out of the administration to states and cities, to hospitals and health care workers, any set of standards that they're advising, you know, states, cities, hospitals, churches, synagogues, public places to follow? Or is it every city, every state is making these decisions on their own?\n\nDIAMOND: At this point, there is guidance coming from the CDC, the Centers for Disease Control, to help hospitals, help health care workers figure out who to diagnose, who to treat, who should be tested. Those guidances (ph) have been a work in progress and consistently behind where they probably need to be - running behind.\n\nCities, states, localities in the United States do have a fair amount of control and sway over what they choose to do. And some in California have been extremely aggressive in moving to ban public gatherings, to lock down certain events. California Governor Gavin Newsom, late last night, said that all events in the state, he recommended, should be canceled for over 250 people. So if you're having a convention, if there's a sporting event, a concert, anything 250 people and up should be put off for the rest of the month because those can be vectors to lead to significant infections among a lot of people if one person is spreading the virus.\n\nBut at this point, we do not have, from the White House, any clear directive on what the country should do. And with his bully pulpit, with that national address, that could have been an opportunity for the president to deliver a stark but probably necessary message on what local leaders should do; he didn't do it.\n\nGROSS: You know, you've written that the biggest mistake so far the Trump administration has made with the coronavirus is not having test kits and testing sooner. What went wrong?\n\nDIAMOND: As one official has said, Terry, the question might not be what went wrong; it's what went right? The Trump administration and health officials knew back in January that this coronavirus was going to be a major threat. They knew that tests needed to be distributed across the country to understand where there might be outbreaks. But across the month of February, as my colleague David Lim at Politico first reported, the tests that they sent out to labs across the country simply did not work. They were coming back with errors.\n\nThe CDC, the Centers for Disease Control, recognized that and promised that new tests would be distributed soon. But one day turned into two days turned into three days turned into several weeks, and in the meantime, we know now coronavirus was silently spreading in different communities, like Seattle. By the time that the Trump administration made a decision to allow new tests to be developed by hospitals by clinical laboratories, it was a step that was seen as multiple weeks late. And now as we talk in March, there are concerns that maybe there aren't enough materials to keep producing tests down the line - so a series of planning failures and missed opportunities to really get ahead of a problem.\n\nGROSS: And it might be hard for the labs that actually conduct the tests to keep up with the need.\n\nDIAMOND: The Trump administration has argued that there's a surplus of tests, that anyone who wants a test can get one. And there is some truth to that. Now tests have been churned out. But the sheer number of people who can run these tests, the number of labs that can perform them, right now it's still fairly limited. And even if there is raw supply for now, there are only so many labs that can do the tests and deliver results.\n\nGROSS: Why didn't the U.S. use the World Health Organization's test?\n\nDIAMOND: If you or your listeners know the answer to that, I would love...\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nDIAMOND: ...To have someone tip me off because that is a question that I've been trying to solve and my colleagues have been looking to solve, too. The World Health Organization did have a working test. Someone somewhere made the decision that the U.S. was going to go its own way, and that started a chain reaction of not having a working test and then having these delays for weeks - so certainly a failure, not necessarily the worst failure but the one that started us down this path.\n\nGROSS: It's almost embarrassing, nationally, that the United States is so far behind other countries in terms of its ability to conduct tests for the virus.\n\nDIAMOND: I think at this point, Terry, South Korea, in the past 24 hours, has probably done more tests for coronavirus than the United States has done in the past two months. South Korea can do 10,000 tests per day. At last count, we have done somewhere between 5,000 and 8,000 tests.\n\nGROSS: What do you think the impact is of the lost time?\n\nDIAMOND: I think it's been a shame for public health writ large, and I think it's been horribly concerning for local leaders. We are flying blind, as the coronavirus threatens the United States. If there is an outbreak, if hundreds of people are infected in a certain city, it's been nearly impossible until recent days for officials to get a handle on that, and that means it's hard to make decisions about whether schools should be canceled or classes pushed off at a local college or conferences delayed.\n\nSome of the measures being taken are smart, preventive efforts to keep people from catching this virus, but some are simply aggressive measures because, in the absence of not knowing, it's always safer to do more rather than less. And if we don't know how far coronavirus has spread, there are only so many public health staff who can deploy to fight this problem, and their efforts are being spread very thin because they don't know where to target.\n\nGROSS: Well, let's take a short break here, and then we'll talk some more. If you're just joining us, my guest is Dan Diamond, a reporter for Politico who investigates health care policy and politics, including the Trump administration's response to the coronavirus. We'll be right back. This is FRESH AIR.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF JOAN JEANRENAUD'S DERVISH)\n\nGROSS: This is FRESH AIR. And if you're just joining us, my guest is Dan Diamond, a reporter for Politico who investigates health care policy and politics, including the Trump administration's response to the coronavirus. So what is your assessment - since you cover the health agencies, what's your assessments of how much - that has gone wrong as a result of, like, bad political decisions, incompetence, just bad luck?\n\nDIAMOND: I don't use this word lightly, Terry, but I'd say that this testing failure and the broader response to the coronavirus has been a catastrophe. The reasons it is a catastrophe, some are on the Trump administration itself; some are simply bureaucratic breakdowns. And if I'm apportioning blame - in the middle of a crisis, it's hard to tell at all times who made what decision when, but certainly, the Trump administration failed to plan for this moment. There were leadership failures, like failing to think through the implications of not having a testing strategy in place. There were leadership failures in allowing feuds to fester for months and months that - in the middle of a crisis, those cracks have widened and caused delays in making simple decisions.\n\nAt the same time, there are also low-level bureaucratic failures that are enough to make a person cry. There was a New York Times story this week about the team in Seattle of flu researchers who wanted to use their research to help uncover where coronavirus might be spreading, but because of complicated regulations, they were not technically supposed to use their data that had been collected for the flu to also search for coronavirus. And they tried for weeks to get permission from local leaders, from national leaders, especially, and just couldn't get it. They were being passed from bureaucrat to bureaucrat. Finally, they went ahead and helped uncover the Seattle coronavirus outbreak but then were told to knock it off.\n\nAnd I look at these decisions and, in the moment, can somewhat understand why a mid-level official might say we have to follow policy and procedure. But in the middle of a crisis, turning to bureaucratic rulebooks is not the way to address this, and that has left the U.S. just a step behind at every step of the way.\n\nGROSS: Trump has made it clear he wants low numbers. He didn't want people who tested positive from a cruise ship to be evacuated and then quarantined because the numbers would go up, and he didn't want those numbers to go up. It would look bad; it would make him look bad. So what do you think the most consequential decisions he's made so far are in terms of the virus, decisions for better or worse?\n\nDIAMOND: When President Trump went on air and did a press conference talking about his concern over the, quote, numbers and didn't want a cruise ship with infected Americans to necessarily dock and have the passengers evacuated because he was worried about the numbers, it was a remarkable statement for a president to say. The president has been obsessed with the numbers, obsessed with the optics of how this looks, which is not what you want the U.S. president to be focused on. The president's decisions on coronavirus, Terry, are, I think, an outgrowth of how he has approached government the past three years. There were so many ticking time bombs that never actually exploded, crises that were averted because either the economy was sailing along, the president's tweets were papered over. But now we are in a crisis moment where these decisions matter.\n\nAnd when I look back on what the president did or did not do, one major piece of behavior is his attack on what some might call the steady state, the career civil servants across the government who work for multiple presidents and bring expertise. The president has driven a lot of those people away. That has weakened the response across government. It has made it harder to coordinate some of these efforts. And in this current moment, there were teams that were either cut or turned away or minimized that could have been useful to fighting a pandemic.\n\nGROSS: Are there cuts the Trump administration made to the public health infrastructure that have left us more undefended? For example, wasn't there a National Security Council health task force that was disbanded under Trump?\n\nDIAMOND: That's right. The president famously axed a team in the White House about two years ago that was focused specifically on pandemic preparedness. He cut funding for a program that predicted when viruses could jump from animals to humans basically around the same time that this new coronavirus appears to have jumped from animals to humans in China. And there are big parts of the bureaucracy that he has either tried to cut or otherwise alienated and driven people away. I do think, Terry, it's possible that some of these moves have been overly emphasized. Several officials pointed out to me that the White House pandemic preparedness team was made up of just three or four people. And if that's the dividing line between a pandemic or not, the United States is perhaps more vulnerable than we realize. And we still have career scientists like Tony Fauci, who's clearly a star, working to fight this outbreak. But it does come back to the president bigger picture. He's chased off experts when we need them most, and he's claimed that he can get scientists back when he needs them, which is just not true.\n\nGROSS: Something I found very interesting - and I'd love to hear your take on this - is that Tucker Carlson, who, of course, has a show weekday nights on Fox News - he has been one of Trump's strongest advocates. And Trump seems to listen, you know, to watch Tucker Carlson's show. So I don't know if he said this on the air, but I was on the Fox News website, and he had something in print on the website that was headlined, The Coronavirus Will Get Worse. Our Leaders Need To Stop Lying About That. And that was Tuesday of this week. And by our leaders, I will assume he means people in the Trump administration and perhaps the president himself. What do you make of that?\n\nDIAMOND: Well, I haven't seen Tucker Carlson's piece, but I will say that the president has made a number of false claims, spread misinformation and frankly has hindered the overall government response, whether that was the president claiming that the number of cases would go from 15 - which was a number that he fixated on based on the number of Americans who were initially detected in the early weeks to have come back from China or perhaps had a close relationship to someone who had returned from China where the infection had originally spread - the president maintaining that number of infected Americans would quickly go to near zero, which - every official I talked to said was not the case. Officials have been preparing for two months for this to sweep across the United States, and the president misled the American people by suggesting that this was under control when, by all accounts, it was never going to be.\n\nThe president also has taken multiple opportunities at press conferences to riff on things that frankly have no relevance to the coronavirus fight. The press conference he gave about a week ago at the Centers for Disease Control was so rambling and wide-ranging that Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Sen. Ed Markey are asking Mike Pence to explain what the president was even talking about when the president, at one point, appeared to compare CDC's response to the coronavirus outbreak to how the media and Democrats treated his impeachment, a comparison that doesn't make a lot of sense both in reflection and also in the moment. He has also created an environment where his aides have been afraid to tell him bad news, and that has skewed what the Trump administration ends up pursuing. If the president is only willing to look at the most optimistic scenario, it makes it very hard to do worst-case planning.\n\nGROSS: My guest is Dan Diamond, a reporter for Politico who has been investigating the Trump administration's response to the coronavirus. After a break, we'll talk about the members of the administration who are in charge of managing the crisis and what their backgrounds are and what their track records have been. I'm Terry Gross, and this is FRESH AIR.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF JOHN WOJCIECHOWSKI'S TWIRL)\n\nGROSS: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. Let's get back to my interview with Dan Diamond, a political reporter who has been investigating the Trump administration's response to the coronavirus. Diamond has been covering health care policy and politics for about 10 years. He's been writing about how President Trump and some members of his administration have mismanaged the coronavirus outbreak, helping fuel the crisis.\n\nSo how America responds to the coronavirus is in the hands of people most Americans don't know much about. So let's take a look at who are some of our health policy leaders right now, what their backgrounds are and what they're doing. Let's start with Alex Azar, who's the head of Health and Human Services. He took over after Tom Price was forced out, and he was forced out in large part because of an investigative article that you did showing that he'd used government funds for a private jet.\n\nDIAMOND: The Tom Price exit at the health department really was the inciting incident for so many feuds that continue today. And, yes, Politico did a series of investigative stories that led to his ouster about 10 days after our first story. And I say our because I was teamed up with my wonderful colleague Rachana Pradhan. Alex Azar has been like the Forrest Gump of Republican politics, where, if you were making a clip reel of the past 25 years, Azar would pop up in so many notable moments. He clerked for conservative Justice Antonin Scalia on the Supreme Court. He worked on the Whitewater investigation of President Bill Clinton. And then he was a lawyer working on the Florida recount in 2000, Bush v. Gore. Because Bush won, Alex Azar was rewarded with senior jobs in the Bush administration, ending up as the No. 2 official at the health department before he then went and worked in the private sector at Eli Lilly, a major pharmaceutical company.\n\nWhat's also interesting about Alex Azar isn't just the jobs he had. It's the people he met along the way. When President Trump chose Brett Kavanaugh to be on the Supreme Court a few years ago, Alex Azar was at the celebration for Kavanaugh. The two of them are very, very close. On the Whitewater investigation, both of them - Azar and Kavanaugh - worked with another man named Rod Rosenstein, who ended up helping lead investigations into President Trump in the past few years. And Azar are also became friends with young conservatives in the 1990s and 2000s, like Laura Ingraham, who is now the Fox News host who, when Alex Azar and the health department are criticized, has been a force pushing back and inviting the secretary on her show to help him get his side of the story out. Overall, Secretary Azar has brought order to a health department that was very dysfunctional when he arrived, but his management style has similarly alienated people like Seema Verma, the surgeon general and many others too.\n\nGROSS: What is it about his management style that's so alienating?\n\nDIAMOND: Well, it depends who you talk to because some would say he's the manager that the health department needs, that he has put difficult performers in line and managed out the biggest problems. But his critics would say that Alex Azar doesn't brook (ph) folks who might be ambitious and have ideas different from him and cuts them out entirely.\n\nGROSS: My impression is that he is anti-abortion. He has described HHS as the department of life. He described the Trump administration as the most pro-life administration in the country's history. He said that in a very admiring way. How has that affected him as the leader of HHS? And was he appointed in part because of his anti-abortion position?\n\nDIAMOND: Secretary Azar has had private views of being anti-abortion for years and years. I've talked to friends and colleagues who say what he has said recently in public is what he has thought in private for decades. What I think is notable, Terry, is that Alex Azar has leaned into his anti-abortion thoughts and bona fides at a moment when his job was most at risk. Secretary Azar has led the health department for two years. The most significant statements he's made about the health department being the department of life, giving very effusive interviews where he praises the president's crackdown on abortion funding, for instance, that's happened a lot in the past few months because his own job was so at risk, I've been told, that he was appealing to a core group of supporters for President Trump and, in doing these interviews, really trying to shore up support for his position.\n\nWhat that has meant for Azar is he's gotten a boost within the administration and within this core group of Trump supporters. But at the same time, he's further alienated a health department where most career health professionals don't share these views. They don't think that the Trump administration should be cracking down on funding for abortion clinics and also broader reproductive health strategies around the country. But it seems like Secretary Azar has made the calculation that it's better to appeal to the anti-abortion constituency at present even if that means turning off some of the people who work directly for him.\n\nGROSS: So you've reported that both Alex Azar, the head of Health and Human Services, and Seema Verma, the head of Medicare and Medicaid, both really go out of their way to try to please Trump. They are also - Verma and Azar - kind of at war with each other.\n\nDIAMOND: Oh, not kind of; they're absolutely fighting it out.\n\nGROSS: OK. Thank you for the (laughter) clarification. So how does their desire to please Trump feed into both how they're handling the epidemic and feed into the feud that they're having with each other? And that feud is very distracting from the real job at hand, which is dealing with the epidemic.\n\nDIAMOND: President Trump has made it clear through his actions, through his tweets, that an official's place in his administration can be decided in a moment. And I think that has leaders like Alex Azar and Seema Verma constantly aware that they need to be reinforcing their relationship with the president, whether that means going on TV, as Alex Azar has done for months and months, and immediately praising the president as the bravest leader on hospital price transparency or the most courageous leader in fighting the drug industry. Seema Verma has also been effusive of about the president and looking to praise him at every turn in a way that we would not have seen during the Obama administration or even during the George W. Bush administration.\n\nMore recently, the two of them have owned different parts of President Trump's healthcare agenda. Seema Verma was tasked with coming up with the replacement to Obamacare. That's a job that she really wanted. It got her a lot of face time with President Trump - so far has not been able to deliver on that. And her team would say, her allies would say that Secretary Azar has undermined her in that effort by taking potshots at the plan and doing other things to slow down her efforts to come up with a replacement. To be fair, Republicans have tried and failed to replace Obamacare for years. This is not just a Seema Verma issue.\n\nMeanwhile, Alex Azar has been the point person on President Trump's goal of lowering drug prices. Azar has pitched himself as the fixer. He worked in the drug industry at Eli Lilly, and now he knows all the secrets and is going to close all the loopholes. But so far, a lot of the plans that the Trump administration has put forward have either fallen apart, been blocked in the courts, have yet to take effect. So Alex Azar also hasn't been able to deliver. And that means both of them are conscious, Azar and Verma, of the need to show Trump that they are delivering. And they have competed at times for taking credit on other priorities, like hospital price transparency.\n\nWhen the coronavirus task force was being assembled and Alex Azar became the leader, my understanding is he did box out Seema Verma. He didn't push to have her on the team, even though she oversees these programs, like Medicare, like Medicaid, where many millions of Americans who are covered by those programs now will want to go test - be tested for coronavirus. And their feud dates back to a simple workplace fight, I think, which is - Alex Azar is technically Seema Verma's boss, but Seema Verma has done a lot of things to go around her boss, and Azar simply does not abide that.\n\nGROSS: Well, let's take a short break here, and then we'll talk some more.

And if you're just joining us, my guest is Dan Diamond, a reporter for Politico who investigates health care policy and politics, and he's been covering the Trump administration's response to the coronavirus.\n\nSo you've reported that Alex Azar of Health and Human Services and Seema Verma of Medicare and Medicaid both want to please President Trump. How have they gone about trying to please him during this period of the epidemic? And is that leading them to say or do things that they otherwise wouldn't do? In other words, are they doing things that shouldn't be done or needn't be done or are unnecessarily time-consuming just because they want to stay in Trump's good graces?\n\nDIAMOND: I think they are both trying to show that they're incredibly active and aggressive in public, but some of the decisions behind the scenes haven't always reflected the best judgment of career professionals. In the case of Alex Azar, he did go to the president in January. He did push past resistance from the president's political aides to warn the president the new coronavirus could be a major problem. There were aides around Trump - Kellyanne Conway had some skepticism at times that this was something that needed to be a presidential priority.\n\nBut at the same time, Secretary Azar has not always given the president the worst-case scenario of what could happen. My understanding is he did not push to do aggressive additional testing in recent weeks, and that's partly because more testing might have led to more cases being discovered of coronavirus outbreak, and the president had made clear - the lower the numbers on coronavirus, the better for the president, the better for his potential reelection this fall.\n\nMeanwhile, Seema Verma, since being added to the team, has announced all kinds of actions that could be seen as cracking down on the problem - dispatching a team of investigators to Washington state, where there has been a major outbreak of corona virus, predominantly in local nursing homes. But I've talked to officials who say that Seema Verma, in an effort to show that she's cracking down, may actually be creating more problems by having her investigators demanding paperwork, demanding answers at a moment when these nursing home officials are just trying to provide basic patient care to people who have been infected by coronavirus.\n\nGROSS: Well, let's take a look at Robert Redfield, who's the head of the Centers for Disease Control. And he was a well-known AIDS researcher, and you say he was a favorite of Christian conservatives when Trump appointed him in 2018. He helped fight HIV-AIDS in Africa, but his approach was to emphasize abstinence and to recommend condoms only as a last resort. Can you tell us more about that?\n\nDIAMOND: Dr. Redfield emerged in the 1980s and 1990s during the AIDS epidemic, and he was seen in some corners as a very important figure in fighting the AIDS epidemic for his willingness to attack this problem as a scientist at a moment when some conservatives were turning away. But he did highlight abstinence as the best preventive measure, saying that the best way to avoid AIDS was holding off on sex until marriage. He wrote the introduction to a book about 30 years ago called Christians In The Age Of Aids, where he conflated the public health problem of spreading AIDS and HIV with living in a biblical way and the need to, I quote, reject false prophets who were suggesting that Americans should use condoms and free needles.\n\nThose views, Redfield has said more recently, are things that he has broadened from. He has walked away from some of those earlier, stricter positions. But Redfield is still seen in some corners as a suboptimal leader of our public health agency, and it's not just because of these views; it's because of his lack of high-end management experience. If you're looking at some of the breakdowns in fighting the coronavirus outbreak, they may not be because Dr. Redfield had these views 30 years ago; they may be more likely that he is not in position to make big, sweeping and aggressive decisions in the middle of an outbreak, which is tough for anyone but certainly a career scientist who may not have been in a management role like this one.\n\nGROSS: So is there a decision, for better or worse, that Redfield was largely responsible for that has changed the course of the epidemic in the U.S. for better or worse?\n\nDIAMOND: It's hard to know in the middle of the crisis. But I do think, Terry, we've seen a pattern of behavior from CDC that's been troubling. The failure to roll out lab tests as promised - that's a CDC problem. The failure to plan ahead for shortfalls in the materials needed to work on tests in the future - that's something that CDC director Redfield admitted this week. And at some level, that goes to the leader. These are management decisions, whether the organization is being proactive and running smoothly or whether it's in chaos at a moment when we really need to count on the CDC to protect us.\n\nGROSS: Vice President Pence not only is now leading the task force against the coronavirus, he also has close ties to several people in key health positions right now. Seema Verma, who is the head of Medicare and Medicaid, was his health care consultant when he was the governor of Indiana. Jerome Adams, who is the surgeon general, was in the Pence administration. When Alex Azar was in Indiana as a senior executive at the pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly, he became connected to Mike Pence.\n\nSo it seems like Mike Pence has been very influential on several levels in dealing with the coronavirus and in working with the people and maybe even helping appoint the people connected with fighting the virus now. Let's look at Pence's own health care policy in terms of epidemiology when he was the governor of Indiana. So tell us a few key things about Pence in Indiana.\n\nDIAMOND: When Mike Pence was governor in Indiana, there was a major outbreak of HIV, an outbreak that public health officials said was largely preventable. One step that Pence could have taken was allowing for needle exchange so people who were infected with HIV and injecting drugs wouldn't necessarily infect others. But as governor, Pence held off on that. That was seen as a policy by lots of conservatives as something that was essentially rewarding drug users and not a position that Pence wanted to get behind. The local Planned Parenthood clinic had been closed because of state cuts that Pence supported. Planned Parenthood does more than provide abortions; it can help in a public health crisis by providing low-cost or free services like HIV testing.\n\nWhile Pence eventually pushed the right measures, the fact that it took him weeks to do so was really concerning at the time. And when he was named to lead the coronavirus task force, a lot of people rightly seized on that episode as an example of an epidemic, an outbreak that he did too little to stop.\n\nBut I think, Terry, there's also a counterargument. Pence learned from that outbreak that the measures that he had in place were wrong and that there needed to be a more aggressive response. He worked with Jerome Adams, at the time his health commissioner, to take those right measures. Now Jerome Adams is on the task force. And I think if there's a silver lining, it's that that experience six years ago in Indiana could be a way for Mike Pence to see a path forward on the need for aggressive action on coronavirus.\n\nGROSS: If you're just joining us, my guest is Dan Diamond. He's a reporter for Politico who investigates health care policy and politics, including the Trump administration's response to the coronavirus. We'll be right back after a short break. This is FRESH AIR.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF AARON PARKS' SMALL PLANET)\n\nGROSS: This is FRESH AIR. If you're just joining us, my guest is Dan Diamond, a reporter for Politico. He investigates health care policy and politics, including the Trump administration's response to the coronavirus.\n\nIn your work covering the coronavirus epidemic, you've been covering the official government response, trying to find out what's happening behind the scenes, and you've also written about certain feuds within the department, like, you know, within the Trump administration and how those feuds are contributing to how the Trump administration is handling the epidemic. And just this week, one of the stories that you broke was about this email breakdown in Medicare and Medicaid. And there wasn't enough communication about the email breakdown, so Medicare and Medicaid missed a certain number of emails. They were out of the loop for a while. I mean, that just contributed to the general chaos. So what's the larger significance of stories like that?\n\nDIAMOND: HHS, the health department, was in the middle of navigating the emergency funding package that they were going to ask Congress to supply to fight coronavirus. This was about two weeks ago. And the day that they were hammering this out, officials realized their emails weren't working; their emails had crashed - not just for 20 minutes or two hours, but in some cases up to 11 hours.\n\nAnd the reason those emails crashed was because Seema Verma's part of the department had run this massive email test at the exact same time without telling anyone, and it took down the system. This was the latest in a series of different IT decisions that Seema Verma and her team had made. It led to frustration in the moment and some bad feelings to the point that the career IT division of the health department - so these are not Trump appointees; these are people who have worked in the government for years - made the call to just take away email responsibility from Seema Verma and assign it to a different part of HHS.\n\nThat story in and of itself might not be a big deal except for what it says about what is happening inside the health department, where different parts of the team are not talking to each other. And it also reveals what the priorities are. After I started reporting the story, I was told that Seema Verma got really upset not just about my report but that she had lost control of her emails and, in the middle of this crisis, was negotiating with the White House, trying to get the White House to intervene on giving her her email back. I'm not sure that these are the things that we want our senior health officials to spend time on as they're trying to fight coronavirus. And that's one of several examples I could give you from the past few weeks.\n\nGROSS: What's another?\n\nDIAMOND: About two weeks ago, my colleague Nancy Cook and I reported that the White House had soured on Alex Azar leading the coronavirus response. He was asked about it in congressional testimony because we broke the story while he was on Capitol Hill, waved it away by saying, you know, didn't trust anonymous sources in Politico. But by the end of the day, Mike Pence had replaced him. And by the next morning, there was a new coordinator brought in, Debbie Birx, to help run the response, too. That's what people saw in public.\n\nBehind the scenes, Azar and his team did know that he was at risk of being replaced, spent a fair amount of time just trying to shore up his standing, calling officials at the White House, on Capitol Hill, just trying to make sure that he didn't lose the job of running the coronavirus response. At that point, we were several weeks into fighting this thing. And in a working, functional administration, the amount of effort just to keep a job, just to fend off these internal fights, I don't know if that would be happening. Since Day 1, there were people trying to get him replaced as the leader of this effort. And Alex Azar also had to spend a lot of political capital fighting to keep this job at a time when we probably would want his efforts focused elsewhere.\n\nGROSS: Like on fighting the virus, not on fighting for his job (laughter).\n\nDIAMOND: Yes, on fighting the threat to the American people, not fighting who has which title.\n\nGROSS: Is the information you're getting saying, basically, that it's too late to prevent a wide outbreak in the U.S.?\n\nDIAMOND: The information that I have is the outbreak is almost certainly coming at some level, but what health officials can still do is slow the outbreak, mitigate the outbreak, for a bunch of very good reasons. One reason is because there's only so much capacity in the system if everyone gets sick or significant amounts of people get sick at the same time.\n\nIn a previous life, I worked for a hospital consulting firm, and hospitals used to have many more beds than they do now. They very aggressively have cut back on their capacity because they didn't want to have a lot of empty wards that they weren't using. That may make sense at normal times, but in a crisis moment, it means there's only so many beds to go around. Health officials don't want a crunch of people rushing to the hospital at the same time. It's bad for coronavirus patients, and it's just as bad for everyone else if doctors are spread thin and worn down.\n\nThe efforts that are now at play are figuring out where the outbreaks are, imposing quarantines in some cases to try and stop spread or slow it and, simultaneously, work on vaccines or treatments. But those might be months and months away. So in the interim, because the population does not have immunity, it's thought that the coronavirus will spread either by people already in the United States, people coming from different countries - given that the outbreaks are all around the world now. There's very little we can do other than all quarantine ourselves in our homes, and that's no way to live.\n\nGROSS: All right, well, thank you so much for your reporting, and thank you for being on our show.

SOS: Puerto Rico Is Losing Doctors, Leaving Patients Stranded\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Ricardo Arduengo/AP Ricardo Arduengo/AP\n\nPuerto Rico is losing people. Due to a decade-long recession, more than 50,000 residents leave the U.S. territory each year--most for jobs and new lives on the mainland. This issue is especially affecting healthcare, where it's estimated that at least one doctor leaves Puerto Rico every day.\n\nThe mass exodus of doctors is creating vacancies that are hard to fill and waiting lists for patient care. Dr. Antonio Peraza is among those doctors who recently left for the mainland. He specializes in internal medicine and for nearly 14 years, had a private practice in Bayamon, Puerto Rico.\n\nHis was a wrenching decision to close his practice and take a job offer in Miami, Florida.\n\nI wish you could have seen my patients. My patients, the day I told them I was going to close my office, they cried, Dr. Antonio Peraza says. I felt like I was betraying them.\n\nFor decades, long before Obamacare, Puerto Rico has had a government-run healthcare system that provides coverage for nearly everyone on the island. It offers generous benefits, but has never been adequately funded.\n\nNearly two-thirds of the island's residents are covered by Medicaid or Medicare. But both of those programs cap payments to Puerto Rico at levels far below what the states receive.\n\nAnd in the last few years, Peraza says Medicare payments—already low—have been cut further.\n\nWhat they have been doing unfortunately is taking these Medicare cuts and passing them along to providers and the patients. Which, we are the weakest link of the chain, Dr. Peraza says.\n\nFaced with a declining income, Peraza decided to move to Florida and sell his office building and practice in Bayamon. But so far he says, he hasn't found a doctor interested in buying him out.\n\nBecause most of them are in the same plan as I am doing. Maybe they are a little behind. Plan B is you have to leave the island because there's no other way, there's no choice, he says.\n\nCongress is working on a plan to help Puerto Rico fix its economic problems and avoid defaulting on its more than $72 billion debt. Puerto Rican officials are hoping the plan will also include an increase in Medicare and Medicaid funding.\n\nMeantime, the exodus of doctors, nurses and other healthcare professionals is making it hard for hospitals and clinics on the island to fill vacant positions. Puerto Rico already had a shortage of specialists.\n\nDomingo Cruz Vivaldi is vice-president of San Jorge Children's Hospital in San Juan and he says, with so many doctors leaving, it's getting worse.\n\nTo see an adult rheumatologist right now, today, the waiting period it can be four to five months. And some of them are moving out. And then to replace those physicians, it takes a decade, Cruz Vivaldi says.\n\nThe outlook is no better for young doctors just starting their careers. At the University of Puerto Rico, one of four medical schools on the island, Manuel Rodriguez is doing a residency in orthopedic surgery. He says of his friends, only about one in five plan on staying in Puerto Rico to practice.\n\nI would love to stay here, Rodriguez says. But seeing the reality we live every day here with the resources that the hospital has, with the resources that the government has. It's difficult to think that we're going to stay here in Puerto Rico.\n\nAfter his residency, Rodriguez says he'll look for a fellowship on the mainland. Fourth year medical student Milagros Lopez says opportunities and pay are better there, but Puerto Rico is home.\n\nThere's a huge economic incentive to stay away, which is a sad, sad truth. But the thing is, we are a different group of people, Lopez says. This has our home, our family, our language. So, I think there is an attachment that's kind of unavoidable there.\n\nLopez says she hopes to come back to Puerto Rico after completing a fellowship on the mainland, but knows life might intervene. Her brother left for a surgical fellowship in the states five years ago, she says. Today, he's married, has two kids and lives in Detroit.
Issues Dividing Democrats And Republicans In Pennsylvania\n\nBoth major parties are counting on some of their core constituents to turn out and vote on Tuesday. We'll hear from some of those people about what's motivating them this election season.\n\nMICHEL MARTIN, HOST:\n\nNow, we started the program hearing about the final days of this very competitive election season. And here is where we want to have a reality check. The fact is, in recent decades, most Americans who are eligible to vote in the midterm elections don't.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: I don't feel like I'm educated enough to follow the politicians. You know, I don't - I just - it's just not my thing.\n\nMARTIN: In a few minutes, we're going to hear more about why people say they don't vote. But first, we want to talk about the other people - the people the major political parties are sure will come out - their core constituencies, often referred to as the base. We were traveling across Pennsylvania last week. We met people who met that description.\n\nFor the Democrats in many parts of the country, that means black women. They are known to work hard for candidates they support, network like crazy and, most of all, show up on Election Day, which perfectly describes three women we met in Philadelphia who became friends through their membership in The Links.\n\nFounded in Philadelphia in the 1940s, it now boasts some 15,000 members across the country, all women of color who are dedicated to community service and very committed to staying informed about the issues. The group is nonpartisan, but individual members are certainly free to express their opinions, which they did when they gathered at the home of Terri Dean in Northwest Philadelphia. She was on the phone organizing a voter education program for college students even as she was laying out sandwiches, cookies and fruit for us and fellow Links members Mariska Bogle and Leah Smith Sheppard. And, when they finally sat down, they told us why they never miss a chance to vote.\n\nTERRI DEAN: Because it's my civic duty and because our ancestors died for this right - for us to be able to vote - and because I do believe that my vote counts.\n\nMARTIN: You do believe that.\n\nDEAN: ...Collectively with others, obviously. But I do believe my vote is my voice.\n\nMARTIN: And, Mariska, what about you? Do you vote routinely? Do you...\n\nMARISKA BOGLE: I vote routinely. And I...\n\nMARTIN: You are going to vote this time.\n\nBOGLE: ...Agree in the fact that my ancestors did die fighting for the right to vote - and women as well - not just my ancestors, but women. So it's my duty, and that's why I do vote. Does my vote count? I am not so sure it does. I have some challenges with the Electoral College. And so that's one of my - thinking of how we need to look at that differently. But it's what I should do, and I do it.\n\nMARTIN: Leah, what about you? Do you vote and routinely and...\n\nLEAH SMITH SHEPPARD: I do vote routinely. I grew up going into the voting booth with my parents, so I really don't know any different from elementary school all the way through, you know, high school. My parents were divorced, so sometimes I'd go with my dad, sometimes I went with my mom. But we always went. So it was like getting a driver's license. I couldn't wait 'til it was my turn to go in and push my own buttons or whatever. So yeah, that is something that I do, something that I'm committed to do. And, like Terri, I go every time.\n\nMARTIN: Are you all interested in this election - just talking about the midterm election coming up? I mean, one of the - it's interesting to talk to you all because you all vote no matter what. But do you sense a lot of interest in this election, perhaps unusually so? Anybody?\n\nSHEPPARD: Sure. It's a bit of shock and awe after 11-9 or 11-8 or whatever we're saying now about 2016. I think people were in a bit of shock, and I think that people are seeing that, you know, maybe they never paid that much attention to the midterms, but they realize that people's terms can end. You can actually effectively vote someone out of office.\n\nMARTIN: We've noted earlier that African-American women have become understood to be a key part of the Democratic constituency, right - for example, the special election in Alabama. There are analysts who give African American women credit for winning that election for Doug Jones. And I just wanted to ask, do you think your concerns are being addressed?\n\nDEAN: Part of me says my concerns are no different than anybody else's concerns. I'm concerned about criminal justice reform. I'm concerned about the disproportionate negative treatment of men of color. And I don't feel those concerns are being addressed. I think they're being talked about, but I don't think they're being addressed.\n\nAnd I've seen the treatment of African-American men in this country when I've seen issues of education, you know, being denied adequate funding for education in the public schools. You know, which is - those are where our kids benefit the most. And I don't see it happening yet, but I have faith that, at some point, it will have to happen because if we continue to exercise our power and flex our muscle and own the fact that we as African-American women are moving this needle forward for the Democratic Party, then yeah - we will start to see some progress being made.\n\nMARTIN: Leah, what about you?\n\nSHEPPARD: I do not feel that the issues are being addressed. One of my issues is health care reform. And I'm a cancer survivor, so it was very important to me to know that the next - when I'm ready to retire or the next job I take or whatever that I'm not going to be declined from any insurance or health care because I have a preexisting condition.\n\nAnd I feel like, over the past, you know, two to four years, the conversations on the Republican side have been more about really dismantling the legacy of President Obama and just stripping away anything that has to do with, quote-unquote, Obamacare as opposed to hearing the concerns of people in rural America, suburban America, in the inner cities. Most people are saying the same things about health care, but I feel like Washington isn't listening.\n\nMARTIN: Well, that seems kind of a bummer, though. I mean - but so - but you all don't seem bummed out. I mean, you're - what you're saying is you really don't...\n\nSHEPPARD: Keep hope alive.\n\nMARTIN: ...Feel very good about...\n\nSHEPPARD: (Laughter) Keep hope alive.\n\nMARTIN: ...Where - so what is keeping hope alive? Because - is it just your personality? Is it just...\n\nSHEPPARD: I think what's keeping hope alive is that we believe a change is going to come. We feel like we are going through a season right now but that we will come out of it. And it will take deliberate action, decisive behavior. And I think it will take motivation for people to stay involved and stay focused and be engaged. But we are in a season of change. And I think we stay positive because we understand what happens when you go through the wilderness and come out on the other side.\n\nMARTIN: Then we headed to Chapman, Pa. It's rural, about two hours from Philadelphia. The population there is less than 200 people and, according to the latest census, it's more than 98 percent white. And that's where we met Dottie Niklos.\n\nDOTTIE NIKLOS: I'm just Dottie. And, in this area, there's no last name for me. It's just, have you seen Dottie?\n\nMARTIN: She is an active member of the Northhampton County Republican Committee, and it shows. Her front lawn is crowded with signs for local Republicans running in all sorts of races. There are more signs stacked in the driveway.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: You've got enough yard signs, you think? I don't think you have enough.\n\nNIKLOS: Oh, well, I have a few more in the garage.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: You have a few more in the garage. How are you?\n\nMARTIN: And when we step inside her home filled with family heirlooms, another spread awaits. Homemade pumpkin roll cookies and hot coffee are laid out in the dining room while Fox News plays in the den. And, just like the ladies we met in Philadelphia, Dottie always votes.\n\nMARTIN: Because it's my country, and it's my duty, and it's a privilege, and there's so many people in the world that don't get to choose their leaders.\n\nMARTIN: Dottie is joined by her friends Judith Ladonis (ph) and Sandra Dech (ph). I asked Dottie and Sandra about their biggest concerns in advance of the election, and the answers are very different from the ones we heard back in Philly.\n\nNIKLOS: National security, including terrorism, immigration and the rule of law in the country.\n\nMARTIN: And what about you, Ms. Sandra?\n\nSANDRA DECH: And I'm strongly against socialism, so I feel I have to vote for the candidate that is more for a free United States. There is a billboard on 22 - two billboards with Gov. Wolf's picture and a socialist Pennsylvania.\n\nMARTIN: Sandra is referring to a billboard paid for by Republican candidate Scott Wagner. It implies falsely that the Democratic candidate is running as a socialist. Like a lot of people we spoke to in Pennsylvania, these ladies told us that the tone of the politics in the U.S. concerns them. They say President Trump wasn't their first choice in 2016, but they came around once he started implementing policies they support. So I asked them how they feel when President Trump says things like this.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: So if you see somebody getting ready to throw a tomato, knock the crap out of them, would you? Seriously.\n\n(CHEERING)\n\nTRUMP: OK? Just knock the hell - I promise you I will pay for the legal fees. I promise. I promise.\n\nMARTIN: OK, but how do you square Mr. Trump's own conduct during the - starting in the campaign where he was encouraging people to beat up protesters saying he'd pay their legal bills, more people need to be body-slammed...\n\nNIKLOS: I never heard that.\n\nMARTIN: ...Just last - you never heard that?\n\nNIKLOS: Never heard that.\n\nMARTIN: You never heard that.\n\nNIKLOS: And I watch...\n\nMARTIN: OK.\n\nNIKLOS: ...Watch all kinds of channels.\n\nMARTIN: Do you really? OK.\n\nNIKLOS: Yes.\n\nMARTIN: OK, well - OK. But...\n\nNIKLOS: And I read all kinds of websites, but I never saw that.\n\nDECH: Would you rather have a polished politician who's not doing what you want? Or would you rather have one who's not a polished politician, who is a businessman who just says what he wants? Maybe there's some things I wish he would kind of, you know, use a little more tact on. But otherwise, he's getting the job done.\n\nMARTIN: Ms. Dottie?\n\nNIKLOS: I see mobs in the street. And I see what they did to Brett Kavanaugh - where his children had death threats and had to be taken to school in an armoured van. They did $10,000 worth of damage to his house. He couldn't take his family to church. Michelle Obama, God bless her, she said, when they go low, we go high. Well, now, all of a sudden, it's the opposite. It's, when they go low, we kick them.\n\nMARTIN: As you've heard, the ladies echoed some of the talking points that Republican candidates and their surrogates have been making on the campaign trail, even repeating some debunked stories, like the point about Brett Kavanaugh's house being damaged by left-wing protesters. That's not true. But it led me to ask about the #MeToo movement that was brought up during that contentious confirmation hearing and has been mentioned as a motivating factor for some women to cross party lines to vote for Democrats in 2018.\n\nNIKLOS: My thought is that women can take care of themselves. They don't have to hate men. I have been approached in inappropriate ways. I've decked a few men. I'm a retired chef. I've decked a couple of waiters.\n\nMARTIN: And you had sharp knives, too.\n\nNIKLOS: Well, they thought they could...\n\nMARTIN: And fire.\n\nNIKLOS: They thought they could pinch me, and I just turned around, and that was - you come back at them strong. And, no, I have been approached with, would you like to have this promotion? Not at that price.\n\nMARTIN: So you're saying you don't understand it - like, why...\n\nNIKLOS: I don't - no. My theory is that the feminist movement at one time was very important because women were being held down. I think women have complete largesse today. They can go where they want. They can do what they want. They can get an education. They can take care of their families. We can stay home with our children if we want. We can do that. We can take a year off. We can do whatever we want. I'm really not into women running around with those silly pink pussy hats on. What does #MeToo mean? It's me. It's not us. It's not for the better good. It's for me - me too.\n\nMARTIN: So that's not a factor in your thinking for...\n\nNIKLOS: My...\n\nMARTIN: ...In choosing a candidate.\n\nNIKLOS: You know, my factor is what's good for my country, what's good for the family, what's good for my community. I may be crazy, but I think that it's just a community. And if we're all - if we're all pulling for ourselves and working together, we're going to be successful.\n\nMARTIN: Ms. Judith, any thoughts about #MeToo? Does it factor into your thinking politically at all?\n\nJUDITH LADONIS: It really does not. I have known a lot of women who have been victims, and I've also known a lot of women who have been humiliated into dropping charges and, you know, and that sort of thing. And they have my complete sympathy with that. But I'm not very comfortable with unlimited times to prosecute people. But I don't know enough about it to make a good decision on it.\n\nMARTIN: That was Judith Ladonis, Dottie Niklos and Sandra Dech speaking to us in Chapman, Pa.\n\nCopyright © 2018 NPR.

Senate Democrats Pass 'Nuclear Option' To Cut Confirmation Gridlock\n\nSenate Democrats, furious about Republicans blocking President Obama's judicial and executive branch nominations, took a dramatic and historic step Thursday. They voted to detonate the so-called nuclear option, which will curb filibusters on most nominations, allowing them to be approved by majority vote.\n\nROBERT SIEGEL, HOST:\n\nThis is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED from NPR News. I'm Robert Siegel.\n\nMELISSA BLOCK, HOST:\n\nAnd I'm Melissa Block.\n\nSenate Democrats went nuclear this afternoon. They turned to the so-called nuclear option - long a threat, today a reality. The change in Senate rules allows most presidential nominations to clear the Senate with a simple majority vote. As NPR's Ailsa Chang reports, the historic move comes after Republicans blocked a series of President Obama's nominees to the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.\n\nAILSA CHANG, BYLINE: A lot of Republicans were scoffing for months, insisting that Democrats would never detonate this bomb because going nuclear would come back to haunt them when there's a Republican White House and a Republican majority in the Senate, and when the Republicans want to ram through their own nominations by a simple majority vote.\n\nBob Corker of Tennessee had told me only a few weeks ago, he didn't take the Democrats' threat seriously. But today...\n\nSENATOR BOB CORKER: At some point, you have to just throw up your hands and say, look, they're going to use brute, raw force to get what they wish. Let's face it. I mean, this is about the D.C. Circuit.\n\nCHANG: Absolutely, said President Obama. You bet this is about the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.\n\nPRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: Four of President Bush's six nominees to this court were confirmed. Four out of five of my nominees to this court have been obstructed. So the vote today, I think, is an indication that a majority of senators believe, as I believe, that enough is enough.\n\nCHANG: This morning, all senators were hastily summoned to the chamber before the session officially opened, a sign that Majority Leader Harry Reid really was going to pull the trigger. He would push through a Senate rules change that would let presidential nominations, except for the Supreme Court, get through by a simple majority vote rather than by the 60 votes required to shut down a filibuster.\n\nIt's time to get the Senate working again, not for the good of the current Democratic majority or some future Republican majority, but for the good of the United States of America.\n\nAt this point, Reid said, he wouldn't be surprised if Republicans started blocking the Senate chaplain from getting through morning prayers. The last straw for Democrats was watching their Republican colleagues block the D.C. Circuit nominations simply by arguing that the court didn't have the caseload to justify filling the last three of its 11 seats.\n\nDick Durbin of Illinois said what was really going on was about stopping the president from tilting the balance among active judges, who are now evenly divided between Democratic and Republican appointees.\n\nSENATOR DICK DURBIN: Not a single person on the Republican side stood up to criticize their qualifications for the job. It had nothing to do with their qualifications. It was to deny President Obama an opportunity to fill these slots on the court.\n\nCHANG: But today, Republicans were ready with their own accusations about ulterior motives. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said Reid's decision to invoke the nuclear option was simply an attempt to distract the public from an issue garnering political points for Republicans, the botched rollout of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nSENATOR MITCH MCCONNELL: It doesn't distract people from Obamacare, it reminds them of Obamacare. It reminds them of all the broken promises. It reminds them of the power grab.\n\nCHANG: But many Republicans argued something deeper was happening. Senate Democrats had altered the fundamental character of their chamber. John McCain of Arizona referenced something George Washington is said tp have told Thomas Jefferson once: That the Senate was set up to cool the hot-headed impulses of the more populist House just as a saucer cools hot tea.\n\nSENATOR JOHN MCCAIN: We put a break on particularly things that seem to be moving too quickly, and now we have just taken that away. We have now basically made us no different from the House of Representatives.\n\nCHANG: Back in July, there was a momentary truce between Democrats and Republicans. A few nominations sailed through after a late night summit in the old Senate Chamber, where Senate giants like Daniel Webster and Henry Clay forged great compromises a century and a half ago. No one today seemed interested in truces.\n\nAilsa Chang, NPR News, the Capitol.\n\nCopyright © 2013 NPR. All rights reserved.

Democrats Weigh Gravity Of Justice Kennedy's Retirement\n\nDavid Greene talks to Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota about the impact of Justice Anthony Kennedy's retirement from the Supreme Court in the run-up to midterm elections.\n\nDAVID GREENE, HOST:\n\nPresident Trump said last night he is hoping to choose a Supreme Court justice who might serve 40, maybe 45 years. And that speaks to the gravity of the decision facing Trump as he weighs his second Supreme Court nomination. This comes after Justice Anthony Kennedy announced his retirement yesterday. Kennedy was a swing vote on so many cases, especially involving social issues. So there is a chance for Trump to reshape the court for years to come. Senator Amy Klobuchar is in our studio. She's a Democrat from Minnesota.\n\nThanks for joining us, Senator.\n\nAMY KLOBUCHAR: Well, thanks, David. It's great to be on.\n\nGREENE: Well, this seemed to surprise everyone yesterday. Did you see this coming? Or where were you when you learned this news?\n\nKLOBUCHAR: (Laughter) Well, there were a lot of rumors about it, of course, for the last year. And in fact, when Justice Gorsuch was nominated people thought, well, maybe that will make Justice Kennedy feel very comfortable in retiring. And so it happened.\n\nGREENE: Explain to me the thinking that Gorsuch coming onto the court might give Kennedy the feeling that he could retire.\n\nKLOBUCHAR: Well, he had been his clerk. And people said that he liked him, and so I think that's what they thought. And you know, unfortunately, when I look at the Gorsuch nomination here, everything we thought - when you looked at his record before he got to the court and then when you looked at what he's done since, he has been the ideologue that we thought he would be. And that's what, of course, concerns me about who the next nominee should be and why I believe we should stick with the McConnell Rule from 2016. And any decision on this and any hearing should be after the election.\n\nGREENE: Well, let's talk about that so-called McConnell Rule - although Republicans like to call it the Biden rule, saying that it came originally from Joe Biden when he was in the Senate. But Senate Majority Mitch McConnell blocked Merrick Garland, President Obama's choice to replace Antonin Scalia, saying it was inappropriate in an election year and that the voices of Americans should be heard. Republicans are making a distinction right now, saying that was a presidential election; this is a midterm election. Why do you not see it differently?\n\nKLOBUCHAR: Well, first of all, I come armed with quotes here this morning. You have Leader McConnell sometimes said presidential year but often said things like, give the people a voice in the filling of this vacancy. Orrin Hatch - the Senate has every right to say, look, we are in a political year. We are not going to politicize this. We'll wait. Roger Wicker - elections have consequences. And the election this November will have consequences as to the type of Senate we have.\n\nGREENE: At some point, don't you have to draw the line and say that it's OK, at some point, to allow Supreme Court nominations to go through?\n\nKLOBUCHAR: Of course. But then you have something else. You have the fact that Justice Kennedy has been a voice of independence. Now, he has done many conservative things, like Citizens United and other cases. But then at other moments, you've seen this incredible spark of independence. You know? He wrote the marriage equality opinion. He was a deciding vote in upholding the central ruling of Roe v. Wade in 1992.\n\nGREENE: Do you really think the court might return to some of these issues? Because there is someone in the conservative camp saying that Democrats are fearmongering...\n\nKLOBUCHAR: Fearmongering? Look at the cases that are out there right now - in Texas, where the administration is arguing that we should get rid of the protection that says that insurance companies can't kick you off insurance just for having a pre-existing condition - that's something like half of America would be involved; the recent Ohio voting case where they basically kicked people off of the voting rolls because they hadn't voted in recent elections. All of these things that matter in people's lives have been affected by court decisions - major if/who you can marry, if you can go to school. These things matter.\n\nGREENE: Just a few seconds left - what leverage do Democrats have? You don't have a majority in the Senate. I mean, it sounds like...\n\nKLOBUCHAR: Yeah.\n\nGREENE: ...This process is just going to go forward. You don't have the votes, do you?\n\nKLOBUCHAR: OK. Well, we have, first of all, public persuasion. And look at this. We got Obamacare in place and kept it in place when we got three courageous Republicans to join us - Senator McCain, Senator Murkowski, Senator Collins. Depending on who the nominee is, they will weigh in. You've also got the process that we have in front of us and our ability to ask questions. And nominees have been withdrawn in the past.\n\nGREENE: Senator Amy Klobuchar, a Democrat from Minnesota.\n\nAlways a pleasure talking to you, Senator. Thank you very much.\n\nKLOBUCHAR: It was great to be on, David. Thank you.\n\nCopyright © 2018 NPR. All rights reserved.

Health Care Vote Could Threaten Republican House Majority\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Nicholas Kamm/AFP via Getty Images Nicholas Kamm/AFP via Getty Images\n\nAs soon as the House approved the GOP health care bill on Thursday, Democrats were working on using it against Republicans in next year's midterm elections.\n\nThey have this vote tattooed on them. This is a scar they carry, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi declared just after the American Health Care Act passed the House.\n\nJust to rub it in, many Democrats on the House floor began singing Na Na Hey Hey Kiss Him Goodbye to their colleagues across the aisle after the vote, a moment of schadenfreude as they hope for the same fate many of their own suffered after the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, was passed in 2010.\n\nDemocrats need to flip 24 seats to win back the House in 2018, and the congressional vote to repeal and replace Obamacare may well have made that a much easier task. Some of the most vulnerable House Republicans voted in favor of the GOP health care plan on Thursday. No Democrats voted for it, while 20 Republicans opposed it, and it only eked by with 217 yay votes — one more than it needed to pass.\n\nEven members who bit the bullet and voted yes, on what they admitted was an imperfect bill, sounded anything but certain about the vote they had just cast.\n\nFlorida Rep. Carlos Curbelo — who represents a Miami district Hillary Clinton won in 2016 by 16 points — made a game-time decision to vote for the legislation, his spokeswoman told the Miami Herald, and now will be looking to the Senate to smooth out some issues with the bill.\n\nToday's vote is just a step in the legislative process for this bill — not the end of it, Curbelo said in a taped statement. We have worked hard to improve the legislation, but we have a long way to go.\n\nThe bill has yet to be scored by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office to determine how much the bill will cost or how many people could lose coverage. A CBO report in March on an earlier iteration of the bill predicted that 24 million fewer people would be covered.\n\nAtop Democratic target lists for 2018 are the 23 Republicans who sit in districts that were won by Hillary Clinton last November. Of those members, 14 ended up voting for the bill, with just nine opposing it. One of those no votes, Florida Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, announced earlier this week she wasn't seeking re-election, so that's one open race Democrats are feeling hopeful about.\n\nMany of the Republicans who voted against the bill cited concerns that the legislation didn't do enough to protect people with pre-existing conditions — echoing a major attack line that Democrats are already using and will surely stick with over the next 18 months.\n\nModerate New Jersey Republican Tom MacArthur worked with members of the conservative Freedom Caucus to come up with an amendment to the GOP's American Health Care Act that allows states to seek waivers from Obamacare requirements, including on coverage for people with pre-existing conditions.\n\nFurther changes put more money toward so-called high-risk pools to help defray costs for people with pre-existing conditions. But NPR's Alison Kodjak reported that an analysis released Thursday by consulting firm Avalere Health concludes that that amount would be inadequate for providing full health coverage for the number of people who now buy insurance in the individual market and have medical problems.\n\nAt this time, I cannot support the AHCA with the MacArthur amendment because I'm concerned that a small percentage of those with pre-existing conditions may still not be protected, Colorado Rep. Mike Coffman, who sits in a district Clinton won, said in a statement explaining his decision.\n\nFor Democrats, it's a pronounced turn of events since Obamacare passed in 2010. With Republicans riding high on the public opposition to the law, the Democrats' majority in the House was decimated that year, with 63 seats and control of the House lost.\n\nBut sentiment has changed on Obamacare, with Gallup Poll finding this month that 55 percent now approve of the ACA.\n\nThe AHCA faces a much tougher road in the Senate, and if it dies there, some of those vulnerable GOP members may have made what ends up being a futile vote.\n\nBut there's another side to consider, too. For Republicans who have made the refrain repeal and replace Obamacare their mantra for seven years now, not acting on their signature campaign promise could risk depleting enthusiasm among their core voters, who they also need to turn out in November 2018 to combat a Democratic base that is energized against President Trump.\n\nAnd after the first attempt at repeal failed in an embarrassing fashion, House Republicans and Trump badly needed a win. That's why they took a victory lap in the White House Rose Garden on Thursday afternoon, even though the bill is far from becoming law.\n\nThe American people expected us to deliver on the promises we've made and that's what House Republicans have just done, National Republican Congressional Committee communications director Matt Gorman wrote in a memo after the vote.\n\nRepublicans have pointed out that more insurance companies are pulling out of state-run exchanges, and the GOP bill will cut about $765 billion in taxes over the next decade, NPR's Scott Horsley reported, though mostly for wealthy Americans.\n\nSome Democratic operatives were already gloating on social media that the Rose Garden event provided great footage for attack ads against House Republicans next year.\n\nUltimately, for the most vulnerable House Republicans, this may be a vote they won't be able to escape over the next year and a half — even if it never becomes law.
Health Care: See Where The 2020 Democratic Candidates Stand\n\nEnlarge this image Photo illustration: Getty Images and Renee Klahr/NPR Photo illustration: Getty Images and Renee Klahr/NPR\n\nEditor's Note on April 8, 2020: With the Democratic primary now down to one candidate, we're no longer updating the below graphic. But you can still see the stances of all candidates — past and present — below.\n\nHealth care helped propel Democrats to victory in a wave of elections in 2018, and it remains a top issue for voters heading into 2020.\n\nBut the conversation has changed over two years; while in the last midterms health care debates revolved around protecting the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, after GOP attempts to repeal it, presidential candidates ahead of 2020 are focusing more on overhauling the entire health care system.\n\nIncorporating a public option, where the government provides a form of insurance coverage the public can buy, was once a relatively progressive position within the party. Now, it has become a relatively moderate position compared to the push for single-payer, government-run health insurance.\n\nThat debate has sparked multiple policy questions, such as what role private insurance should play. In addition, candidates have been debating other ways to keep costs down, particularly in the area of prescription drugs. Here are where the current Democratic candidates stand across five health care policy areas.\n\nLoading...\n\nDon't see the graphic above?

Taking Back The House Could Be 'Life And Death' For Democrats\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Jose Luis Magana/AP Jose Luis Magana/AP\n\nVeteran Democratic strategist Paul Begala doesn't think it's hyperbolic to say that everything is at stake for Democrats heading into Tuesday's elections.\n\nThey always say it's the most important election of your life, he says, explaining that in the past two years, Democrats learned the consequences of being completely shut out as the GOP controlled both Congress and the White House.\n\nIf Democrats fail to take back the House and make significant gains at the state level, they'll be shut out again, without a say in legislation and judicial appointments.\n\nRon Klain, a former top aide in the Clinton and Obama White Houses, calls the upcoming election an issue of life and death for Democrats.\n\nHe says if Democrats lose on Tuesday, their worst fears come true and President Trump has a free hand.\n\n[It will mean] he can fire Jeff Sessions and essentially end the Mueller investigation and replace him with the attorney general of his choosing. It means that Trump could continue to roll back regulatory protections and undo the Affordable Care Act.\n\nChanges in the House\n\nHow the House operates can change dramatically with a shift in party control. Here are six ways the House could change under new leadership:\n\n1. The agenda: The majority decides what legislation the House votes on and schedules hearings on the issues it wants to highlight. Democrats have a lengthy list of their own priorities they would like to vote on such as lowering prescription drug costs.\n\n2. Subpoenas: Many committee chairs can unilaterally issue subpoenas to demand information and testimony from federal agencies. GOP-controlled committees in the House and Senate haven't done much to press Trump administration officials for details on reports of government mismanagement. That could change with a Democratic-controlled House.\n\n3. Investigations: Leadership can direct committees to investigate top Trump administration officials or policies.\n\n4. Rules: At the beginning of each new session of Congress, the House adopts a rules package to govern how the chamber is run and how legislation comes up for a vote. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi has said that Democrats are working on new rules to allow for more debate on the House floor.\n\n5. The impeachment process: The Constitution gives the House of Representatives the power to impeach a civil officer of the government. Any articles of impeachment would be referred to the House Judiciary Committee for review and possible hearings. If the committee approves any articles, the full House would vote on impeachment and then refer the matter to the Senate for a trial. Top congressional Democrats are throwing cold water on moving to impeachment quickly, but they say if there is evidence that emerges from the special counsel's probe of any wrongdoing, they don't rule out Judiciary Committee action.\n\n6. Potential government shutdown: If Democrats retake control of the House, the president will be forced to negotiate on government spending to enact key administration priorities. Standoffs over border-wall money, cutting money for agencies regulating industries and implementing health care programs are likely and could trigger government shutdowns.\n\nMore oversight\n\nIf the Democrats win one chamber or both, Klain says, then Congress returns to being a check and balance on the president. That means one thing for certain — a lot of oversight.\n\nYou'll start to see questions being asked about how taxpayer dollars are being wasted, how the government is being used as a piggy bank for the Trump family, Klain says. He added that committees will start to investigate various agencies and allow Democrats to zero in on concerns they have about how big corporate interests are turning our environmental laws inside out at the Environmental Protection Agency and the Interior Department.\n\nAs part of that oversight, Pelosi has named a top priority: forcing Trump to hand over his tax returns. Key committees do have the authority to trigger the Treasury secretary to respond to a request for tax filings, but it's unclear what kind of legal battle would ensue.\n\nOther areas of oversight could include probing allegations of waste and fraud within the administration (think former EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt's spending and former HHS Secretary Tom Price's use of private planes), foreign contacts during the 2016 campaign and the Trump Organization and family members' finances.\n\nBeyond oversight\n\nIf Democrats take back the House of Representatives, they stress they will be a check on the president, but they also have an ambitious agenda of their own.\n\nDemocratic candidates pledge they will take up legislation to increase the minimum wage, expand child care availability and control prescription drug costs.\n\nEven if they can't overcome Senate Republicans or a presidential veto, Begala says, Democrats can use the House agenda to preview what they would do heading into the next election for president in 2020 against Trump.\n\nPelosi has also outlined plans to vote on legislation to fund infrastructure projects, overhaul campaign finance laws, expand background checks for gun sales and provide a path to citizenship for those children of immigrants brought to the United States illegally.\n\nBut Republicans who have been down this road before offer words of caution — be careful what you wish for.\n\nEric Cantor came to power as the Republican majority leader when Republicans took over the House after President Barack Obama's first midterm in 2010 thanks to the Tea Party. Those who fueled that movement demanded instant results.\n\nI can tell you if we weren't contemplating at least monthly, if not more often, repealing Obamacare — then we were not doing all we could, even though there was no chance that a bill to repeal Obamacare would pass a Democratic Senate or would be signed into law by President Obama himself, Cantor says.\n\nCantor warns that if Democrats win, they'll have to deal with that same danger of high expectations from their left-wing base.\n\nThese constituencies are gonna expect abolishing ICE. They're going to expect a Democratic majority to implement and execute on 'Medicare-for-all,'  he says. And at the most extreme, they're going to expect the Democrats who, if they win majority in the House, to go ahead and impeach the president.\n\nIf Democrats win the House, impeachment will quickly become their biggest hot potato. Their left-wing activist base will demand they move quickly to impeach the president. But the current Democratic leaders are lukewarm at best to that idea and say it's important to allow special counsel Robert Mueller's probe to wrap up to review its findings.\n\nBut Democrats are willing to wrestle with the political pressures and perils of impeachment because they know it's a problem they'll encounter only if they win the majority again.
Will Congress Continue Health Care For 9 Million Children?\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Rebecca Nelson/Getty Images Rebecca Nelson/Getty Images\n\nA popular federal-state program that provides health coverage to millions of children in lower- and middle-class families is up for renewal Sept. 30.\n\nBut with a deeply divided Congress, some health advocates fear that the Children's Health Insurance Program could be in jeopardy or that conservative lawmakers will seek changes to limit the program's reach. Other financial priorities this month include extending the nation's debt ceiling, finding money for the Hurricane Harvey cleanup and keeping the government open.\n\nWith all that is on Congress' plate, I am very worried that a strong, wildly successful program with strong public support will get lost in the shuffle and force states to begin the process of winding down CHIP, said Bruce Lesley, president of the advocacy group First Focus.\n\nThe program covers more than 9 million kids — typically from families not poor enough to qualify for Medicaid, the state-federal program that covers health care for people with low incomes.\n\nIncome eligibility levels for CHIP vary widely among states, though most set thresholds at or below 200 percent of the poverty level — about $49,000 for a family of four. Unlike Medicaid, CHIP is usually not free to participants. Enrolled families pay an average premium of about $127 a year.\n\nSince CHIP's enactment, the share of uninsured children in the U.S. fell from 13.9 percent in 1997 to 4.5 percent in 2015, according to the Medicaid and CHIP Payment and Access Commission.\n\nThe 20-year-old program has bipartisan support. One of its original sponsors is Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, chairman of the Finance Committee, which has scheduled a hearing on reauthorization Thursday.\n\nIt's possible in the jam-packed legislative calendar this month that other health-related provisions could be attached to a CHIP reauthorization bill — such as Republican-sponsored changes to the Affordable Care Act. Those changes could keep the resulting bill from getting enough support from Democrats and some Republicans in the Senate for passage.\n\nIt's the only vehicle in health care policy other than the federal budget that's going to be moving, so it's likely extraneous items are likely to be added to it, says Christopher Pope, a health policy researcher and senior fellow at the conservative Manhattan Institute.\n\nSupporters of CHIP also worry about changes in eligibility for the program that could dampen enrollment.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act bumped up federal funding of CHIP by 23 percentage points and forbids states to restrict eligibility rules that were in place in 2010. Both of those requirements continue through September 2019.\n\nThe added funding means a dozen states have their entire CHIP programs paid for by the federal government. In the fiscal year that ended last September, states contributed less than $2 billion, compared with the federal government's $13.6 billion contribution, according to the conservative Heritage Foundation. States should pay a higher share of the program's costs, the foundation argues.\n\nPresident Trump's budget request this spring called for immediately eliminating the ACA bump in funding and ending the restriction on a state's ability to curtail eligibility — often referred to as the maintenance of effort provision.\n\nBut that provision has kept CHIP stable at a time when the individual insurance market faces uncertainty, says Joan Alker, director of Georgetown University's Center for Children and Families in Washington, D.C.\n\nAdvocates note that if children have to leave CHIP and move to marketplace coverage, their families may be forced to pay higher out-of-pocket costs for their kids' health care.\n\nWithout the maintenance-of-effort requirement, advocates fear that states would be more likely to do what Arizona did during the last economic downturn: It froze enrollment from December 2009 until last June. The move was allowed because it took effect before the ACA's restriction began in March 2010.\n\nMeanwhile, Republicans are not united in their views of the maintenance-of-effort requirement. Some favor it because, they say, it shifts more authority of the program to states. Others say it would very likely lead some states to move many CHIP enrollees into either Medicaid or private insurance policies sold on the Obamacare exchanges — both areas where the federal government may pay an even higher share of the costs, Pope says.\n\nIt's not a simple win for anything, but you can see why some governors would like it, he says.\n\nAt a House subcommittee hearing in June, some Republican lawmakers expressed concerns about extending the enhanced federal funding for CHIP.\n\nThis increase in funding has challenged the program by both shifting the nature of shared responsibility of the state Children's Health Insurance Program to the federal government and making states more dependent on federal dollars, said Rep. Michael Burgess, R-Texas, who heads the Energy and Commerce subcommittee on health.\n\nA committee staff memo prepared for the hearing suggested that taking away the extra funding (as some Republicans would like to do), but leaving the maintenance-of-effort requirement in place, would not result in fewer children having coverage.\n\nWithout renewal of the program, Arizona, Minnesota, North Carolina and the District of Columbia would run out of their federal CHIP funding by the end of this year. By March 2018, an additional 27 states would exhaust their funds.\n\nMinnesota and D.C. officials say all children in those two regions who are covered by CHIP will transition to Medicaid if the federal funding is cut.\n\nAlker says the enhanced funding included in CHIP's 2009 reauthorization has helped several states, including Nevada and Utah. The states were able to expand coverage to legal immigrant children immediately; before that extra money came in, these kids faced a five-year wait for insurance.\n\nGiven the complexity of making major changes and the tight congressional timeline, some experts say Congress may opt to pass a clean CHIP bill — without major changes to the program.\n\nCongress is in [session] this month so few days that I can easily see CHIP simply being reauthorized without strings attached, says Joe Antos, a health economist with the conservative American Enterprise Institute. Lawmakers' attention is more likely to focus on the debt-limit deadline, the budget resolution and tax reform, Antos says.\n\nKaiser Health News is a national health policy news service that is part of the nonpartisan Henry J.

Even Without Congress, The Trump Administration Can Still Redo Obamacare\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Alex Wong/Getty Images Alex Wong/Getty Images\n\nUpdated July 19 at 2:30 p.m. ET\n\nRepealing the Affordable Care Act was at the top of Republicans' policy wish list ever since the law was passed in 2010. Seven years later, having gained the White House and majorities in both houses of Congress, the GOP apparently has failed to repeal that law, also known as Obamacare.\n\nHowever, that doesn't mean Obamacare itself is untouchable. While Congress faltered, the White House still has lots of power.\n\nThere are things the Trump administration might do that could prop up the markets, and there are things they might do that could help the markets explode, if that's what they want to happen, says Cynthia Cox, who studies Obamacare's effects on private insurance at the Kaiser Family Foundation.\n\nHere are a few possible changes:\n\n1. Cut off the subsidies\n\nOne of the biggest threats to the Affordable Care Act has been a lawsuit filed by House Republicans that could have ended what are called cost-sharing subsidies, which help people limit their out-of-pocket expenses.\n\nAs Kaiser Health News' Julie Rovner reported last year, the suit, filed in 2014, charged that the Obama administration was unconstitutionally spending money that Congress hadn't formally appropriated, to reimburse health insurers who were providing coverage to working-poor policyholders.\n\nLast spring, a judge sided with House Republicans, but allowed the subsidies to remain in force pending appeal.\n\nWith Trump's election, his administration took responsibility for the appeal.\n\nShould the Trump administration decide to drop that appeal, it would be quick, easy and potentially crippling to Obamacare. Trump reportedly wants to stop making the payments, Politico recently reported.\n\nThat might sound like a simple decision for a president who detests the Affordable Care Act, but it could come with heavy political consequences.\n\nIf they stop defending the litigation, then they have to stop reimbursing insurers for the [subsidies] and the markets would crater, says Sabrina Corlette,a research professor at Georgetown University's Center on Health Insurance Reforms. It seems politically risky to think voters wouldn't blame them for that. The Congress could step in and appropriate the money, but it's hard to see that getting buy-in from the far right.\n\nPerhaps with those political realities in mind, some in the GOP have said they are willing to spend that money anyway. In March, some top House Republicans said they wanted to keep the subsidies going.\n\n2. Remove the individual mandate's teeth\n\nThe Trump administration can't do away with the mandate requiring individuals to have health insurance on its own, but it can greatly weaken it. Doing so would be another way to seriously undermine the Affordable Care Act.\n\nOne way is through the IRS. That individual mandate is about tax incentives — fail to get insurance, and you have to pay a penalty. So to hobble Obamacare, the Trump administration can decide not to enforce that penalty.\n\nIn fact, the IRS already took a small step in that direction earlier this year. The agency said it will not reject silent returns — tax returns on which a person declines to say whether they have insurance.The IRS explained in a statement that this year, for the first time, the agency had been set to reject those silent returns. But Trump's January executive order on Obamacare changed that, telling the heads of executive branch offices to waive, defer, grand exemptions from, or delay parts of the act.\n\nConsistent with that, the IRS has decided to make changes that would continue to allow electronic and paper returns to be accepted for processing in instances where a taxpayer doesn't indicate their coverage status, the IRS said. However, legislative provisions of the ACA law are still in force until changed by the Congress, and taxpayers remain required to follow the law and pay what they may owe.\n\nIn other words, a lot still won't change here — the penalties remain the law of the land.\n\nHowever, the IRS' statement left considerable uncertainty about what enforcement would now look like, as the Society for Human Resource Management reported in February.\n\nOne other option here, Cox says, is that the Trump administration could loosen up the rules on who can get hardship exemptions. People with particularly tough circumstances — homelessness, domestic violence, bankruptcy — can currently apply to get an exemption from any penalties for not holding insurance. The Trump administration could approve more people in more circumstances for those hardships, Cox says. (Likewise, the administration could also approve fewer people if it wanted to.)\n\nWere the administration to approve more waivers, it could mean fewer people in the marketplaces. And to the degree that that pulls healthy people out, it would create sicker pools that create more costly coverage, which in turn could cause more people to drop out.\n\n3. Let states be looser in defining essential health benefits\n\nThe ACA requires that health plans cover 10 essential health benefits — health services in basic, broad areas like emergency services, prescription drugs and maternity care. And the administration has a few paths for changing exactly what those are — changes that could weaken some people's health care but also maybe nudge more insurers into the marketplaces.\n\nThe federal government laid out and defined the benefits (known among health care wonks as EHBs), but the nitty-gritty of a state's essential health benefits can be found in its benchmark plan.\n\nRight now each state has picked a small group plan or similar plan that would have existed before the ACA and used that as a benchmark for what all the plans in each state now have to cover, Cox says.\n\nThe Trump administration could loosen that, giving plans much more wiggle room for what services they include or exclude, Cox added.\n\nPrice could come back in and say, 'We've changed how each state can define their [essential health benefit] plan as long as it looks reasonably like an employer plan,'  she says.\n\n4. Redefine the EHBs\n\nThe administration could also simply tweak the EHBs by broadening or narrowing the definitions of some of the 10 broad benefit categories.\n\nFor example, one of the 10 benefits set by law includes preventive care. But the law itself didn't say exactly what that meant — rather, the Obama administration defined what exactly preventive services are through regulation.\n\nThat means the Trump White House could undo some of that through regulation, making particular benefits disappear. Contraception, for example, is a part of the preventive service EHB, and the Obama administration also made sure that in many plans, that birth control is copay-free. HHS Secretary Tom Price has opposed that rule in the past.\n\nOnce again, loosening rules around essential health benefits could reduce the kinds of things people get coverage for, but it could also potentially nudge more insurers into a state's exchanges, Cox says. That could address a key Obamacare problem: Some areas of the country only have one insurer in their marketplaces.\n\n5. Let states experiment more\n\nStates can apply for waivers to deviate from the ACA as written in some way — the idea, Cox says, is to allow for some experimentation or innovation at the state level to improve the system. States could pass laws that change their health care system, then apply to the federal government for the waiver.\n\nPrice has promoted waivers as ways for states to alter their health care systems. Under a Trump administration that's no fan of the ACA, approved waivers might look substantially different than they would have under Obama.\n\nFor example, California had passed a law and filed a waiver that would have allowed people in the state illegally to get health insurance on the state exchange (though they would not have been allowed to get federal subsidies). When Trump won the presidency, California withdrew the waiver.\n\nAn administration so opposed to illegal immigration likely wouldn't have approved that kind of change. But the Trump administration might be more open to conservative tweaks.\n\nOne example might be in states that didn't expand Medicaid, and now have higher premiums and more unhealthy people in their individual market, Cox says. The idea here is that sicker people could have moved out of the exchanges and into Medicaid, had those states opted into a Medicaid expansion offered to them under Obamacare.\n\nThere may be some conservative states where they are allowed to expand Medicaid if they have work requirements — waivers or exemptions that the Obama administration would not have allowed, she added.\n\nLikewise, Alaska filed a waiver creating a reinsurance program — in a basic sense, a pool of money that comes from insurers and helps pay for particular health conditions — which the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services recently approved. The Affordable Care Act had something similar for a three-year transition period — insurers paid into a pot, which then reimbursed insurers for people's medical costs that were particularly high, between $45,000 and $250,000.\n\nPrice highlighted this effort in his statement, signaling to other states that they could potentially get approval for their own reinsurance plans.\n\n6. Let the architecture crumble\n\nIt takes a lot of upkeep to keep Obamacare running — the exchange websites need to hum along, and people need to be ready to answer the helpline. But the administration could hypothetically make a lot of that a lower priority, Georgetown's Corlette says, essentially letting the system atrophy.\n\nThe Price administration [at HHS] can redirect resources so they would have a fair amount of flexibility for how they direct resources for the fall enrollment, Corlette says.\n\nIn his first week on the job, Trump killed the advertising surrounding the Affordable Care Act, as well as outreach, as Politico explained:\n\nEmails are no longer being sent out to individuals who visited HealthCare.gov, the enrollment website, to encourage them to finish signing up. Those emails had proven highly successful in getting stragglers to complete enrollment before the deadline.\n\nTake all of this to its logical conclusion, and even these fixes could lead to a sicker mix of people in the markets.\n\nIf you're a sick person, you're going to do whatever it takes to get that coverage, Corlette says. You will sit on the phone for two hours. You will hit the refresh button. If you're healthy, you're going to say, 'Forget it.' 
Radical Or Incremental? What's Really In Joe Biden's Health Plan\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Justin Sullivan/Getty Images Justin Sullivan/Getty Images\n\nThe headlines about presidential candidate Joe Biden's new health care plan called it a nod to the past and Affordable Care Act 2.0. That mostly refers to the fact that the former vice president has specifically repudiated many of his Democratic rivals' calls for a Medicare for All system, and instead sought to build his plan on the ACA's framework.\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders, one of Biden's opponents in the primary race and the key proponent of the Medicare for All option, has criticized Biden's proposal, complaining that it is just tinkering around the edges of a broken health care system.\n\nStill, the proposal put forward by Biden earlier this week is much more ambitious than Obamacare – and despite its incremental label, would make some very controversial changes.\n\nI would call it radically incremental, says Chris Jennings, a political health strategist who worked for Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama and who has consulted with several of the current Democratic candidates.\n\nRepublicans who object to other candidates' Medicare for All plans find Biden's alternative just as displeasing.\n\nNo matter how much Biden wants to draw distinctions between his proposals and single-payer, his plan looks suspiciously like SandersCare Lite, writes former congressional aide and conservative commentator Chris Jacobs in a column for The Federalist.\n\nBiden's plan is built on the idea of expanding the ACA to reduce costs for patients and consumers — similar to what Hillary Clinton campaigned on in 2016. It would do things Democrats have called for repeatedly since the ACA was passed. Among Biden's proposals is a provision that would uncap federal help to pay for health insurance premiums — assistance now available only to those with incomes that are 400% of the poverty level, or about $50,000 for an individual.\n\nUnder Biden's plan, no one would be required to pay more than 8.5 percent of their income toward health insurance premiums.\n\nBut it includes several proposals that Congress has failed repeatedly to enact, including some that were part of the original debate over the ACA. Plus, Biden's plan has some initiatives that are so expansive, it is hard to imagine them passing Congress — even if Democrats sweep the presidency and both houses of Congress in 2020.\n\nHere are some of the more controversial pieces of the Biden health plan:\n\nPublic option\n\nAlthough many of the Democratic presidential candidates have expressed varying degrees of support for a Medicare for All plan, nearly all have also endorsed creating a government-sponsored health plan, known colloquially as a public option, that would be available to people who buy their own health insurance. That eligible group would include anyone who doesn't get insurance through their job or who doesn't qualify for other government programs, like Medicare or Medicaid.\n\nA public option was included in the version of the ACA that passed the House in 2009. But its proponents could not muster the 60 votes needed to pass that option in the Senate over GOP objections — even though the Democrats had 60 votes at the time.\n\nBiden's public option, however, would be available to many more people than the 20 million or so who are now in the individual insurance market. According to the document put out by the campaign, this public option also would be available to those who don't like or can't afford their employer insurance, and to small businesses.\n\nMost controversial, though, is that the 2.5 million people currently ineligible for either Medicaid or private insurance subsidies because their states have chosen not to expand Medicaid would be automatically enrolled in Biden's public option, at no cost to them or the states where they live. Also included automatically in the public option would be another 2 million people with low incomes who currently are eligible for ACA coverage subsidies – and who would also be eligible for expanded Medicaid.\n\nThat part of Biden's proposal has prompted charges that the 14 states that have so far chosen not to expand Medicaid would save money, compared with those that have already expanded the program, because expansion states have to pay 10% of the cost of that new population.\n\nJennings, the Democratic health strategist, argues that extra charge to states that previously expanded Medicaid would be unavoidable under Biden's plan, because people with low incomes in states that haven't expanded Medicaid need coverage most. If you're not going to have everyone get a plan right away, you need to make sure those who are most vulnerable do, Jennings says.\n\nAbortion\n\nThe Biden plan calls for eliminating the Hyde Amendment, an annual rider to the spending bill for the Department of Health and Human Services that forbids the use of federal funds to pay for most abortions. Biden recently ran into some difficulty when his position on the Hyde ammendment was unclear.\n\nBeyond that, Biden's plan also directly calls for the federal government to fund some abortions. [T]he public option will cover contraception and a woman's constitutional right to choose, his plan says.\n\nIn 2010, the Affordable Care Act very nearly failed to become law after an intraparty fight between Democrats who supported and opposed federal funding for abortions. Abortion opponents wanted firm guarantees in permanent law that no federal funds would ever be used for abortion; abortion-rights supporters called that a deal breaker. Eventually a shaky compromise was reached.\n\nAnd while it is true that there are now far fewer Democrats in Congress who oppose abortion than there were in 2010, the idea of even a Democratic-controlled Congress voting for federal abortion funding seems far-fetched. The current Democratic-led House has declined even to include a repeal of the Hyde Amendment in this year's HHS spending bill, because it could not get through the GOP-controlled Senate or get signed by President Trump.\n\nUndocumented immigrants\n\nWhen Obama said in a speech to Congress in September 2009 that people not in the U.S. legally would be ineligible for federal help with their purchase of health insurance under the ACA, it prompted the infamous You lie! shout from Rep. Joe Wilson, R-S.C..\n\nToday, all the Democratic candidates say they would provide coverage to undocumented residents. There is no mention of them specifically in the plan posted on Biden's website, although a Biden campaign official told Politico this week that people in the U.S. who are undocumented would be able to purchase plans on the health insurance exchanges, but would not qualify for subsidies.\n\nStill, in his speech unveiling the plan at an AARP-sponsored candidate forum in Iowa, Biden did not address this issue of immigrants' health care. He said only that his plan would expand funding for community health centers, which serve patients regardless of their ability to pay or their immigration status, and that people in the U.S. without legal authority would be able to obtain coverage in emergencies. That is already law.
Many Who Buy ACA Health Plans For 2019 Find Lower Prices And More Choice\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Patrick Sison/AP Patrick Sison/AP\n\nIn recent years, some cities, including Memphis and Phoenix, withered into health insurance wastelands, as insurers fled and premiums skyrocketed in the insurance marketplaces that were set up under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nBut today, as in many parts of the U.S., these two cities are experiencing something unprecedented: Insurance premiums are sinking and choices are sprouting.\n\nIn the newly competitive market in Memphis, for example, the cheapest midlevel silver plan for 2019 health coverage will cost $498 a month for a 40-year-old — a 17 percent decrease compared to last year.\n\nPlease Tell Us What You Think About Shots Help us make Shots more relevant for you by completing an NPR research survey. Click here to start the questionnaire.\n\nAnd four insurers are now selling ACA policies in Phoenix. That's the same market that then-presidential candidate Donald Trump highlighted in 2016 because all but one insurer had left the region — he called it proof of the madness of Obamacare.\n\nJanice Johnson, a 63-year-old retiree in Arizona's Maricopa County, which includes Phoenix, said her monthly premium for a high-deductible bronze plan will be $207 for 2019, instead of $270, because she is switching carriers.\n\nWhen you're on a fixed income, that makes a difference, said Johnson, who receives a government subsidy to help cover her premium. I'll know more in a year from now if I'm going to stick with this company. But I'm going to give them a chance, and I'm pretty excited by that.\n\nLooking across all 50 states, the premiums for the average benchmark silver plan, which the government uses to set subsidies, are dropping nearly 1 percent. And more than half of the counties in the 39 states that rely on the federal HealthCare.gov exchange are experiencing a 10 percent price decrease, on average, for their cheapest plan.\n\nLoading...\n\nIn most places, the declines are not enough to erase the price hikes that have accrued since the creation of the health care exchanges in 2014.\n\nInstead, next year's price cuts help to correct the huge increases that jittery insurers set for 2018 to protect themselves from anticipated Republican assaults on the markets. While Congress came up one vote shy of repealing the federal health law in the summer of 2017, Trump and Republicans in Congress did manage to strip away many of the structural underpinnings that induced people to buy plans and helped insurers pay for some of their low-income customers' copayments and deductibles. Insurers responded with a 32 percent increase, on average, for 2018 plans.\n\nInsurers overshot last year, said Chris Sloan, a director at Avalere, a health care consulting company in Washington, D.C. We are nowhere close to erasing that increase. This is still a really expensive market with poor benefits when it comes to deductibles and cost.\n\nFor 2019, the average premium for the benchmark silver plan will be 75 percent higher than it was in 2014, according to data from the Kaiser Family Foundation. (Kaiser Health News is an editorially independent program of the foundation.)\n\nWhen Republicans failed to kill the health law last year, they inadvertently may have made it stronger. Insurers banked hefty profits in 2018, and that attracted new companies to most ACA markets.\n\nAll these factors were especially influential in Tennessee, where the average benchmark premium is dropping 26 percent, according to an analysis by the federal government. That's a bigger drop than in any other state.\n\nSeventy-eight of 95 Tennessee counties had just one insurer for 2018. That monopoly allowed the insurer to set the prices of its plans without fear of competition, said David Anderson, a researcher at the Duke-Margolis Center for Health Policy in Durham, N.C. They were massively overpriced, Anderson said of all available policies.\n\nBut for the coming year, 49 Tennessee counties will have more than one insurer, with a few — like Shelby County, where Memphis is located — having four companies competing. There, Cigna dropped the price of its lowest-cost silver plan by 15 percent. Even then, Cigna was underbid by Ambetter of Tennessee, a company owned by the managed-care insurer Centene Corp.\n\nWe're finally at the point where the market is stabilized, said Bobby Huffaker, the CEO of American Exchange, an insurance brokerage firm based in Tennessee. From the beginning, every underwriter — [and] the people who were the architects — they knew it would take several years for the market to mature.\n\nStill, the cheapest Memphis silver premium is nearly three times what it was in 2014, the first year of the marketplaces. A family of four, headed by 40-year-old parents, will be paying $19,119 for all of next year unless they qualify for a government subsidy.\n\nThe unsubsidized are leaving, said Sabrina Corlette, a professor at Georgetown University's Health Policy Institute. They are finding these premiums unaffordable.\n\nThe landscape in Phoenix is greatly improved from when Trump visited after the federal government announced a 116 percent premium increase for 2017; the number of insurers at that time had dropped from eight to one.\n\nNow, three new insurers are entering Maricopa County. Meanwhile, Ambetter, the only insurer that offered plans for 2018, reduced its lowest price for a silver plan for next year by 12 percent — and it offers the cheapest such plan in the market.\n\nStill, Ambetter's plan is 114 percent above the least expensive silver plan offered there in the first year of the exchanges. And neither Ambetter nor any of the insurers coming into the market for 2019 offer as broad and flexible a choice of doctors and hospitals as consumers had back then, according to Michael Malasnik, a local broker.\n\nSince the start of the exchanges, Malasnik said, insurers have raised their rates by multiples, and they've figured out you have to be a very narrow network.\n\nEach plan in Phoenix for 2019 contains trade-offs, he said. Only Bright Health's plan includes Phoenix Children's Hospital. Ambetter's plan includes the most popular hospital and doctor groups, Malasnik said. But those providers are not as conveniently located for people living in the southeastern corner of the county, and that makes other insurers' plans more appealing for some customers.\n\nGeography is the name of the game this year, Malasnik said.\n\nTheresa Flood, a preschool teacher who lives outside Phoenix, said none of the provider networks of the plans she considered included her doctors, such as the specialist who treats her spine problems. She has had four surgeries, and a neurologist who monitors a cyst and benign tumor in her brain is also outside the network she ended up choosing.\n\nI have to establish care with a whole new spine doctor and establish care with a whole new neurologist if I want to follow up on these things, said Flood, who is 59. You're going from 'established care' to 'who in the heck am I going to see?' \n\nThe plan Flood ultimately chose would have been too expensive, except that she and her husband John, who is a minister, qualified for a $1,263-a-month subsidy that will drop the cost to $207 a month. That bronze plan from Ambetter carries a $6,550-per-person deductible; so Flood expects she'll still have to pay out-of-pocket for her treatments and doctor visits unless she needs extensive medical attention.\n\nIt's gone from being able to have a plan that you could sort of afford and got some benefit from, to putting up with what you can afford and hoping nothing happens that you actually have to use your insurance, she said. At this point, I'll take what I can get.\n\nKaiser Health News, a nonprofit news service, is an editorially independent program of the Kaiser Family Foundation, and is not affiliated with Kaiser Permanente.
Part Of Oregon's Funding Plan For Medicaid Goes Before Voters\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Gillian Flaccus/AP Gillian Flaccus/AP\n\nOregon is in a battle royal over how to pay for expanded Medicaid.\n\nThe fight revolves around Measure 101, a ballot initiative that you have to go back a few years to understand.\n\nDuring the 1990s, Oregon's then-governor, John Kitzhaber, had a background in health care — he had worked as an emergency room doctor. His legacy in the state includes the expansion of health insurance for the poor, an idea he managed to sell to both Democrats and Republicans.\n\nSo when President Barack Obama proposed expanding Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, Oregon lawmakers on both sides of the aisle embraced it. As a result, some 95 percent of Oregonians now have health insurance. That's among the highest rates in the nation.\n\nBut now the federal government is trimming its contribution to Medicaid. And legislatures all around the U.S. are scrambling to find money to replace those federal payments.\n\nIn Oregon last summer, Democrats joined with Republicans, hospital owners and health insurance CEOs to come up with a tax package that would fund the Medicaid expansion. And hospitals and insurance companies agreed to the plan, though they are on the hook for many of the included taxes.\n\nHere's where the wrinkle comes: Under state law in Oregon, voters can use the initiative process to collect signatures and force a public vote on any new tax. And that's what state Rep. Julie Parrish did.\n\nParrish and others managed to get Measure 101 on Oregon's Tuesday ballot — putting part of the Medicaid tax package passed last summer into the hands of voters. If it succeeds not much will happen — the tax package will continue to fund Medicaid expansion. But if it fails, Oregon's Legislature will have to go back to the drawing board and come up with a new way to pay for the health care of its poorest residents and others who rely on Medicaid.\n\nParrish is a Republican state legislator whose family was on Medicaid when she was a child.\n\nBut she doesn't like the tax package.\n\nThis is about a fundamental disagreement that taxing other people's insurance is the way to fund Medicaid, she says. Parrish says the funding package Oregon came up with is inequitable because it doesn't apply to big corporations and unions. Instead, she says, it hurts the little guy — people who couldn't afford to hire lobbyists.\n\nSmall businesses — mom and pop businesses, she says, ticking off the groups she thinks would unfairly bear the tax burden under the state's plan. Individuals who have to buy their own [health insurance].\n\nParrish thinks Medicaid would be better-funded in Oregon with something like a cigarette tax increase — although it's not clear that would generate enough money or garner enough votes to pass.\n\nCedric Hayden, a Republican representative from Falls Creek, is a dentist who accepts Medicaid patients and runs a charitable health clinic in Lane County. He is also a member of Parrish's Stop Healthcare Taxes committee — the group that collected enough signatures to put Measure 101 on the ballot.\n\nHayden says if he and other members of his committee had been against funding Medicaid altogether, they could have insisted the Legislature's entire funding plan be put up for a public vote.\n\nWe did not, he points out.\n\nInstead, if approved, Measure 101 would ratify the Medicaid expansion in Oregon that the Legislature approved last summer. But if Measure 101 fails, a part of that tax package will be eliminated. A no vote would eliminate the 0.7 percent increase to an existing tax on hospitals that the Legislature wants. And it would also stop a 1.5 percent tax on health insurance contracts.\n\nIt's unclear how the passage of Measure 101 would affect consumers. That's because, on one hand, any new taxes would very likely be passed on to consumers. But on the other hand, Measure 101 funds a program that saves consumers of health care $300 a year.\n\nSome Republicans in the state want a no vote. They don't like the new tax and they don't trust the Oregon Health Authority with the money. They say the OHA wasted millions of dollars on things like Medicaid overpayments and CoverOregon — the webpage that initially sold Obamacare insurance.\n\nOn the yes side are all kinds of advocacy groups and the vast majority of Oregon's health organizations. They say 48 other states have some form of this tax package to pay for Medicaid.\n\nThe alternative of lack of coverage — we're talking kids, seniors, people with disabilities — is unacceptable, says Andy Van Pelt, the executive director of the Oregon Association of Hospitals and Health Systems.\n\nHe says it is cheaper to treat people with health insurance than to treat them without insurance, when they turn up sick in emergency rooms anyway.\n\nThere's a real possibility that people could lose their coverage. It will just destabilize the Medicaid program for hundreds of thousands of people, and that would be utter chaos, Van Pelt says.\n\nWhile the Trump administration hasn't managed to repeal the Affordable Care Act, it has taken several steps to dismantle it.\n\nThe effect of Measure 101 on Oregon's Medicaid expansion remains to be seen. If it fails, state lawmakers will spend the next couple of months searching for new ways to pay for Medicaid expansion.
What To Expect From The 2nd Night Of The 1st 2020 Democratic Primary Debate\n\nSeveral leading Democratic candidates landed on the second night of the first debate series. Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders, Kamala Harris and Pete Buttigieg are among those sharing Thursday's spotlight.\n\nAUDIE CORNISH, HOST:\n\nImmigration and health care were two of the biggest issues to draw differences among the Democratic presidential candidates last night. Tonight 10 more will be on stage, including some of the biggest names in the race. Former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders will be right in the middle. Want to bring in NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson - she's in Miami. That's where the candidates are preparing for tonight's matchup. Hey there, Mara.\n\nMARA LIASSON, BYLINE: Hi, Audie.\n\nCORNISH: So people are saying that they did see differences among these Democrats last night. And it was notable that candidates didn't aggressively offer a kind of prebuttal to Biden or Sanders or even President Trump. So how do you think things are going to change tonight?\n\nLIASSON: I think tonight there's some obvious contrast. Just by looking at the stage, you have the two guys standing in the center, Biden and Sanders. You couldn't have a greater ideological contrast between them. They're about the same age; they're both fighting Democrats. But they're from very different wings of the party. Sanders is a proud Democratic Socialist who wants a government takeover of the private health insurance industry. Biden likes to work across the aisle, and he wants to continue the legacy of Barack Obama. He wants to supplement Obamacare with a Medicare buy-in. So I would be surprised if we don't get some kind of a clash between those two.\n\nThe other obvious contrast tonight are the people flanking Sanders and Biden. They represent an obvious generational challenge. Without saying anything, just looking at Pete Buttigieg and Kamala Harris, they're decades younger than Biden and Sanders. Pete Buttigieg is gay. Kamala Harris is black. They represent the younger, modern more diverse Democratic Party.\n\nCORNISH: I want to talk about some of the progressives onstage. You've got Bernie Sanders, obviously Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren. Where do things stand after Warren's debate performance last night?\n\nLIASSON: Well, those two are battling for the progressive lane of the party. And I think one of the most striking moments last night was when the candidates were asked if they would eliminate private health plans. Elizabeth Warren's hand shot right up. Up until now, she'd been ambiguous about how she would achieve universal coverage. She's talked about Medicare for All being maybe voluntarily established. But she made some news last night. Here she is on the NBC News debate.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nELIZABETH WARREN: I'm with Bernie on Medicare for All, and let me tell you why. I spent a big chunk of my life studying why families go broke. And one of the No. 1 reasons is the cost of health care.\n\nLIASSON: So this is an interesting tactical choice on her part. I'm with Bernie on this, she said. Doing away with private health insurance plans may be popular with the Democratic base, but it is not popular with general election voters. About 160 million people have private health insurance. But Elizabeth Warren took that risk in order not to be outflanked on her left by Sanders. Some Democrats think this could come back to haunt her if she is the nominee. And it's going to be really interesting to see tonight how Sanders responds.\n\nCORNISH: For the lower-profile candidates, the stakes are so high - right? - to try and stand out onstage. Who has that challenge tonight?\n\nLIASSON: Well, they all have a slightly different imperative. Pete Buttigieg has been the phenomenon of the race. But he needs to expand his appeal beyond white college-educated voters. And just as the moment he needed to do that, he had to go home to deal with the fallout from a white police officer in South Bend killing a black man. And it'll be interesting to see tonight how he deals with that.\n\nThe other candidate tonight who has a lot of potential with minority voters after New Hampshire and Iowa is Kamala Harris. She had a very strong debut. She has a charismatic personality. She's warm and strong, but she hasn't been able to state the rationale for her candidacy very clearly. She's gotten high marks for her prosecutorial abilities when she's questioning somebody in a Senate hearing room, but she's been less sure-footed when she's the one being asked the questions. So it'll be interesting to see tonight how she deals with those problems.\n\nCORNISH: That's NPR's Mara Liasson. Mara, thanks so much.\n\nLIASSON: Thank you.\n\nCopyright © 2019 NPR.

Biden Faces A Convention Test, To Offer A Vision Beyond Beating Trump\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Drew Angerer/Getty Images Drew Angerer/Getty Images\n\nIn a recent campaign ad, Joe Biden is behind the wheel of a 1967 Corvette Stingray, in his trademark aviator sunglasses.\n\nI love this car, nothing but incredible memories. Every time I get in, I think of my dad and Beau, Biden says, referring to his late son. God, could my dad drive a car.\n\nIt's pure nostalgia. But then Biden pivots to his pitch to restore American manufacturing.\n\nThey're making an electric Corvette and it can go 200 miles an hour, Biden says. You think I'm kidding — I'm not kidding. So, I'm excited about it.\n\nIt lines up with the vision for the future being laid out by the 77-year-old Biden, the ultimate retro politician, a middle of the road Democrat who talks about the good old days, now embracing some of the most progressive ideas of his party. How Biden, his running mate California Sen. Kamala Harris and other Democrats lay out this vision in their virtual convention over the next week is important.\n\nPresidential elections are won by the candidate who presents the most compelling vision for the future, and the convention is an opportunity for Biden and Harris to convince voters not just that President Trump has failed today, but that Democrats will make Americans' lives safer and more prosperous tomorrow.\n\nBiden's vision is a combination of old and new, according to Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., a campaign surrogate.\n\nLet's take the best of what our country is, that proud manufacturing tradition, that notion that you ought to have a fair shot no matter where you live, Warner said. Let's marry it with a vision for the future that says we can build the autos of the future that will also save our planet.\n\nBiden calls his vision Build Back Better, and it includes big investments in the public health system, green infrastructure and American manufacturing, paid for with higher taxes on corporations and the wealthy. He says he'll be tougher on Wall Street — a change from the Obama-Biden administration, criticized for the lack of any prosecution of senior Wall Street bankers after the financial crisis that triggered the Great Recession. He also wants to expand Obamacare with a public option, as well as address systemic racism in policing, homeownership and federal contracting.\n\nMany of Biden's plans are longstanding Democratic Party goals, but they've been adapted to address racial inequities and climate change.\n\nWhen Donald Trump thinks about climate change, the only word he can muster is 'hoax.' When I think about climate change, the word I think of is 'jobs,'  Biden said last month. Good-paying union jobs that will put Americans to work making the air cleaner for our kids to breathe, restoring our crumbling roads and bridges and ports, making it faster, cheaper and cleaner to transport American-made goods all across the country and around the world.\n\nThe rap on Biden for most of the year was that he was the candidate of restoration, looking to return to the good old Obama days. Then the pandemic happened, George Floyd was killed, and the country was forced to confront systemic racism. All of a sudden, Biden, as the head of the party that believes in activist government, was given a new opportunity to recast his agenda with a forward-looking vision of what government should do.\n\nThe thing about the American people is, we really don't like government as a concept. We do love government, however, when there's an emergency, said Elaine Kamarck, a member of the Democratic National Committee who ran a program tasked with reinventing government in the Clinton White House. So, whenever there's an emergency, the first question is, where's the government? And the first criticism is the government didn't do enough or the government screwed this up.\n\nThat is the core of Biden's argument: Donald Trump thinks government is a swamp, while Joe Biden thinks government can be a solution to America's ills.\n\nThe pandemic and our response to it, as well as the Floyd events, have really shown us just how ruptured our social contract is. We don't actually think of ourselves as all in it together, said professor Danielle Allen, a political theorist and director of Harvard's Edmond J. Safra Center for Ethics.\n\nAllen was skeptical at first that Biden could have a vision for the future, but no more: I do think the Biden campaign has laid out a vision that is about pulling us all together and that does focus on the key elements that we need in order to restore a healthy, strong social contract. Where we're pursuing simultaneously the objectives of saving lives, securing livelihoods, protecting liberties.\n\nBut others are not convinced yet that Biden's vision of the future is compelling enough to get the voters he needs to turn out in large numbers this fall.\n\nIt's not everything that we would want, but we think he has the potential, said the Rev. William Barber, co-chair of the Poor People's Campaign. He's trying to motivate millions of low-income people to vote, and he says that will depend a lot on how Biden explains his vision for the future at the convention.\n\nBarber has advice for how Biden should do that: Push the issues that would cause people to see, if I vote, I will get a living wage. If I vote, there will be health care for me and my children. If I vote, the candidates will deal with the issues of ecological devastation. If I vote, somebody would deal with this racist voter suppression that's not only hurting Black people, but it also ends up suppressing the votes of Latino and poor white people, as well.
Poll: Democrats Fired Up Against Trump In Midterms, But GOP Rallying Around Him\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Andrew Harnik/AP Andrew Harnik/AP\n\nThe battle lines are being drawn five months ahead of the midterms, with more Americans than at any point in at least the last two decades saying they're enthusiastic about voting — and record numbers of voters say President Trump and which party controls Congress are big factors in their vote, according to a new Pew Research Center survey released Wednesday.\n\nVoters also are saying they want candidates to talk more about immigration and health care, two hot-button issues that have no simple solutions or easily navigable middle grounds.\n\nJust Wednesday, the president backed down from his zero tolerance immigration policy that has resulted in the separation of families, while adults who crossed the border illegally are held for adjudication. A long-term comprehensive solution, however, remains out of reach. On healthcare, Republicans have failed so far to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, but they did strip out the mandate to buy insurance, which policy experts warn could raise the prices of premiums in October, a month before this fall's elections.\n\nEnthusiasm is at record levels\n\nOverall, slightly more than half of Americans (51 percent) told Pew they are more enthusiastic about voting than usual, the highest share saying so in at least the last 20 years since Pew has been asking the question.\n\nDemocrats are more enthusiastic than Republicans, but not by much — 55 percent of Democrats said they are more enthusiastic than usual, but 50 percent of GOP voters said the same. Those are both very high numbers overall for midterms.\n\nGenerally, in midterms, the party out of power is far more fired up. That's been the case in each of the last three midterms — which have all been wave elections resulting in control of at least one chamber of Congress changing hands.\n\nIn 2006, when Democrats benefited from the spiraling Iraq war and President George W. Bush's declining approval numbers to take control of Congress, a slightly lower number of Democrats than today said they were more enthusiastic than usual (47 percent). But they far outnumbered Republicans in who said they were more enthusiastic in 2006 (30 percent), a 17-point advantage.\n\nIn 2010, when Republicans won a whopping 63 seats in the House and regained control of that chamber, the GOP was ahead on this question by 13 points (55 to 42 percent). And in 2014, when Republicans won back the Senate, they had an 8-point overall advantage (45 to 37 percent).\n\nSo the bottom line is Democrats today are as enthusiastic about voting as Republicans were in 2010, but Republicans are also fired up, which could mitigate GOP losses in the House and help them protect their slim Senate majority.\n\nBoth parties also see who controls Congress as consequential, with a record 68 percent saying so. That number has been steadily on the rise in the past two decades, evidence that elections have become far more nationalized since the Bill Clinton impeachment and through Bush v. Gore, 9/11, the Iraq war, Obamacare and Trump. Politics just isn't so local anymore.\n\nDemocrats need to win nearly two dozen seats to take control of the House. They are facing a very difficult map in the Senate, defending seats in 26 states, many of which Trump won handily in 2016. Republicans are defending just nine Senate seats.\n\nThe double-edged Trump sword\n\nThree-fifths of Americans (60 percent) said that their vote is essentially a vote for or against the president. That is the highest percentage of voters saying that in at least three decades, Pew found.\n\nWhat's more, a strong majority of Democrats (61 percent) see their vote as one against Trump and a majority of Republicans (52 percent) see it as one for him.\n\nPutting those numbers in context again shows Republicans' support for Trump to be pretty strong. Consider that that 52 percent seeing their vote as one for Trump is nearly 20 points higher than the percentage of the GOP who saw their vote as one for Bush in 2006 and is also higher than the percentage of Democrats who said their votes in 2010 and 2014 were to support Obama. That could further insulate Republicans from massive losses this year.\n\nRoiling all of this is a strong anti-incumbent sentiment. Two-thirds of Americans say they do not want to see most representatives elected.\n\nMajorities are concerned about how either party will deal with Trump after the election — 58 percent of voters think Democrats will spend too much time investigating Trump if they win, and an equal but different 58 percent think Republicans would not focus enough on oversight of the Trump administration.\n\nOn the issues\n\nIf it's the economy, stupid, Republicans are in pretty good shape this fall.\n\nPew found Democrats have advantages, sometimes sweeping, on almost all issues — but not on dealing with the economy.\n\nRepublicans maintain an advantage over Democrats on doing a better job dealing with a terrorist threat and the economy. They also have smaller advantages on dealing with the budget deficit, taxes and trade, but they have relinquished their advantages on dealing with gun policy, immigration and health care.\n\nAmericans also say they prefer Democrats to deal with foreign policy, drug addiction (something the president and the GOP have talked about a lot), abortion and contraception, race and ethnicity issues and the environment.\n\nStill, the GOP advantage on the economy could be Democrats' biggest problem heading into the midterms. The country is in a time of relative peace and prosperity, with the lowest unemployment numbers since the turn of the century and Trump stepping off of a nuclear standoff with North Korea and putting on a show of diplomacy.\n\nThat could be why Democrats' advantage on the question of who Americans want to control Congress is only 5 points (48-to-43 percent) in this poll. Democratic strategists would feel far more comfortable with a larger lead on that question, as they had in past wave years.

Each of our players will have 60 seconds in which to answer as many fill-in-the-blank questions as they can. Each correct answer now worth two points. Bill, can you give us the scores?\n\nBILL KURTIS: I sure can. Peter has two. Roxanne and Roy each have three.\n\nSAGAL: All right.\n\nSAGAL: So that means Peter is in third place.

And when police attempted to arrest him, he gave the cops a fake name. That probably would have worked if Bushman did not have his full name tattooed in giant letters on his neck. It also didn't help that he was also wearing a nametag from a recent forgers convention...\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nSAGAL: ...That said, hello, my name is guilty.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nSAGAL: Bill, how did Peter do on our quiz?\n\nKURTIS: Real good - six right, 12 more points, total of 14.

One of those...\n\nSAGAL: No.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nSAGAL: They had students - during this test to keep them from cheating, they had students wear cardboard boxes on their heads. A recent picture showed university students taking an exam while wearing these cardboard boxes with small cut out eye holes presumably to keep students from looking to their left or right and cheating off the person next to them. Or maybe just every student had ended up with a bad Halloween costume. The school has since apologized for doing this to their students. They say that when it comes to future ideas for preventing cheating, they'll try and think outside the box.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nSAGAL: Bill, how did Roy do on our quiz?\n\nKURTIS: He got three right, six more points, total of nine.

Montana's Senate Race Might Come Down To Who's More Likable\n\nIn the tightening Senate race, Democratic Sen. Jon Tester and challenger Matt Rosendale are criss-crossing the vast, sparsely populated state with the hopes of meeting every voter personally.\n\nARI SHAPIRO, HOST:\n\nOne of the tightest U.S. Senate races in the country could come down to something pretty old-fashioned. Who is more likable? That's a key strategy of Montana Democrat Jon Tester. He's trying to win a third term against Republican challenger Matt Rosendale in a state where President Trump is wildly popular. NPR's Kirk Siegler reports.\n\nKIRK SIEGLER, BYLINE: President Trump will visit Montana for a fourth time this weekend to stump for Republican Matt Rosendale. He's a former state legislator and current insurance commissioner.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nMATT ROSENDALE: Good evening, Montana.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nSIEGLER: Here's Rosendale speaking at a recent Trump rally.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nROSENDALE: President Trump is making history again here in Montana, by golly.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nSIEGLER: Now, Rosendale's speeches tend to be short. He usually sticks to GOP talking points - on the border wall, on guns, repealing Obamacare. But he quickly comes back to the fact that he is all in with the Trump agenda.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nROSENDALE: President Trump and all of his policies are on the line. So let's make history and retire Jon Tester and send President Trump the help he needs.\n\nSIEGLER: Rosendale moved here from Maryland in 2002, which Democrats point out all the time, including in this Facebook ad where they make fun of how he pronounces the state name.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nUNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: Because he doesn't sound like a Montanan.\n\nROSENDALE: Citizens of Montana...\n\nThe people of Montana...\n\nCitizens of Montana...\n\nCitizens of Montana...\n\nSIEGLER: Montana is a huge state with barely a million people. So the political playbook here has always been shake as many hands with as many Montanans as possible.\n\nJON TESTER: How are you?\n\nUNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: Hi.\n\nSIEGLER: It's worked for Jon Tester twice before in similarly tight contests. With his signature flat-top hair, the Senate's only working farmer spent part of this week campaigning on the state's remote Hi-Line.\n\nTESTER: He doesn't know what the challenges are in Montana 'cause he's not from here. And look, I couldn't go to Maryland and do it. And I'm not going to 'cause I don't particularly want to. I love this state.\n\nSIEGLER: The Hi-Line is a vast region of prairies and wheat fields along the border with Canada near where Tester grew up. There are three reservations here, traditional Democratic strongholds.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED PERSON #3: (Singing).\n\nSIEGLER: At this get out the Native vote rally, there's an honor song. And at a nearby table, Raymond King, a Vietnam vet, says he doesn't trust Rosendale.\n\nRAYMOND KING: He's never lived here. He's not from here. How can he be for Montana? And so I think he just wants to sell some more land.\n\nSIEGLER: Rosendale has been a real estate developer. His campaign declined interview requests. And right now, support for Tester is predictably strong in the liberal college towns and say the state capitol. But the rural areas are harder to gauge. Most voted for Trump, but some also re-elected a Democratic governor. On the country highways, you're just as likely to see a Rosendale sign plastered on an old barn as you are one for Tester.\n\nSUSAN GOOD-GEISE: Montana is truly a maverick.\n\nSIEGLER: Susan Good-Geise is a classic example. She formerly chaired the state GOP but is a vocal critic of Trump. Now she says Montana is known for voting people over party.\n\nGOOD-GEISE: They want somebody who's approachable. They want somebody with whom they'd be comfortable having a beer or seeing them at church or seeing them at a basketball game, you know. And Jon Tester is certainly that.\n\nSIEGLER: But that folksy-old model is getting tested right now. And she says this race has become more like a symbol of the country's tribalized politics.\n\nBRAD LOTTON: Come on in, and get away from the highway.\n\nSIEGLER: In Havre, the largest town on Montana's Hi-Line, Republican Brad Lotton runs a construction company on the east end of town.\n\nLOTTON: I don't know how long you have to be here before you're considered a Montanan.\n\nSIEGLER: Now, Lotton's met Rosendale several times. And he supports him, even though like most people here Lotton has a connection to Tester. His brother went to junior high with him.\n\nLOTTON: But if you're a Montanan and you vote with California here, you really have lost touch with your voters or your constituents.\n\nSIEGLER: The latest poll shows Tester with a narrow lead, though the Libertarian candidate in the race just endorsed Matt Rosendale, which could give the Republican a boost.

Deal Or Disrupt? Congressional Democrats Weigh 2017 Choices\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Evan Vucci/AP Evan Vucci/AP\n\nDemocrats may have lost the House and the Senate over the past eight years, but they always had one thing: President Barack Obama — and his veto pen — in the White House.\n\nThat won't be the case next year, when Republicans find themselves with all the power in Washington for the first time since 2006.\n\nThe capitol's new power dynamic — and the aggressive agenda Republican leaders are laying out for 2017-- is forcing Democrats to make some tough strategic choices about how they'll work as a minority party.\n\nThe starting point in the conversation Democrats are having with themselves right now is this: Republicans in Congress spent almost all of the past eight years opposing President Obama, and they seem to have reaped a lot of political rewards for the block opposition.\n\nGOP leaders will get to set the agenda in Congress next year. And among their first orders of business will be voting on a Supreme Court nominee picked by President Donald Trump. That's after Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell rejected any hearings, let alone votes, for Obama's pick, Merrick Garland.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi is quick and careful to reject an approach of wholesale opposition, though. She recently described Democrats' approach as always trying to find a place where we can find a common goal. Giving [Republicans] credit, or saving face, whatever it happens to be.\n\nWe would be hopeful that there are some places that we can work together, Pelosi said.\n\nBut when Pelosi and other Democrats talk about working with Trump, that common goal is conditional. They say Trump would have to be willing to do things they care about — like, perhaps, following through on a promise to spend hundreds of billions of dollars on infrastructure projects.\n\nWe think it should be large. He's mentioned a trillion dollars. I told him that sounds good to me, incoming Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer recently told ABC News.\n\nHighlighting differences\n\nBut otherwise, Democrats are confident that drawing out their differences with the new president will be a winning strategy.\n\nOur big leverage is the public, Pelosi said, expressing confidence that public opinion sides with Democrats when it comes to issues like not making major changes to Medicare and Social Security.\n\nDemocrats are eager to draw the contrast on those sorts of topics, and see those particular wedge issues as a big reason why they won back the House and Senate in 2006, the last time Republicans held so much power in Washington.\n\nThat's why, while Republicans like McConnell and House Speaker Paul Ryan are focusing on repealing Obamacare, Pelosi, Schumer, and other Democrats keep talking about the possibility of wholesale Medicare changes.\n\nRepublicans here in Washington are gearing up for a war on seniors, Schumer warned at a recent Washington press conference with a hands off our Medicare message.\n\nSchumer said Senate Democrats will give one heck of a hearing to Rep. Tom Price, Trump's pick for the Department of Health and Human Services and a longtime Medicare critic.\n\nDemocrats think they can generate a lot of positive headlines by grilling Trump's cabinet picks. These are, with a few exceptions, radical nominees, the likes of which we have never seen in this country, said Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut.\n\nDemocrats see hearings as a way to continue emphasizing their key concerns about Trump, like the fact he never released his tax returns, and the ongoing question of how he'll avoid conflict-of-interest problems as president.\n\nThey see Secretary of State nominee Rex Tillerson's hearing as an avenue to highlight Russia's attempt to disrupt the presidential race, and Trump's warm words toward Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nA big choice on Obamacare\n\nBut highlighting contrasts can only go so far, when Republicans set the Congressional agenda.\n\nAt some point, Democrats still face a choice. Do they do their best to block every single big initiative, or try to work with Republicans to make it more Democrat-friendly?\n\nSarah Binder studies Congress at the Brookings Institution, and said Democrats do have leverage. On most measures, whether it's spending bills, deregulation, repeal Dodd-Frank. That all requires cooperation from at least eight Democrats.\n\nThat's because while Republicans will control the Senate with 52 seats, they'll need at least 60 votes to advance bills in the chamber.\n\nThe hardest political calculus could be Obamacare.\n\nRepublicans can repeal the landmark law without any Democratic votes, using the budget reconciliation process that helped pass the initial law. But they'd need Democratic support in the Senate to pass a replacement plan, since the measure would be subject to filibuster.\n\nBlocking any sort of replacement plan, and then trying to lay the blame for disappearing health care coverage on Trump and Republicans, would be a bold, if callous, political move.\n\nAre they kind of, as a party, constitutionally adverse to that type of strategy? Many people think so, said Binder. That they just value government and legislative action too much to do that to the process.\n\nIndeed, many Democrats might want to work with Republicans to keep as much of Obamacare as they can.\n\nBut helping give Trump a big legislative accomplishment could make him more popular. And it could anger progressive activists.\n\nIt is the responsibility of this minority of Democrats in Congress to block, obstruct, disrupt, and do whatever they can, filmmaker Michael Moore recently argued on CNN.\n\nHe issued a warning to Democrats who may consider cutting deals with Trump: In the same way that the Tea Party was there in 2009, myself and thousands like me are going to be at those town halls in the district in the spring. And we will primary these Democrats if they don't do their job.\n\nWarnings like that may be why leaders like Schumer are quick to qualify any talk about working with Trump on issues like infrastructure spending. When we oppose Trump on values, or if his presidency takes a dark, divisive turn, we're going to do it tooth-and-nail, he told ABC News.\n\nPelosi knows Democrats all across the country are anxious. But she's urging patience as the party tries to make its case to voters.\n\nSomebody used the analogy of, it's like telling somebody they married the wrong person or their art is fake, she recently told reporters.\n\nThe first scenario is something many people have seen happen to a friend or family member. The second? Maybe not as much. Still, Pelosi's point was that American voters did choose Trump and the GOP this year.\n\nThey bought it. They'll find out sooner or later whether they made a mistake, she said, arguing that it's better to let the married couple or art connoisseur make that discovery themselves, than to be told by an outside party.\n\nPelosi has seen voters reject Democrats, come back to the party, and then reject them again.\n\nShe said she is patient enough to point out the key differences between the parties, and wait for voters to eventually come back.
Biden To Sign 2 Executive Actions Related To Health Care\n\nRACHEL MARTIN, HOST:\n\nSince taking office, President Joe Biden has signed a long list of executive orders to try to fulfill his core campaign promises or at least to signal their priority in his administration. Today, health care is in the spotlight. President Biden is signing two executive actions. One aims to increase access to health insurance through the Affordable Care Act and increase access to Medicaid. The other is a memorandum to expand access to reproductive health. NPR health policy reporter Selena Simmons-Duffin is with us for details. Good morning, Selena.\n\nSELENA SIMMONS-DUFFIN, BYLINE: Good morning, Rachel.\n\nMARTIN: What can you tell us? Let's start off with the executive order on the ACA.\n\nSIMMONS-DUFFIN: So the big news there is that the Biden administration is opening up a special enrollment period on healthcare.gov. That is the federally run health insurance exchange. Starting February 15, Americans will have three months to sign up for a health plan if their state uses healthcare.gov as its Obamacare exchange - most states do. That will be open for three months until mid-May. And that means you don't have to prove you've just lost coverage or had a qualifying life event. You could just go in, choose a plan, get covered. And this is the first time there's been a special enrollment period on the federal exchange during the pandemic. The Trump administration faced pressure to have one in the spring, but it never did.\n\nMARTIN: And this executive order addresses Medicaid as well.\n\nSIMMONS-DUFFIN: Yeah, that's right. Medicaid has turned out to be key in preventing millions of people who've lost jobs from the coronavirus recession from losing their health coverage as well. That's the health plan for low-income people. And last night, the White House put out this fact sheet about the executive order, and it seems pretty sweeping. It's asking federal agencies to look at any rules or policies that make it harder for people to have access to health insurance, either through ACA exchanges or Medicaid. And that includes the controversial work requirements that the Trump administration encouraged states to take up in the last few years. And there are other ways that Biden has said he would like to shore up the ACA. But this is a significant start in terms of what he can do from the executive branch.\n\nMARTIN: OK, so the Medicaid and the ACA access, that's encompassed in one executive action. And then there's this memorandum on reproductive health, right?\n\nSIMMONS-DUFFIN: Yeah, that's right. So first of all, this one rescinds the global gag rule or Mexico City policy that bans federal dollars from going to international organizations that provide or refer people for abortions. And this is kind of a yo-yo issue. So Republican presidents reinstate it, Democrats rescind it. Biden is getting rid of it. He's also asking for a review of a Trump policy that prevented organizations that promote or provide abortions here in the U.S. from having access to Title X funding. So Biden wants to get rid of that policy as well.\n\nMARTIN: So, I mean, we've talked about this on the show. President Biden, other presidents before him, use executive actions when, frankly, on a lot of these issues, they don't think they can get the support in time in Congress. So when you think about these executive orders, when you think about President Biden and what he said about his agenda, where does health policy fall?\n\nSIMMONS-DUFFIN: Yeah, that's right. It's kind of hard to remember that health policy was supposed to be the issue of the 2020 election. That's not exactly how it shook out.\n\nMARTIN: Right.\n\nSIMMONS-DUFFIN: But, yes, I think that Biden is going to be using executive action. And some health experts that I've talked to have said that Trump gave him a playbook for how to do this. All that Trump did on the issue was through the executive branch. He didn't get a single piece of big health legislation through Congress. So Biden has that model to work from to shape this issue in a totally different way with totally different priorities and values. And also part of what he's doing is getting this on people's radar. There are 26 million uninsured people in this country. It's a pandemic. A lot of people don't know that the Affordable Care Act is still the law. And so I'm expecting to see a big push to try to get people to know that this open enrollment period is coming on February 15.\n\nMARTIN: NPR health policy reporter Selena Simmons-Duffin, thank you.\n\nSIMMONS-DUFFIN: Thank you.\n\nCopyright © 2021 NPR.

GOP Rep. Warren Davidson On Trump Win And Freedom Caucus Vision\n\nNPR's Audie Cornish talks to Republican Rep. Warren Davidson of Ohio, who replaced former Speaker John Boehner last year, about Trump's win and what the Freedom Caucus is hoping to accomplish.\n\nAUDIE CORNISH, HOST:\n\nWe're going to get more reaction to the election results now from Congressman Warren Davidson of Ohio. He's a Republican and member of the conservative House Freedom Caucus. Congressman Davidson, welcome to the show.\n\nWARREN DAVIDSON: Thank you. It's nice to talk with you.\n\nCORNISH: Now, establishment Republicans in Ohio have had a mixed relationship with Donald Trump to say the least. Do you think it was a mistake for Republicans like, say, John Kasich to not support Trump? Is the party Trump's party now?\n\nDAVIDSON: Well, the party will become the party that the people have asked for, which is to reject the status quo. So to that extent, Donald Trump clearly ran on a platform of rejecting the status quo. And a part of that involves the kind of traditional political class, but a whole lot of it involves the policies that have resulted in inaction on some of the big issues of the day.\n\nCORNISH: You replace the last House speaker, John Boehner, in his district in Ohio. He left in the middle of his term. Do you plan to support Paul Ryan as House speaker now? Will the House Freedom Caucus move to replace him?\n\nDAVIDSON: Yeah, I don't think that's the topic for the day. I mean there's - we're talking about leadership next week. Today's a good day to celebrate and to unite.\n\nCORNISH: Congressman - so meaning that that is off the table or just something you'll talk about next week?\n\nDAVIDSON: Yeah, that's a topic that the House will take up next week for leadership elections. And I think today's a day to celebrate and just focus on, you know, the direction the country wants to go, which is, you know - all this is inside politics and the kind of struggle for power and inside, you know, baseball are the kinds of things that I think this election says, yeah, we're sick of that; go get stuff done.\n\nCORNISH: But the House Freedom Caucus has been a powerful voice in Congress, but it has been a minority voice. I mean what's your response to what Speaker Ryan had to say today?\n\nDAVIDSON: Well, I enjoy what he had to say. I think it was right on. It's a day to celebrate. We did far better across the conference than most people had projected. We lost a few seats, which is disappointing. We picked up I think 26 new Republicans that will be joining the House. That's something to be thankful for. We held the Senate. There was a lot of debate about that. And we get an opportunity to have a unified government with President Trump going forward.\n\nSo when you talk to people in our district, for sure it really felt like we were always on defense, and people were hungry for offense, for us to go out and work to implement really our platform, things like Obamacare, things like the health care system that's been broken. And we tried the Democrats' solution, and it's actually made things worse. So the people are anxious to go out there and say, no, please go solve this problem.\n\nCORNISH: Lawmakers such as yourself and especially in the Freedom Caucus have really tried to rein in government spending. Donald Trump's - some of his major policy issues like, say, an infrastructure bank involve quite a bit of spending. What are your concerns going forward?\n\nDAVIDSON: Yeah, I think that's one of the things that unites conservatives at least. You know, I've met members of Congress that believe deficits don't matter. I'm not one, and conservatives generally agree. At a minimum, we coalesce around don't bankrupt America.\n\nCORNISH: So are there red flags from some of the policy items you've heard from him this year?\n\nDAVIDSON: Yeah, I think there was very little attention paid in the presidential debate about, you know, our debt crisis. But what you did see really, if you look at the contrast to the extent it was in there, between Hillary Clinton's plan and Donald's vision - Donald Trump's vision - is, you know, you had one plan that said, we can spend our way out of a debt crisis. That was what Hillary Clinton offered.\n\nAnd we had another plan that said, we are going to need to grow our way out of this debt crisis. And that was essentially Donald Trump's plan. I know it's the House's plan, and I think it will work.\n\nCORNISH: Congressman Warren Davidson, Republican of Ohio, thank you so much for speaking with us.\n\nDAVIDSON: Yeah, thank you.\n\nCopyright © 2016 NPR.

Week In Politics: New N.C. Election And Emergency Border Declaration\n\nNPR's Ari Shapiro talks with E.J. Dionne of The Washington Post and Tiana Lowe of the Washington Examiner about House lawmakers' plan to vote on legislation to block President Trump's national emergency declaration and a new election in North Carolina's House race.\n\nARI SHAPIRO, HOST:\n\nThe China tariff deadline is just one in a cascade of news events we're expecting next week. There is a North Korea summit, testimony from President Trump's former fixer, Michael Cohen, and on Tuesday, the House will vote on a bill to block the president's national emergency declaration on the border. That's where we are going to start our week in politics conversation. Our guests today are Tiana Lowe, who writes for the Washington Examiner. Thanks for being here.\n\nTIANA LOWE: Hi.\n\nSHAPIRO: And we have E.J. Dionne of The Washington Post and the Brookings Institution. Always good to have you, E.J.\n\nE J DIONNE, BYLINE: Good to see you.\n\nSHAPIRO: When President Trump announced the emergency declaration a week ago, he said he knew he would get pushback, and he has. States have filed lawsuits. And now the House is going to vote on Tuesday. This is what Speaker Nancy Pelosi said in a conference call with reporters this morning.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nNANCY PELOSI: The president's act is lawless and does violence to our Constitution and therefore to our democracy.\n\nSHAPIRO: Tiana, Republicans were very concerned during the Obama administration about executive overreach. Do you expect any Republican lawmakers will support this House bill?\n\nLOWE: Well, right now, the only Republican to come out publicly saying that they will support this resolution is Representative Justin Amash. But that being said, this resolution doesn't really do what Congress actually has to do. Right now, they've abdicated their responsibility to define what emergency powers truly are. And a resolution is one thing, but actually creating legislation to provide definitive legal bounds on the provisions and what constitutes the powers of the president to declare a national emergency - that would be a lot more powerful statement rather than a singular rebuke of this president.\n\nSHAPIRO: But given that Senator Mitch McConnell has said he is going to support President Trump's emergency declaration, Congress taking that kind of a move or even something more modest doesn't seem very likely, E.J.\n\nDIONNE: Well, I think it's a very good thing that this is coming to a vote because it will probably pass the House with maybe a few Republican votes. But then under the law, the Senate has to vote on it, and it seems to me that Republicans who like to call themselves constitutional conservatives - it's a very popular term - are really going to have, or at least should have, a hard time ceding all of this authority to Trump when he's really only doing it because Congress wouldn't appropriate money the way he wanted to appropriate it.\n\nI actually agree that we need to revisit the emergency powers. I don't think it's that they - there aren't limits, but I think they're written in a way that give the president even more power than people realize because no one really expected a president to use emergency powers this - in this partisan or I would say irresponsible a way.\n\nSHAPIRO: I wonder whether you each think that this House vote on Tuesday is more about protecting institutions and preserving the separation of powers, as Democrats argue, or is it about denying the president victory on his signature campaign promise? Tiana, what do you think?\n\nLOWE: I do think that it's more about a rebuke of Trump because if you look at the breakdown of the funding, you know, the first $3.5 billion of what - of these three parts that have constituted emergency funding are not actually parts of emergency funding. There's only the $3.6 billion that's from actual emergency declaration. And again saying a singular resolution for Trump to be unable to use that $3.6 billion when he would already have to make it through almost $5 billion before then - which will take him well into 2020 to do so - that is a lot less powerful a statement than actually going back to the original National Emergencies Act and rewriting the law and taking the constitutional powers back. It is very possible that what Trump is doing is legal, but is it what the Founding Fathers intended in the Constitution - probably not.\n\nSHAPIRO: E.J., what do you think this is about?\n\nDIONNE: Well, there is a fundamental disagreement on the wall, and it's about that. But I do think it's fundamentally about presidential power and the abuse of it. And that's why I think there will be Republicans who are going to have to search their consciences. Marco Rubio, for example, has said critical things about this. Will they be there when the vote comes? I think this is a real test for a lot of Republicans in the Senate.\n\nSHAPIRO: To move on to another topic - when Congress casts that vote next week, one district in North Carolina will not have a voting member. Yesterday, after a remarkable hearing, the state's Board of Elections voted to throw out the results from last November because of election fraud. The Republican in the race, Mark Harris, said this.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nMARK HARRIS: Through the testimony I've listened to over the past three days, I believe a new election should be called. It's become clear to me that the public's confidence in the 9th District seat general election has been undermined to an extent that a new election is warranted.\n\nSHAPIRO: E.J., do you think Harris should get another shot at that seat?\n\nDIONNE: No. I - you know, I think it's very odd, as a lot of people have pointed out, that, well, the guy cheated, so he gets to play the game all over again. I just don't know if there was a legal way to keep him off the ballot. There's a lot of - a lot of Democrats see an almost delicious irony in this. Here it was - the Republicans who have been charging all this in-person voter fraud - and a presidential commission had to be disbanded because it doesn't really exist - and now you have a Republican charged with voter fraud. Two good things here; one - this was decided in a nonpartisan way, which is a good thing, and secondly, Democrats were ready to refuse to cede Harris because of these obligations. It could have become a - it could have become a partisan fight. Now everybody can agree on the facts, and they can fight a new election again.\n\nSHAPIRO: Tiana, does it seem odd to you that President Trump, who has often raised the specter of voter fraud, hasn't tweeted at all about this case?\n\nLOWE: So I just saw that he finally condemned voter fraud of all kinds, you know, sort of in broad terms. But, obviously, when you tweet as much as the president does, what he doesn't emphasize says just as much as what he does emphasize. I think it is good, though, even if only in nominal terms that he does denounce the fact that this was a fairly obvious act of voter deception.\n\nSHAPIRO: All right. In our last couple of minutes, I want to ask you both about something that one of the 2020 Democratic candidates proposed this week. Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren rolled out a plan that would give all Americans affordable child care paid for with a tax on multimillionaires. And, of course, this is after Ivanka Trump proposed a child tax credit. Senators Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, Kirsten Gillibrand of New York are talking about affordable child care. Do you both think that there is a growing bipartisan sense that the U.S. should make it easier for working parents to be working parents - Tiana?\n\nLOWE: When you frame it like that, then I believe it's a positive thing. But I don't think that that's what these bills necessarily do. If you look at these paid parental leave acts, I mean, Obamacare architect Jonathan Gruber found that women bear 100 percent of the economic burden of all paid parental leave programs because disproportionately women are the ones to take time off. There is a reason why 10 percent more women are in management positions in America than in Scandinavian countries, and it's because women are kept in the workplace, and a lot of these programs disincentivize women from staying in the workplace.\n\nSHAPIRO: E.J., briefly, I want to give you the last word.\n\nDIONNE: I think a lot of women are forced out of the labor force because they are - we give so little support to women who actually work and have to - in most - in many cases have to work to support their families. I like this proposal for the reasons Paul Krugman described. It's a realistic, medium-sized proposal that will help solve a problem. Democrats should be talking about more of those.\n\nSHAPIRO: That's E.J. Dionne of The Washington Post and the Brookings Institution and Tiana Lowe of the Washington Examiner. Thank you both for joining us and have a great weekend.\n\nCopyright © 2019 NPR. All rights reserved.

Coronavirus Response Shows How A National Crisis Can Again Transform Politics\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Paul Sancya/AP Paul Sancya/AP\n\nJust like the coronavirus pandemic could permanently change daily life in America, from hand washing habits to telework, it also has the potential to transform the country's politics in profound ways.\n\nThis crisis is a time machine to the future, says Anne-Marie Slaughter, CEO of the think tank New America and a former director of policy planning at the State Department during the Obama administration. I think we'll look back and see that this was like the Great Depression or a war, and that created political space to make big policy change that seemed just too hard even two months ago.\n\nAfter every big national crisis in America, the federal government has emerged with a new, greater role.\n\nFormer Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, who as President Obama's chief of staff during the Great Recession famously said never allow a good crisis go to waste, points out that after the Civil War came land grant colleges and the national railway system; after the Great Depression came rural electrification and Social Security; and at the height of the Cold War President Eisenhower proposed a national highway system — all big federal investments that changed the fabric of life across the country.\n\nThe current pandemic and expected recession could result in a new, expanded role for the federal government again.\n\nBig policy changes could also rearrange traditional political divisions, now that Republicans in the Senate have voted unanimously for policies they've opposed in the past, like paid sick leave, a guaranteed minimum income, student debt relief protections for renters and support for gig economy workers. Of course, this massive package of federal help for ordinary people is only temporary, but Democrats are hoping that not all of it is.\n\nSuddenly, in a crisis like this, people realize across the political spectrum that unless we can provide a floor, the whole economy can crash, said Slaughter, noting the potential for permanent changes to the political debate. That paid sick leave is not about coddling workers. It's about making sure that sick workers don't come to work and infect others. People are equally realizing, if workers have no money to spend, the economy can't function.\n\nDemocrats have advocated many of these policies for decades. But now that Congress has approved the largest federal intervention in the economy since the creation of Medicare, they see a new opportunity to push for big investments in modern digital infrastructure like 5G, a better public health system, universal health insurance that doesn't disappear when you lose your job, and a stronger social safety net.\n\nFormer Clinton White House aide Bill Galston summed up the Democrats' argument this way: The COVID-19 pandemic has been a brutal x-ray of the weaknesses of our social safety net in dealing with national emergencies. We shouldn't be caught flat-footed by the next emergency any more than we should be caught flat-footed with a nearly empty national health emergency reserve, which was never restocked when it should have been.\n\nBut Democrats aren't the only ones who see a political opportunity in the pandemic. The nationalist, populist wing of the Republican Party that's been warning about the dangers of globalization also appears to have gotten a boost.\n\nOne of the core arguments of the Trump 2016 campaign is that in our supply chains and our manufacturing economy, we'd become too dependent on a globalized world, especially China, said conservative J.D. Vance, the author of Hillbilly Elegy. It turns out that if you want to have an economy that can weather a crisis, you actually have to be able to make some core things yourself, whether it's wireless technology, whether it's pharmaceutical products, whether it's ventilators and hospital masks.\n\nAnd that's exactly the argument that you're hearing from White House trade adviser Peter Navarro, President Trump's pandemic equipment czar.\n\nIf there's any vindication of the president's 'Buy American, secure borders and a strong manufacturing base' philosophy, strategy and belief, it is this crisis, Navarro said during a White House press briefing earlier this month.\n\nOn trade, the pandemic gives a clear advantage to the anti-globalists in the GOP led by Trump, but on domestic policies and the role of the federal government, while Democrats know what they want, Republicans aren't so sure, according to Henry Olsen, a senior fellow at the Ethics & Public Policy Center in Washington.\n\nI think the debate within the Republican Party over what it stands for has been heating up, and the pandemic is going to kick it into overdrive, Olsen said. You've got the people who are holding onto the neo-libertarian version of the past. But you've seen more and more calls for reform, which is moving more in the direction of engaging the Democrats on their core issue, which is, how do we help people rather than saying the government can't help people?\n\nHe added, I think you'll see that debate ramp up once we return to more normal politics after the lockdowns are over. Then, I think the battle in the Republican Party is going to be fierce.\n\nThere are already lots of splits.\n\nFreshman Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., for instance, wants to beef up the social safety net, advocating a European-style unemployment backstop, where the federal government would pay companies 80% of wages to prevent layoffs during the crisis.\n\nOther Republicans, however, support nothing more than the current temporary emergency measures. And in addition to Tea Party-style protests against the stay-at-home orders, there's also conservative pushback to the exponential increases in federal spending — even the temporary ones.\n\nRepublicans shouldn't expect to get any guidance from the president on resolving these internal disputes, according to Olsen. If Donald Trump does what he usually does, he will gyrate between positions that each side can support, he said. And if the party does what it usually does, in the short term it will be locked in stasis, trying to figure out which iceberg Trump is going to land on and try to be there.\n\nBut in the meantime, until Republicans agree on what they stand for, it may be hard for the president and his party to continue to argue that popular programs, like Obamacare, should be eliminated lock, stock and barrel.\n\nI think the appetite for small-government, everyone-is-on-their-own approach to the welfare state, frankly, was always pretty small and it's gonna be even smaller, I think, over the next couple of years, said Vance, particularly given the massive numbers of people applying for unemployment benefits, which hit 22 million last week, canceling out nearly all of the job gains since the Great Recession.\n\nHow this debate resolves itself depends on how long the pandemic recession lasts and how popular the government rescue programs turn out to be. As Olsen points out, If the giant government rescue plan works, it will legitimize government intervention in the economy in a way we haven't seen in decades.\n\nUntil then, the pandemic has given both parties an opportunity to appeal to the vast number of Americans who will need help from the federal government for some time to come.
Donald Trump Says He'll Deport 2-3 Million People Once In Office\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Ethan Miller/Getty Images Ethan Miller/Getty Images\n\nUpdated at 7:30 p.m. ET\n\nHe'll build a border wall and he'll deport millions of people who are in the U.S. illegally, President-elect Donald Trump says, promising to keep his campaign pledges on immigration in his first prolonged interview since winning the White House.\n\nSaying that his administration will deport probably 2 million — and possibly 3 million — people who are in the country illegally, Trump told 60 Minutes' Lesley Stahl that he wants to secure the border. Trump also seemed willing to consider the plan some of his fellow Republicans have aired, of securing some parts of the border with a fence.\n\nThe interview with Trump aired on CBS Sunday night; it also includes members of his family. The interview was taped Friday at Trump's Fifth Avenue residence in New York City. It comes after days of anti-Trump protests in more than a dozen American cities, where demonstrators have criticized the incoming president's immigration stance.\n\nOn another campaign promise, Trump affirmed his plan to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare.\n\nBut Trump also wants to keep some parts of the plan. For instance, he told Stahl that he'll maintain coverage for people with pre-existing conditions, because it happens to be one of the strongest assets of the plan.\n\nTrump also said he wants to keep a portion of the law that covers children living with their parents for an extended period.\n\nAs for how the change from one sphere of coverage to another might work, Trump promised it would be smooth, saying, We're going to do it simultaneously. It'll be just fine. That's what I do. I do a good job. You know, I mean, I know how to do this stuff.\n\nHe continued: We're going to repeal it and replace it. And we're not going to have, like, a two-day period and we're not going to have a two-year period where there's nothing. It will be repealed and replaced. I mean, you'll know. And it'll be great health care for much less money.\n\nHere's what Trump told 60 Minutes when he was asked about undocumented immigrants in the U.S.:\n\nWhat we are going to do is get the people that are criminal and have criminal records — gang members, drug dealers — we have a lot of these people, probably 2 million, it could be even 3 million. We're getting them out of our country or we're going to incarcerate. But we're getting them out of our country, they're here illegally. After the border is secured, and after everything gets normalized, we're going to make a determination on the people that you're talking about — who are terrific people, they're terrific people. But we're going to make a determination ... but before we make that determination, Leslie, it's very important, we're going to secure our border.\n\nFor comparison purposes, we'll note that in President Obama's first term, his administration carried out a record 1.5 million deportations — including more than 400,000 in fiscal year 2012. The figure declined to 235,413 in fiscal year 2015, and as NPR's Scott Horsley reported this summer, the Obama administration has shifted its focus to deporting criminals, people caught near the border, and those who recently came to the country without securing documents.\n\nAs Scott Horsley noted in a review of recent U.S. immigration policy, the rate of deportations went up under Obama, just as it had under the previous two presidents. And Trump took notice, back in August.\n\nWhat people don't know is that Obama got tremendous numbers of people out of the country, Trump told Fox News' Bill O'Reilly. Bush, the same thing. Lots of people were brought out of the country with the existing laws. Well, I'm going to do the same thing.\n\nThe plan for a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico is Trump's new facet in immigration policy. Here's his exchange with Stahl, discussing the idea:\n\nAre you really going to build a wall? Stahl asks. Yes, Trump says. They're talking about a fence in the Republican Congress. Would you accept a fence? For certain areas I would — but certain areas, a wall is more appropriate. I'm very good at this, it's called construction. So, part wall, part fence? Yeah, it could be some fencing.\n\nIn the course of the interview, Trump remained noncommittal on several topics that informed his campaign.\n\nOn whether he will appoint a special prosecutor to investigate Hillary Clinton: They're good people; I don't want to hurt them, Trump said, telling Stahl he will give a very good and definitive answer the next time we do 60 Minutes together.\n\nOn whether he will release his tax returns: At the appropriate time, I will release them. But right now I'm under routine audit. Nobody cares. The only one who cares is, you know, you and a few people that asked that question.\n\nOn the presence of lobbyists on his transition team, despite his pledge to drain the swamp of lobbyists and special interests in Washington: That's the only people you have down here, he said, later adding: I'm saying that they know the system right now, but we're going to phase that out.\n\nAround the Nation Threats And Intimidation Against Minorities Reported Nationwide Threats And Intimidation Against Minorities Reported Nationwide Listen · 3:09 3:09\n\nAsked about his personal views on same-sex marriage, Trump said, It's irrelevant, because it was already settled. It's law. It was settled in the Supreme Court. I mean, it's done.\n\nAnd when pressed on the fears felt by African-Americans, American Muslims and other minorities since the election, Trump dismissed the anxieties as products of the media. I think it's built up by the press because, frankly, they'll take every single little incident that they can find in this country, which could've been there before. If I weren't even around doing this, and they'll make into an event because that's the way the press is.\n\nAs for the dozens of acts of harassment and intimidation against minorities that have been reported this week, many of which were allegedly performed in his name, Trump said he's surprised to hear of them. I'm so saddened to hear that, he said. And I say, stop it. If it — if it helps, I will say this and I will say right to the cameras: Stop it.
Moderate Democrats Under Pressure As Party's Left Grabs Attention\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Matt Eich for NPR Matt Eich for NPR\n\nFor Democrats, one of the keys to winning control of the House of Representatives last year was convincing voters in formerly Republican districts that there's more than one way to be a Democrat.\n\nRep. Abigail Spanberger, D-Va., was one of dozens of new members who ousted Republicans, in part on a pledge to buck party leaders and work across the aisle. Spanberger spent her first three months in office following through on that promise — she voted against Nancy Pelosi for speaker of the House and split from Democrats on a number of procedural votes.\n\nBut constituents in her ideologically diverse district are still asking if her independence will stand firm as other more nationally recognized Democrats, like her House colleague New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, and several Senate Democrats running for president in 2020 try to pull the party to the left ahead of the election in 2020.\n\nSpanberger's bipartisan credentials were a central issue for voters at a town hall in the Nottoway High School auditorium in rural Crewe, Va, a more conservative corner of her district.\n\nI've heard you talk a lot tonight about bipartisanship, said a woman who identified herself as Sue Christian, a resident of Crewe.\n\nChristian had questions on Spanberger's stance on abortion rights and scandals surrounding Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam who faced pressure to resign after a racist yearbook photo surfaced decades after he was in medical school. But she also wanted to know about Spanberger's voting record.\n\nHave you ever voted against Nancy Pelosi?, she asked. And if so, on what?\n\nThat's a question Spanberger was ready for. The former CIA officer and first-time politician knew that once she defeated Republican Dave Brat to represent Virginia's 7th Congressional District she'd have to defend her promise to work across the aisle pretty often.\n\nYes, she responded with a smile. So I voted against Nancy Pelosi a couple of times. I did not vote for her to be speaker of the House.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Matt Eich for NPR Matt Eich for NPR\n\nShe went on to say she also voted with Republicans on a number of smaller bills — including an amendment to a gun bill that drew the ire and frustration of many of her progressive colleagues.\n\nSpanberger also highlighted her work on the bipartisan Problem Solvers caucus and told voters that she was one of just a handful of Democrats invited to the White House in January to discuss border security with President Trump.\n\nBut that record has not been enough to completely inoculate her from questions about her role in a party that some voters see as moving steadily to the left. Over the course of the hour-long meeting, Spanberger fielded questions on Obamacare, President Trump's push for a Southern border wall and some social issues.\n\nPeter Hasso spoke up to challenge Spanberger on her position on Trump's proposed border wall with Mexico. After the meeting he said Spanberger's answers were pretty much what he expected, and he wasn't convinced that she's any different from other Democrats.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Matt Eich for NPR Matt Eich for NPR\n\nI think unfortunately when people get it to Washington — they don't call it the swamp for nothing, Hasso said. They get mired in it. It doesn't matter whether you're Democrat or Republican, they get mired in the system.\n\nHe says Democrats like Spanberger are getting drawn into a party that wants to go left — and specifically mentioned progressive members like Reps. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., and Ocasio-Cortez, who he identified as socialists.\n\nHasso says Spanberger can't support Omar and Ocasio-Cortez and still say she's a different kind of Democrat.\n\nShe's riding both sides of the fence, Hasso said. And she's trying not to be identified. I don't blame her. I wouldn't want to be identified with AOC and all of these other people.\n\nSpanberger says her record should speak for itself but her liberal colleagues are often the ones in the national spotlight passionately defending controversial policies like Medicare-for-all and the sweeping climate proposal known as the Green New Deal.\n\nTheir priorities, and not hers, have been setting the tone for what a lot of voters picture when they hear the label Democrat.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Matt Eich for NPR Matt Eich for NPR\n\nI know what it's like in my district, Spanberger said after the town hall. I would find it more helpful if other Democrats, when they talk about their districts would talk about their districts and the priorities of their districts so I don't have to go back to my constituents and say 'yes, I know that's not you all.'\n\nCentrists like Spanberger have at times faced intense criticism from some liberal members, like Ocasio-Cortez, particularly after they voted with Republicans to pass a procedural motion that Democrats hoped to block.\n\nThat led to threats from progressives that they would get activists to target moderates to try to sway their votes.\n\nI can have colleagues threaten me as much as they like, Spanberger said. I'm going to continue serving my district in a way I think is important. And I'm going to continue serving in Congress in a way I think is important. And that doesn't mean falling in line on every single vote.\n\nHasso and some other voters here aren't moved by that argument at all.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Matt Eich for NPR Matt Eich for NPR\n\nBut others, like Billy Coleburn, the mayor of the nearby town of Blackstone, say they've really been impressed by Spanberger's willingness to stand up to Pelosi and to come out and talk to voters at town halls like this. And Coleburn wants to be clear he's not exactly a Democrat.\n\nI am one who voted for Donald Trump, Coleburn said. I was an obnoxious Trump supporter in 2015 from the minute he got off the elevator, not because he was so good looking or eloquent, but because I wanted to put the middle finger to the establishment.\n\nBut now, he could see himself voting a split ticket, Trump/Spanberger in 2020, provided Spanberger keeps voting independently.\n\nAs someone who still believes in Trump's policies, I have a lot of respect for Abigail Spanberger, Coleburn said. We've talked, we've joked about that.
Trump And Biden Had A Real Debate, And 4 Other Takeaways\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Brendan Smialowski/AFP via Getty Images Brendan Smialowski/AFP via Getty Images\n\nPresident Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden met for their second and final debate as tens of millions of Americans have already voted. A deeply divided country begins its final sprint to Election Day amid the coronavirus pandemic, and it's unclear how many voters have yet to make up their minds.\n\nHere are five takeaways from the debate in Nashville, Tenn., a much different — and far more civil — night than the last encounter.\n\nNPR YouTube\n\n1. There was a real debate\n\nThe first debate between Trump and Biden was unwatchable. It was overwhelmed by interruptions and cross-talk, disregard for the moderator and name-calling — all largely on the part of the president.\n\nNew rules imposed by the Commission on Presidential Debates included a mute button operated by a staffer for the CPD that turned off each candidate's microphone for the first two minutes of his opponent's speaking time at the beginning of each debate topic.\n\nModerator Kristen Welker of NBC News skillfully kept the conversation moving. She followed up and pressed for answers and fairly gave both candidates opportunities to respond to the other's comments. Welker pushed back when the candidates attempted to run over time or tried to change the subject. She was firm and her no-nonsense approach held the candidates to task.\n\nTrump dropped in the polls after the first debate and got advice from Republicans to tone it down this time. Thursday night he was more measured and attempted to stay on message. Biden was also more disciplined and came prepared to address personal attacks the Trump campaign signaled beforehand it was going to make about his son Hunter's business dealings.\n\n2. The coronavirus is still the driving force in the election\n\nThe 2020 election remains focused on Trump's handling of the coronavirus, and it was the subject of Welker's first question. Both candidates tested negative for the coronavirus prior to entering the venue on Thursday, and those in the small audience were required to wear masks. Members of the Trump family adhered to the rules, donning masks and appearing to keep them on after conspicuously refusing to do so during the first debate.\n\nThe two candidates' approaches and attitudes could not have been more different on the pandemic. Biden warned a dark winter was looming and that with 220,000 Americans dead the president had failed from the outset to take control of the response to the virus.\n\nAnyone who is responsible for that many deaths should not remain as president of the United States of the America, Biden said.\n\nTrump repeatedly claimed that his approach saved millions of lives and that we're rounding the turn. After testing positive himself following the last debate, the president acknowledged he had personal experience with the disease but argued it was manageable, saying, I had it. And I got better.\n\nHe repeated his claim that a vaccine was weeks away, but when pressed admitted: It's not a guarantee. Trump said it has a good chance by the end of the year to be approved, and that he had a plan lined up for the military to help distribute millions of doses.\n\nThe president attempted to pivot to the economic impact of returning to restrictions, arguing that Biden wanted to shut down the country, saying: We can't keep this country closed. This is a massive country with a massive economy. People are losing their jobs.\n\nBiden retorted, referring to the virus, He says that we're learning to live with it. People are learning to die with it.\n\n3. Health care debate pitted Bidencare versus ending Obamacare\n\nDemocrats have made the GOP effort to end Obamacare a key line of attack in the campaign, both in the presidential election and in congressional races, and it's proven effective.\n\nBiden dubbed his plan for the Affordable Care Act Bidencare during Thursday night's debate.\n\nThe president vowed to protect preexisting conditions, but Biden hammered him for not presenting a plan to replace the ACA despite four years of indicating one was imminent. The Supreme Court is slated to hear a challenge to the law brought by the Trump administration one week after the election. As he's done before, Biden linked health care concerns over the coronavirus pandemic to the administration's efforts to dismantle the ACA.\n\nEarlier on Thursday, the president released raw video from a taped interview with the CBS News program 60 Minutes where he was pressed about his position on the ACA. Trump declared, I hope that they end it. It'll be so good if they end it. And during the debate he continued to sharply criticize the ACA, which 10 years after it was implemented is more popular and has proven to be a political plus for Democrats.\n\nWhat we'd like to do is terminate it, the president said, also noting that he terminated the individual mandate that required people to enroll in coverage plans or pay a fine.\n\nThe president maintained Biden's plan amounted to socialized medicine that would threaten Medicare, the popular government health coverage for seniors. He equated Biden's plan with that of other Democrats who during the primary pushed for a more sweeping Medicare for All program.\n\nBut Biden disavowed those proposals, saying, I beat all those other people because I disagreed with them on health care.\n\n4. Trump attacked Biden as a typical politician, engaged in corruption\n\nTrump won in 2016 in part by arguing he wasn't a politician, that he was a businessman who was going to Washington to drain the swamp. He has been trying in the past couple of weeks to reprise that strategy, and to paint Biden as a corrupt Washington figure who has a 47-year career in government without much to show for it. Even though reelection races for incumbents are usually referendums on their first terms, Trump has talked less about his own record and more about Biden's.\n\nGoing into the debate, the Trump campaign signaled the president would home in on Biden's son Hunter's work with overseas businesses, arguing it led to the former vice president personally enriching himself. The president pointed to reports in the New York Post about alleged emails from Hunter that described efforts to create a business venture in China that included money for his father and his uncle.\n\nBut the authenticity of the material cited in the news reports has not been verified — it was given to the Post by Trump's attorney and ally, Rudy Giuliani. And Biden's campaign denies the allegations. One of the Trump campaign's guests at the debate was a man who claims to be a former business associate of Hunter Biden who said he had direct knowledge that Joe Biden was involved in his son's business dealings and was planning to meet with Senate GOP investigators about the matter.\n\nBiden was ready for the attack. I have not taken a penny from any foreign source ever in my life, he said. He argued that Trump's focus on the Biden family was intended to distract from the problems facing voters' families.\n\nThe president waved off Biden's answers as changing the subject like other typical politicians, saying, I'm not a typical politician. That's why I got elected.\n\nThe president made multiple references to Biden receiving millions from foreign governments, but didn't provide any evidence to support his claims. Biden pointed out that many of Trump's allegations about the Biden family were proven false during the impeachment probe.\n\nWith less than two weeks before Election Day, Trump's effort to change the focus of the campaign may not connect and could have been confusing to voters because his charges were less than clear. Also many voters are focused on the economy and health care, not on unsupported allegations of corruption.\n\nBiden did use the exchange to bring up a New York Times report that revealed Trump himself had a Chinese bank account, which raised questions about Trump's own tax payments to China and refusal to release his U.S. tax returns. The president said he believed he closed the China account and claimed again he will release his returns once an IRS audit is completed. The IRS is on record that the audit does not prevent Trump from releasing his returns now.\n\n5. The debate may not matter\n\nMore than 40 million people have already voted, and recent polls show a very small sliver of the electorate is persuadable this close to the election. Even Biden appeared bored, and near the end of the debate checked his watch.\n\nBoth campaigns chiefly wanted to avoid any major mistakes in the last debate, and both candidates delivered. Now their focus in the final stretch will be to get out supporters and see how states process an unprecedented number of ballots from those voting early or by mail to avoid lengthy lines during a continuing national health crisis.

Trump Backs Off Obamacare Replacement After Top GOP Leader Nixes The Idea\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Evan Vucci/AP Evan Vucci/AP\n\nPresident Trump, bowing to political reality, says he is putting off his thoughts of finding a replacement for the Affordable Care Act until after the 2020 election.\n\nIn remarks to reporters Tuesday, Trump said, I wanted to put it after the election because we don't have the House. But it became clear that he didn't have support for a replacement to Obamacare in the GOP-led Senate, either.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said he made it clear to [Trump] that we were not going to be doing that in the Senate. Asked whether there were differences between him and Trump on the issue, McConnell replied succinctly, Not any longer.\n\nMcConnell recounted that he had a good conversation with the president on Monday and pointed out the Senate Republicans' view that working on comprehensive health care legislation with a Democratic House was not something his party planned to do.\n\nTrump surprised Republicans last week when he said he was going to make the GOP the party of health care and would revisit the issue that has frustrated Republicans and helped deliver the House to Democrats in the 2018 midterm election.\n\nEven with GOP control of both chambers of Congress prior to that, Republicans were unable to agree on a plan to replace the ACA — something McConnell noted on Tuesday.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said Trump's reversal means he will hold Americans hostage through 2020 on an issue that affects millions of people. Schumer said Trump insists he has a magic plan that we can see if only the American people re-elect him.\n\nThe administration continues to push for a court ruling that would invalidate the entire ACA, and it's unclear what would happen if the courts were to rule in the president's favor. Democrats have introduced a nonbinding resolution in the House that would tell the administration to drop its challenge to the law.
Sen. Bill Cassidy On His State's Racial Disparites In Coronavirus Deaths\n\nNPR's David Greene talks to GOP Sen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, a state with an already staggering number of COVID-19 cases, about how hospitals and residents there are preparing for grim days ahead.\n\nDAVID GREENE, HOST:\n\nAll right, I want to bring in Louisiana's Republican Senator Bill Cassidy, a member of the U.S. Senate, also a medical doctor. Senator, thank you for taking the time for us this morning.\n\nBILL CASSIDY: Thank you, David.\n\nGREENE: Can you tell me what is being done to help the black community in your state right now, which, you know, it clearly is being disproportionately hit by this disease?\n\nCASSIDY: Well, I think it's, first - clearly, there's been a surge of ventilators, of medical equipment to all folks, particularly in southeast Louisiana because that's where we had the peak first. I worked in the Charity Hospital system for 25 years as a physician, and 80% of my patients were African American. That was just the demographic makeup. And so some things in your report, I'm not quite sure people of whatever race are less likely - at least of African American race are less likely to go to the hospital. Again, that was my practice, and I did not see that.\n\nBut if you're going to look at the fundamental reason, African Americans are 60% more likely to have diabetes. The virus likes to hit what is called an ACE receptor. Now, if you have diabetes, obesity, hypertension, then African Americans are going to have more of those receptors inherent in their having the diabetes, the hypertension, the obesity.\n\nSo there's a physiologic reason which is explaining this. Now, as a physician, I would say we need to address the obesity epidemic, which disproportionately affects African Americans. That would lower the prevalence of diabetes, of hypertension. And that's what would bring benefit.\n\nGREENE: Well, I mean, as we heard in that report, I mean, some underlying health conditions and disparities are part of the issue here. But I mean, we heard Congressman Cedric Richmond say, as well, that this is rooted in years of systemic racism. Aren't there other forces at work here?\n\nCASSIDY: Well, you know, that's rhetoric, and it may be. But as a physician, I'm looking at science. And the science...\n\nGREENE: You're saying that's just rhetoric? I mean, there are more uninsured African Americans compared to other populations in your state. Doesn't that play a role in people...\n\nCASSIDY: You know, they said minorities. African - we've done the Medicaid expansion. Now, intuitively, it might be. But again - I don't want to seem insensitive at all. Again, I'm a physician. This was my practice. But as a physician, I approach it more - OK, what is the physiology? And the physiology is that if you have an ACE inhibitor - excuse me, an ACE receptor, that's where the virus hits.\n\nGREENE: But, obviously, I mean, you are a doctor, as you said. But I mean, obviously, you're also a member of the U.S. Senate. And if there are other issues at play here, isn't it also your role to address them? I mean, I think about the concern that came up that...\n\nCASSIDY: Absolutely. But - absolutely. So - but I think it's important to be analytical because we're not going to come to a solution if we just say, oh, this must be the case. The issue at hand is, how do we decrease death rates from COVID-19? And that is by, among other things, addressing the underlying factors. And those are diabetes, hypertension and obesity, no matter your race. And if we do that, all will benefit.\n\nGREENE: Well, Senator, let me ask you. I mean, the situation at hand, there are some other members of Congress, some Democrats, who have said that one option here might be for the White House and the Trump administration to reopen enrollment for the Affordable Care Act, for Obamacare - and for the president to encourage people and say, that is an option if you are suffering from COVID and need to feel the confidence of being insured to get to a hospital. Is that something you would consider?\n\nCASSIDY: So I certainly would consider it, but the White House has specifically said that if anybody has a hospital bill related to COVID, the federal government will pay 100% of it. I have mixed feelings about that because now you're better off being uninsured because you have no deductible and co-pay because 100% of your expense is going to be covered by the federal government. But if they want to open up the exchanges, I would not object. But the president...\n\nGREENE: You would not object. You would support that and tell the president that that's an idea that might help people in your state.\n\nCASSIDY: It would. But on the other hand, it does seem as if there's been an alternative pathway which otherwise addresses the issue.\n\nGREENE: Can I just ask you to step back? I mean, you've been, obviously, a very central player in your party when it comes to questions about the future of health care in our country. As you look at a moment like this and see African Americans dying at an alarming rate and you think about, you know, as a doctor, as you said - thinking about what conditions can be addressed, but when you think about policies, you know, you've been criticized before by the NAACP for policies that, in their view, don't support minority communities.\n\nIs this a moment where you're willing to step back and say, let's rethink everything and think about whether we as a country are addressing the racial disparities when it comes to health care?\n\nCASSIDY: So my whole practice for 25 years was attempting to address racial disparities. And my practice, if you will, as a member of Congress has been to address those racial disparities. If you actually look at my policies, they would have actually brought equity to those people who are less well-off because, again, if you separate poverty out of the separate issue, then a lot of the racial - not all, but a lot of the racial disparities go away because poor people have less - have poorer health than those who are well-off. And that's what we must address.\n\nGREENE: All right, so much to talk about here. Senator Bill Cassidy, a Republican of Louisiana - Louisiana, one of the states that is being hit particularly hard right now with this coronavirus outbreak. Senator, we're thinking about all the citizens of your state. And thank you so much for the time this morning.\n\nCASSIDY: Thank you, David.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)\n\nCopyright © 2020 NPR.

Supreme Court Undercuts Access To Birth Control Under Obamacare\n\nEnlarge this image J. Scott Applewhite/AP J. Scott Applewhite/AP\n\nUpdated at 12:32 p.m. ET\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court has made it more difficult for women to get access to birth control as part of their health plans if their employer has religious or moral objections to contraceptives.\n\nThe opinion upheld a Trump administration rule that significantly cut back on the Affordable Care Act requirement that insurers provide free birth control coverage as part of almost all health care plans.\n\nWe hold that the [Trump administration] had the authority to provide exemptions from the regulatory contraceptive requirements for employers with religious and conscientious objections, Justice Clarence Thomas wrote for the majority.\n\nHe was joined by Chief Justice John Roberts, and Justices Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch and Brett M. Kavanaugh.\n\nThe case now goes back to a lower court, which the Supreme Court ordered to lift an injunction that had prevented the implementation of the exception.\n\nJustices Elena Kagan and Stephen Breyer, two of the court's four liberals, did not join the majority opinion, but said they agreed with the conservatives to send the case back to the lower court.\n\nUnder the ACA, churches and synagogues were automatically exempted from the birth control insurance mandate. Not automatically exempt, however, were nonprofits like religiously affiliated universities, charities and hospitals, which employ millions of people who want their health insurance plans to cover birth control for themselves and their family members.\n\nFor these nonprofits, the Obama administration enacted an opt-out provision for employers with religious objections. They were required to notify the government or their insurance company, or their plan administrator so that the insurance company could provide free birth control options to individual employees but separate from the employer's plan.\n\nThat did not satisfy some religious objectors, however. They contended that signing an opt-out form or notifying their plan administrator was the same as authorizing the use of their plan for birth control.\n\nThe Supreme Court previously punted on the issue. And when President Trump came into office, his administration issued new rules that would give broad exemptions from the birth control mandate to nonprofits and some for-profit companies that object to birth control on religious or moral grounds.\n\nNow the Supreme Court has upheld the Trump administration's rules, declaring that they are a reasonable accommodation between church and state.\n\nDissenting from the opinion were Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Sonia Sotomayor.\n\nToday, for the first time, the Court casts totally aside countervailing rights and interests in its zeal to secure religious rights to the nth degree, Ginsburg wrote.
Trump, GOP Lawmakers Back Off From Immediate Obamacare Repeal\n\ntoggle caption Carolyn Kaster/AP\n\nThere's a moment in the Broadway musical Hamilton where George Washington says to an exasperated Alexander Hamilton: Winning is easy, young man. Governing's harder.\n\nWhen it comes to health care, it seems that President Trump is learning that same lesson. Trump and Republicans in Congress are struggling with how to keep their double-edged campaign promise — to repeal Obamacare without leaving millions of people without health insurance.\n\nDuring the campaign, Trump promised to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act immediately upon taking office. Last month, in an interview with The Washington Post, he said he had a replacement law very much formulated down to the final strokes.\n\nBut on Sunday, he dialed back those expectations in an interview with Fox News.\n\nIt's in the process and maybe it will take till sometime into next year, but we are certainly going to be in the process. It's very complicated, Trump said.\n\nHe repeated his claim that Obamacare has been a disaster and said his replacement would be a wonderful plan that would take time statutorily to put in place. And then he hedged the timing again.\n\nI would like to say by the end of the year, at least the rudiments, he said.\n\nTrump's recent hesitation comes as Republicans in Congress tame their rhetoric surrounding the health care law.\n\nSen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., chairman of the Senate health committee, said he'd like to see lawmakers make fixes to the current individual market before repealing parts of the law.\n\nWe can repair the individual market, which is a good place to start, Alexander said on Feb. 1.\n\nHe has also urged his colleagues to leave the other parts of the health care sector — Medicare, Medicaid and the employer market — alone.\n\nThroughout the campaign, and over the six years since the law passed, Republicans in Congress have vowed to completely repeal the Affordable Care Act.\n\nBut in the time since the law went into effect, it has helped as many as 20 million people get insurance who didn't have it before, according to the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nJust last week, the open enrollment period for 2017 ended and HHS reported that 9.2 million people bought insurance through the federal government's insurance marketplace — slightly lower than last year but still a large number. About 3 million more people likely bought coverage on state-run exchanges, based on enrollment in past years.\n\nIn addition, about 10 million people qualified for health coverage because of the expansion of Medicaid in most states.\n\nThat left Trump and Republicans, the day after the election, facing the choice of fulfilling their clear promise to repeal the ACA and the reality that doing so could leave millions of people without access to health care.\n\nAt that time the public seemed to gain a new appreciation of the law once it was actually threatened with repeal. In recent weeks, several polls have shown that more people view it more favorably than they did before the election.\n\nAnother reality Republicans have had to face is that, even though they control both houses of Congress and the White House, their ability to repeal the ACA is limited. That's because Democrats in the Senate can block bills using their filibuster power.\n\nBut laws dealing with taxes and the budget are protected from filibuster, so Republicans can roll back many Obamacare provisions because they involve tax credits and federal spending.\n\nThat leaves lawmakers having to build a new health care system that works within the general framework of the Affordable Care Act. They can get rid of subsidies to help people buy insurance, but the law creating government-run insurance exchanges, for example, will still be on the books.\n\nThat's why Alexander and a handful of other Republicans are beginning to talk about repairing the current system. Currently, not enough young healthy people have signed up for coverage to offset the costs to insure sicker, older people. The result is that premiums have risen and insurance companies that lost money pulled out of many markets.\n\nBut not everyone is on board. House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., said last week in an interview on Fox that repairing the health care system means You must repeal and replace Obamacare.
Trump Says Republicans Will Lose In 2018 If They Don't Support GOP Health Care Bill\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption J. Scott Applewhite/AP J. Scott Applewhite/AP\n\nPresident Trump made the trip up Pennsylvania Avenue to close the deal with members of his own party on a bill that, on the face of it, does what Republicans have been promising to do for years: Repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare.\n\nHe came with a tough love message for members of his own party.\n\nLooks like you'd be ripe for a primary if you don't keep your promise, the president told the group of lawmakers in a closed-door meeting, according to Rep. Blake Farenthold. He did say that, the Texas Republican adds.\n\nFarenthold thinks Trump moved a handful of votes in what has become a narrow path to passage for a bill with Democratic and conservative critics.\n\nMany of the people that were elected in that room were elected because of Obamacare, and so he was just being realistic, said Rep. Peter King, R-N.Y., explaining President Trump's pitch.\n\nIn short, when Republicans didn't hold the White House, Congress voted dozens of times to repeal the Affordable Care Act, and now you can't get it done. It will really make us look bad in the eyes of the public, and this unity we have now — House, Senate and the presidency — it could go down. We could lose in 2018, King said, paraphrasing the president.\n\nTrump reiterated that the American people gave us serious instructions during a fundraiser for the National Republican Congressional Committee on Tuesday evening.\n\nKing, who still counts himself among the undecided, was singled out by the president in the closed-door meeting. It was friendly, he says, and possibly persuasive. After he told everybody that he and I grew up near each other, it will be hard for me to vote no. They are both from Queens, N.Y. — Trump grew up in Jamaica Estates. King grew up in Sunnyside.\n\nHe was basically saying this is bad for the whole Republican agenda. If we don't make it on this one, which we spoke about so much, then it hurts us on everything going forward, said King.\n\nMost significantly, tax reform could be in jeopardy, something that congressional Republicans and the president have made clear they want to get to.\n\nTrump also called out Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., the chairman of the far-right House Freedom Caucus. According to people in the room, Trump said, Mark Meadows. I'm coming after you.\n\nMeadows did not take it as a threat. And he thinks if anyone can bring this home and close out this deal, it's the president. But at the moment, Meadows remains a no vote, and while he refused to get into numbers, Meadows claimed there are enough people who agree with him to bring the bill down. The president, he said, is aware of a vote count issue, and he believes Trump remains open to negotiating changes that could move people like Meadows to vote for the bill.\n\nAt the White House daily press briefing on Tuesday afternoon, press secretary Sean Spicer said that Trump continues to meet with members and walk away with a very, very optimistic view of where the bill is headed. Spicer also said he didn't want to rule anything out with regard to further changes to the bill.\n\nA Congressional Budget Office analysis found 14 million fewer people would have health coverage almost immediately if the GOP bill is passed, with that number rising to 24 million fewer people insured by 2026. It also found that insurance premiums would initially rise before falling by 10 percent in later years.\n\nIt's the premiums that are giving Meadows pause, while for more moderate Republicans the concern is millions of people who would be without health care or would see their out of pocket costs increase drastically as less generous tax credits replace Obamacare subsidies under the GOP bill.\n\nTrump and House leaders are setting this up as a binary choice for Republicans: Do you want to keep Obamacare and break your pledge to your voters to repeal it? Or do you want to vote for this bill, which they admit isn't perfect, but which they promise will get better as the legislative process moves along, and which GOP leaders insist is far better than the Affordable Care Act.\n\nPresident Trump was here to do what he does best, and that is to close the deal, said House Speaker Paul Ryan at a press conference after the meeting. He is all in and we are all in to end this Obamacare nightmare.\n\nBut a question remains. All in for what?\n\nAs Trump left the meeting, he predicted, We're going to have a real winner. But then he added, There are going to be adjustments made, but I think we'll get the vote on Thursday.\n\nAlready House leaders have introduced a series of amendments to the bill aimed at bringing on board reluctant Republicans. The amendments, announced last night, cut taxes on the wealthy that were put in place by the Affordable Care Act a year sooner, give states the option of imposing work requirements on able-bodied Medicaid recipients, and offer more generous reimbursement for elderly and disabled people on Medicaid (while still freezing and rolling back the expansion of Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act).\n\nIt's unclear whether Trump is negotiating for additional changes now, as he looks to close the deal with House conservatives before Thursday's vote, or whether any changes would come in the Senate, which would take up the House bill once it passes, if it passes.\n\nThis is our chance and this is our moment, said Ryan. It's a big moment. And I think our members are beginning to appreciate just what kind of a rendezvous with destiny we have right here.
Rep. Meadows Will Soon Be The Official White House Chief Of Staff\n\nCongressman Mark Meadows of North Carolina has long had President Trump's ear. Now he's transitioning to White House chief of staff in the midst of a spiraling crisis brought on by the coronavirus.\n\nSTEVE INSKEEP, HOST:\n\nThe White House employs about 4,000 people. It is fair to say they've been busy. Those staffers are traditionally led by the chief of staff, who is also a chief gatekeeper to the president. At a time of turmoil in this country, the chief of staff position is in transition. NPR White House correspondent Tamara Keith has this profile of the incoming chief.\n\nTAMARA KEITH, BYLINE: Nearly three weeks after President Trump announced via tweet that his acting chief of staff would be replaced by North Carolina Congressman Mark Meadows, Meadows still hasn't technically started.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nMARK MEADOWS: I'm still a member of Congress.\n\nKEITH: That was Meadows yesterday walking out of a meeting where senators and Trump administration officials had been negotiating the big financial rescue bill. Lisa Desjardins from the PBS NewsHour asked him about his status.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nLISA DESJARDINS: Are you interim chief of staff now at the White House?\n\nMEADOWS: Well, I'm still a member of Congress. Mick Mulvaney is still the acting chief officially.\n\nDESJARDINS: How do you qualify what you're doing at the White House?\n\nMEADOWS: I'm a member of Congress.\n\nKEITH: An aide says Meadows plans to resign from Congress around the end of the month and is transitioning into the chief of staff job. He's been at the White House in and out of meetings. It's not clear yet how Meadows intends to run the White House, a notoriously difficult job even without a national crisis. But those who know him say he may be better positioned to succeed than Trump's first three chiefs of staff.\n\nJAY SEKULOW: Mark has a really good grasp of who the president is, how the president operates.\n\nKEITH: Jay Sekulow, one of President Trump's attorneys, worked with Meadows on impeachment. Long before being named chief of staff, Meadows talked to the president all the time. Sekulow says Trump trusts him.\n\nSEKULOW: I feel that he will avoid any kind of problem areas. And he will not interfere with the president's operating style, which is important.\n\nKEITH: Trump and Meadows got off to a rocky start. Just a couple of months into Trump's presidency, Meadows and the rabble-rousing House Freedom Caucus he led delivered Trump an early defeat.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nHALLIE JACKSON: Tonight, the Republican plan to kill Obamacare - flatlining.\n\nKEITH: Meadows was vocal about his opposition to the president's first try at repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nMEADOWS: I am still a no at this time. I'm desperately trying to get to yes. And I think the president knows that, and I told him that personally.\n\nKEITH: For Meadows, clashing with his party's leaders was familiar territory by that point. In 2015, he used an obscure procedure to try to oust House Speaker John Boehner. House GOP Whip Steve Scalise, who was part of Boehner's leadership team at the time, now has nothing but praise for Meadows.\n\nSTEVE SCALISE: You know, Mark's been in these positions where he'll call the president with a recommendation or an idea and the president sometimes might take it and sometimes might not. But then they're able to move forward after that.\n\nKEITH: Several people mentioned that Meadows has relationships with members of Congress on both sides of the aisle, something his predecessors lacked. California Democrat Ro Khanna worked with Meadows on a war powers resolution that Trump ultimately vetoed.\n\nRO KHANNA: My hope is, you know, Mark Meadows is not going to be a yes man. He is someone who will have the ability to share a candid perspective with the president. I know he has.\n\nKEITH: But another Democratic congressman who's worked well with Meadows, Gerry Connolly from Virginia, isn't sure the dynamic will be the same when Meadows is an aide rather than an outside confidant and cable TV defender of Trump.\n\nGERRY CONNOLLY: How do you now undertake this new role that requires very different skills and a very different role if you do your job? The country kind of depends on it. And that's an open question.\n\nKEITH: One that will be answered as the country faces the largest public health and economic crisis in generations.\n\nTamara Keith, NPR News.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF MAMMAL HANDS' BECOMING)\n\nCopyright © 2020 NPR.

News Brief: Wuhan Testing, Uninsured People, Swabs In Short Supply\n\nChina plans to test every resident in Wuhan for COVID-19. New study examines how many people have lost health insurance since the pandemic. And, swabs for coronavirus testing are in short supply.\n\nSTEVE INSKEEP, HOST:\n\nThe Chinese city of Wuhan gave the world a preview of the severity of the coronavirus.\n\nRACHEL MARTIN, HOST:\n\nIs it now giving a preview of what might happen once restrictions are lifted? As the city reopens, six new cases have alarmed authorities. And you might be thinking to yourself, but it's only six cases. But when there's no vaccine, it just takes a few to kick off another outbreak. Chinese authorities are taking a dramatic step in response.\n\nINSKEEP: NPR's Emily Feng is in Beijing to report on that next step. Hi there, Emily.\n\nEMILY FENG, BYLINE: Hey. Good morning.\n\nINSKEEP: First, how did the extra six people get sick?\n\nFENG: It all comes down to one 89-year-old man who says he did not leave his home because he's quite old. He had COVID-like symptoms on and off since mid-March. But because they would go away, he never got tested. When he finally did last week, it turns out he had COVID. And he'd actually infected his wife and four neighbors, none of whom had symptoms. And so Wuhan's reaction has been to say they're testing all 11 million people who live in the city starting Tuesday.\n\nINSKEEP: Wow.\n\nFENG: They're supposed to do it within 10 days. But that actually exceeds the amount of testing capability they have. So they've said today that they'll stagger the amount of tests they do each day.\n\nINSKEEP: And it's a staggering number, 11 million people.\n\nFENG: Yeah.\n\nINSKEEP: What makes authorities that concerned?\n\nFENG: China can't afford to have another Wuhan. The way the political and health systems there broke down for a few weeks in early February were catastrophic to the image of China's ruling Communist Party. And so authorities now have swung the opposite direction. They're very willing to impose strict lockdowns over just a handful of cases because they want to avoid any accusation that they were slow to react or even covered up new outbreaks. And they've seen a number of small, localized clusters. Last month, there were about 500 new cases where Chinese travelers were coming back from Russia. China reacted by closing down more than 4,000 kilometers of land border with Russia and putting a total lockdown on one of the border towns. And just today, a major city in China's northwest has basically sealed itself off because it saw six new cases. Here's the mayor of that city - it's called Jilin - today describing the situation.\n\nGAI DONGPING: (Non-English language spoken).\n\nFENG: She's saying, the current COVID-19 situation is quite complex and severe. There's a huge risk of further spread of the virus. And they're not going to take any chances. To leave that city now, you've got to show you have a negative COVID test that you took no more than two days ago.\n\nINSKEEP: There do seem to be lessons here for the United States as American states and different businesses begin to reopen.\n\nFENG: There is. First is the difficulty of catching these asymptomatic cases, people who exhibit no symptoms whatsoever. Five of the six new cases in Wuhan reported this week were very difficult to detect because they'd had no symptoms whatsoever. The other is, even with extensive testing, as they are doing in China, it can be difficult to reach the right people. This was an elderly man who was in his home. And so local officials did not test him despite the fact that he felt sick for the last two months.\n\nAnd even when lockdowns are lifted, there are still going to be people coming in and out of borders, traveling. And so I would not expect to see international travel to return to normal anytime soon. What China has done is implement extensive testing and digital contact tracing. And the hope is they can catch new outbreaks quickly.\n\nINSKEEP: Emily, thanks for the update.\n\nFENG: Thanks, Steve.\n\nINSKEEP: That's NPR's Emily Feng.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)\n\nINSKEEP: All right. We know that millions of Americans have lost work during the pandemic. How many people have lost their health insurance?\n\nMARTIN: A new analysis from the Kaiser Family Foundation puts the number at nearly 27 million. That's in part because so many people get their insurance through their employers. The 27 million figure isn't far behind the number of people who are newly unemployed.\n\nINSKEEP: NPR health policy reporter Selena Simmons-Duffin joins us now. Good morning.\n\nSELENA SIMMONS-DUFFIN, BYLINE: Good morning, Steve.\n\nINSKEEP: OK. Another awful number, 27 million. Although, I should ask, does this mean that 27 million people will all join the ranks of the uninsured?\n\nSIMMONS-DUFFIN: So probably not. In fact, the report found that most people are eligible to get health insurance somewhere else, mostly by enrolling in Medicaid, which is essentially free for people who are eligible, or a plan on the Obamacare insurance exchanges with a tax subsidy to make the premiums more affordable. So the report authors estimate about 6 million people do not have those options and are likely to join the ranks of the uninsured. But even though a lot of people could get coverage, a big question mark here is how many actually will. Health insurance is complicated. Signing up is hard. Here is what one of the authors of the report, Larry Levitt, told me.\n\nLARRY LEVITT: There's a lot of stressors on people right now. You may be unemployed. You might be sick. You might be quarantining. And, you know, there's just a limit to how many life things you can deal with at once.\n\nSIMMONS-DUFFIN: Even though it's overwhelming, there is a time crunch here. If you lost coverage, that's what's called a qualifying life event. So you can go to healthcare.gov if your state uses that for its insurance exchange and show you've lost coverage and enroll in a new plan. But that all needs to happen within 60 days of losing coverage. So for people who lost coverage at the beginning of when all of this started in early March, the clock is ticking for them.\n\nINSKEEP: OK. First, thanks for telling us the clock is ticking and what some of the options are. Is the U.S. government actively telling people the clock is ticking and what they can do?\n\nSIMMONS-DUFFIN: So not really. Of course, the Affordable Care Act, which set up these exchanges, is President Obama's trademark law. And President Trump has made getting rid of Obamacare a major priority during his first campaign and as president. So now, the Trump administration is arguing before the Supreme Court that the law should be struck down. Funding for navigators who can help people sign up and advertising for these insurance exchanges has been dramatically cut.\n\nAnd the White House decided not to pull a big lever it could use to get more of these millions of newly uninsured people into the ACA exchanges by creating a federal special enrollment period so that, no matter where you live, you don't need a qualifying event. You can just sign up. The decision not to do that could really impact how many people access this coverage and how many people become uninsured longer-term.\n\nINSKEEP: If the government isn't helping there, is the government doing anything?\n\nSIMMONS-DUFFIN: Yeah. The federal government says it plans to pay hospitals directly for the care of uninsured people with COVID-19. But Larry Levitt of the Kaiser Family Foundation points out, that's only for the treatment of COVID-19. Here's what he said.\n\nLEVITT: While COVID-19 is a very present risk right now in a lot of people's minds, you know, people have health care needs that go beyond the coronavirus.\n\nSIMMONS-DUFFIN: If you end up with cancer, for instance, or a burst appendix and you are uninsured, that can be financially ruinous. And that's why health policy experts are always urging people to enroll in health insurance if at all possible. And that's all the more true during a pandemic like this.\n\nINSKEEP: Oh, my goodness. And even more important now when people are putting off a lot of doctor's visits and hospital visits, suggesting that when they finally do get medical care, their problems could be more serious and more expensive. Selena, thanks.\n\nSIMMONS-DUFFIN: Yeah, that's true. Thank you.\n\nINSKEEP: NPR's Selena Simmons-Duffin.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)\n\nINSKEEP: All right. What will it take to reopen this country's economy? Yesterday, the chairman of a Senate committee hearing made it clear what he thinks.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nLAMAR ALEXANDER: All roads back to work and school go through testing.\n\nMARTIN: But coronavirus testing depends on medical supplies like swabs. And there aren't enough of them. This week, the White House said it would get more supplies to states in order to expand testing. So how could there be a shortage of something that sounds so basic like a swab?\n\nINSKEEP: Yeah. NPR's Sacha Pfeiffer has been looking into that and is on the line. Good morning.\n\nSACHA PFEIFFER, BYLINE: Good morning, Steve.\n\nINSKEEP: It's a little stick with a little bit of soft material on the end. How could we end up, in America, with a shortage of that?\n\nPFEIFFER: I know. That's the question, isn't it? Well, these are actually considered medical devices. They have to be long and flexible enough to go through your nose to the back of your throat. They also have to be made with a synthetic material like polyester because cotton, which has its own genetic material, could interfere with test results. And turns out, before the pandemic, there were only two major manufacturers of these - one in Maine, one in Italy. When COVID-19 hit, they got overwhelmed. Here's Timothy Templet, a spokesman for the company in Maine called Puritan Medical Supplies (ph).\n\nTIMOTHY TEMPLET: I don't think the United States was prepared. That includes us, Puritan. And it includes our customers. And it includes the government. And now it gets really nerve-racking to think that we may be in this for another couple of years.\n\nINSKEEP: Which, I guess, we could be. They're talking about wanting to do 40 or 50 million tests a month by the fall. Could the government have done something sooner to prepare?\n\nPFEIFFER: It could have been stockpiling them, but it was not. Swabs are not part of the Strategic National Stockpile of medical supplies. The government does have the Defense Production Act, which the Trump administration used to require General Motors to produce more ventilators. That happened in March. But the administration did not act as quickly to use that tool for swap shortages. That's even though people like Washington Governor Jay Inslee were advising that. He told NPR that he urged President Trump more than a month ago to invoke the Defense Production Act for that purpose.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)\n\nJAY INSLEE: To convert some of their production to swabs and contact vials and machines that can do analysis. And he did not agree with that assessment. And we lost weeks, frankly.\n\nINSKEEP: Did the president or other people around the president receive warnings even earlier than that discussion in March?\n\nPFEIFFER: We know that in mid-February, a group of health experts told a U.S. Senate committee that the country had a testing supply problem. More than a month later, former FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb put out a tweet that said, swabs could be a weak link in broadening testing. And in mid-March, there were other public distress calls about supply shortages.\n\nINSKEEP: Although, of course, the president has been saying, in recent days, we've met the moment. We have triumphed. How has the government responded over the last couple of months to those warnings?\n\nPFEIFFER: In mid-March, the government did start flying shipments of swabs from Italy to the U.S. But that still did not meet demand. And in mid-April, complaints were still coming. So President Trump said he would use the Defense Production Act to ramp up swab production. On April 29, the government said Puritan in Maine would get $75 million to do that. And this week, the White House promised to get supplies to help states meet testing goals. Although, the government said it wants to focus on high-risk communities like nursing homes.\n\nINSKEEP: Are the efforts now in place enough to meet demand?\n\nPFEIFFER: Hard to say because it's difficult to get consensus on how much coronavirus testing should be happening and how many swabs are needed. But the FDA has approved more types of swabs. And a Ohio company is converting a plant to make swabs. The FDA has also approved a saliva test that does not require a swab. This week's promise by the administration may still be fairly limited. And so it's unclear if it will be enough to give the public confidence that the U.S. economy can reopen safely.\n\nINSKEEP: NPR's Sacha Pfeiffer. Thanks so much.\n\nPFEIFFER: You're welcome.\n\nCopyright © 2020 NPR. All rights reserved.

Reality Check On Trump Calling For Bipartisanship On Health Care\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Andrew Harnik/AP Andrew Harnik/AP\n\nThe fallout from Friday's Republican health care bill collapse is still trying to be understood.\n\nRight after the bill was pulled, President Trump teased that he wanted to work with Democrats and believed a bipartisan bill would be possible.\n\nBut it wasn't clear if that was just talk. On Tuesday night, he may have taken the first step to trying to reach across the aisle.\n\nI know that we're all going to make a deal on health care, that's such an easy one, Trump told a bipartisan group of senators gathered at the White House. I have no doubt that's going to happen very quickly.\n\nSpeed is relative. The Trump-Paul Ryan health care bill was fast-tracked and collapsed in 17 days. It took President Obama more than a year to pass the Affordable Care Act, with more members of his own party in the Senate than Republicans have now.\n\nWe have all been promising it — Democrat, Republican — to the public, Trump said Tuesday night.\n\nThat's the rub for Republicans. Health care has been one of the most hotly partisan issues of the past decade. It has been the issue that has animated Republican opposition to Obama. The prospect of repealing and replacing Obamacare has been so critical to Republican success, it is arguably responsible for hollowing out the Democratic Party.\n\nObama's focus on instituting the law gave the Tea Party a clear focus.\n\nWhat brought everything together was the Obamacare idea, which contains every odiferous objection, Mark Williams of Tea Party Express told CNN in August of 2009.\n\nIt was a staple of every Tea Party rally through that election cycle, so it is unlikely the GOP base shrugs its collective shoulders and moves on the way Trump promised to do Thursday and Friday — and wait for Obamacare to explode.\n\nWaiting for the law to fall apart puts Republicans in a terrible bind. Trump could get it left, right and center. If the Trump administration doesn't work as hard as it can to implement and administer the law, and you start seeing reporting from unnamed career officials verifying that, it very well could mean the Trump administration is blamed for harming real people's lives.\n\nThat would enrage not just Democrats, but independents and some Republicans.\n\nIf the Trump administration does administer the law the way the Obama administration did, the GOP base would likely be enraged, especially without a repeal-and-replace option. Is this what they voted for all these years?\n\nWe are going to be doing a great job, Trump added in his remarks to senators Tuesday night. Hopefully it will start being bipartisan, because everybody really wants the same thing. We want greatness for this country that we love.\n\nBut there is little muscle memory for anything bipartisan with this Congress. And there are challenges.\n\nDemocrats may be open to it, but Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said only if repeal is off the table. Would Republicans in Congress be OK with that? Maybe some, but it's unlikely — and could cost Ryan his job as speaker if he doesn't have the majority of his conference and winds up working with Democrats.\n\nPlus, congressional Republicans viewed Trump's election as their chance, finally, to enact sweeping changes with traditional Republican agenda items. They won't give that up easily.\n\nNPR's Susan Davis noted Tuesday that congressional Republicans are insisting they are closer now to passing health care than they were Friday and aren't giving up, reversing course on the tone Ryan took Friday that Obamacare is now the law of the land. But, as Davis put it:\n\nHouse Republicans' optimism that they could find a GOP-based solution to health care is undercut by comments this week by the White House and Senate Republicans who say any future health care legislation will likely require Democratic support — a tacit acknowledgement that repealing Obamacare is off the table.\n\nWill Trump really force their hand on repair? So far, there's no real evidence of that. His whole presidency to this point has been bold appeals to his base, not reaching across the aisle.\n\nWhat's more, would rank-and-file Republican voters be OK with it? They'd be skeptical, and it'd be up to Trump to make the sale — something he didn't do the first go-round with health care.\n\nBipartisanship is just an idea at this point. There is no discernible White House strategy for getting a bill through right now, and no evidence to suggest his team could shepherd it through.\n\nTrump took a first step Tuesday night. He acknowledged Schumer, whom he hasn't spoken with since shortly after the inauguration.\n\nI think we are going to have some very good relationships — right, Chuck? Trump said. I see Chuck. Hello, Chuck.\n\nBut, as the health care failure showed, legislating is a lot harder than talking.
The First 100 Days: What Clinton And Trump Want To Get Done\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Jewel Samad/AFP/Getty Images Jewel Samad/AFP/Getty Images\n\nImagine for a moment that it's Jan. 21, 2017. After a chilly inauguration the day before, the parades and festivities have ended. And the new president of the United States is ready for his or her first day of work.\n\nPolitics In Gettysburg, Trump Mixes Policy With Personal Attacks In Gettysburg, Trump Mixes Policy With Personal Attacks Listen · 1:58 1:58\n\nWhat follows is my 100-day action plan to make America great again, Donald Trump told supporters in Gettysburg, Pa., last weekend. First I will announce my intention to totally renegotiate NAFTA, one of the worst deals our country has ever made.\n\nTrump also promised to withdraw from a proposed Asia-Pacific trade deal that's been in the works. Both those moves would be well within the new president's authority.\n\nThe First 100 Days List Donald Trump On His Own Cancel Obama's executive orders on climate, energy, immigration, overtime, retirement savings Renegotiate trade deals like NAFTA, withdraw from TPP Deport criminal immigrants living in the country illegally Federal hiring freeze (except for military, public safety, public health) With Congress Multitrillion-dollar tax cut Authorization for border wall Repeal Obamacare (replace with Health Savings Accounts and interstate insurance marketing) Tariffs on companies that move offshore Expand the military Supreme Court picks in Scalia mold Amend Constitution to impose congressional term limits\n\nHillary Clinton On Her Own Appoint trade prosecutor to pursue anti-competitive trade actions With Congress Major investments in infrastructure, clean energy, manufacturing Comprehensive immigration reform Raise taxes on the wealthy Supreme Court picks with real life experience who support Roe v. Wade, marriage equality Amend Constitution to reverse Citizens United\n\nAs a general matter, if the president wants to withdraw from a treaty, he simply gets to do that, said Benjamin Wittes, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. That's part of the powers of the office.\n\nTrump would also have the power to deport more than 2 million criminals in the country illegally, halt immigration from parts of the world he calls terror prone, and quickly reverse many of the initiatives undertaken by President Obama.\n\nIf you're an administration that lives by the executive order, than you're going to die by the executive order, too, said Stephen Moore, an economic adviser to Trump. He expects Trump would act almost immediately to reverse the power plant rules at the heart of Obama's climate agenda, as well as Obama's orders governing immigration enforcement and overtime pay.\n\nYou could literally have a stack of executive orders on Donald Trump's desk in the Oval Office that he could sign literally in his first hours of being president, Moore said. And that would be in many cases, I think, an enormous lift to the economy.\n\nOther parts of Trump's agenda would require support from a friendly Republican Congress. Those include Trump's massive tax cut, the repeal of Obamacare, and that big new wall along the border with Mexico.\n\n\n\nDon't worry about it, Trump assured supporters. Mexico is paying for the wall. With the full understanding that Mexico will be reimbursing the United States for the full cost of such a wall.\n\nHillary Clinton, meanwhile, has her own road map for the first 100 days if she winds up in the White House.\n\nWe're not going to build a giant wall, Clinton said. We're going to build roads and bridges and tunnels and ports and airports and water systems and a new electric grid.\n\nClinton told supporters in Johnstown, Pa., over the summer she will also pursue immigration reform and big new investments in clean power.\n\nWithin the first hundred days of our administration, we are going to break the gridlock in Washington and make the biggest investment in good-paying jobs since World War II, Clinton said.\n\nMost of Clinton's plans would require congressional support. And that would test the former secretary of state's negotiating skills, since the House of Representatives at a minimum is expected to remain in Republican hands.\n\nShe was a fairly successful legislator, recalled former Rep. Tom Davis, R-Va. And her husband was just very good at working with a Republican Congress. She's got that in her background. But remember, the world has changed since that time.\n\nWashington, like the rest of the country, has grown more polarized. And either Clinton or Trump will face strong political headwinds from the very first day in office.\n\nRemember this, Davis said. The president, whoever it is, will come in with a high negative — probably close to 55 percent unfavorable view. That's not the traditional kind of mandate.\n\nEven if there's no traditional honeymoon, though, whoever sits in the Oval Office will still wield considerable power, starting with the nomination of a new Supreme Court justice.\n\nPolitics Clinton, Trump Make Closing Arguments With 2 Weeks Until Election Day Clinton, Trump Make Closing Arguments With 2 Weeks Until Election Day Listen · 4:14 4:14\n\nPresidents generally try to deliver on campaign promises — and in many cases they succeed. So like them or not, voters should take these pledges seriously.\n\nWhen somebody promises to do something, you have to think about whether that's something you'd be willing to see happen, said Wittes, the Brookings Institution scholar. Because the powers are simply too vast and too dangerous to say, 'Well, he was probably clowning around at that point or he doesn't know what he's saying.' 
Kentucky Midterm House Race: Voter Issues\n\nA Morning Edition team goes to Lexington, Ky., the heart of the state's 6th congressional district, to understand the issues important to voters, and to find out how they're leaning ahead of midterms.\n\nSTEVE INSKEEP, HOST:\n\nI'm Steve Inskeep before a live audience in Lexington, Ky. Tell America good morning, folks.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nINSKEEP: We are visiting a hotly contested congressional district. It's a district President Trump campaigns in this weekend while former Vice President Biden campaigns here today. We are meeting people in three corners of this district, three very different places where voters will help decide control of the House this fall. Elsewhere this morning we're on the first corner in desperately poor Wolfe County, Ky.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED PERSON: I can't get a vehicle because I have no job. And I can't get a job because I have no vehicle.\n\nINSKEEP: There just aren't many jobs within a mile or?\n\nUNIDENTIFIED PERSON: No, no. I could walk. If there was any jobs here, I would get up and skip to work.\n\nINSKEEP: Our second of three corners offers a very different view of the congressional district, the corner of Versailles Road and Old Clubhouse Lane. They say Versailles here, by the way, not Versailles. That is the entrance to Keeneland, the horse racing track in Lexington.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF CALL TO POST)\n\nINSKEEP: It is the time of Keeneland's Fall Meet. On a weekday afternoon, people wear suits and dresses and heels. And we stood with Ken (ph) and Resia Ayres (ph). She works for a foundation improving horse health, and he is a horse breeder. One of his mares gave birth to Small Town Hero, the horse that they saw pulling ahead in the day's second race.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED ANNOUNCER: Wow, it is wide open in the final furlong. Small Town Hero - $900.\n\nKEN AYRES: Come on baby. Come on baby.\n\nRESIA AYRES: Small town.\n\nK. AYRES: Here he comes.\n\nR. AYRES: Come on Small Town.\n\nK. AYRES: All right. He's going to win it.\n\nR. AYRES: Come on. Come on. Come on. Yahoo (laughter) That's great.\n\nK. AYRES: I didn't have a dime on him.\n\nINSKEEP: Whoa.\n\nR. AYRES: And he went off at like 30 to 1.\n\nINSKEEP: Maybe they missed the jackpot on that winning horse, but Ken and Resia Ayres, like many at Keeneland, have done well. Though many Kentuckians are poor, this state is rich - in farmland, in coal, in bourbon, in universities and in horses. The Ayres are pleased with the direction of the country right now.\n\nYou voted for President Trump?\n\nK. AYRES: I certainly did.\n\nINSKEEP: Did you also, ma'am?\n\nR. AYRES: Yes, I did.\n\nINSKEEP: OK.\n\nK. AYRES: He's standing up to all these countries around the world that have taken advantage of our goodwill, if you will.\n\nINSKEEP: The Ayres see a strong economy, and they are voting to keep Republican Congressman Andy Barr.\n\nK. AYRES: Well, I think the country has rectified itself. I think it's brought itself up from the bootstraps and we're going good again. The only thing I'm afraid of is a civil war.\n\nINSKEEP: Whoa. Whoa. Whoa, Civil War? The country's going great except for the fear of a civil war?\n\nR. AYRES: It seems like nobody can have an opinion anymore and disagree agreeably. Everyone is so entrenched in their own viewpoint that they don't - they can't even speak or say what they think because they're afraid somebody else is going to jump on them.\n\nINSKEEP: Remember in 2016, when many Americans thought the country was doing well and could not understand why Trump voters were so angry? In our talks in Kentucky this, week it's often been the Trump supporters baffled by the anger. Seven miles from Keeneland, we found some voters who are unhappy at the third of our three corners. We knocked on a door at the corner of Eastern Avenue and 3rd Street in Lexington.\n\nHi. How are you, ma'am?\n\nPHYLLIS EVANS: Wonderful, how are you?\n\nINSKEEP: And we talked on the porch of Phyllis Evans (ph). She lives in the East End, which is a district of wood-frame houses. It was a segregated black neighborhood of Lexington. We're near the Lyric Theatre, where Duke Ellington and Ray Charles once played.\n\nEVANS: This really used to be a really nice neighborhood. Like I said, I grew up in this area. And, you know,...\n\nINSKEEP: Fifty years ago, it would be really...\n\nEVANS: Oh, it was beautiful. Yeah. We had our own grocery store. We had our own pharmacy, schools, recreation, everything.\n\nINSKEEP: She bought a house with her husband, worked for the University of Kentucky and raised her kids. She also saw the neighborhood decline when the end of legal segregation let African-Americans leave.\n\nEVANS: You know, to be honest with you, the friends that I used to see and the people that I grew up, they're no longer here. And it's really sad because a lot of people I grew up, you know, like I said, I grew up with, and I don't see them anymore. They're not here.\n\nINSKEEP: Now, a new generation is moving in, many younger and white. A French bakery just opened across the street, brightly lit and smelling of espresso. Phyllis Evans says she has seen her Republican congressmen there, Andy Barr. But a sour look crosses her face when she mentions him because she links him with President Trump.\n\nEVANS: I'm sorry that he's our president. Now, you can say what you want about, you know, some of the other previous presidents but never anything like this. And what really got me was the separation of those children.\n\nINSKEEP: Oh, the migrant children crossing the border from their parents.\n\nEVANS: Absolutely. Absolutely. I think he's racist, I really do.\n\nINSKEEP: Is it important to have a Congress that would provide more of a check to President Trump?\n\nEVANS: Absolutely. He's power drunk. This election, to me, is to vote to put a check on him.\n\nINSKEEP: Phyllis Evans put up a blue yard sign for Democratic congressional candidate Amy McGrath. McGrath can expect many votes near this corner, though maybe not all votes, as we learned from other residents who put up their own sign. Theirs said, remember in November.\n\nONDINE QUINN: I'm Ondine.\n\nINSKEEP: Ondine, how do I spell that?\n\nQUIN: O-N-D-I-N-E.\n\nINSKEEP: O-N-D-I-N-E. What's your last name, Ondine?\n\nQUIN: Quinn.\n\nINSKEEP: OK. And how about you?\n\nDREW BOWLING: Drew, D-R-E-W. Bowling.\n\nINSKEEP: They're social workers, both progressive. Drew attended a town hall meeting for Congressman Barr and challenged his opposition to Obamacare. Yet Drew also attended a meeting to challenge Democrat Amy McGrath, asking if she was progressive enough.\n\nBOWLING: I was at one of her meet-and-greets. There was a room probably about 40, 50 people. They were all white, and so I raised my hand. And I said, I'm just going to acknowledge this. There is a lack of melanin in this room. What are you doing to reach out to communities of color, specifically black communities, to talk to them about the issues that are important to them?\n\nINSKEEP: Amy McGrath is a Marine veteran who flew combat missions in Iraq. That is a big part of the Democrats appeal in this conservative district, yet it is exactly what Drew and Ondine dislike.\n\nBOWLING: Fighter jet's her logo, right?\n\nINSKEEP: Sure, she's a veteran.\n\nBOWLING: On her signs, so she's pretty proud of it. All I can hear is like murderous imperialist when I see that. And I'm just like...\n\nQUIN: So we're pretty bitter and jaded, just to be totally honest.\n\nINSKEEP: Drew and Ondine know the kind of argument made by their neighbor, that Democratic control of the House is needed to put a check on President Trump.\n\nQUIN: It feels ugly and gross over and over again to have to compromise your personal values and ethics to vote for the lesser of two evils. I'm tired of people trying to guilt me into voting for crappy people using that argument. I'm tired of it. And I'm just not going to be bullied into doing that anymore.\n\nINSKEEP: Those are some of the voters we're meeting in three corners of this Kentucky congressional district, one of those that could decide control of the House. And Emily Beaulieu of the University of Kentucky is here with us. What do you hear in those voices, Emily?\n\nEMILY BEAULIEU: Steve, what I hear in these voices are themes that resonate, really, across the country, both in terms of the nature of support for Trump and the ways that Trump is reshaping people's understanding of democratic politics.\n\nINSKEEP: What do you mean?\n\nBEAULIEU: In terms of the nature of support, we see that it's not those who are most economically disadvantaged who favor Trump. In fact, it's folks who are doing comparatively well for whom the narrative that Trump presents resonates with their understanding.\n\nINSKEEP: They feel other people are taking advantage of the system.\n\nBEAULIEU: And so he represents their understanding of where we're at in America. And in terms of the reshaping of politics, you notice from both supporters and opponents alike just a sense of heightened incivility and impending conflict.\n\nINSKEEP: OK.

How Millennials Win And Lose Under The GOP Health Bill\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Kristin Gourlay/RINPR Kristin Gourlay/RINPR\n\nDesigning skateboards is just one of Luke Franco's gigs. He has just enough time before his next shift to chat at a café in downtown Providence, R.I.\n\nI work at the YMCA Monday through Friday with kindergartners through fifth graders. It's split shift; seven to nine, two to six daily, he says. With the rest of my day, I also work at a local pizza place. And in addition to that, I also own and operate a small skateboard company.\n\nBut none of his jobs offers health insurance. I ask him if he worries about that.\n\nYes, especially being an avid skateboarder, the 26-year-old says. That's constantly something in the back of my head now — before I try this trick, what happens if I get hurt?\n\nSo he's looking for a full time job with benefits. Until then? Franco hasn't really explored his options. He's a member of the millennial generation. They represent more than a quarter of the nation's population. These are people 18 to 34 years old, and we're hearing a lot about them in the health care debate. How they fare under the GOP health care bill going through Congress is complicated.\n\nFranco doesn't know whether he qualifies for Medicaid or a subsidy to buy coverage on the exchange set up under the Affordable Care Act, also called Obamacare.\n\nIf the Republican plan to repeal and replace the ACA goes forward, his options might be more limited than that.\n\nI'm assuming that paying full price for it [health care] would be completely unaffordable for me, he says.\n\nThe GOP plan would offer Franco a tax credit of $2,000 a year — that's the amount for which 26- to 29-year-olds would be eligible. The amount goes up to $2,500 for those ages 30 to 39. But even if Franco could buy a plan for a few hundred dollars a month, he wants to hold on to what little pocket money he has for dinner or drinks with friends.\n\nJen Mishory heads an organization called Young Invincibles, a tongue-in-cheek name for millennials who think they're too healthy to need health insurance. But the organization is serious about advocating for young people. Mishory says the ACA helped this generation.\n\nYou're starting pre-ACA with an uninsurance rate of about 29 percent for young people. We see that uninsurance rate drop, over the course of the last five, six years to about 16 percent, she says. That's thanks to many factors, the expansion of Medicaid, for one, and children being able to stay on their parents' insurance until age 26.\n\nBut coverage on the exchange is still expensive for some millennials. Even with subsidies, they didn't sign up for the ACA exchanges in the numbers insurers were hoping for.\n\nMishory points out the GOP proposal to roll back Medicaid expansion could hurt some young, single adults. The proposed tax credit might help others.\n\nFor some young people [the tax credit] may be more than what they received under the ACA, she says. But for a lot of the low-income young people, they could see reductions in that subsidy.\n\nWhat concerns Mishory most is the Republican provision that insurance companies could charge customers 30 percent more for a plan if their coverage lapses.\n\nYoung people are the most likely to see gaps in coverage, she says. That's because young adults move and change jobs a lot. They also tend to have lower incomes, so the penalty might discourage millennials, especially healthy ones, from enrolling in coverage again.\n\nMolly Tracy says she'll buy insurance, penalty or not. She's 25 and works at a charter school.\n\nShe worries the Republican model won't be affordable.\n\nI'm not rich! I work in public education. So even if I do have coverage, having a $3,000 medical bill ... that's going to pose a significant challenge for me, she says.\n\nRight now, Tracy is covered by her father's health insurance. But her 26th birthday is coming soon, she says, So I'm trying to get a tonsillectomy before my insurance lapses. That's one of the issues. The other issue is scheduling, having enough time to recover.\n\nWhen Tracy does get her own health insurance through work this fall, she wants to know what she will be getting. Will birth control remain affordable? Will mental health care be covered? A Congressional Budget Office analysis finds people like Tracy might end up paying much more out of pocket for those benefits than they would now.\n\nThis story is part of a partnership with NPR, Rhode Island Public Radio and Kaiser Health News.
