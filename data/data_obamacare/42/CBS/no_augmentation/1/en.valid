the second is plank is to empower individual ownership, in part by giving a tax deduction to those who buy their own insurance. the third is to focus federal regulation, partially by allowing people to purchase insurance across state lines.
they did not know if they would survive the hour. they did not know if they would grow old. but they knew that america had to prevail. their cause was this nation, and generations yet unborn.
i wouldn't do it if i didn't think i had a chance to win, bennet, the 22nd democrat to enter the race, told the colorado independent shortly after his diagnosis. i think, like everyone else does, it's a long shot. but i think everyone in the field is a long shot.

bloomberg also doubled down on his opposition to medicare for all and a wealth tax.
vice president joe biden acknowledged wednesday that the new obamacare marketplaces may not meet their original enrollment goals. still, biden -- who famously called the 2010 passage of the affordable care act a big f**king deal, said that the new marketplaces are nevertheless off to hell of a start.
trump claimed that in san bernardino last year many people saw the bombs all over the apartment.
scott raised $22 million in his first quarter as a candidate for senate, with $8 million of those funds coming from individual contributions, while nelson raised $4.4 million in the second quarter. scott is also extremely wealthy, and could potentially pour millions of his own funds into his campaign in the final stretch of the race.
pelosi is described by friends and foes alike as a master legislative strategist. the first woman elected speaker of the house in 2007, she was a fierce critic of then-president george w. bush, but pelosi rounded up democratic votes to help him pass an economic bailout package.

but gop senate majority leader scott fitzgerald acknowledged the political underpinnings at play. we trusted scott walker and the administration to be able to manage the back and forth with the legislature. we don't trust tony evers right now in a lot of these areas, he told a conservative radio host.
she said she has a positive and optimistic view of the country's direction.
when mccain cast the deciding vote against legislation graham introduced to overhaul the affordable care act in september 2017, wrecking republican chances of obamacare repeal, some questioned whether their friendship would weather the storm. president trump tweeted mccain had, let his best friend l.g. down! it would be the first of many verbal attacks mr. trump would make over mccain's vote in the months ahead.
the house bill, which narrowly passed in a 217-213 vote on may 4, would significantly reduce the funding for obamacare subsidies, revamp tax credits so that they're tied to a person's age, freeze the medicaid expansion in 2020 and allow states to seek waivers from a rule that requires states to offer essential benefits in their plans and a provision that prevents insurers from charging people with pre-existing conditions more money compared to healthy people. instead of obamacare's insurance mandate, the house republican bill would incentivize people to have continuous coverage. should coverage be interrupted for more than 63 days, insurers would be able to charge a 30 percent penalty over the original premium for one year.
democrats will also have the majority in the house next year. democratic leader nancy pelosi, the presumptive speaker of the house of the incoming congress, said that the house will move swiftly to formally intervene in the appeals process to uphold the life-saving protections for people with pre-existing conditions and reject republicans' effort to destroy the affordable care act. this resolution would allow the house general counsel to defend the health care law on the chamber's behalf.
liberal stars took trump to task about his bad hombres comment. sophia bush used it as an opportunity to urge fans to vote.
year after year, countless americans are murdered by criminal illegal aliens.
republicans need a simple majority to pass it, rather than a supermajority since they're using the budget reconciliation process. they may still have to rely on vice president mike pence to cast a tie-breaking vote. the senate currently has 52 republicans and 48 democrats. that means if all democrats vote against the bill, only three no votes from republicans can torpedo it. even if republicans are successful in getting it through the upper chamber, they would then still need to reconcile it with version passed by the house in early may, reach a bicameral agreement with house republicans, and hold votes in the house and senate on that version again.
it's going to get done this year. that is the emphasis, that is the focus, and that is what we have been working toward.
he's a very confused guy, biden said. he thinks he's running against somebody else. he's running against joe biden. i beat all those other people because i disagree with them.
preliminary reporting shows those predictions are accurate. in a study of 14 major metro areas by the kaiser family foundation, premiums for the second-lowest-cost silver medical plans (the plans that tax credits are based on) are expected to rise an average of 11 percent in 2017. in the cities kaiser studied, complete data was available on insurer premium change requests. it found the changes range from a decrease of 13 percent in providence, rhode island, to an increase of 18 percent in portland, oregon.
well, i had never heard the expression, 'get a life,' but then i did! she laughed.
it's unlikely that democratic sen. bob menendez is going to lose his re-election effort in new jersey in november, but it is not outside the realm of possibility. after a hung jury was unable to come to a verdict on federal corruption-related charges, the government dropped the case against menendez, but the specter of his alleged misdeeds overshadows his campaign.

still, the insurance isn't as comprehensive as one might imagine a federal judge or supreme court justice would get. unlike the so-called cadillac plans that top corporate executives often enjoy that fully cover a host of health care expenses, the federal plans have deductibles, premium costs, co-pays and other out-of-pocket expenses.
the senator refers to himself as a pragmatic idealist, looking to herald in a new era of progress for washington. he told dickerson that he has a tendency to tell the truth to his constituents in colorado and now wants the chance to do that with the american people.
polling has shown the race to be close, with scott leading nelson by 3 percentage points in a cbs news poll from july. florida is one of the states where a loss would be devastating for democrats, as it would widen the narrow gap between the current majority and minority in the senate.
the protesters had signs reading trump is treason and the art of the liar.
other senate republicans voiced frustration that the process had been too secretive and out of the public eye. senate republicans don't intend to hold any committee hearings on the bill, despite their commitment to so-called regular order.
pelosi again delivered the votes for the affordable care act in 2010, which republicans derisively called obamacare. that fall, they retook the house.
democrats were able to retake the house in large part because they campaigned on health care issues, warning that republicans would try to strip away some of the more popular provisions of the aca, such as protection for pre-existing conditions. around 130 million people in the united states have pre-existing conditions, and without the aca, insurers would no longer be required to cover those conditions.
on health care, bloomberg called medicare for all — which is supported in some form by most of the democratic candidates — a solution to the problem. he said it's better to tweak obamacare and restore some of the cuts that were taken away. former vice president joe biden has a similar stance.
he's talking about destroying your medicare and destroying your social security, and this whole country will come down, the president said.
he has a more direct approach to politics and policies and how he handles things, and from what i've seen, he seems to care about the issues of baltimore city, which is something that we desperately need, baylor said.
the president claimed he in fact up-played covid-19, after telling washington post journalist bob woodward he always wanted to play it down.
the move to start in arizona comes as bloomberg is taking the path less traveled in the presidential race. he will not appear on the ballot in some early-voting states, such as new hampshire, and he has hinted that he will not compete in other early states like iowa.
republicans want to make sure they are not going to appear to be lap dogs and lay down. they are saying yes, evers won, but it's not a mandate and he can't arbitrarily throw out everything they've worked on for eight years. that becomes laying down the political gauntlet, says republican strategist brandon scholz, asked about the politics at play. if roles were reversed, and democrats were fortifying things they'd worked on for eight years, republicans would say the same thing.
i didn't downplay it. i actually in many ways up-played it in action, the president told the voter who asked him why he would downplay a pandemic that is known to disproportionately harm low-income families and minority communities.
some democratic leaders and officials cited other hurdles for biden, such as his struggles with fundraising compared to other top candidates, issues with his campaign's organizing ability, and lackluster performances from biden at campaign stops in iowa. while several democratic leaders and officials echoed that the campaign is in trouble, many acknowledged that biden has been able to hold on to his initial supporters.
in rapid city, south dakota, hundreds of trump opponents and supporters also turned out. a larger anti-trump faction stood on a street corner as part of a not my president protest, similar to other demonstrations being held across the country. a group supporting the president lined up on a different corner at the same intersection.
the obama administration initially said it wanted to enroll seven million americans in the new marketplaces by the end of the six-month open enrollment period, aligning its goals with nonpartisan projections about the marketplace's popularity. yet when the marketplaces opened for enrollment in october, the significant technical problems with healthcare.gov and some state-based obamacare websites seriously slowed down the process.
at wednesday's debate, biden can be expected to try and turn mr. trump's accusations into an advantage. and the former vice president also says that russian president vladimir putin and north korean dictator kim jong un are worried about a potential biden presidency. north korean state media recently called biden a rabid dog, a phrase biden laughs at.

the result? on thursday, many of her staunchest critics ended up casting votes for pelosi.
san diego used to have the most illegal border crossings in the country. in response, and at the request of san diego residents and political leaders, a strong security wall was put in place. this powerful barrier almost completely ended illegal crossings.
health insurance is meant to help people pay their medical expenses and avoid potentially catastrophic bills. before obamacare, however, using your insurance could cause you to lose it.
mr. trump also claimed herd mentality will help rid the u.s. of the virus.
republican sen. bob corker's departure has left tennessee open to democratic takeover. rep. marsha blackburn, the republican candidate, is facing a challenge from former gov. phil bredesen, a popular moderate democrat. bredesen is ahead of blackburn in early polling.

yes, i think he should release his tax returns immediately, stone said in the interview, first reported by buzzfeed.
therefore, we recently imposed tariffs on $250 billion of chinese goods — and now our treasury is receiving billions of dollars a month from a country that never gave us a dime. but i don't blame china for taking advantage of us — i blame our leaders and representatives for allowing this travesty to happen. i have great respect for president xi, and we are now working on a new trade deal with china. but it must include real, structural change to end unfair trade practices, reduce our chronic trade deficit, and protect american jobs.
senator bernie sanders opened eight new offices across the state this past weekend, according to the campaign. sanders now has 22 offices and over 133 staffers on the ground, both among the most of any campaign in iowa says bidar. the campaign also says it knocked on more than 11,000 doors in the last 48 hours, adding to the over 100,000 doors they have knocked since the launch of the campaign. this comes after congresswoman alexandria ocasio-cortez campaigned for sanders in iowa this month.
to bolster their case against barrett, democrats cite an essay she wrote in 2017, in which barrett was critical of chief justice john roberts' majority opinion in the blockbuster 2012 supreme court case upholding obamacare's individual mandate.
signing the law, romney said, was right for the people of my state.
buttigieg specifically asked warren if her plan would increase taxes on middle class families, which the massachusetts senator has been loath to admit. your signature senator is to have a plan for everything, except this, buttigieg said at the last debate.
there are 22 members on the judiciary committee — 12 republicans and 10 democrats — and each will have their chance to question barrett directly later in the week.
since the video of trump making lewd comments in 2005 surfaced friday, many republicans have either condemned their nominee, withdrawn their endorsements or called for him to drop out of the race to allow mike pence to take over. trump released a video late friday attempting to apologize for his comments, but it didn't go far enough for many republicans.
sen. sanders wands to devolve the authority to set up state health insurance programs to individual state governors, clinton continued. now maybe if i lived in a place like new hampshire, with your governor, i would feel okay about that. but if i lived in a state that had a republican governor, particularly a republican governor who already turned down medicaid expansion matching funds, i don't think i would be comfortable, right? because i don't want to live in a country that has an unequal health care system again.
even as primary season continues, several senate races are taking shape, with some incumbent republicans and several incumbent democrats in danger of losing their seats. the blue wave may be coming for the house of representatives, but it is less likely to crash over the senate, where democrats are likely to lose seats and widen the gap between the majority and the minority. here is an updated look at senate races to watch as november approaches.
via cbs news campaign reporter zak hudak over the past month, elizabeth warren has faced more criticism than at any point since the early days of her campaign. the drama began at the last debate when her opponents swung at her from all sides.
it all started years ago, during the push for then-president bill clinton's impeachment, when lindsey graham, then a house member, was presenting the case to senators, including arizona's sen. john mccain.
clinton said there's no evidence that classified information was hacked and ended up in the wrong hands.
clinton said back in june, she said trump was not fit to be president and commander in chief.
i'll be candid… one of the areas of agreement in even contentious times in the obama administration was that our corporate tax rate is way too high, sayegh said on the latest episode of the takeout podcast. and it's made us uncompetitive. i mean, that is a point that both republicans and democrats largely agree on. we're going to really tackle that tax rate.
10:25 p.m. et candidates are asked what they would prioritize as the most important aspect of picking a supreme court justice.
his willingness to embrace mr. trump may be enough to save manchin, who is facing republican state attorney general patrick morrisey in the general election. recent polling has shown manchin to be several points ahead of morrisey. however, if republicans - with the help of trump - are successfully able to portray manchin as just another democrat, that lead could narrow very quickly.
the situation in syria is catastrophic, clinton said, adding that she advocates a no-fly zone in syria to provide humanitarian aid to people suffering and to work with allies.
the audit on trump's returns, however, from 2002 to 2008 is complete, and conway was asked about releasing those returns.
if someone with an individual insurance policy got sick, the insurer could scour the person's application looking for errors. even minor mistakes could cause the company to revoke the policy, a practice called rescission. under the aca, rescissions are allowed only if there's fraud or a material misrepresentation of facts.
after 24 months of rapid progress, our economy is the envy of the world, our military is the most powerful on earth, and america is winning each and every day. members of congress: the state of our union is strong. our country is vibrant and our economy is thriving like never before.
later, at a stop in portsmouth, clinton made a trip to g. wilikers toy store where she perused children's books for her 15-month old daughter, charlotte.
10:29 p.m. et clinton said that she respects the 2nd amendment, but wants comprehensive background checks, to close the gun show loophole and charleston loophole.
but graham made it clear their friendship was much deeper than politics or any single bill.
trump said clinton wants to move to a single-payer plan like canada's. he added that it should be repealed and replaced.
i am asking the congress to pass legislation that finally takes on the problem of global freeloading and delivers fairness and price transparency for american patients. we should also require drug companies, insurance companies, and hospitals to disclose real prices to foster competition and bring costs down.
his comment came after trump's new campaign manager, kellyanne conway, reversed her position that trump should release his tax returns.

the reality of a herd immunity, which appears to be what the president meant by herd mentality, is not so clear. the scant scientific research the world has so far suggests antibodies only last several months after infection, which seem to make it possible to be reinfected.
still, it might be more instructive if federal judges give a little thought to why their health insurance option works so well. that's primarily because federal employees are a large, diversified pool of patients, with varying ages, demographics and health care needs. such a pool helps insurers spread risk among young, healthy participants and those who are older or have more health care needs. the large pool also helps the government negotiate with insurers to keep costs down.
to debra, heather, madison, please stand: few can understand your pain. but i will never forget, and i will fight for the memory of gerald and sharon, that it should never happen again.
the border city of el paso, texas, used to have extremely high rates of violent crime — one of the highest in the country, and considered one of our nation's most dangerous cities. now, with a powerful barrier in place, el paso is one of our safest cities.
california's senate seat will definitely remain in democratic hands. incumbent sen. dianne feinstein overwhelmingly won her primary against state sen. kevin de leon, who challenged feinstein from the left. however, feinstein and de leon are both on the november ballot, due to california's practice of advancing the top two vote-getters in a primary, regardless of party.
senate majority mitch mcconnell, r-kentucky, aims to hold a vote on the legislation before lawmakers leave at the end of next week for the week-long july 4 recess.

romney said that more specifics about the plan would be forthcoming. but he argued that overall it lowered costs and meant less government spending than the obama plan, which he cast as a tax-raising, costly bureaucratic nightmare that forces an un-american federal mandate on the american people.
i respect his children, clinton said, adding that it says a lot about trump. i don't agree with nearly anything else he does or says.
by highlighting both mr. trump's request to ukraine and the barbs from foreign adversaries—whom he calls thugs—biden underscores his foreign policy experience, which he sees as a key selling point to voters. having spent much of the last 50 years as a powerful lawmaker steeped in foreign policy discussions, he says he knows intimately what makes leaders like kim and putin tick. will he proactively start contrasting this record with the other democrats?
i'm going to vote for biden, she said.
that's a shame, trump said, but he added that, there is a problem.
asked about the packed field of challengers he now faces, bennet told cbs that it's phenomenal we have an array of candidates that we have calling it a competition of ideas.
our approach is based on principled realism — not discredited theories that have failed for decades to yield progress. for this reason, my administration recognized the true capital of israel — and proudly opened the american embassy in jerusalem.
i will bring our energy companies back, said trump, who added that the epa is so restrictive it's putting energy companies out of business.
baltimore resident kyle baylor said he planned to drop off his ballot with a vote for mfume at the post office. baylor cited mfume's experience.
know your options. having a thorough knowledge of your exchange options can help you when it comes to applying for subsidies. individual exchanges often change their benchmark plans -- those that qualify for government subsidies. if you stay in your plan from the previous year thinking it will still be the benchmark plan, but then the benchmark plan shifts to a different carrier, you may lose your subsidy.
that has not been debunked, trump responded.
whether we like it or not, there is a problem, he said. we have to be sure that muslims come in and they report what's going on.

sen. joe donnelly is perhaps the most vulnerable democrat in the senate this election season. donnelly is running for re-election in a state mr. trump won by nearly 20 percentage points. the democrat has been nervously hewing to the center in recent months, denouncing recent progressive battle cries like implementing medicare for all and abolishing u.s. immigration and customs enforcement.
are we going to have religious tests when people fly into our country? clinton said, adding that what trump has said was extremely unwise and dangerous.
jesse weber, an attorney and anchor on the law & crime network, told cbs this morning saturday that the ruling was not unexpected.
clinton added that she worked to change the adoption and foster care system and she worked to rebuild new york after 9/11 and get healthcare for first responders.
under my administration, we will never apologize for advancing america's interests.
tens of thousands of innocent americans are killed by lethal drugs that cross our border and flood into our cities — including meth, heroin, cocaine, and fentanyl.
trump is asked how he would replace obamacare. he said the u.s. would have so much competition in the insurance industry. he said he's going to block grant into the states.
the special enrollment period, which extends to may 15, allows americans in need of health insurance to sign up for coverage through healthcare.gov. mr. biden signed an executive order in late january allowing the department of health and human services to establish the special enrollment period for uninsured and underinsured americans to seek coverage through the federal marketplace in light of the exceptional circumstances caused by the pandemic.
so you may not know me, but over the years i've learned a lot about what americans struggle with.
i don't want to see the country sold to the highest bidder. i want to see a system, something like a change in the system that martin luther king talked about, that we change the country, the system, that people are treated fairly no matter what station is in life, said bronson.
one week after votes for the next president are cast, the supreme court is scheduled to hear oral arguments in a blockbuster dispute involving the fate of obamacare.
10:19 p.m. et anderson cooper asked clinton how she can unite the country after her deplorables remark.
the candidates will likely have to answer whether the party is in a place to win over the roughly eight million voters who went for mr. obama in 2012 and mr. trump in 2016 as well as motivate turnout among african americans and latinos, a major problem for hillary clinton in 2016. democrats scored big wins in louisiana and kentucky's gubernatorial races this month. but in both cases, the democratic candidates did not focus on the ambitious policies frequently discussed in the primary field, such as medicare for all.
if no candidate gets a majority of votes, there will be a runoff election between the top two candidates. espy's path to victory is surprisingly plausible: if espy and mcdaniel are the top two candidates, mississippians may choose the moderate democrat over the conservative provocateur.

9:05 p.m. et both candidates entered the debate hall. the candidates didn't shake each other's hands.
medicaid would be phased out under the bill beginning in 2021, with gradual reductions until 2024 in the amount of federal obamacare funds that have financed the entitlement program's expansion. the senate bill would also slash funding to medicaid from what republicans call gimmicks that drive up federal costs. president trump repeatedly promised during the 2016 presidential campaign that he would not cut medicaid, medicare or social security.

colorado sen. michael bennet is the latest democratic contender to enter the packed field of 2020 hopefuls, announcing on cbs this morning on thursday that he's running for president.
we may not get to seven million, we may get to five or six, but that's a hell of a start, biden said while visiting a coffee shop in minneapolis, the minneapolis star-tribune reports. i'm here to say thanks.
president biden was clear: we need to strengthen the affordable care act and give more americans access to health care, especially during this pandemic, which has further demonstrated the importance of having the right coverage, health and human services acting secretary norris cochran said in a statement.
in wisconsin, republicans have had full control of the state for the past eight years. and in michigan, republicans have had full control since 2011. democrats in those states, both of which are also critical to the 2020 presidential contest, argue that republicans are dismissing the will of voters during lame duck sessions.
the fourth is to limit medical malpractice lawsuits. and the fifth is to make health care more competitive in part through co-insurance products that give consumers more of a stake in the overall cost of their care.
clinton said, we will have vetting that's as tough as it needs to be, but then she asked about trump's policy about banning people based on a religion, how do we do that?
the president is encouraging lack of empathy. like, lack of empathy, lack of respect, karen clodfelter said.
so finding coverage for specialists and out-of-network services isn't as tough a problem for judges as it can be in the often narrow networks aca enrollees rely on. and federal employees have the option of keeping their coverage into retirement, unlike many private employer plans.
my concerns about the community would be equal opportunities, jerome said.
pauley asked, did you learn that from the experience of being a target?

mr. biden vowed during the 2020 presidential campaign to preserve and expand the affordable care act, which he helped shepherd through congress while serving as vice president. in addition to the special enrollment period, the centers for medicare and medicaid services announced friday it is launching an education campaign that begins today focusing on increasing awareness of the added time to sign up for coverage, as well as the assistance available to those who qualify to pay for premiums.
in chicago, cbs news' roseanne tellez covered a protest in the city's downtown, where protesters had signs reading dump trump and repeal and replace trump, not obamacare!
a cost estimate of the bill from the nonpartisan congressional budget office (cbo) is expected to be released by early next week. white house staff met with senate republican staffers wednesday night on capitol hill to review the bill.
mr. trump's chumminess with heitkamp has evoked the annoyance of her republican opponent, rep. kevin cramer, who has suggested that mr. trump was not targeting heitkamp forcefully because of her gender. however, in a june rally, mr. trump went after heitkamp, saying that she was liberal who voted in line with senate minority leader chuck schumer and house minority leader nancy pelosi.
speaking at the university of michigan, romney defended the individual mandate in the massachusetts plan, saying it was necessary to address the free rider problem of state residents declining to buy health care and then showing up at hospitals for care, leaving taxpayers to foot the bill.
in addition to the affordable care act, barrett will likely be pressed about roe v. wade, the 1973 supreme court decision that established a woman's right to an abortion.
biden said he would push for a version of the affordable care act that includes a public option, deeming it bidencare. biden said his health care proposal would also allow medicare to negotiate drug prices with insurance companies and reduce premiums.
president trump signed an executive order in september announcing a steadfast commitment to always protecting individuals with preexisting conditions, but the order alone can't force insurers to offer coverage if the aca is struck down.
while pete buttigieg continues to surge in the polls, harris took her first jab at the south bend mayor when asked about reports of his campaign using a stock photograph of a kenyan woman on his website to promote a plan targeted at african americans. though harris laughed at the report, she warned that the democratic nominee must have to have the ability to unify the party and the country, and added and you can't unify folks if you don't understand who they are and their specific needs and the right that they have to be represented based not on a stock photograph, but [on] who they actually are. is this the sign of more attacks to come in the surging mayor's direction?

at the center of the case before the supreme court is the constitutionality of the so-called individual mandate, an original statute of the act that required those who could afford health insurance, but opted out, to pay a fee when they filed taxes. congress passed tax legislation in 2017 that eliminated the unpopular fine, and a federal appeals court determined the mandate was unconstitutional at this time last year. texas and other conservative-led states have since argued that the mandate's unconstitutionality renders the entire aca unconstitutional.

but if the supreme court finds the individual mandate unconstitutional and rules the rest of obamacare cannot stand without the provision, mr. trump said he would put forth a brand new, beautiful health care plan — without offering any specifics.

plus, with an annual salary of $255,300 for associate supreme court justices, this elite group of jurists likely doesn't feel the pain of out-of-pocket costs as much as the average aca recipient. the high court doesn't disclose how many justices opt for the federal employees health benefits program. they are allowed to receive coverage elsewhere, such as through a spouse's plan.

that means judges who opt into the system pay premiums, just like the rest of us. they may even pay a bit more than the average private-sector employee. in addition, depending on what type of plan judges pick, like private-sector employees they may have high deductibles or high co-insurance for certain services. as in the marketplaces, it's all about what plan they choose.
i apologize to my family and i certainly apologize to the american people, added trump, who then started talking about isis.
but how do you get at least 50 votes in the senate, especially after efforts to repeal and replace obamacare failed to garner the support of all republican senators?

before the aca, insurers routinely used preexisting health conditions as a reason to deny coverage or charge people more for their insurance premiums. preexisting conditions typically included serious ailments such as cancer or heart disease as well as more common conditions such as high cholesterol, high blood pressure, asthma, diabetes and obesity, and even temporary conditions including pregnancy. insurers denied about 1 in 5 applications for individual policies because of preexisting conditions, and some employer-provided group policies required people to wait up to a year before their preexisting conditions were covered.

in a departure from his fellow democratic contenders, bennet, who supports creating a public option for health care while making private insurances available on obamacare marketplaces, noted in his campaign rollout video that the answer to the nation's health care woes does cannot be found in far-left policies like medicare-for-all.
at issue in the case was the individual mandate, which requires people to have health insurance. the penalty for not having insurance was dropped to $0 in the most recent tax legislation, potentially undercutting the supreme court's decision in 2012 that the affordable care act was constitutional because of congress' ability to tax.

stump. but will this message resonate enough with voters to give the candidate a needed boost?
here, in the united states, we are alarmed by new calls to adopt socialism in our country. america was founded on liberty and independence –- not government coercion, domination, and control. we are born free, and we will stay free. tonight, we renew our resolve that america will never be a socialist country.
in downtown los angeles, thousands gathered outside city hall chanting love, not hate, makes america great, reports cbsla's margaret carrero.
9:07 p.m. et a voter in the audience asked if the candidates can display appropriate behavior for youth. clinton, who won the coin toss to answer first, said it is very important for americans to make clear to children that our country is really great because we're good.
after thousands of wisconsin voters waited hours in line outside crowded polling stations for that state's recent primary, maryland sent ballots to eligible voters weeks in advance to encourage as many mail-in votes as possible — in a test of how future elections might safely be held during the pandemic.
senate minority leader charles schumer reported the president said he'd keep the government closed for a very long period of time, months or even years – a promise mr. trump confirmed at a press briefing later that day.
if the law is invalidated, it could scrap other well-liked sections of the law, such as the part that allows parents to keep young adult children on their health care coverage until age 26.
that was a mistake. i take responsibility for using a personal email account. obviously if i were to do it over again, i would not, she said. i am very sorry about that.
10:10 p.m. et martha raddatz said that his running mate, mike pence, recently said that the u.s. should be prepared to use military force to strike the military targets of the assad regime and that provocations by russia need to be met with american strength.
he cast the pre-mandate system as the big government approach, since paying for care fell to taxpayers. he contrasted that with the mandate to buy insurance or pay a penalty, which he cast as the personal responsibility option.

clinton added that trump has made brutal kinds of comments about not only women, but all kinds of americans.
the stakes are enormous — for all kinds of americans as well as the broader american economy.
9:11 p.m. et trump is asked by anderson cooper if he understood that he bragged about engaging in sexual assault in his comments from 2005 that surfaced on friday.
we meet tonight at a moment of unlimited potential. as we begin a new congress, i stand here ready to work with you to achieve historic breakthroughs for all americans.
everything that has come since — our triumph over communism, our giant leaps of science and discovery, our unrivaled progress toward equality and justice — all of it is possible thanks to the blood and tears and courage and vision of the americans who came before.
so, they have to undermine. but that doesn't bother me. that's their problem.
and you'll develop — you'll develop herd — like a herd mentality — it's going to be herd developed — and that's going to happen, the president said tuesday night. that will all happen. but with a vaccine i think it will go away very quickly. but i really believe we're rounding the corner. and i believe that strongly.
the debate comes about two weeks after the two nominees last faced off at their first debate and after major revelations have surfaced about trump's past.
if they don't [report], it's a very difficult situation for our country, trump said.
now, though, the fate of an estimated 20 million americans covered under the aca lies in the hands of these well-covered judges. judge o'connor's friday ruling that the aca is unconstitutional came in response to a lawsuit filed earlier this year by a group of republican governors and state attorneys general.

graham, who leads the committee, publicly refused to take a covid-19 test when challenged by his democratic opponent last week to do so.
absent a vaccine, i think it would quite likely become like seasonal flu or perhaps like some of the other coronaviruses that we are familiar with, bill hanage, an associate professor of epidemiology at harvard university's school of public health, told usa today earlier this year. it is entirely plausible that this could become part of our regular landscape of respiratory virai infections.
i might even go so far as to say that this face mask is more guaranteed to protect me against covid than when i take a covid vaccine, redfield said wednesday. ... if i don't get an immune response, the vaccine's not going to protect me. this face mask will.
rick santorum, one of romney's likely rivals, released a statement immediately following the speech deeming the massachusetts health care law the precursor to national socialized medicine.
at issue in the case brought by a group of republican-led states — which are backed by the trump administration — is whether the health care law's individual mandate to have health insurance is unconstitutional, since congress abolished the financial penalty for individuals who do not purchase health insurance in its overhaul of the tax code in 2017. the justices are also tasked with deciding whether the rest of obamacare can survive if the individual mandate is invalidated.
yeah, i think, i think so. if you're effective, you're a target. there's just no question.
with the supreme court poised to decide the future of the affordable care act and the senate set to confirm president trump's third appointee to the high court, judge amy coney barrett, health care was a key topic during thursday night's debate. mr. trump and democratic nominee joe biden were asked to detail their health care plans should the justices vote to kill the obama-era health care law.
9:18 p.m. et the next question came from a guy named jeff from ohio on facebook. jeff asked: trump said the campaign has changed him. when did that happen? martha raddatz piggybacked onto the question and asked when trump walked off the bus on access hollywood at age 59, was he a different man then and did that behavior change?

as congress becomes increasingly mired in gridlock, states have become increasingly empowered and motivated to act on issues of national importance. and more state legislatures have fallen under one-party control; after the 2018 midterm elections, only one state -- minnesota -- has a divided legislature. democrats control 19 legislatures while republicans control 30. and after democrats made gains in governorships via november's elections, 13 states have one party controlling the executive and the other in charge of the legislature.
well, that would be depending on what comes forth from the special counsel's office. if and when the time comes for impeachment, it will have to be something that has such a crescendo in a bipartisan way, pelosi said.
with the house impeachment hearings in full force, biden has continued to defend himself and his son, hunter, from the trump administration's allegations of wrongdoing in ukraine. the keen interest the administration has taken in the bidens is now a main topic of the former vice president's trail speeches, where it is cited as proof that the president thinks biden would be his toughest general election opponent.
mccaskill received another political godsend in 2018 thanks to the meltdown of the state republican party. gop gov. eric greitens, a conservative rising star, resigned earlier this year amid after being accused of blackmailing and assaulting a woman with whom he had had an affair.
in 2018, when the 7th circuit weighed whether the full court should rehear a case involving a challenge to an indiana abortion law that requires fetal remains to be cremated or buried after an abortion, barrett joined a dissent from the denial of rehearing en banc authored by judge frank easterbrook. in his dissent, easterbrook took issue with a panel decision striking down a different statute that prohibits abortion based on sex, race or disability.

mr. trump declined to put forth additional details. he has long promised to unveil a replacement for the aca but has not done so.
i never thought we would be arguing about the affordable care act, or obamacare, in the democratic primary, clinton told democrats in manchester, one of three stops she made during her swing.
that question seems fair to ask in light of u.s. district judge reed o'connor's ruling on friday striking down the affordable care act -- the 2010 law passed under president barack obama that expanded health insurance to millions of americans -- as unconstitutional. o'connor's decision looks certain to be appealed by a group of democratic state attorneys general, first to the u.s. court of appeals for the fifth circuit and then likely to the supreme court.
just what kind of health insurance do federal judges and supreme court justices have?
she is expected to participate in the hearings remotely from her senate office, her office said, citing judiciary committee republicans' refusal to take commonsense steps to protect members, aides, capitol complex workers and members of the media.

be willing to change plans. true, all the jumping around in the marketplaces is making it hard for insurers to estimate costs going forward, but from the consumer perspective, this is one of the best options you have to keep premiums down.
in june, we mark 75 years since the start of what general dwight d. eisenhower called the great crusade — the allied liberation of europe in world war ii. on d-day, june 6, 1944, 15,000 young american men jumped from the sky, and 60,000 more stormed in from the sea, to save our civilization from tyranny. here with us tonight are three of those heroes: private first class joseph reilly, staff sergeant irving locker, and sergeant herman zeitchik. gentlemen, we salute you.
trump said that her comment was a great compliment.
that was a great display of presidential leadership, she said.
but we must do more. it is unacceptable that americans pay vastly more than people in other countries for the exact same drugs, often made in the exact same place. this is wrong, unfair, and together we can stop it.
senator cory booker says he wants to stop delineating left from right and said the nominee should have the full support of the party to defeat president trump. senator elizabeth warren, whose tagline is big, structural change, said she is so grateful for what obama did on healthcare and the consumer financial protection bureau. mayor pete buttigieg said he agreed with the premise of mr. obama's comments and said the role of activists is to lead the country forward but politicians must still balance competing constituencies.

three republicans are vying to become the republican candidate for senate: rep. martha mcsally, the choice of the party establishment, conservative firebrand dr. kelli ward, and former maricopa county sheriff joe arpaio. arpaio, who recently received a presidential pardon, will likely leech votes away from ward, a former state senator who ran in the republican primary against sen. john mccain in 2016.
on wednesday night in atlanta at the fifth democratic presidential debate, candidates will likely be asked to respond to comments former president obama made on friday cautioning against radical change. during an interview with stacey abrams, mr. obama said, this is still a country that is less revolutionary than it is interested in improvement. they like seeing things improved, but the average american doesn't think we have to completely tear down the system and remake it.
this new era of cooperation can start with finally confirming the more than 300 highly qualified nominees who are still stuck in the senate – some after years of waiting. the senate has failed to act on these nominations, which is unfair to the nominees and to our country.

if you've ever just went in to open something', there's so many papers, there's so many things you've got to do. there's so many taxes you have to file every month. it's like the system is made to be difficult, cathy said, sounding a bit more like a republican than a democrat. i don't want anyone ever to think that i think a republican can't help me….it does sound like we have a few things in common, right?
then again, increased medicare spending and reduced revenues will deplete the system's trust fund faster. the current insolvency date, with aca in place, is 2028; after that point, medicare's revenues won't be enough to cover all of its promised benefits.

mr. trump, who has not followed through on a pledge in july that he would have a health care plan ready and signed in two weeks, said his administration would not get rid of the preexisting conditions coverage that were implemented by the affordable care act. he was responding to ellesia blaque, an assistant professor who lives in philadelphia, who told him she's paying $7,000 a year for life-saving medicine because of a condition she was born with, sarcoidosis.

sen. dean heller is widely considered the most vulnerable senator in the majority and is the only republican senator seeking re-election in a state that hillary clinton won in 2016. although he avoided a potentially tricky primary with mr. trump's help, his close ties with the president and his agenda could be fatal to his campaign. in 2017, heller co-sponsored a bill to repeal and replace the affordable care act, which would have reportedly cost nevada $250 million in federal health care funding. heller said in august that republicans made a big mistake by tackling obamacare as their first major legislative move with trump in office.

both romneycare and obamacare infringe upon individual freedom and exponentially increase the government's healthcare cost burden, he said. romneycare has, in fact, not made healthcare better or saved costs in massachusetts. it's done just the opposite. this is not a failure of execution, but a lack of foresight on governor romney's part to understand the implications of his policy proposals. we need leaders who believe in the american people again, not the power of government to solve our problems.

at first glance, i have serious concerns about the bill's impact on the nevadans who depend on medicaid. i will read it, share it with governor sandoval, and continue to listen to nevadans to determine the bill's impact on our state, said sen. dean heller, r-nevada, in a statement. heller is up for re-election next year and is considered by democrats to be one of the most vulnerable republicans.

no, i didn't say that at all, trump said. i don't think you understand what i said...this was locker room talk.
over the weekend, the sanders campaign also launched a second digital ad featuring ocasio-cortez. we're building the largest grassroots movement of working class iowans our state has ever seen, said sander's iowa field director michael fasullo in a statement. with these new offices, we're expanding our reach across the state and giving our supporters the tools they need to bring new folks into the political process and win the caucus in february.

the events on the federal holiday didn't draw nearly as many people as the million-plus who thronged the streets following the republican president's inauguration a month earlier, but the message was similar.
well, in either case it doesn't matter to me, pelosi laughed. what matters to me is that he recognize that the congress of the united states is the first branch of government, that we're a co-equal branch of government, and that we represent the people. and that when we go to the table to speak with him, we're respectful of the branch that he represents, the office of the president. and we want him to be respectful of the branch of government we represent. co-equal.
democratic sen. heidi heitkamp is a major target for national republicans, although she has a relatively close relationship with mr. trump for a democrat. heitkamp was considered for a cabinet position, and has sat next to the president at bill-signings and ridden on air force one. mr. trump once called her a good woman. heitkamp released an ad touting her bipartisanship, noting that she voted over half the time in line with mr. trump's policies.

roberts said he believes that if congress had wanted the full act to fall, it would have struck it down itself, adding that it's not the supreme court job's to do so. it's hard for you to argue that congress intended the entire act to fall if the mandate were struck down when the same congress that lowered the penalty to zero did not even try to repeal the rest of the act, roberts told texas solicitor general kyle hawkins, who argued on behalf of the 18 red states challenging the law.

clinton said that she was alluding to steven spielberg's movie about abraham lincoln. she said that in order to get the congress to approve the 13th amendment, clinton said he used a principled and strategic approach in which he used an argument with one group of people and another argument with another group of people.

klacik, a baltimore county republican central committee member, generated buzz with appearances on fox news. her social media posts last year showing trash and blight in baltimore prompted a call for her to appear on the network's program fox & friends. president donald trump went on to describe the 7th congressional district in tweets last year as a disgusting, rat and rodent infested mess where no human being would want to live, at a time when cummings was the powerful house oversight committee chairman, leading multiple investigations of the president at the time.
pressed further to say whether he had actually engaged in such behavior, trump claimed he hasn't.

without the aca, insurers could once again charge copayments or coinsurance for preventive care, including screenings, immunizations, annual checkups and birth control. medicare beneficiaries could again have to pay for certain services, including screenings for breast cancer, colorectal cancer, cardiovascular disease and diabetes. the law also closed the infamous doughnut hole in medicare's prescription drug coverage that left many older people paying thousands of dollars out of pocket for their medication.
what will we do with this moment? how will we be remembered?
since then, other candidates like harris and former housing secretary julian castro have changed their campaign strategies to free-up cash and refocus their efforts. klobuchar, meanwhile, recently boasted in new hampshire that while her campaign prides itself on being frugal, they were looking to add staffers and offices, at least in iowa. the big moments for klobuchar at the last debate were her strong but polite criticisms of some progressive policies, such as medicare for all and forgiving student loans. klobuchar argues that she can deliver better, more politically realistic policies, such as a public option for healthcare and free community college. what will be the key policy difference she highlights this time?

currently, there's a $19 trillion gap, give or take, between what sen. sanders has proposed and how he's articulated paying for those proposals, clinton said. so that, to me, is troubling.
smart money in texas is not betting that rep. beto o'rourke, the telegenic democratic congressman from el paso, will defeat sen. ted cruz. however, despite mr. trump's nearly 10-point margin of victory in 2016 and cruz winning by 16 percentage points in 2012, the buzz around o'rourke is loud enough to suggest that the conservative incumbent may be in trouble.

in addition, consumers should be willing to drop a metal level to save money, advised dillon. according to his calculations, consumers can save approximately 15 percent in premium costs by shifting from gold to silver, or from silver to bronze plans. such a drop will likely mean more out-of-pocket costs, so based on your health care needs, you'll have to calculate if the savings on premiums in exchange for higher out-of-pocket costs makes sense.
there is no more greater multiplier of revenue than economic growth, sayegh argued, over a trout parmesan meal with cbs news chief white house correspondent major garrett and political director steve chaggaris. and that is the bottom line. and we again are forecasting some serious growth projections being able to be achieved if you enact tax reform.

even if you were able to keep your health insurance, experts say you could face caps on your coverage that expose you to enormous medical bills. preventive care and birth control could cost you more. medicare beneficiaries could face higher premiums, deductibles and copays. insurers could cancel your policy retroactively for even minor mistakes on your application.

washington -- protecting his signature domestic achievement, president barack obama on friday vetoed legislation to repeal his health care law, saying the measure would reverse the significant progress we have made in improving health care in america.
in advance of the speech, which the romney campaign billed as major, the conservative wall street journal editorial page hammered the massachusetts republican on the issue, writing: mr. romney now claims obamacare should be repealed, but his failure to explain his own role or admit any errors suggests serious flaws both in his candidacy and as a potential president.
i don't think 180 million americans want to give up the insurance they already have through their work or their union, said bennet.
no one has benefitted more from our thriving economy than women, who have filled 58 percent of the new jobs created in the last year. all americans can be proud that we have more women in the workforce than ever before — and exactly one century after the congress passed the constitutional amendment giving women the right to vote, we also have more women serving in the congress than ever before.
as a candidate for president, i pledged a new approach. great nations do not fight endless wars.

romney said that while pundits have been pushing him to simply admit his decision to sign the massachusetts law was a boneheaded mistake, he would not do so. that's because, he said, it wouldn't be honest.
the senate passed the measure last year under special rules that protected it from a democratic filibuster, and the house passed it this week.
biden repeatedly outpolls mr. trump in head-to-head matchups, including in pivotal states like michigan and pennsylvania. and a clear majority of democratic voters say the ability to beat mr. trump is the single most important attribute a candidate can possess. jesse harris, biden's senior iowa adviser, said the campaign is looking to get biden in front of as many iowans as possible. in an attempt to reach a wider group of voters, biden's team in iowa is targeting not just previous caucus-goers and democrats, but also independents and republicans.
even with trump's hot-and-cold behavior, heitkamp is seriously vulnerable.
you may not have thought america's health care system could get any more dysfunctional. if obamacare goes away, prepare to be unpleasantly surprised.

obamacare isn't working. by nearly any measure, it has failed, and no amount of 11th-hour, reality-denying or buck-passing by democrats is going to change the fact that more americans are going to get hurt unless we do something, he said on the floor after the bill was posted. republicans believe we have a responsibility to act, and we are.
we virtually ended the estate, or death, tax on small businesses, ranches, and family farms.

the winner will serve the remainder of cummings' term into january. the winner also will run as an incumbent in the state's june 2 primary to be his or her party's nominee for a full term. for the upcoming primary, voters also will be strongly urged to vote by mail.
how can he keep that momentum rolling in the debate? essentially, just by maintaining his status quo. his campaign argues that folks at home know bernie sanders. they know that his signature policy is medicare for all. they know that he's 78 years old.
since then, she's released significant details on her plans to pay for medicare for all and get congress to pass it. but that's opened her policies to new scrutiny. with the release of a 3-year plan leading up to a push for the original medicare for all bill, warren could face attacks from both her right and her left on where she now stands on health care. but while she walked onto the stage last month as the biggest target in the field, buttigieg's recent polling surge in iowa could distract some of the candidates looking for blood. will her rivals continue to pile-on warren, or will they move on to other top candidates like biden and buttigieg?
tuesday is the last day to sign up for obamacare in 36 states, while another 14 and washington, d.c. have later dates. the federal health insurance program — accessible at healthcare.gov — has seen a crush of signups as the open enrollment deadline approaches, and coronavirus cases continue to surge.
what donald trump says about muslims is used to recruit fighters, she said.
as part of our commitment to improving opportunity for women everywhere, this thursday we are launching the first ever government-wide initiative focused on economic empowerment for women in developing countries.
a major factor relates to one of obamacare's greatest strengths. now that people with preexisting conditions qualify for coverage, insurers may have underestimated the amount of health care services these people need. in addition, special subsidies given to insurers in the beginning of obamacare have come to an end. that's on top of rising health care costs in general, especially prescription drug costs.
10:14 p.m. et an undecided voter in the debate hall asked if the candidates can be a devoted president to all people in the united states.
but we must reject the politics of revenge, resistance, and retribution — and embrace the boundless potential of cooperation, compromise, and the common good.

mr. obama was also a topic of discussion at the debate in july when candidates argued over whether or not obamacare went far enough as well as that administration's immigration policies. on friday, mr. obama indirectly responded to those comments in his interview with abrams.
he is loyal to his friends, said an emotional graham, fighting tears. he loves his country. and if he has to stand up to his party for his country, so be it. he would die for his country. i love him to death.
this entire tax return debate is somewhat confounding to me, in the following sense: i don't think that it creates one job, gets one more individual who does not have health insurance covered by health insurance, particularly under the disaster that has been obamacare with these private insurers pulling out our exchanges now and reporting billions of dollars of losses, she told cnn.
mr. trump repeated a claim tuesday night he has made in the past — that covid-19 is probably going to go away now a lot faster because of the vaccine but would go away without the vaccine.
the next major priority for me, and for all of us, should be to lower the cost of healthcare and prescription drugs — and to protect patients with pre-existing conditions.
clinton went even further, arguing that sanders' plan would empower republican governors to eliminate health insurance for low-income and middle-income americans.

so now that i'm on the inside, i know something i didn't know then. he's under audit. he's said completely, when audit is completed, he will release, she said on cnn's state of the union.
while he said he has the plan already, stephanopoulos noted that mr. trump has been in office for 3 1/2 years and has not yet presented a plan to replace obamacare.
this isn't a zero sum world that we live in, her, partner john shepherd, said of what he hopes republicans will understand. and it doesn't have to be that way, yet it seems as though it is. if i have a primary motivator it's that everyone's lives should be better. not just mine – everyone's.
i will need some time to absorb this, but i want cindy —and the entire mccain family — to know they are in my prayers.
in just over 2 years since the election, we have launched an unprecedented economic boom — a boom that has rarely been seen before. we have created 5.3 million new jobs and importantly added 600,000 new manufacturing jobs — something which almost everyone said was impossible to do, but the fact is, we are just getting started.
like the vast majority of federal employees of all ranks, the government's judges have the option of enrolling in plans offered by the federal employee health benefits system. it includes hundreds of plan choices throughout the u.s. -- far more than even the largest private employers. many plan options also have broad networks of providers, often nationwide.
there are five planks in romney's proposal. the first is to give more power to states through medicaid block grants, more flexibility in dealing with the ill and uninsured and limits on federal standards.
pauley asked pelosi, was that bluster? hyperbole?
cbs news political unit associate producer eleanor watson says several of the candidates were asked about this over the weekend but did not bite.
i wouldn't count him out, but there's certainly been some troubling signs, said former democratic political operative grant woodard, who worked on hillary clinton's 2008 iowa campaign. a top iowa democrat said the former vice president doesn't have the intensity of support that other candidates have shown, adding, if he's not in the top three it's over.
that prospect has been the backbone of the president's insistence on the senate confirming barrett before election day.
no issue better illustrates the divide between america's working class and america's political class than illegal immigration. wealthy politicians and donors push for open borders while living their lives behind walls and gates and guards.
are you recalibrating your assessment of how you can work with this president?
in salt lake city, hundreds of protesters chanting this is what democracy looks like marched. the salt lake tribune reports that the crowd marched to push back against mr. trump and his administration's stance on such issues as the environment, immigration, free speech and russia.
in an interview on 610 wiod miami radio's fernand amandi show, stone was asked if trump is making a mistake by not releasing his returns.
cbs los angeles reported that organizers said they chose to rally on the holiday as a way to honor past presidents by exercising their constitutional right to assemble and peacefully protest.
hundreds of plans to choose from
we are also joined tonight by matthew charles from tennessee. in 1996, at age 30, matthew was sentenced to 35 years for selling drugs and related offenses. over the next two decades, he completed more than 30 bible studies, became a law clerk, and mentored fellow inmates. now, matthew is the very first person to be released from prison under the first step act. matthew, on behalf of all americans: welcome home.
trump made it clear several months before conway's interview with cnn in april that his returns are under audit and that he wouldn't release them until it is completed.
for about 20 minutes, protesters had been given verbal warnings to clear the street. some did, while others kept blocking traffic. police initially arrested three people, according to koin, and at least five others were arrested about 10 minutes later.
the fact is, president trump is about the only one who's spending any money here and in some of the other swing states around the country, bloomberg told reporters. that's a big problem for our party, and i am determined to change exactly that.
such a nasty woman ~also trump
officials have been urging the electorate to vote by mail for weeks, after roughly 484,000 ballots were mailed earlier this month to registered voters in the state's 7th congressional district to choose a candidate to finish the term of the late rep. elijah cummings. he died in october.

clinton said she supports an investigation of the russians and syrians committing war crimes in syria.
speaker pelosi ushered in a new era of divided government in the midst of a government shutdown – 800,000 federal government employees furloughed or working without pay, national parks and museums closed.
that's funny, isn't it? she laughed. sadly, i was hoping that we would have an american woman president just two years ago.
senators who emerged from the meeting didn't appear entirely confident it would pass next week.
if she's president of the united states, nothing is ever going to happen...she's all talk. it doesn't get done.
retiring early or starting a business might become too hazardous if your access to health insurance isn't guaranteed. you might have to wait a year before preexisting conditions are covered by an employer's plan. young adults could be kicked off their parents' policies. millions of people who buy insurance through the aca marketplaces or who now qualify for expanded medicaid coverage funded by obamacare in many states could lose their coverage as well.
we're not surprised to see donald trump continue his destructive race to the bottom. hillary clinton understands the opportunity in this town hall is to talk to voters on stage and in the audience about the issues that matter to them, and this stunt doesn't change that. if donald trump doesn't see that, that's his loss. as always, she's prepared to handle whatever donald trump throws her way.
here tonight, we have legislators from across this magnificent republic. you have come from the rocky shores of maine and the volcanic peaks of hawaii; from the snowy woods of wisconsin and the red deserts of arizona; from the green farms of kentucky and the golden beaches of california. together, we represent the most extraordinary nation in all of history.
despite blackburn's trumpworld cred, the race remains competitive. bredesen's campaign recently released an ad highlighting praise that he received from republicans when he was governor. blackburn is trying to make the election a referendum on trump, a strategy which may not work in her favor.
the senate's version was supposedly crafted by a working group consisting of 13 republican men -- and no women -- but one of the group's participants, sen. mike lee, r-utah, said even he had been left in the dark. lee said the measure was apparently being written by a small handful of staffers for members of the republican leadership in the senate.
clinton said she would save what works and what's good about obamacare and provide additional help to small businesses.
there could be no greater contrast to the beautiful image of a mother holding her infant child than the chilling displays our nation saw in recent days. lawmakers in new york cheered with delight upon the passage of legislation that would allow a baby to be ripped from the mother's womb moments before birth. these are living, feeling, beautiful babies who will never get the chance to share their love and dreams with the world. and then, we had the case of the governor of virginia where he basically stated he would execute a baby after birth.
we expect this ruling will be appealed to the supreme court. pending the appeal process, the law remains in place, white house press secretary sarah sanders said in a statement.
a final decision from the court is expected by june.

fellow billionaire tom steyer has urged bloomberg to support a wealth tax, but bloomberg said other countries have failed to show it can be successful.
over 915,000 people signed up for obamacare from november 29 to december 5, the fifth week of open enrollment and most recent data released by the centers for medicare & medicaid services' weekly enrollment snapshot. that's nearly double the week prior, when 523,020 people selected plans, which itself was about a 50% increase from the same time period last year.
supporters of the law immediately said they would appeal. california attorney general xavier becerra expressed confidence that the ruling could be overturned, saying the aca has already survived more than 70 unsuccessful repeal attempts and withstood scrutiny in the supreme court.
my administration has acted decisively to confront the world's leading state sponsor of terror: the radical regime in iran.
democrats are also fuming that the confirmation process is happening so close to election day, four years after republicans blocked the confirmation of judge merrick garland to the supreme court because it was an election year. democrats are expected to question barrett about her judicial record, but they also may use their time to excoriate their republican colleagues for choosing to hold the hearings now.
in the decade since the aca became law, many americans have become so accustomed to the protections and savings afforded by the landmark legislation that they may not realize how much could change if obamacare were struck down. its effects on health care are so pervasive that nearly every american could be affected, according to the kaiser family foundation, which tracks health care issues.
cuba is decorated with murals showing famous moments in the town's history, like an 1864 battle during the civil war. it's a town that knows something about a divided country.
10:21 p.m. et trump is asked if his recent tweet referring a sex tape involving former miss universe alicia machado shows that he has strong discipline, but he seemed to deny talking about one and then talked about clinton's role as secretary of state during the 2012 benghazi attack.
for now, the administration expects to get a cohesive bill in front of the house and senate committees of jurisdiction in the beginning of september, with mark-up completed by the first half of the month. after an effort to merge a house and senate tax reform bill together, it's going to get done by late october or november, sayegh said.
the affordable care act was all built on that penalty, weber said. the case will now likely go to the supreme court, where the five justices who previously voted to uphold the aca are still sitting. however, weber noted that the court now has a conservative majority, with the confirmation of supreme court justices neil gorsuch and brett kavanaugh under mr. trump.
both parties should be able to unite for a great rebuilding of america's crumbling infrastructure.
it's really very interesting, trump said.
barrett has written that abortion is always amoral, and in 2006, she signed on to an anti-abortion newspaper advertisement that opposed abortion on demand. in 2013, barrett's name also appeared in an advertisement sponsored by the group university faculty for life, which said we affirm our full support for our university's commitment to the right to life.
menendez won his primary with only 62 percent of the vote against a primary candidate who barely campaigned. menendez will probably prevail against republican bob hugin, but the margin of victory may be smaller than expected, depending on how many people cast a protest vote. hugin has also injected over $15 million in his own campaign.
9:38 p.m. et a muslim undecided voter asked what the candidates would do to combat islamophobia that's on the rise.
my administration has sent to the congress a commonsense proposal to end the crisis on our southern border.
for example, decades ago the united states entered into a treaty with russia in which we agreed to limit and reduce our missile capabilities. while we followed the agreement to the letter, russia repeatedly violated its terms. that is why i announced that the united states is officially withdrawing from the intermediate-range nuclear forces treaty, or inf treaty.
sen. lindsey graham, r-south carolina, said in a statement that he needs to carefully review the text first, but would prefer to address health care reform in a bipartisan manner, accusing democrats of being unwilling to negotiate with republicans.
but the dispute before the justices this term raises different issues than the 2012 legal challenge to obamacare, making it more difficult to discern how barrett may rule.
no matter the trials we face, no matter the challenges to come, we must go forward together.
mfume, a 71-year-old democrat who held the seat for five terms from 1987 to 1996, is trying to regain the office he held before cummings.
just months ago, 11 jewish-americans were viciously murdered in an anti-semitic attack on the tree of life synagogue in pittsburgh. swat officer timothy matson raced into the gunfire and was shot seven times chasing down the killer. timothy has just had his 12th surgery — but he made the trip to be here with us tonight. officer matson: we are forever grateful for your courage in the face of evil.
as we have seen, when we are united, we can make astonishing strides for our country. now, republicans and democrats must join forces again to confront an urgent national crisis.
peter bronson was in south florida on vacation from new york. he drove down from deerfield beach to voice his concerns over the trump administration.
well, the speaker has awesome power. but if the president of the united states is against governance and doesn't care whether people's needs are met or that public employees are paid or that we can have a legitimate discussion, then we have a problem, and we have to take it to the american people, she replied.
the decision doesn't affect people currently insured in the aca marketplaces or those who have just signed up for 2019 coverage. ultimately, however, if the ruling holds it would dismantle the entire law -- that includes many of the popular aca components such as protections for people with preexisting conditions, mandated coverage of essential health benefits and zero-cost preventive care. medicaid expansion coverage under the aca would also be in jeopardy.
the trip started before dawn at shelly's route 66 café in the small town of cuba, missouri – where friends gather, and strangers are made to feel welcome, their slogan goes.
republicans have argued that the law doesn't work and promised to override the veto next year.
clinton said, we've got to remain energy independent. she said she has a comprehensive energy plan that includes fighting climate change.
mccaskill's republican opponent, state attorney general josh hawley, has been criticized by some in his own party for being too distant, and not campaigning with sufficient vigor. mccaskill has also outraised hawley, raking in over $4 million in donations during the second quarter, compared to hawley's $1 million. early polling has generally shown mccaskill ahead, although a poll from the republican firm remington research in july showed hawley edging out mccaskill by two percentage points. mccaskill has also recently been knocked by hawley for using a private plane during a campaign tour.
while the aca's ultimate fate may depend on those courts, here's what to know about the health coverage federal judges and supreme court justices can typically expect.
on thursday, the president had kind words for pelosi. i just want to start off by congratulating nancy pelosi on being elected speaker of the house, he said. it's a very, very great achievement. i think it's actually going to work out. i think it'll be a little bit different than a lot of people are thinking.
nonetheless, o'rourke is a long shot. no democrat has been elected statewide in texas in 20 years. as in arizona, o'rourke's candidacy is a test of how much demographic changes have shifted a solid republican state to the left, and whether it's enough to elect a democrat.
some democrats in the house and senate support some version of medicare-for-all. progressives in congress may take the opportunity to try to pass a more comprehensive health care bill, although with republicans still controlling the senate, such a measure could die in the house.
other stars praised clinton for exercising restraint, while criticizing trump for seeming tense.
sen. rand paul, r-kentucky, didn't appear to be a fan of the bill.
nancy pelosi capped her unlikely comeback this past week surrounded by children. the california democrat was elected, once again, the speaker of the united states house of representatives, and become the most powerful woman in american history.
she said, you go into the arena and you understand that you will be a target. and that isn't anything that should keep you out of the arena. and so i always say to women, 'just be yourself. be who you are.'
she has such a complex and nuanced plan, clinton said after referencing her mother's record from when she was a new york senator. that's why paul krugman and others have said hers goes the farthest to regulate and rein in wall street and to increase the chance that we will never have 2008 ever again.
we will not avert our eyes from a regime that chants death to america and threatens genocide against the jewish people. we must never ignore the vile poison of anti-semitism, or those who spread its venomous creed. with one voice, we must confront this hatred anywhere and everywhere it occurs.
when mccain announced he had brain cancer in july 2017, the revelation rocked washington, d.c. — but it particularly touched graham. it was graham who, after being on the phone with mccain, broke the news to a meeting of fellow senators discussing health care.
president trump was in the spotlight tuesday night for a rare town hall in philadelphia with undecided voters, where he fielded questions on topics including the coronavirus pandemic and health care, which have been on the minds of many voters.
9:14 p.m. et clinton responded and said with prior gop presidential nominees, she has disagreed with them on policies, but she said, i have never questioned their fitness to serve. donald trump is different.
tonight, i am also asking you to join me in another fight that all americans can get behind: the fight against childhood cancer.
the veto was expected. but republicans claimed victory with the vote, arguing that they met two goals by finally passing a repeal bill: keeping a promise to voters in an election year, and showing that they are capable of repealing the law if a republican wins november's presidential election.
wages are rising at the fastest pace in decades, and growing for blue collar workers, who i promised to fight for, faster than anyone else. nearly 5 million americans have been lifted off food stamps. the united states economy is growing almost twice as fast today as when i took office, and we are considered far and away the hottest economy anywhere in the world. unemployment has reached the lowest rate in half a century. african-american, hispanic-american and asian-american unemployment have all reached their lowest levels ever recorded. unemployment for americans with disabilities has also reached an all-time low. more people are working now than at any time in our history –- 157 million.
just not their view of obamacare, which cut the jenkins' insurance costs. they want to elect a democratic congress to stop the president's attacks on it.
monday's rallies were the latest in what has been a seemingly endless string of protests against the president. several cities hosted similar events over the weekend.
conservatives have always been for repealing obamacare, and my concern is that this doesn't repeal obamacare, paul told reporters. what i've seen so far is that it keeps 10 out of 12 regulations, it continues the obamacare subsidies, and i think ultimately will not bring down premiums, because instead of trying to fix the death spiral of obamacare, it simply subsidizes it with taxpayer money to insurance companies. so for those reasons, it looks a lot like obamacare instead of a repeal of obamacare.
but also casting a shadow over barrett's confirmation hearing are possible legal showdowns stemming from the november election, as mr. trump has predicted the outcome of the presidential race could be decided by the supreme court.
the election initially was going to be an all mail-in vote, but limited in-person voting was allowed after concerns were raised about people who can't cast ballots by mail, including the disabled and homeless. more than 85,000 votes already have been mailed in.
there is a new opportunity in american politics, if only we have the courage to seize it. victory is not winning for our party. victory is winning for our country.
we must keep america first in our hearts. we must keep freedom alive in our souls. and we must always keep faith in america's destiny — that one nation, under god, must be the hope and the promise and the light and the glory among all the nations of the world!

clinton scooped up several books and a crochet owl hat to bring back to new york before heading over to the portsmouth brewery to host her final town hall of the day, where she faced a question about her mother's ties with wall street.
9:54 p.m. et candidates are asked what specific tax provisions they will change to ensure the wealthy pay their fair share. trump said he will cut taxes for the middle class, while he said clinton will raise everybody's classes massively.
over the last 2 years, we have begun to fully rebuild the united states military — with $700 billion last year and $716 billion this year. we are also getting other nations to pay their fair share. for years, the united states was being treated very unfairly by nato — but now we have secured a $100 billion increase in defense spending from nato allies.
coverage for those who make the deadline will begin january 1, a handful of weeks before the program's most prominent opponent, president trump, leaves office. mr. trump campaigned on repealing and replacing obamacare during the 2016 election, and kept on message, albeit unsuccessfully, throughout his presidency.
the final part of my agenda is to protect america's national security.
phoenix-area rep. kyrsten sinema, the likely democratic nominee, has tried to carve a niche as a more moderate democrat. according to fivethirtyeight, sinema votes in line with president trump's policies around 60 percent of the time. she is also a member of democrats' blue dog coalition, a group of more moderate congressional democrats. however, local democrats see sinema as the party's best chance of taking a still-red state.
but recall the biggest difference: feds have dramatically more choices than most employees or people shopping the aca marketplaces for coverage.
check, check and check again if you qualify for a subsidy. the government estimates that 87 percent of people who buy marketplace plans can receive a subsidy or premium tax credit to help lower costs. check with healthcare.gov and update your income information each year to make sure you're getting the assistance you qualify for.
senate republicans unveiled a discussion draft of the bill thursday of their plan to repeal and replace obamacare that would end the health care law's penalties for people who don't buy insurance, cut back an expansion of medicaid, but would keep protections for people with pre-existing conditions, compared to the house-passed bill.

vice president says health insurance sign-ups may be short of the 7 million goal during the open-enrollment period but adds he's optimistic regardless
via cbs news political unit associate producer ben mitchell while andrew yang's poll numbers continue to hover somewhere between 2% and 4% in the early states, the campaign insists they're exactly where they want to be right now. yang is still bringing in plenty of donations, his campaign is hiring new people every week and voters are still getting to know him, campaign staffer argue, which leaves room for growth. they also point to other campaigns that are hemorrhaging support and money.
that argument, however, has not exactly been met with a warm reception by the conservative majority on the supreme court. last month, chief justice john roberts and justice brett kavanaugh, one of three justices appointed by president trump, both signaled they disagree with arguments made by the republican-led states.
president trump recognized world war ii veterans in the audience at the state of the union address, feb. 5, 2019. cbs news
during the debate, clinton defended president obama's signature healthcare law and said, 20 million people have health insurance.
we have to bring back respect to law enforcement, he said.
are those the voters watching on debate night? perhaps. but it's more likely sanders will speak reach these people on the trail, or through door knocking and phone banking. still, sanders needs those committed democrats watching every debate night closely. can he win them over with a winning debate performance? he hasn't had any major flubs yet on stage, so if they haven't come to him now, will they ever?
republican-led legislatures in wisconsin and michigan in lame duck sessions are aiming to limit the powers of incoming democratic governors in their states, prompting sore loser allegations from opponents who say lawmakers are undermining voters. but the moves also raise broader questions about whether such efforts have become the new normal in a political environment in which state bodies are becoming more partisan--and more powerful.
nearly three-quarters of americans said senate republicans should discuss their health care plans publicly, according to a cbs news poll released tuesday. a quarter of the public, by contrast, said it should be developed in private. it also found 57 percent said obamacare needs some changes, 28 percent said it should be repealed entirely and 12 percent said it should be kept in place.
with no penalty, there's no tax, the plaintiffs, a coalition of republican-led states, argued in the texas case. the plaintiffs also argued that the individual mandate is so essential to the entire law, so that if it's unconstitutional, the rest of the law must also be thrown out. u.s. district court judge reed o'connor agreed on that point, too.
romney said that our plan was a state solution to a state problem, and his is a power grab by the federal government to put in a one sized fits all plan across the nation.
we eliminated the very unpopular obamacare individual mandate penalty — and to give critically ill patients access to life-saving cures, we passed right to try.
to build on our incredible economic success, one priority is paramount — reversing decades of calamitous trade policies.
9:20 p.m. et clinton responded by repeating a line from michelle obama's 2016 democratic national convention speech, when they go low, we go high.
my plan is to run for president, bennet told cbs this morning co-anchor john dickerson. i think this country faces two enormous challenges, one is a lack of economic mobility and opportunity for most americans and the other is the need to restore integrity to our government.
he made a variety of claims about the health care system, health care proposals and the scientific realities of covid-19. here are some of the highlights, as well as fact checking and context for his statements.
for weeks, reporters pressed him on using the defense production act to ramp up production of much-needed medical supplies before the president took action. he also claimed the virus would go from 15 cases down to zero quickly, and has insisted that the virus will eventually disappear. he has also been slow to embrace social distancing measures and practices like wearing a mask that scientists have encouraged to arrest the spread of covid-19.
in the 20th century, america saved freedom, transformed science, and redefined the middle class standard of living for the entire world to see. now, we must step boldly and bravely into the next chapter of this great american adventure, and we must create a new standard of living for the 21st century. an amazing quality of life for all of our citizens is within our reach.
whatever the case, federal judges' own health coverage probably doesn't weigh too heavily on their decision-making. after all, we've been here before. the supreme court upheld the aca in 2012, saying the individual mandate -- the area of the law under dispute in the texas case -- was constitutional because of the tax penalty involved. but now that the trump administration abolished the penalty, the recent lawsuit argued the entire law was no longer constitutional.
in june, i commuted alice's sentence — and she is here with us tonight. alice, thank you for reminding us that we always have the power to shape our own destiny.
it's an ideal situation, one that the aca tried to replicate in many ways.

trump, however, slammed obamacare, the situation involving trade and the u.s. border.
if there is going to be peace and legislation, there cannot be war and investigation. it just doesn't work that way!
via cbs news campaign reporter jack turman at a nevada democrats first in the west event sunday night, new jersey senator cory booker said the presidential election is not about left or right. it is about right and wrong. at the last debate, booker kept his focus on mr. trump and mostly avoided criticizing his fellow democrats. and at a california democratic party convention in long beach this past weekend, booker reiterated that democrats need to concentrate on winning back the white house instead of infighting. i'm happy to be in this field and plan on winning, but the one thing i'm going to stop is us tearing each other down, booker told reporters. after months of struggling in the polls, will booker look to throw some punches at his democratic competitors? or will he continue to focus on mr. trump?
here is what to expect for barrett's confirmation hearings:
control of the senate hinges in part on a race in missouri. democratic sen. claire mccaskill is locked in a close contest with the state's attorney general, josh hawley. missouri voted for president trump in 2016 and has grown more conservative over time. cbs news contributor and host of npr's morning edition, steve inskeep, took a road trip down historic route 66 for three meals with missouri voters: breakfast in a small town, lunch in a suburb and dinner in a city.
blackburn is focusing her campaign on her support for trump, who endorsed her in may. at a rally in nashville in may, mr. trump portrayed bredesen as a tool of chuck and nancy. blackburn has promised to wholeheartedly support mr. trump's agenda if elected. blackburn used clips from that rally in a recent campaign ad touting trump's endorsement.
the muslim ban is something that in some form has morphed into some extreme vetting for certain areas of the world, trump said.
so, you have to remind him of that periodically?
barrett wrote roberts pushed the affordable care act beyond its plausible meaning to save the statute. his decision, she continued, might be explained by the fact that chief justice roberts has not proven himself to be a textualist in matters of statutory interpretation, unlike scalia, a staunch textualist and originalist.
bet noted that the uncommitted african americans who asked mr. trump questions at the philadelphia town hall did not seem convinced by his answers on a range of topics from health care to inequality. blaque, the voter suffering from sarcoidosis, told cnn later that the president did not answer her question, and she's now decided who's getting her vote.
premium increases are also expected to hit employer-sponsored plans in 2017, but employers often offset those rises by passing on the costs to employees in the form of higher deductibles, co-pays and other out-of-pocket payments.
no one has more respect for women than me. ~trump
sinema would likely prefer to face a more extreme figure like ward or arpaio. however, mcsally is the front-runner to win the nomination, making it less likely that moderates will flock to sinema.
the judges, of course, would still have their federal coverage.
to get a broader understanding of barrett's views on abortion, democrats will likely ask whether she believes roe and planned parenthood v. casey, a major abortion case from 1992, were rightly decided, as well as for her views on stare decisis, the legal principle that says courts must follow precedent.
via cbs news campaign reporter jack turman south bend mayor pete buttigieg drew sharp contrasts with his progressive competitors, elizabeth warren and bernie sanders, on health care in the last debate. in contrast to warren and sanders' embrace of medicare for all, which would eliminate most private insurance plans, buttigieg's health care plan calls for a public option and does not eliminate private insurance plans.
the president has long cited his move to restrict travel from china as one of those actions. but the president was also slower on other needed measures.
the bill would have ended the law's medicaid expansion and subsidies and would eliminate the tax increases imposed under the law. the legislation would also cut federal funding for planned parenthood.
on friday, it was announced that we added another 304,000 jobs last month alone — almost double what was expected. an economic miracle is taking place in the united states — and the only thing that can stop it are foolish wars, politics, or ridiculous partisan investigations.
clinton also said her mother has a plan to pay for her higher-education proposals, unlike sanders, who proposed free tuition at public colleges and universities. clinton has also proposed to make tuition at two-year and four-year public universities free.
10:01 p.m. et trump accused clinton of being an ineffective senator. clinton said that as first lady, she helped get through the children's health insurance fund, which has provided health insurance to 8 million kids, she said.
there we found a group of small business owners, veterans, and retirees who all support the president. however, sue greenstreet is feeling dread. she's on medicare.
pauley asked her, will the next congress be remembered for impeachment, or will they be remembered for something else?
well, let me first say that our purpose in the meeting at the white house was to open up government, said pelosi. the impression you get from the president [is] that he would like to not only close government, build a wall, but also abolish congress so the only voice that mattered was his own.
the agenda i will lay out this evening is not a republican agenda or a democrat agenda. it is the agenda of the american people.

i began this evening by honoring three soldiers who fought on d-day in the second world war. one of them was herman zeitchik. but there is more to herman's story. a year after he stormed the beaches of normandy, herman was one of those american soldiers who helped liberate dachau. he was one of the americans who helped rescue joshua from that hell on earth. almost 75 years later, herman and joshua are both together in the gallery tonight — seated side-by-side, here in the home of american freedom. herman and joshua: your presence this evening honors and uplifts our entire nation.
while biden and sanders did release a platform to ensure universal health care, it is not sanders' medicare for all plan. the platform recommends an affordable and government-run public option health care plan to be made available through the obamacare exchanges.
pence urged pennsylvania voters to turn out at the polls next month. he argued that with saccone in office, congress would end budget cuts to the nation's armed forces and would pass funding to build a border wall.
now congress must pass a strong law that provides great healthcare and protects pre-existing conditions. mitch and nancy, get it done! he tweeted.
as part of a bold new diplomacy, we continue our historic push for peace on the korean peninsula. our hostages have come home, nuclear testing has stopped, and there has not been a missile launch in 15 months. if i had not been elected president of the united states, we would right now, in my opinion, be in a major war with north korea with potentially millions of people killed. much work remains to be done, but my relationship with kim jong un is a good one. and chairman kim and i will meet again on february 27 and 28 in vietnam.

ending obamacare could increase medicare beneficiaries' costs in other ways. the aca reduced payments to medical providers and private insurers. reversing that could lead to higher deductibles and copays for part a, which covers hospital visits, and higher premiums and deductibles for part b, which covers doctor visits and other outpatient care.
at st. louis's schlafly tap room, inskeep met flight attendant jana wayne, who didn't vote in 2016, and bartender shea bandera, who voted for donald trump. both say he's done a better job than they expected. but for bandera, there's one thing he doesn't agree with the president on: climate change.
yet he argued that what was right for his state is not necessarily right for the nation. romney grounded his argument in the founding fathers' vision for america, saying they didn't want a king-like structure grounded in a central government but rather for americans to have the freedom to choose our life's course, our enterprises.
it has, in fact, been debunked. he said it on howard stern's radio show.
millions could become uninsured if the aca exchanges are shut down, obamacare's expanded medicaid coverage is rescinded, and insurers are no longer required to cover children under 26 on their parents' plans. some employers may continue dependent coverage, since young people in general tend to use less health care. but young people in poor health or with preexisting conditions could be shut out.
it wasn't a matter of if, but more like how much. health care analysts and actuaries have been predicting for weeks now that affordable care act exchange members would likely see premium increases for 2017 around 10 percent on average.
in an attempt to address perhaps his greatest political vulnerability, likely 2012 republican presidential candidate mitt romney on thursday said there are clear differences between the health care law he signed into law as massachusetts governor and the obamacare federal health care law disdained by republicans.

the savage gang, ms-13, now operates in 20 different american states, and they almost all come through our southern border. just yesterday, an ms-13 gang member was taken into custody for a fatal shooting on a subway platform in new york city. we are removing these gang members by the thousands, but until we secure our border they're going to keep streaming back in.
o'rourke's tour of the state has garnered large crowds nearly everywhere he goes. he has also raised $10 million in the second quarter, compared to cruz's $4 million. the cook political report has even rated the texas senate race as lean republican, which means they don't believe it is a lock for cruz.
sayegh's boss, treasury secretary steven mnuchin, and national economic council director gary cohn have spent the last few months speaking with over 200 members of congress, including democrats, and hundreds of business leaders, trade associations, home builders and manufacturers in order to whip up support for their tax plan.
