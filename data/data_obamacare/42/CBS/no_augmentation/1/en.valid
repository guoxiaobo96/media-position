In just over 2 years since the election, we have launched an unprecedented economic boom — a boom that has rarely been seen before. We have created 5.3 million new jobs and importantly added 600,000 new manufacturing jobs — something which almost everyone said was impossible to do, but the fact is, we are just getting started.
Dinner at Schlafly Tap Room in St. Louis, Missouri CBS News
Ferguson, Missouri, a red area of the map, is where Michael Brown was killed by a police officer in 2014. Cathy and Jerome Jenkins kept their restaurant open during the protests that followed.
Here tonight is Debra Bissell. Just three weeks ago, Debra's parents, Gerald and Sharon, were burglarized and shot to death in their Reno, Nevada, home by an illegal alien. They were in their eighties and are survived by four children, 11 grandchildren, and 20 great-grandchildren. Also here tonight are Gerald and Sharon's granddaughter, Heather, and great‑granddaughter, Madison.
Year after year, countless Americans are murdered by criminal illegal aliens.
Our brave troops have now been fighting in the Middle East for almost 19 years. In Afghanistan and Iraq, nearly 7,000 American heroes have given their lives. More than 52,000 Americans have been badly wounded. We have spent more than $7 trillion in the Middle East.
The situation is dire for low-income consumers. According to a Commonwealth Fund study released Thursday, low-income adults who qualify for Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act but live in a state that hasn't expanded Medicaid will likely pay higher out-of-pocket costs for less comprehensive insurance coverage.

Year after year, countless Americans are murdered by criminal illegal aliens.
Yeah, I think, I think so. If you're effective, you're a target. There's just no question.
I never thought we would be arguing about the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, in the Democratic primary, Clinton told Democrats in Manchester, one of three stops she made during her swing.
In his veto message to Congress, Obama disagreed. Obama said the Affordable Care Act includes fairer rules and stronger consumer protections that have made health care coverage more affordable, more attainable and more patient-centered. And it is working.

9:14 p.m. ET Clinton responded and said with prior GOP presidential nominees, she has disagreed with them on policies, but she said, I have never questioned their fitness to serve. Donald Trump is different.
Mr. Biden vowed during the 2020 presidential campaign to preserve and expand the Affordable Care Act, which he helped shepherd through Congress while serving as vice president. In addition to the special enrollment period, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services announced Friday it is launching an education campaign that begins today focusing on increasing awareness of the added time to sign up for coverage, as well as the assistance available to those who qualify to pay for premiums.
The president claimed he in fact up-played COVID-19, after telling Washington Post journalist Bob Woodward he always wanted to play it down.
Mr. Trump's chumminess with Heitkamp has evoked the annoyance of her Republican opponent, Rep. Kevin Cramer, who has suggested that Mr. Trump was not targeting Heitkamp forcefully because of her gender. However, in a June rally, Mr. Trump went after Heitkamp, saying that she was liberal who voted in line with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi.
Well, I hope so, Pelosi replied. But the fact is, he has said it again and again.

Both Romneycare and Obamacare infringe upon individual freedom and exponentially increase the government's healthcare cost burden, he said. Romneycare has, in fact, not made healthcare better or saved costs in Massachusetts. It's done just the opposite. This is not a failure of execution, but a lack of foresight on Governor Romney's part to understand the implications of his policy proposals. We need leaders who believe in the American people again, not the power of government to solve our problems.
Democrats outnumber Republicans by more than 4-1 in the majority-black district, which includes a significant portion of Baltimore, as well as parts of Baltimore and Howard counties.
Clinton said she started off as a young lawyer working to fight discrimination against black children in schools.
Clinton added that Trump has made brutal kinds of comments about not only women, but all kinds of Americans.
Nearly three-quarters of Americans said Senate Republicans should discuss their health care plans publicly, according to a CBS News poll released Tuesday. A quarter of the public, by contrast, said it should be developed in private. It also found 57 percent said Obamacare needs some changes, 28 percent said it should be repealed entirely and 12 percent said it should be kept in place.
You may not have thought America's health care system could get any more dysfunctional. If Obamacare goes away, prepare to be unpleasantly surprised.
But the dispute before the justices this term raises different issues than the 2012 legal challenge to Obamacare, making it more difficult to discern how Barrett may rule.
With polls showing the Democratic race tightening in the crucial leadoff states of Iowa and New Hampshire, Chelsea Clinton on Tuesday took aim at Bernie Sanders -- her mother's chief rival for the nomination -- saying that Sanders would dismantle the health care system as we know it.
Biden was in Minneapolis for a private Democratic National Committee fundraiser but stopped at Moose & Sadie's coffee shop specifically to talk about the Affordable Care Act. He met with four women who were invited there to talk about the law, the Star-Tribune reported.
Still, Republicans hope to hold a final vote to confirm Barrett in the last week of October.
No. I don't know. We'll see. We shall see. It isn't so much about him. It's about the office that he holds, the Presidency of the United States. Sometimes I think I respect the office he holds more than he does.
It's going to get done this year. That is the emphasis, that is the focus, and that is what we have been working toward.
Republican Sen. Bob Corker's departure has left Tennessee open to Democratic takeover. Rep. Marsha Blackburn, the Republican candidate, is facing a challenge from former Gov. Phil Bredesen, a popular moderate Democrat. Bredesen is ahead of Blackburn in early polling.
I believe very much in improving and strengthening Obamacare, Mfume said in a recent interview.
Some people raised signs that said Not My President, while others held up a large American flag. Protester Reg Brookings warned the crowd that Trump is trying to divide the country by making such groups as immigrants the enemy.
Romney said that more specifics about the plan would be forthcoming. But he argued that overall it lowered costs and meant less government spending than the Obama plan, which he cast as a tax-raising, costly bureaucratic nightmare that forces an un-American federal mandate on the American people.
That gave me a chance to think about whether I really wanted to run or not, he said.
Asked again if the Muslim ban is no longer his proposal, Trump said, It's called extreme vetting.
The protesters had signs reading Trump is treason and the art of the liar.
Lee, of Utah, and Tillis both tested positive for the virus after attending the White House event, and it's unclear whether they will participate in the hearings in person or remotely.
On health care, Bloomberg called Medicare for All — which is supported in some form by most of the Democratic candidates — a solution to the problem. He said it's better to tweak Obamacare and restore some of the cuts that were taken away. Former Vice President Joe Biden has a similar stance.
The Trump administration and a group of Republican attorneys general have asked that the entire law be thrown out. The Supreme Court is scheduled to hear oral arguments on November 10 and could issue a ruling as late as June 2021.
Sen. Claire McCaskill is yet another endangered Democrat seeking re-election in a state Mr. Trump won by an overwhelming margin. McCaskill has lucked out in her Republican opponents in previous years; in 2012, the candidacy of Republican Todd Akin was tanked by his comment that legitimate rape could not result in pregnancy.
We will get through this crisis if we look out for one another and work together to expand coverage, lower costs and ensure that health care truly is aa right for all Americans, the president said.
Three Republicans are vying to become the Republican candidate for Senate: Rep. Martha McSally, the choice of the party establishment, conservative firebrand Dr. Kelli Ward, and former Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio. Arpaio, who recently received a presidential pardon, will likely leech votes away from Ward, a former state senator who ran in the Republican primary against Sen. John McCain in 2016.
The judges, of course, would still have their federal coverage.
Since the first debate, The New York Times has also reported that Trump's 1995 tax returns, which it obtained, show that he posted a $916 million loss that year, which means he could have avoided paying federal income taxes for up to 18 years.
While Pete Buttigieg continues to surge in the polls, Harris took her first jab at the South Bend mayor when asked about reports of his campaign using a stock photograph of a Kenyan woman on his website to promote a plan targeted at African Americans. Though Harris laughed at the report, she warned that the Democratic nominee must have to have the ability to unify the party and the country, and added and you can't unify folks if you don't understand who they are and their specific needs and the right that they have to be represented based not on a stock photograph, but [on] who they actually are. Is this the sign of more attacks to come in the surging mayor's direction?

My Administration has acted decisively to confront the world's leading state sponsor of terror: the radical regime in Iran.
Think of this Capitol — think of this very chamber, where lawmakers before you voted to end slavery, to build the railroads and the highways, to defeat fascism, to secure civil rights, to face down an evil empire.
There is no more greater multiplier of revenue than economic growth, Sayegh argued, over a Trout Parmesan meal with CBS News Chief White House Correspondent Major Garrett and Political Director Steve Chaggaris. And that is the bottom line. And we again are forecasting some serious growth projections being able to be achieved if you enact tax reform.
In Wisconsin, Republicans have had full control of the state for the past eight years. And in Michigan, Republicans have had full control since 2011. Democrats in those states, both of which are also critical to the 2020 presidential contest, argue that Republicans are dismissing the will of voters during lame duck sessions.
There we found a group of small business owners, veterans, and retirees who all support the president. However, Sue Greenstreet is feeling dread. She's on Medicare.
In Portland, Oregon, dozens gathered late Monday morning and blocked downtown streets, and a handful of protesters were arrested after refusing to stop blocking traffic, CBS Portland affiliate KOIN reported. Video from the scene showed police making arrests and people laying face down on the ground.
We must be united at home to defeat our adversaries abroad.
More than 300,000 people have now died from the coronavirus in the U.S., according to data from Johns Hopkins University. The U.S. has set records for COVID-19 hospitalizations for eight days in a row, and the number of patients requiring intensive care is up 80% from a month ago.
Since the video of Trump making lewd comments in 2005 surfaced Friday, many Republicans have either condemned their nominee, withdrawn their endorsements or called for him to drop out of the race to allow Mike Pence to take over. Trump released a video late Friday attempting to apologize for his comments, but it didn't go far enough for many Republicans.
9:22 p.m. ET Trump said that Clinton owes an apology for her thousands of missing emails. He then said, If I win, I am going to instruct my attorney general to get a special prosecutor to look into your situation.
Clinton said that within hours, I said I was sorry about the way I talked about that.
10:13 p.m. ET Trump complained that the moderators keep letting Clinton to go a few seconds over.
The hearings will be a venue for Democrats to air their criticisms of Republicans' response to the pandemic, as well as to gauge how the senators — and Barrett — react to the public safety threat. Barrett contracted the virus and recovered from it over the summer, according to The Washington Post. The White House said on October 2 she tested negative after the September 26 event.
Here is a glimpse of their friendship, in photos:
On Wednesday night in Atlanta at the fifth Democratic presidential debate, candidates will likely be asked to respond to comments former President Obama made on Friday cautioning against radical change. During an interview with Stacey Abrams, Mr. Obama said, This is still a country that is less revolutionary than it is interested in improvement. They like seeing things improved, but the average American doesn't think we have to completely tear down the system and remake it.
Across the table, Diane Nickel fears social unrest.
I have a deep devotion...to making sure that every American feels that he or she has a place in our country, she said.
This year, America will recognize two important anniversaries that show us the majesty of America's mission, and the power of American pride.
Biden said he would push for a version of the Affordable Care Act that includes a public option, deeming it Bidencare. Biden said his health care proposal would also allow Medicare to negotiate drug prices with insurance companies and reduce premiums.
Here's the full text of the discussion draft of the bill.
We may not get to seven million, we may get to five or six, but that's a hell of a start, Biden said while visiting a coffee shop in Minneapolis, the Minneapolis Star-Tribune reports. I'm here to say thanks.
She also, unlike Sen. Sanders, has articulated how she's going to pay for that proposal, Chelsea Clinton said of Hillary Clinton's plan.
When you look at Bill Clinton, he said, There has never been anyone in the history of this nation...who has been so abusive to women.
Yeah, well, I don't know if I would retire. I would've gone home. Yeah, I see my role as more of a mission than job tenure. And when the mission is accomplished, then I can have that satisfaction that when I was needed to get the job done, I was there to do it.
Biden pushed back, though, and stressed he split from the Democratic presidential candidates who supported Medicare for All, including his running mate Senator Kamala Harris, who was his rival in the Democratic primaries.
In the last 2 years, our brave ICE officers made 266,000 arrests of criminal aliens, including those charged or convicted of nearly 100,000 assaults, 30,000 sex crimes, and 4,000 killings.
We virtually ended the estate, or death, tax on small businesses, ranches, and family farms.
Clinton added that Trump has made brutal kinds of comments about not only women, but all kinds of Americans.
The bigger the pool, the better
Trump then brought up President Bill Clinton's past infidelities.
9:16 p.m. ET After Clinton outlined how she would help Americans, including minorities across the U.S., Trump said, It's just words, folks. It's just words.
Mr. Trump campaigned against Donnelly during a May rally in Elkhart, Indiana, calling the incumbent Sleepin' Joe. Meanwhile, Donnelly continues to steadfastly project an image as a moderate, and even Trump-friendly. In July, Donnelly released an ad that quotes Mr. Trump's praise of the senator at a bill signing later in May.
Despite decisively losing the primary, De Leon was endorsed by state Democratic Party, and some progressives in the state hope that he can ride an insurgent campaign to victory over the 85-year-old incumbent.
Pelosi again delivered the votes for the Affordable Care Act in 2010, which Republicans derisively called Obamacare. That fall, they retook the House.
Well, that would be depending on what comes forth from the Special Counsel's Office. If and when the time comes for impeachment, it will have to be something that has such a crescendo in a bipartisan way, Pelosi said.
Vice President Joe Biden acknowledged Wednesday that the new Obamacare marketplaces may not meet their original enrollment goals. Still, Biden -- who famously called the 2010 passage of the Affordable Care Act a big f**king deal, said that the new marketplaces are nevertheless off to hell of a start.
As the first woman elected Speaker of the House, her place in history was already secure. But her defining role in history may lie ahead of her.
Senator Cory Booker says he wants to stop delineating left from right and said the nominee should have the full support of the party to defeat President Trump. Senator Elizabeth Warren, whose tagline is big, structural change, said she is so grateful for what Obama did on healthcare and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Mayor Pete Buttigieg said he agreed with the premise of Mr. Obama's comments and said the role of activists is to lead the country forward but politicians must still balance competing constituencies.
So first of all, you are taken seriously. I hope you are, he responded. And we are not going to hurt anything having to do with preexisting conditions. We're not going to hurt preexisting conditions. And, in fact, just the opposite.
The CDC says masks are most likely to reduce the spread of COVID-19 when they are widely used by people in public settings.
The special enrollment period, which extends to May 15, allows Americans in need of health insurance to sign up for coverage through Healthcare.gov. Mr. Biden signed an executive order in late January allowing the Department of Health and Human Services to establish the special enrollment period for uninsured and underinsured Americans to seek coverage through the federal marketplace in light of the exceptional circumstances caused by the pandemic.
Yes, I think he should release his tax returns immediately, Stone said in the interview, first reported by Buzzfeed.
To get a broader understanding of Barrett's views on abortion, Democrats will likely ask whether she believes Roe and Planned Parenthood v. Casey, a major abortion case from 1992, were rightly decided, as well as for her views on stare decisis, the legal principle that says courts must follow precedent.
In this special DEBATE edition of Trail Markers, the CBS News Political Unit gives a rundown of what to watch for from the 10 presidential candidates who made it to the stage plus other political news of the day.
Donnelly is facing a challenge from Mike Braun, a Republican business executive who sailed to his primary victory as an outsider candidate and spent $4.5 million in the final weeks of the race.
While he faces an uphill fundraising battle with his delayed entry into the already jam-packed field, Bennet is optimistic about his political future.
Phoenix — In his second day on the campaign trail, former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg stood in strong contrast to many of his Democratic rivals in the presidential race. He criticized not only their campaign strategies but their policies.

Despite decisively losing the primary, De Leon was endorsed by state Democratic Party, and some progressives in the state hope that he can ride an insurgent campaign to victory over the 85-year-old incumbent.
Ahead of Wednesday's debate, Warren has released two more plans on health care: one indicating that her plan would not increase taxes on middle class families and the other detailing a health care bill that includes an expansive public option that she says she would work to pass before Medicare for All. Meanwhile, two polls in the last week, including a CBS News Battleground Tracker poll, showed Buttigieg rising in Iowa. And with less than 80 days until the Iowa caucus, Buttigieg's competitors may start redirecting their fire toward the millennial mayor. How will Buttigieg fend off potential attacks now that polling shows him in the top tier of candidates?
Yeah, well, I don't know if I would retire. I would've gone home. Yeah, I see my role as more of a mission than job tenure. And when the mission is accomplished, then I can have that satisfaction that when I was needed to get the job done, I was there to do it.
Are those the voters watching on debate night? Perhaps. But it's more likely Sanders will speak reach these people on the trail, or through door knocking and phone banking. Still, Sanders needs those committed Democrats watching every debate night closely. Can he win them over with a winning debate performance? He hasn't had any major flubs yet on stage, so if they haven't come to him now, will they ever?
She talks tough against Putin and Assad, he added. Every time we take rebels, we're arming people...they end up being worse than the people...almost everything she's done in foreign policy has been a mistake and it's been a disaster.
10:14 p.m. ET An undecided voter in the debate hall asked if the candidates can be a devoted president to all people in the United States.
At St. Louis's Schlafly Tap Room, Inskeep met flight attendant Jana Wayne, who didn't vote in 2016, and bartender Shea Bandera, who voted for Donald Trump. Both say he's done a better job than they expected. But for Bandera, there's one thing he doesn't agree with the president on: climate change.
The protesters had signs reading Trump is treason and the art of the liar.
Bloomberg also doubled down on his opposition to Medicare for All and a wealth tax.
We can make our communities safer, our families stronger, our culture richer, our faith deeper, and our middle class bigger and more prosperous than ever before.
I don't think 180 million Americans want to give up the insurance they already have through their work or their union, said Bennet.
Asked who those people are, the president responded that masks aren't good for waiters.
California's Senate seat will definitely remain in Democratic hands. Incumbent Sen. Dianne Feinstein overwhelmingly won her primary against state Sen. Kevin De Leon, who challenged Feinstein from the left. However, Feinstein and De Leon are both on the November ballot, due to California's practice of advancing the top two vote-getters in a primary, regardless of party.

Counting votes is in her blood. She was born the daughter of a Congressman, later the longtime mayor of Baltimore, Tom D'Alesandro. Nancy was the youngest of seven, and the only girl.
No, I didn't say that at all, Trump said. I don't think you understand what I said...This was locker room talk.
What will we do with this moment? How will we be remembered?
While Democrats have few procedural tools at their disposal to block Barrett's nomination, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer on Sunday vowed to deny Republicans the quorum needed for a vote by the Judiciary Committee and on the Senate floor.
Mr. Trump declined to put forth additional details. He has long promised to unveil a replacement for the ACA but has not done so.
The Trump White House has said that the law will remain in place for now. The ruling is certain to be appealed.
McCaskill's Republican opponent, state Attorney General Josh Hawley, has been criticized by some in his own party for being too distant, and not campaigning with sufficient vigor. McCaskill has also outraised Hawley, raking in over $4 million in donations during the second quarter, compared to Hawley's $1 million. Early polling has generally shown McCaskill ahead, although a poll from the Republican firm Remington Research in July showed Hawley edging out McCaskill by two percentage points. McCaskill has also recently been knocked by Hawley for using a private plane during a campaign tour.
You may not have thought America's health care system could get any more dysfunctional. If Obamacare goes away, prepare to be unpleasantly surprised.
In the two abortion cases she was involved in during her tenure on the 7th Circuit, she joined the dissent in ruling to deny requests for the the full appeals court to rehear disputes.
The herd immunity strategy would also yield far more deaths, as Stephanopoulos pointed out.
No one has benefitted more from our thriving economy than women, who have filled 58 percent of the new jobs created in the last year. All Americans can be proud that we have more women in the workforce than ever before — and exactly one century after the Congress passed the Constitutional amendment giving women the right to vote, we also have more women serving in the Congress than ever before.
He is one of my dearest friends in the world, and John McCain can do whatever damn he wants to, he's earned that right, Graham said on CNN during a health care debate the same month.
We eliminated the very unpopular Obamacare individual mandate penalty — and to give critically ill patients access to life-saving cures, we passed right to try.
Well, that would be depending on what comes forth from the Special Counsel's Office. If and when the time comes for impeachment, it will have to be something that has such a crescendo in a bipartisan way, Pelosi said.
9:18 p.m. ET The next question came from a guy named Jeff from Ohio on Facebook. Jeff asked: Trump said the campaign has changed him. When did that happen? Martha Raddatz piggybacked onto the question and asked when Trump walked off the bus on Access Hollywood at age 59, was he a different man then and did that behavior change?
Senators who emerged from the meeting didn't appear entirely confident it would pass next week.
The candidates will likely have to answer whether the party is in a place to win over the roughly eight million voters who went for Mr. Obama in 2012 and Mr. Trump in 2016 as well as motivate turnout among African Americans and Latinos, a major problem for Hillary Clinton in 2016. Democrats scored big wins in Louisiana and Kentucky's gubernatorial races this month. But in both cases, the Democratic candidates did not focus on the ambitious policies frequently discussed in the primary field, such as Medicare for All.
Asked who those people are, the president responded that masks aren't good for waiters.
Added Dave Dillon, fellow at the Society of Actuaries: Insurers developed rates for the exchanges back in 2014 with no data. At best it was an educated guess, he explained. It's no wonder lots of insurers underestimated their costs.
It all started years ago, during the push for then-President Bill Clinton's impeachment, when Lindsey Graham, then a House member, was presenting the case to senators, including Arizona's Sen. John McCain.
Considered a relatively moderate Democrat, Bennet has represented Colorado in the U.S. Senate since 2009. Before entering politics, he spent seven years in the private sector where served as director of the Anschutz Investment Company. It was there that he managed the consolidation of three major movie chains into the Regal Entertainment Group.
Scott raised $22 million in his first quarter as a candidate for Senate, with $8 million of those funds coming from individual contributions, while Nelson raised $4.4 million in the second quarter. Scott is also extremely wealthy, and could potentially pour millions of his own funds into his campaign in the final stretch of the race.
That's funny, isn't it? she laughed. Sadly, I was hoping that we would have an American woman president just two years ago.
She added, Four-hundred pieces of legislation have my name on it.
Meanwhile, WikiLeaks on Friday leaked hundreds of emails that were hacked from some of the email accounts of John Podesta, Clinton's campaign chairman. One of the emails showed excerpts of Clinton's speeches to Goldman Sachs.
There is no more greater multiplier of revenue than economic growth, Sayegh argued, over a Trout Parmesan meal with CBS News Chief White House Correspondent Major Garrett and Political Director Steve Chaggaris.

He's talking about destroying your Medicare and destroying your Social Security, and this whole country will come down, the president said.
There are 22 members on the Judiciary Committee — 12 Republicans and 10 Democrats — and each will have their chance to question Barrett directly later in the week.
9:42 p.m. ET Martha Raddatz said that Trump's running mate, Mike Pence recently said that Trump's proposed Muslim ban from last December is no longer their campaign's position. Asked if that's correct, Trump said, First of all, Captain Khan is an American hero.
What Donald Trump says about Muslims is used to recruit fighters, she said.
On Friday, it was announced that we added another 304,000 jobs last month alone — almost double what was expected. An economic miracle is taking place in the United States — and the only thing that can stop it are foolish wars, politics, or ridiculous partisan investigations.
To defend the dignity of every person, I am asking the Congress to pass legislation to prohibit the late-term abortion of children who can feel pain in the mother's womb.
The president has long cited his move to restrict travel from China as one of those actions. But the president was also slower on other needed measures.
10:31 p.m. ET Candidates are asked what steps their energy policies will take to meet Americans' needs while limiting job losses and not damaging the environment.
So now that I'm on the inside, I know something I didn't know then. He's under audit. He's said completely, when audit is completed, he will release, she said on CNN's State of the Union.
What Donald Trump says about Muslims is used to recruit fighters, she said.
I want to know what it is that you're going to do assure that people like me who work hard, we do everything we're supposed to do, can stay insured, she asked Mr. Trump.
Like the vast majority of federal employees of all ranks, the government's judges have the option of enrolling in plans offered by the Federal Employee Health Benefits system. It includes hundreds of plan choices throughout the U.S. -- far more than even the largest private employers. Many plan options also have broad networks of providers, often nationwide.
9:11 p.m. ET Trump is asked by Anderson Cooper if he understood that he bragged about engaging in sexual assault in his comments from 2005 that surfaced on Friday.
9:16 p.m. ET After Clinton outlined how she would help Americans, including minorities across the U.S., Trump said, It's just words, folks. It's just words.
VIA CBS NEWS CAMPAIGN REPORTER JACK TURMAN Hawaii Representative Tulsi Gabbard, who memorably dinged California Senator Kamala Harris at a debate earlier this year, went on the attack against Elizabeth Warren in the last debate. Gabbard has redirected her focus to Hillary Clinton since then, a response to the former Democratic nominee's insinuation that the dovish congresswoman is a favorite of the Russians. Gabbard's campaign lawyer released a letter to Clinton, who recently indicated that she could still run for president, saying that she defamed Gabbard and demanded a retraction. Will Gabbard try to criticize Warren again and will she continue to go after Clinton?
He's never come up with a plan, the former vice president said. I guess we're going to get the pre-existing conditions plan at the same time we'll get the infrastructure plan.

Well, I had never heard the expression, 'Get a life,' but then I did! she laughed.
But going toe-to-toe in a televised standoff with the president may have helped seal the deal. She corrected the president – Please don't characterize the strength that I bring to this meeting as the leader of the House Democrats, who just won a big victory – and she left that meeting in shades and a flaming red power coat, making her a social media celebrity.
The stakes are enormous — for all kinds of Americans as well as the broader American economy.
What can you do if you're looking at a big jump in your premium?
San Diego used to have the most illegal border crossings in the country. In response, and at the request of San Diego residents and political leaders, a strong security wall was put in place. This powerful barrier almost completely ended illegal crossings.
In June, we mark 75 years since the start of what General Dwight D. Eisenhower called the Great Crusade — the Allied liberation of Europe in World War II. On D-Day, June 6, 1944, 15,000 young American men jumped from the sky, and 60,000 more stormed in from the sea, to save our civilization from tyranny. Here with us tonight are three of those heroes: Private First Class Joseph Reilly, Staff Sergeant Irving Locker, and Sergeant Herman Zeitchik. Gentlemen, we salute you.
As part of a bold new diplomacy, we continue our historic push for peace on the Korean Peninsula. Our hostages have come home, nuclear testing has stopped, and there has not been a missile launch in 15 months. If I had not been elected President of the United States, we would right now, in my opinion, be in a major war with North Korea with potentially millions of people killed. Much work remains to be done, but my relationship with Kim Jong Un is a good one. And Chairman Kim and I will meet again on February 27 and 28 in Vietnam.
Several senators are already expressing concerns about the proposal.
Vice President Mike Pence on Friday delivered remarks at an event for Rick Saccone, the GOP nominee running in the special election to fill the seat vacated by former Rep. Tim Murphy, R-Pennsylvania, which is being held on March 13. Conor Lamb is the Democratic candidate running for the seat.
Trump said Clinton wants to move to a single-payer plan like Canada's. He added that it should be repealed and replaced.
Republicans have argued that the law doesn't work and promised to override the veto next year.
Hundreds of plans to choose from
It's still unclear when that health care plan, which Mr. Trump said would be signed weeks ago, will be released. White House chief of staff Mark Meadows said the plan has a legislative component and an executive action component.
Just months ago, 11 Jewish-Americans were viciously murdered in an anti-semitic attack on the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh. SWAT Officer Timothy Matson raced into the gunfire and was shot seven times chasing down the killer. Timothy has just had his 12th surgery — but he made the trip to be here with us tonight. Officer Matson: we are forever grateful for your courage in the face of evil.
Liberal stars took Trump to task about his bad hombres comment. Sophia Bush used it as an opportunity to urge fans to vote.
At issue in the case brought by a group of Republican-led states — which are backed by the Trump administration — is whether the health care law's individual mandate to have health insurance is unconstitutional, since Congress abolished the financial penalty for individuals who do not purchase health insurance in its overhaul of the tax code in 2017. The justices are also tasked with deciding whether the rest of Obamacare can survive if the individual mandate is invalidated.
The result? On Thursday, many of her staunchest critics ended up casting votes for Pelosi.
Senate Majority Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, aims to hold a vote on the legislation before lawmakers leave at the end of next week for the week-long July 4 recess.
We can make our communities safer, our families stronger, our culture richer, our faith deeper, and our middle class bigger and more prosperous than ever before.
Sen. Joe Donnelly is perhaps the most vulnerable Democrat in the Senate this election season. Donnelly is running for re-election in a state Mr. Trump won by nearly 20 percentage points. The Democrat has been nervously hewing to the center in recent months, denouncing recent progressive battle cries like implementing Medicare for All and abolishing U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
My friendship with @SenJohnMcCain is not based on how he votes but respect for how he's lived his life and the person he is. — Lindsey Graham (@LindseyGrahamSC) September 22, 2017

As we speak, large, organized caravans are on the march to the United States. We have just heard that Mexican cities, in order to remove the illegal immigrants from their communities, are getting trucks and buses to bring them up to our country in areas where there is little border protection. I have ordered another 3,750 troops to our southern border to prepare for the tremendous onslaught.
Hillary Clinton's communications director, Jennifer Palmieri, issued a statement on the event.
There's very little decorum left, Scholz says. Everything is going to be a political fight.

Supporters of the law immediately said they would appeal. California Attorney General Xavier Becerra expressed confidence that the ruling could be overturned, saying the ACA has already survived more than 70 unsuccessful repeal attempts and withstood scrutiny in the Supreme Court.
I apologize to my family and I certainly apologize to the American people, added Trump, who then started talking about ISIS.
Clinton said she would save what works and what's good about Obamacare and provide additional help to small businesses.
And to me, it means one of two things; either he doesn't regard you that seriously, that you need a 'gotta cut her down' nickname, or that he has some respect for you.

As a candidate for President, I pledged a new approach. Great nations do not fight endless wars.
While Mr. Trump invested no small degree of political capital in the Louisiana and Kentucky only to watch Republicans come up short, neither deep-red state is expected to be competitive in 2020's presidential race. Still, national parties are looking for takeaways from Saturday's result.
We have unleashed a revolution in American energy — the United States is now the number one producer of oil and natural gas in the world. And now, for the first time in 65 years, we are a net exporter of energy.
There has never been so many lies, so much deception, he said.
Despite Blackburn's Trumpworld cred, the race remains competitive. Bredesen's campaign recently released an ad highlighting praise that he received from Republicans when he was governor. Blackburn is trying to make the election a referendum on Trump, a strategy which may not work in her favor.
Another historic trade blunder was the catastrophe known as NAFTA.
VIA CBS NEWS CAMPAIGN REPORTER TIM PERRY Heading into the debate, Kamala Harris has seen a sharp decline in her poll numbers and has had to make major layoffs and changes with her staff. When asked how she plans to prepare for such a crucial debate, Harris jokingly said prayer, but added, I'm going to just be present.
Polling has shown the race to be close, with Scott leading Nelson by 3 percentage points in a CBS News poll from July. Florida is one of the states where a loss would be devastating for Democrats, as it would widen the narrow gap between the current majority and minority in the Senate.
I didn't downplay it. I actually in many ways up-played it in action, the president told the voter who asked him why he would downplay a pandemic that is known to disproportionately harm low-income families and minority communities.
Senate Majority Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, aims to hold a vote on the legislation before lawmakers leave at the end of next week for the week-long July 4 recess.
During a question and answer period following Romney's address, he said the Massachusetts law wasn't perfect, adding that there were a number of things the state could have done differently. But he said he was proud that he signed a law that helped get residents insured and was in the interest of the people of Massachusetts.

Mr. Trump, who has not followed through on a pledge in July that he would have a health care plan ready and signed in two weeks, said his administration would not get rid of the preexisting conditions coverage that were implemented by the Affordable Care Act. He was responding to Ellesia Blaque, an assistant professor who lives in Philadelphia, who told him she's paying $7,000 a year for life-saving medicine because of a condition she was born with, sarcoidosis.
And in Michigan, where Democrat Gretchen Whitmer defeated incumbent Gov. Rick Snyder, Republicans put forth proposals to give the legislature authority in legal fights and to create a commission to oversee the state's campaign finance laws, according to the Detroit News. The moves come nearly two years after the Republican legislature in North Carolina made similar efforts, some of which are being challenged in court, to lessen the power of Democrat Roy Cooper, after he narrowly defeated GOP incumbent Gov. Pat McCrory.
And Senator Kamala Harris announced Monday that she will be spending Thanksgiving with her family in Iowa. Bidar notes that Harris has spent four days in Iowa this month and is scheduled to spend five days in the Hawkeye state during the week of Thanksgiving. According to the latest CBS News Battleground Tracker, Harris is polling at 5% in Iowa, tied for fifth place with Amy Klobuchar. Harris's campaign says they have knocked on more than 200,000 doors in Iowa since August. Day by day and door by door, we are continuing to grow our network of supporters, volunteers, and precinct leaders that form the heart of our campaign, said Iowa Organizing Director Erin Phillips.
In the 20th century, America saved freedom, transformed science, and redefined the middle class standard of living for the entire world to see. Now, we must step boldly and bravely into the next chapter of this great American adventure, and we must create a new standard of living for the 21st century. An amazing quality of life for all of our citizens is within our reach.
For weeks, reporters pressed him on using the Defense Production Act to ramp up production of much-needed medical supplies before the president took action. He also claimed the virus would go from 15 cases down to zero quickly, and has insisted that the virus will eventually disappear. He has also been slow to embrace social distancing measures and practices like wearing a mask that scientists have encouraged to arrest the spread of COVID-19.
This is a smart, strategic, see-through steel barrier — not just a simple concrete wall. It will be deployed in the areas identified by border agents as having the greatest need, and as these agents will tell you, where walls go up, illegal crossings go way down.
Stephanopoulos pointed out that Dr. Anthony Fauci disagrees with this, but Mr. Trump insisted other doctors like Scott Atlas agree with him.
In a nearly 4-minute long campaign video released Thursday morning titled 7,591 words (a nod to the word count of the U.S. Constitution) Bennet makes the case that politics and governing aren't the same thing.
Here tonight, we have legislators from across this magnificent republic. You have come from the rocky shores of Maine and the volcanic peaks of Hawaii; from the snowy woods of Wisconsin and the red deserts of Arizona; from the green farms of Kentucky and the golden beaches of California. Together, we represent the most extraordinary Nation in all of history.
There are 22 members on the Judiciary Committee — 12 Republicans and 10 Democrats — and each will have their chance to question Barrett directly later in the week.
Conservatives have always been for repealing Obamacare, and my concern is that this doesn't repeal Obamacare, Paul told reporters. What I've seen so far is that it keeps 10 out of 12 regulations, it continues the Obamacare subsidies, and I think ultimately will not bring down premiums, because instead of trying to fix the death spiral of Obamacare, it simply subsidizes it with taxpayer money to insurance companies. So for those reasons, it looks a lot like Obamacare instead of a repeal of Obamacare.
The president has long cited his move to restrict travel from China as one of those actions. But the president was also slower on other needed measures.
Did Crooked Hillary help disgusting (check out sex tape and past) Alicia M become a U.S. citizen so she could use her in the debate? — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 30, 2016
He's talking about destroying your Medicare and destroying your Social Security, and this whole country will come down, the president said.
Today's misguided ruling will not deter us: our coalition will continue to fight in court for the health and wellbeing of all Americans, said Becerra, who is leading a coalition of states defending the ACA.
Mr. Trump said the public option means socialized medicine.
Mfume supports stronger gun-control measures, such as reauthorizing a federal assault weapons ban that expired in 2005. He also is focusing on the root causes of crime, like the inability of young adults to find jobs. He has made health care a priority, particularly lower prescription drug costs.
When Stephanopoulos pointed this out to the president, Mr. Trump responded, Doesn't matter. I have it already, and it's a much better plan for you, and it's a much better plan.
Perhaps we can negotiate a different agreement, adding China and others, or perhaps we can't –- in which case, we will outspend and out-innovate all others by far.
Other Senate Republicans voiced frustration that the process had been too secretive and out of the public eye. Senate Republicans don't intend to hold any committee hearings on the bill, despite their commitment to so-called regular order.
Joining Melania in the gallery this evening is a very brave 10-year-old girl, Grace Eline. Every birthday since she was 4, Grace asked her friends to donate to St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. She did not know that one day she might be a patient herself. Last year, Grace was diagnosed with brain cancer. Immediately, she began radiation treatment. At the same time, she rallied her community and raised more than $40,000 for the fight against cancer. When Grace completed treatment last fall, her doctors and nurses cheered with tears in their eyes as she hung up a poster that read: Last Day of Chemo. Grace — you are an inspiration to us all.
And you'll develop — you'll develop herd — like a herd mentality — it's going to be herd developed — and that's going to happen, the president said Tuesday night. That will all happen. But with a vaccine I think it will go away very quickly. But I really believe we're rounding the corner. And I believe that strongly.
Join me in St. Louis, Missouri - as I conclude my debate prep. Posted by Donald J. Trump on Sunday, October 9, 2016
Donald Trump's longtime adviser Roger Stone said Monday that the GOP presidential nominee should release his tax returns.
Well, in either case it doesn't matter to me, Pelosi laughed. What matters to me is that he recognize that the Congress of the United States is the first branch of government, that we're a co-equal branch of government, and that we represent the people. And that when we go to the table to speak with him, we're respectful of the branch that he represents, the Office of the President. And we want him to be respectful of the branch of government we represent. Co-equal.
Democrats outnumber Republicans by more than 4-1 in the majority-black district, which includes a significant portion of Baltimore, as well as parts of Baltimore and Howard counties.
Know your options. Having a thorough knowledge of your exchange options can help you when it comes to applying for subsidies. Individual exchanges often change their benchmark plans -- those that qualify for government subsidies. If you stay in your plan from the previous year thinking it will still be the benchmark plan, but then the benchmark plan shifts to a different carrier, you may lose your subsidy.
Ending Obamacare could increase Medicare beneficiaries' costs in other ways. The ACA reduced payments to medical providers and private insurers. Reversing that could lead to higher deductibles and copays for Part A, which covers hospital visits, and higher premiums and deductibles for Part B, which covers doctor visits and other outpatient care.
Nonetheless, O'Rourke is a long shot. No Democrat has been elected statewide in Texas in 20 years. As in Arizona, O'Rourke's candidacy is a test of how much demographic changes have shifted a solid Republican state to the left, and whether it's enough to elect a Democrat.
Peter Bronson was in South Florida on vacation from New York. He drove down from Deerfield Beach to voice his concerns over the Trump administration.
9:04 p.m. ET Moderators CNN's Anderson Cooper and ABC News' Martha Raddatz are kicking off the debate now.
She went on to say that Trump has insulted women and members of other communities throughout the campaign.
Let us work together to build a culture that cherishes innocent life. And let us reaffirm a fundamental truth: all children — born and unborn — are made in the holy image of God.
My Administration has cut more regulations in a short time than any other administration during its entire tenure. Companies are coming back to our country in large numbers thanks to historic reductions in taxes and regulations.
Clinton went even further, arguing that Sanders' plan would empower Republican governors to eliminate health insurance for low-income and middle-income Americans.
Here is what to expect for Barrett's confirmation hearings:
But going toe-to-toe in a televised standoff with the president may have helped seal the deal. She corrected the president – Please don't characterize the strength that I bring to this meeting as the leader of the House Democrats, who just won a big victory – and she left that meeting in shades and a flaming red power coat, making her a social media celebrity.
To build on our incredible economic success, one priority is paramount — reversing decades of calamitous trade policies.

Some people raised signs that said Not My President, while others held up a large American flag. Protester Reg Brookings warned the crowd that Trump is trying to divide the country by making such groups as immigrants the enemy.
The Obama administration, he said, citing the health care law, fundamentally doesn't believe in that American experiment. The administration distrusts the idea that states are where the power of government resides, he added.
If the law is invalidated, it could scrap other well-liked sections of the law, such as the part that allows parents to keep young adult children on their health care coverage until age 26.

9:58 p.m. ET Anderson Cooper asked Trump if it was true that he posted a $916 million loss in his 1995 tax returns and he seemed to admit that he did, explaining that a lot of my write-off was depreciation.
With polls showing the Democratic race tightening in the crucial leadoff states of Iowa and New Hampshire, Chelsea Clinton on Tuesday took aim at Bernie Sanders -- her mother's chief rival for the nomination -- saying that Sanders would dismantle the health care system as we know it.
I wouldn't do it if I didn't think I had a chance to win, Bennet, the 22nd Democrat to enter the race, told The Colorado Independent shortly after his diagnosis. I think, like everyone else does, it's a long shot. But I think everyone in the field is a long shot.
We are going to respect one another, lift each other up, said Clinton, who added that she will be looking for ways to embrace diversity.
Speaker Pelosi ushered in a new era of divided government in the midst of a government shutdown – 800,000 federal government employees furloughed or working without pay, national parks and museums closed.

When McCain announced he had brain cancer in July 2017, the revelation rocked Washington, D.C. — but it particularly touched Graham. It was Graham who, after being on the phone with McCain, broke the news to a meeting of fellow senators discussing health care.
Graham, who leads the committee, publicly refused to take a COVID-19 test when challenged by his Democratic opponent last week to do so.
When American soldiers set out beneath the dark skies over the English Channel in the early hours of D-Day, 1944, they were just young men of 18 and 19, hurtling on fragile landing craft toward the most momentous battle in the history of war.

It wasn't a matter of if, but more like how much. Health care analysts and actuaries have been predicting for weeks now that Affordable Care Act exchange members would likely see premium increases for 2017 around 10 percent on average.
While Democrats have few procedural tools at their disposal to block Barrett's nomination, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer on Sunday vowed to deny Republicans the quorum needed for a vote by the Judiciary Committee and on the Senate floor.

Just what kind of health insurance do federal judges and Supreme Court justices have?
He is loyal to his friends, said an emotional Graham, fighting tears. He loves his country. And if he has to stand up to his party for his country, so be it. He would die for his country. I love him to death.
Scott raised $22 million in his first quarter as a candidate for Senate, with $8 million of those funds coming from individual contributions, while Nelson raised $4.4 million in the second quarter. Scott is also extremely wealthy, and could potentially pour millions of his own funds into his campaign in the final stretch of the race.
With no penalty, there's no tax, the plaintiffs, a coalition of Republican-led states, argued in the Texas case. The plaintiffs also argued that the individual mandate is so essential to the entire law, so that if it's unconstitutional, the rest of the law must also be thrown out. U.S. District Court Judge Reed O'Connor agreed on that point, too.

In the two abortion cases she was involved in during her tenure on the 7th Circuit, she joined the dissent in ruling to deny requests for the the full appeals court to rehear disputes.
Democrat Governor John Bel Edwards will be the first Democrat governor to win reelection in Louisiana since 1975, after defeating Republican Eddie Rispone by just over one percent on Saturday. And after almost two days of no public acknowledgement from Mr. Trump's Twitter account, Edwards spokesperson Eric Holl told CBS News political unit broadcast associate Aaron Navarro the president called to congratulate Edwards in private. At his election night watch party, CBS News political unit associate producer Sarah Ewall-Wice reports Edwards only mentioned Trump briefly in his remarks: You didn't just vote for me, you voted for four more years of putting Louisiana first...And as for the president, God bless his heart.
But recall the biggest difference: Feds have dramatically more choices than most employees or people shopping the ACA marketplaces for coverage.
My plan is to run for president, Bennet told CBS This Morning co-anchor John Dickerson. I think this country faces two enormous challenges, one is a lack of economic mobility and opportunity for most Americans and the other is the need to restore integrity to our government.
If the U.S. Supreme Court throws out the Affordable Care Act, your finances and your future could pay the price.
How do you stop the descending spiral? says Wisconsin Democratic strategist Joe Zepecki. Every two years this just gets worse and worse...what you're seeing is more behavior in state legislatures and at the state level that is similar to what we're seeing in Congress.
That's funny, isn't it? she laughed. Sadly, I was hoping that we would have an American woman president just two years ago.
10:21 p.m. ET Trump is asked if his recent tweet referring a sex tape involving former Miss Universe Alicia Machado shows that he has strong discipline, but he seemed to deny talking about one and then talked about Clinton's role as secretary of state during the 2012 Benghazi attack.
Are we going to have religious tests when people fly into our country? Clinton said, adding that what Trump has said was extremely unwise and dangerous.
In June, when close to half a million Americans had lost health insurance through their employer due to the economic shutdown brought on by the pandemic, the Trump administration urged the Supreme Court to overturn the Affordable Care Act, which authorized Obamacare. By August, the number of Americans who had lost their health insurance jumped to six million — or, at least 12 million when spouses and children are taken into account, according to research from the Economic Policy Institute.
Well, we will talk about what we talked about in the campaign for the people: Lower healthcare costs by reducing the cost of prescription drugs and preserving pre-existing condition benefit; building bigger paychecks by building the infrastructure of America.
9:29 p.m. ET An uncommitted Missouri voter asked what the candidates will do to bring the cost down of healthcare and make costs better. Clinton and Trump argued over who would answer first. Trump said, I'm a gentleman, and he let Clinton answer first.

San Diego used to have the most illegal border crossings in the country. In response, and at the request of San Diego residents and political leaders, a strong security wall was put in place. This powerful barrier almost completely ended illegal crossings.
Manchin has made his reputation as a conservative Democrat, voting to confirm Justice Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court in 2017 and Gina Haspel as director of the Central Intelligence Agency in 2018. He is a major target of Republican efforts to get vulnerable Democrats to vote for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh. Manchin hasn't ruled out voting for Mr. Trump in 2020.
Supreme Court to hear legal challenge to Affordable Care Act The U.S. Supreme Court will take up a legal challenge to the Affordable Care Act. At issue in the case is the constitutionality of the law's individual mandate. The justices will hear the case in October, meaning it is likely to become a major issue during the presidential campaign. CBS News chief legal correspondent Jan Crawford joins CBSN with more.
As a candidate for President, I pledged a new approach. Great nations do not fight endless wars.
Democratic Sen. Heidi Heitkamp is a major target for national Republicans, although she has a relatively close relationship with Mr. Trump for a Democrat. Heitkamp was considered for a cabinet position, and has sat next to the president at bill-signings and ridden on Air Force One. Mr. Trump once called her a good woman. Heitkamp released an ad touting her bipartisanship, noting that she voted over half the time in line with Mr. Trump's policies.
The president is encouraging lack of empathy. Like, lack of empathy, lack of respect, Karen Clodfelter said.
But if the Supreme Court finds the individual mandate unconstitutional and rules the rest of Obamacare cannot stand without the provision, Mr. Trump said he would put forth a brand new, beautiful health care plan — without offering any specifics.
Washington — The federal health insurance marketplace, Healthcare.gov, reopened Monday for a special enrollment period that will run through mid-May as part of efforts by President Biden to ensure that Americans in need of insurance coverage during the coronavirus pandemic have access to health care.
The border city of El Paso, Texas, used to have extremely high rates of violent crime — one of the highest in the country, and considered one of our Nation's most dangerous cities. Now, with a powerful barrier in place, El Paso is one of our safest cities.
So, they have to undermine. But that doesn't bother me. That's their problem.
Before the ACA, insurers routinely used preexisting health conditions as a reason to deny coverage or charge people more for their insurance premiums. Preexisting conditions typically included serious ailments such as cancer or heart disease as well as more common conditions such as high cholesterol, high blood pressure, asthma, diabetes and obesity, and even temporary conditions including pregnancy. Insurers denied about 1 in 5 applications for individual policies because of preexisting conditions, and some employer-provided group policies required people to wait up to a year before their preexisting conditions were covered.
That question seems fair to ask in light of U.S. District Judge Reed O'Connor's ruling on Friday striking down the Affordable Care Act -- the 2010 law passed under President Barack Obama that expanded health insurance to millions of Americans -- as unconstitutional. O'Connor's decision looks certain to be appealed by a group of Democratic state attorneys general, first to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit and then likely to the Supreme Court.
In an interview on 610 WIOD Miami radio's Fernand Amandi Show, Stone was asked if Trump is making a mistake by not releasing his returns.
Mr. Trump nominated Barrett, a judge on the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, to succeed the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg on the Supreme Court last month. If Barrett, 48, is confirmed, she will be Mr. Trump's third appointment, and her addition to the nation's highest court will expand its conservative majority to 6-3.
In June, I commuted Alice's sentence — and she is here with us tonight. Alice, thank you for reminding us that we always have the power to shape our own destiny.
Buttigieg specifically asked Warren if her plan would increase taxes on middle class families, which the Massachusetts Senator has been loath to admit. Your signature senator is to have a plan for everything, except this, Buttigieg said at the last debate.
That's a shame, Trump said, but he added that, There is a problem.
To ensure this corrupt dictatorship never acquires nuclear weapons, I withdrew the United States from the disastrous Iran nuclear deal. And last fall, we put in place the toughest sanctions ever imposed on a country.
Still, Republicans hope to hold a final vote to confirm Barrett in the last week of October.
He shared the statement via a Facebook live feed.

Sanders said President Trump is calling on Congress to pass a measure that would replace the Affordable Care Act, which is also known as Obamacare. Mr. Trump, who campaigned on repealing the ACA, said in a tweet that Congress must act.
Several senators are already expressing concerns about the proposal.
Still, it might be more instructive if federal judges give a little thought to why their health insurance option works so well. That's primarily because federal employees are a large, diversified pool of patients, with varying ages, demographics and health care needs. Such a pool helps insurers spread risk among young, healthy participants and those who are older or have more health care needs. The large pool also helps the government negotiate with insurers to keep costs down.
Pence urged Pennsylvania voters to turn out at the polls next month. He argued that with Saccone in office, Congress would end budget cuts to the nation's armed forces and would pass funding to build a border wall.
I respect his children, Clinton said, adding that it says a lot about Trump. I don't agree with nearly anything else he does or says.
In 2018, when the 7th Circuit weighed whether the full court should rehear a case involving a challenge to an Indiana abortion law that requires fetal remains to be cremated or buried after an abortion, Barrett joined a dissent from the denial of rehearing en banc authored by Judge Frank Easterbrook. In his dissent, Easterbrook took issue with a panel decision striking down a different statute that prohibits abortion based on sex, race or disability.
10:07 p.m. ET Trump said that Clinton talks tough about Russia and the U.S. nuclear program has fallen way behind.

Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, said in a statement that he needs to carefully review the text first, but would prefer to address health care reform in a bipartisan manner, accusing Democrats of being unwilling to negotiate with Republicans.
Other stars just wanted to talk about Clinton's white pantsuit.
Clinton said back in June, she said Trump was not fit to be president and commander in chief.
He has a more direct approach to politics and policies and how he handles things, and from what I've seen, he seems to care about the issues of Baltimore city, which is something that we desperately need, Baylor said.
In addition, consumers should be willing to drop a metal level to save money, advised Dillon. According to his calculations, consumers can save approximately 15 percent in premium costs by shifting from gold to silver, or from silver to bronze plans. Such a drop will likely mean more out-of-pocket costs, so based on your health care needs, you'll have to calculate if the savings on premiums in exchange for higher out-of-pocket costs makes sense.
We virtually ended the estate, or death, tax on small businesses, ranches, and family farms.
The November election will test McCaskill's luck, and her campaigning skills.
President Biden was clear: we need to strengthen the Affordable Care Act and give more Americans access to health care, especially during this pandemic, which has further demonstrated the importance of having the right coverage, Health and Human Services Acting Secretary Norris Cochran said in a statement.
Mr. Biden vowed during the 2020 presidential campaign to preserve and expand the Affordable Care Act, which he helped shepherd through Congress while serving as vice president. In addition to the special enrollment period, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services announced Friday it is launching an education campaign that begins today focusing on increasing awareness of the added time to sign up for coverage, as well as the assistance available to those who qualify to pay for premiums.
Although Barrett is expected to garner support from most, if not all, 53 Republican senators, most Democrats will likely oppose her confirmation. Barrett has only been on the federal bench for three years, but she has conservative bona fides and credits the late Justice Antonin Scalia with shaping her judicial philosophy.
I would not use American ground forces in Syria, Clinton said. I think that would be a very serious mistake. I don't think that American troops should be holding territory, which is what they would have to do as an occupying force. I don't think that would be a smart strategy.
So, you have to remind him of that periodically?
He and I haven't spoken, and I disagree, Trump said.
Currently, there's a $19 trillion gap, give or take, between what Sen. Sanders has proposed and how he's articulated paying for those proposals, Clinton said. So that, to me, is troubling.
I have also accelerated our negotiations to reach a political settlement in Afghanistan. Our troops have fought with unmatched valor — and thanks to their bravery, we are now able to pursue a political solution to this long and bloody conflict.
We must be united at home to defeat our adversaries abroad.
Republicans have argued that the law doesn't work and promised to override the veto next year.
Inspired by stories like Alice's, my Administration worked closely with members of both parties to sign the First Step Act into law. This legislation reformed sentencing laws that have wrongly and disproportionately harmed the African-American community. The First Step Act gives non-violent offenders the chance to re-enter society as productive, law-abiding citizens. Now, States across the country are following our lead. America is a Nation that believes in redemption.
Mr. Trump, who typically forgoes wearing a mask himself, said there are a lot of people who think that masks are not good. A voter had asked why he doesn't wear a mask more often himself and why he hasn't imposed a national mask mandate.
We meet tonight at a moment of unlimited potential. As we begin a new Congress, I stand here ready to work with you to achieve historic breakthroughs for all Americans.
BET noted that the uncommitted African Americans who asked Mr. Trump questions at the Philadelphia town hall did not seem convinced by his answers on a range of topics from health care to inequality. Blaque, the voter suffering from sarcoidosis, told CNN later that the president did not answer her question, and she's now decided who's getting her vote.
Tuesday is the last day to sign up for Obamacare in 36 states, while another 14 and Washington, D.C. have later dates. The federal health insurance program — accessible at healthcare.gov — has seen a crush of signups as the open enrollment deadline approaches, and coronavirus cases continue to surge.
Barrett has written that abortion is always amoral, and in 2006, she signed on to an anti-abortion newspaper advertisement that opposed abortion on demand. In 2013, Barrett's name also appeared in an advertisement sponsored by the group University Faculty for Life, which said we affirm our full support for our university's commitment to the right to life.
The Trump administration and a group of Republican attorneys general have asked that the entire law be thrown out. The Supreme Court is scheduled to hear oral arguments on November 10 and could issue a ruling as late as June 2021.
Biden's own proposal calls for building on the Affordable Care Act and for increasing the value of tax credits to lower premiums for Americans. Biden's plan would also offer coverage premium-free to individuals who would qualify under Medicaid expansion, but whose states have chosen not to expand Medicaid.
President Trump signed an executive order in September announcing a steadfast commitment to always protecting individuals with preexisting conditions, but the order alone can't force insurers to offer coverage if the ACA is struck down.
In April, Conway told CNN that she'd like see Trump's returns become transparent, but in multiple interviews on Sunday, she said he shouldn't while they remain under audit.
A second Holocaust survivor who is here tonight, Joshua Kaufman, was a prisoner at Dachau Concentration Camp. He remembers watching through a hole in the wall of a cattle car as American soldiers rolled in with tanks. To me, Joshua recalls, the American soldiers were proof that God exists, and they came down from the sky.
Over 915,000 people signed up for Obamacare from November 29 to December 5, the fifth week of open enrollment and most recent data released by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services' weekly enrollment snapshot. That's nearly double the week prior, when 523,020 people selected plans, which itself was about a 50% increase from the same time period last year.
WASHINGTON, DC - JULY 26: U.S. Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) (L), who was recently diagnosed with brain cancer, and Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) head for the Senate Floor for a vote at the U.S. Capitol July 26, 2017 in Washington, DC. GOP efforts to pass legislation to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, were dealt setbacks when a mix of conservative and moderate Republican senators joined Democrats to oppose procedural measures on the bill.

Asked again if the Muslim ban is no longer his proposal, Trump said, It's called extreme vetting.
Like any employer offering health insurance, the federal government pays a good portion of employees' premiums. Except for some negotiated union contracts with postal workers, the feds generally pay about 72 percent of premium costs. But that's less than the average 80 percent that private sector employers kick in.
But while the president has claimed he would protect preexisting conditions, his administration has been trying to kill the Affordable Care Act in the courts.
When McCain cast the deciding vote against legislation Graham introduced to overhaul the Affordable Care Act in September 2017, wrecking Republican chances of Obamacare repeal, some questioned whether their friendship would weather the storm. President Trump tweeted McCain had, let his best friend L.G. down! It would be the first of many verbal attacks Mr. Trump would make over McCain's vote in the months ahead.
The Obama administration initially said it wanted to enroll seven million Americans in the new marketplaces by the end of the six-month open enrollment period, aligning its goals with nonpartisan projections about the marketplace's popularity. Yet when the marketplaces opened for enrollment in October, the significant technical problems with HealthCare.gov and some state-based Obamacare websites seriously slowed down the process.
The winner will serve the remainder of Cummings' term into January. The winner also will run as an incumbent in the state's June 2 primary to be his or her party's nominee for a full term. For the upcoming primary, voters also will be strongly urged to vote by mail.
For example, decades ago the United States entered into a treaty with Russia in which we agreed to limit and reduce our missile capabilities. While we followed the agreement to the letter, Russia repeatedly violated its terms. That is why I announced that the United States is officially withdrawing from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, or INF Treaty.
A federal judge in Texas ruled on Friday the entire Affordable Care Act is unconstitutional due to a recent change in federal tax law. The ruling came a day before the December 15 deadline to sign up for 2019 health coverage through the Affordable Care Act's marketplace.
Here tonight, we have legislators from across this magnificent republic. You have come from the rocky shores of Maine and the volcanic peaks of Hawaii; from the snowy woods of Wisconsin and the red deserts of Arizona; from the green farms of Kentucky and the golden beaches of California. Together, we represent the most extraordinary Nation in all of history.
The founders, he said, chose for American power to be grounded in the states, and codified that impulse in the 10th Amendment.
No issue better illustrates the divide between America's working class and America's political class than illegal immigration. Wealthy politicians and donors push for open borders while living their lives behind walls and gates and guards.
Clinton said back in June, she said Trump was not fit to be president and commander in chief.
The next major priority for me, and for all of us, should be to lower the cost of healthcare and prescription drugs — and to protect patients with pre-existing conditions.
Buttigieg specifically asked Warren if her plan would increase taxes on middle class families, which the Massachusetts Senator has been loath to admit. Your signature senator is to have a plan for everything, except this, Buttigieg said at the last debate.
While Mr. Trump invested no small degree of political capital in the Louisiana and Kentucky only to watch Republicans come up short, neither deep-red state is expected to be competitive in 2020's presidential race. Still, national parties are looking for takeaways from Saturday's result.
He's a very confused guy, Biden said. He thinks he's running against somebody else. He's running against Joe Biden. I beat all those other people because I disagree with them.
Not one more American life should be lost because our Nation failed to control its very dangerous border.

But Graham made it clear their friendship was much deeper than politics or any single bill.
Retiring early or starting a business might become too hazardous if your access to health insurance isn't guaranteed. You might have to wait a year before preexisting conditions are covered by an employer's plan. Young adults could be kicked off their parents' policies. Millions of people who buy insurance through the ACA marketplaces or who now qualify for expanded Medicaid coverage funded by Obamacare in many states could lose their coverage as well.
When campaigning never stops, governing never begins, he adds.
Like any employer offering health insurance, the federal government pays a good portion of employees' premiums. Except for some negotiated union contracts with postal workers, the feds generally pay about 72 percent of premium costs. But that's less than the average 80 percent that private sector employers kick in.
The final part of my agenda is to protect America's National Security.
Clinton also said her mother has a plan to pay for her higher-education proposals, unlike Sanders, who proposed free tuition at public colleges and universities. Clinton has also proposed to make tuition at two-year and four-year public universities free.
But if the Supreme Court finds the individual mandate unconstitutional and rules the rest of Obamacare cannot stand without the provision, Mr. Trump said he would put forth a brand new, beautiful health care plan — without offering any specifics.
He is one of my dearest friends in the world, and John McCain can do whatever damn he wants to, he's earned that right, Graham said on CNN during a health care debate the same month.
This disease has never had a more worthy opponent, Graham told reporters following the diagnosis.
Mr. Trump declined to put forth additional details. He has long promised to unveil a replacement for the ACA but has not done so.
And America is a land of preexisting conditions. Half of adults under age 65, or up to 133 million people, had health issues that could cause them to be denied coverage or charged exorbitant premiums, according to a 2017 government analysis.
Think of this Capitol — think of this very chamber, where lawmakers before you voted to end slavery, to build the railroads and the highways, to defeat fascism, to secure civil rights, to face down an evil empire.
Pressed further to say whether he had actually engaged in such behavior, Trump claimed he hasn't.
That was locker room talk. I'm not proud of it. I am a person who has great respect for people, my family, the people of this country, Trump said.
For his part, Mr. Trump criticized the ACA and praised Republicans in Congress for excising the individual mandate from the law. He also said he asked his administration to run [Obamacare] as well as you can, and said the cost of premiums have declined.
Here is a glimpse of their friendship, in photos:
VIA CBS NEWS CAMPAIGN REPORTER ZAK HUDAK Tom Steyer's ad blitzes have kept him on the debate stage, but the billionaire climate activist will likely need earned media to rise above his middle-of-the-road polling numbers. The debate stage is an opportunity for him to tout his status as the earliest candidate to call for Mr. Trump's impeachment. But with campaign scandals in both Iowa and South Carolina since the last debate, Steyer could himself be a target for any opponent looking to score easy points.
That has not been debunked, Trump responded.
Even with Trump's hot-and-cold behavior, Heitkamp is seriously vulnerable.
Over the last 2 years, we have begun to fully rebuild the United States Military — with $700 billion last year and $716 billion this year. We are also getting other nations to pay their fair share. For years, the United States was being treated very unfairly by NATO — but now we have secured a $100 billion increase in defense spending from NATO allies.
How can he keep that momentum rolling in the debate? Essentially, just by maintaining his status quo. His campaign argues that folks at home know Bernie Sanders. They know that his signature policy is Medicare for All. They know that he's 78 years old.
Clinton said that there have been some divisive, dark things said about Muslims. She added that his demagogic behavior is dangerous and his rhetoric plays into the hands of the terrorists.
Trump brought up Clinton's remark from a month ago when she called his supporters deplorable. He said that he would help members of the black community and Hispanic community.
VIA CBS NEWS CAMPAIGN REPORTER BO ERICKSON While Democrats are united in criticizing Mr. Trump for asking the Ukrainian government to investigate the Biden family, it's a much more personal topic for the former vice president.
10:34 p.m. ET The last question came from an uncommitted voter in the audience. He asked the candidates if they can name one positive thing that each respects about the other.
Two weeks ago, the United States officially recognized the legitimate government of Venezuela, and its new interim President, Juan Guaido.
Clinton scooped up several books and a crochet owl hat to bring back to New York before heading over to the Portsmouth Brewery to host her final town hall of the day, where she faced a question about her mother's ties with Wall Street.
It was a friendship that would remain strong to the very end. McCain died on Saturday at 81.
Biden said he would push for a version of the Affordable Care Act that includes a public option, deeming it Bidencare. Biden said his health care proposal would also allow Medicare to negotiate drug prices with insurance companies and reduce premiums.
Since then, she's released significant details on her plans to pay for Medicare for All and get congress to pass it. But that's opened her policies to new scrutiny. With the release of a 3-year plan leading up to a push for the original Medicare for All bill, Warren could face attacks from both her right and her left on where she now stands on health care. But while she walked onto the stage last month as the biggest target in the field, Buttigieg's recent polling surge in Iowa could distract some of the candidates looking for blood. Will her rivals continue to pile-on Warren, or will they move on to other top candidates like Biden and Buttigieg?
That was a great display of presidential leadership, she said.
She added, Four-hundred pieces of legislation have my name on it.
We are going to respect one another, lift each other up, said Clinton, who added that she will be looking for ways to embrace diversity.
Now Congress must pass a STRONG law that provides GREAT healthcare and protects pre-existing conditions. Mitch and Nancy, get it done! he tweeted.
At Wednesday's debate, Biden can be expected to try and turn Mr. Trump's accusations into an advantage. And the former vice president also says that Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un are worried about a potential Biden presidency. North Korean state media recently called Biden a rabid dog, a phrase Biden laughs at.
Simply put, walls work and walls save lives. So let's work together, compromise, and reach a deal that will truly make America safe.
On Wednesday night in Atlanta at the fifth Democratic presidential debate, candidates will likely be asked to respond to comments former President Obama made on Friday cautioning against radical change. During an interview with Stacey Abrams, Mr. Obama said, This is still a country that is less revolutionary than it is interested in improvement. They like seeing things improved, but the average American doesn't think we have to completely tear down the system and remake it.
By highlighting both Mr. Trump's request to Ukraine and the barbs from foreign adversaries—whom he calls thugs—Biden underscores his foreign policy experience, which he sees as a key selling point to voters. Having spent much of the last 50 years as a powerful lawmaker steeped in foreign policy discussions, he says he knows intimately what makes leaders like Kim and Putin tick. Will he proactively start contrasting this record with the other Democrats?
That was a mistake. I take responsibility for using a personal email account. Obviously if I were to do it over again, I would not, she said. I am very sorry about that.
We are honored to be joined tonight by Tom Wibberley, whose son, Navy Seaman Craig Wibberley, was one of the 17 sailors we tragically lost. Tom: we vow to always remember the heroes of the USS Cole.
The Republican-controlled Senate is charging ahead with Barrett's confirmation at a pace that is uncharacteristic of the upper chamber, as they and Mr. Trump want her confirmed before the general election on November 3. But Democrats are casting Barrett's nomination as illegitimate, citing the proximity to Election Day.
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-New York, noted that the president had asked for a bill with more heart than the House bill, but this bill, Schumer said, is every bit as bad as the House version and maybe meaner. The way this bill cuts health care is heartless, he said on the floor.
But the dispute before the justices this term raises different issues than the 2012 legal challenge to Obamacare, making it more difficult to discern how Barrett may rule.
Sen. Dean Heller is widely considered the most vulnerable senator in the majority and is the only Republican senator seeking re-election in a state that Hillary Clinton won in 2016. Although he avoided a potentially tricky primary with Mr. Trump's help, his close ties with the president and his agenda could be fatal to his campaign. In 2017, Heller co-sponsored a bill to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, which would have reportedly cost Nevada $250 million in federal health care funding. Heller said in August that Republicans made a big mistake by tackling Obamacare as their first major legislative move with Trump in office.
While Pete Buttigieg continues to surge in the polls, Harris took her first jab at the South Bend mayor when asked about reports of his campaign using a stock photograph of a Kenyan woman on his website to promote a plan targeted at African Americans. Though Harris laughed at the report, she warned that the Democratic nominee must have to have the ability to unify the party and the country, and added and you can't unify folks if you don't understand who they are and their specific needs and the right that they have to be represented based not on a stock photograph, but [on] who they actually are. Is this the sign of more attacks to come in the surging mayor's direction?
Polling has shown the race to be close, with Scott leading Nelson by 3 percentage points in a CBS News poll from July. Florida is one of the states where a loss would be devastating for Democrats, as it would widen the narrow gap between the current majority and minority in the Senate.
Back then, many people who had health issues — or whose family members did — avoided changing jobs, starting businesses or retiring early because of the risk they couldn't find affordable health insurance.
In Washington, D.C., several hundred demonstrated. Dozens gathered around the fountain in Dupont Circle chanting Dump Trump and Love, not hate: That's what makes America great.
VIA CBS NEWS POLITICAL UNIT ASSOCIATE PRODUCER BEN MITCHELL While Andrew Yang's poll numbers continue to hover somewhere between 2% and 4% in the early states, the campaign insists they're exactly where they want to be right now. Yang is still bringing in plenty of donations, his campaign is hiring new people every week and voters are still getting to know him, campaign staffer argue, which leaves room for growth. They also point to other campaigns that are hemorrhaging support and money.
At first glance, I have serious concerns about the bill's impact on the Nevadans who depend on Medicaid. I will read it, share it with Governor Sandoval, and continue to listen to Nevadans to determine the bill's impact on our state, said Sen. Dean Heller, R-Nevada, in a statement. Heller is up for re-election next year and is considered by Democrats to be one of the most vulnerable Republicans.
Ending Obamacare could increase Medicare beneficiaries' costs in other ways. The ACA reduced payments to medical providers and private insurers. Reversing that could lead to higher deductibles and copays for Part A, which covers hospital visits, and higher premiums and deductibles for Part B, which covers doctor visits and other outpatient care.
This fall she even faced a revolt from members of her own party, who called for a new generation of Democratic leaders to take on President Trump.
There are five planks in Romney's proposal. The first is to give more power to states through Medicaid block grants, more flexibility in dealing with the ill and uninsured and limits on federal standards.
While many insurers have put in requests to raise premiums, a lot of marketplaces have new entrants that are offering competitive or below-market rates. That's why it's so important to shop the exchanges every open-enrollment period.
The 142-page measure would provide tax credits, based on income, age and geography, which would make more money available to lower income recipients to help them buy insurance. This differs from the House bill, which tied its tax credits to age. Obamacare taxes would be repealed under the bill. The Senate bill would provide for expanded tax-free Health Savings Accounts, and it would also eliminate federal funding for Planned Parenthood.
Now, though, the fate of an estimated 20 million Americans covered under the ACA lies in the hands of these well-covered judges. Judge O'Connor's Friday ruling that the ACA is unconstitutional came in response to a lawsuit filed earlier this year by a group of Republican governors and state attorneys general.
Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, called it a good proposal overall, but that there's a lot to absorb.
Since the video of Trump making lewd comments in 2005 surfaced Friday, many Republicans have either condemned their nominee, withdrawn their endorsements or called for him to drop out of the race to allow Mike Pence to take over. Trump released a video late Friday attempting to apologize for his comments, but it didn't go far enough for many Republicans.

Plus, with an annual salary of $255,300 for associate Supreme Court justices, this elite group of jurists likely doesn't feel the pain of out-of-pocket costs as much as the average ACA recipient.

Garland's failed confirmation in 2016 is providing the backdrop for Barrett's nomination fight. While Democrats say voters should have a voice in choosing the president who fills Ginsburg's seat, Republicans argue this vacancy is different from the fight in 2016, as the same party controls the Senate and the White House.
Health care is a right, not a privilege — and I will do everything in my power to ensure that all Americans have access to the quality, affordable health care they deserve, Mr. Biden said in a statement. That is especially critical in the midst of a deadly pandemic that has already taken the lives of more than 470,000 of our fellow Americans and infected more than one out of every 12 additional Americans, often with devastating consequences to their health.
Republican lawmakers have pushed many repeal measures since 2010, when Obama signed the health care program into law. This was the first of those bills to clear Congress and reach his desk.
Tonight, we are also joined by Pittsburgh survivor Judah Samet. He arrived at the synagogue as the massacre began. But not only did Judah narrowly escape death last fall — more than seven decades ago, he narrowly survived the Nazi concentration camps. Today is Judah's 81st birthday. Judah says he can still remember the exact moment, nearly 75 years ago, after 10 months in a concentration camp, when he and his family were put on a train, and told they were going to another camp. Suddenly the train screeched to a halt. A soldier appeared. Judah's family braced for the worst. Then, his father cried out with joy: It's the Americans.

Now is the time for bipartisan action. Believe it or not, we have already proven that it is possible.
Other stars praised Clinton for exercising restraint, while criticizing Trump for seeming tense.
As Congress becomes increasingly mired in gridlock, states have become increasingly empowered and motivated to act on issues of national importance. And more state legislatures have fallen under one-party control; After the 2018 midterm elections, only one state -- Minnesota -- has a divided legislature. Democrats control 19 legislatures while Republicans control 30. And after Democrats made gains in governorships via November's elections, 13 states have one party controlling the executive and the other in charge of the legislature.
Wages are rising at the fastest pace in decades, and growing for blue collar workers, who I promised to fight for, faster than anyone else. Nearly 5 million Americans have been lifted off food stamps. The United States economy is growing almost twice as fast today as when I took office, and we are considered far and away the hottest economy anywhere in the world. Unemployment has reached the lowest rate in half a century. African-American, Hispanic-American and Asian-American unemployment have all reached their lowest levels ever recorded. Unemployment for Americans with disabilities has also reached an all-time low. More people are working now than at any time in our history –- 157 million.
In addition, consumers should be willing to drop a metal level to save money, advised Dillon. According to his calculations, consumers can save approximately 15 percent in premium costs by shifting from gold to silver, or from silver to bronze plans. Such a drop will likely mean more out-of-pocket costs, so based on your health care needs, you'll have to calculate if the savings on premiums in exchange for higher out-of-pocket costs makes sense.
Health care is a right, not a privilege — and I will do everything in my power to ensure that all Americans have access to the quality, affordable health care they deserve, Mr. Biden said in a statement.

With the House impeachment hearings in full force, Biden has continued to defend himself and his son, Hunter, from the Trump administration's allegations of wrongdoing in Ukraine. The keen interest the administration has taken in the Bidens is now a main topic of the former vice president's trail speeches, where it is cited as proof that the president thinks Biden would be his toughest general election opponent.

In 1997, Alice was sentenced to life in prison as a first-time non-violent drug offender. Over the next two decades, she became a prison minister, inspiring others to choose a better path. She had a big impact on that prison population — and far beyond.
But public medical experts think this strain of coronavirus may be here to stay.
Phoenix-area Rep. Kyrsten Sinema, the likely Democratic nominee, has tried to carve a niche as a more moderate Democrat. According to FiveThirtyEight, Sinema votes in line with President Trump's policies around 60 percent of the time. She is also a member of Democrats' Blue Dog Coalition, a group of more moderate congressional Democrats. However, local Democrats see Sinema as the party's best chance of taking a still-red state.
Republican Gov. Rick Scott, who is prevented from seeking a third term due to term limits, is challenging Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson in one of the country's most contentious races. State and national Democrats are concerned about the prospects of victory for Nelson, who has been in office since 2001.

Democrats have raised concerns that, if confirmed to the Supreme Court, Barrett would vote to overturn the ACA. She has previously criticized Chief Justice John Roberts' 2012 ruling upholding the law. During her confirmation hearings last week, Barrett declined to weigh in on the constitutionality of the law, since there is a case on the ACA is pending before the Supreme Court.
According to CMS, about 8.3 million people enrolled or were automatically re-enrolled in the program during the 2020 open enrollment period, over 2 million of whom were new consumers. And, as of June 2019, 14 million people who were made newly eligible for coverage under the ACA's Medicaid expansion, adopted by 39 states, enrolled in coverage, according to data from the Kaiser Family Foundation.
WASHINGTON, DC - JULY 26: U.S. Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) (L), who was recently diagnosed with brain cancer, and Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) head for the Senate Floor for a vote at the U.S. Capitol July 26, 2017 in Washington, DC.

7:30 p.m. ET The second general election debate between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump is slated to kick off in about 90 minutes on the campus of Washington Unviersity in St. Louis, Missouri.
Today, their street has recovered and the Jenkins would like to see more black-owned businesses.
But GOP Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald acknowledged the political underpinnings at play. We trusted Scott Walker and the administration to be able to manage the back and forth with the Legislature. We don't trust Tony Evers right now in a lot of these areas, he told a conservative radio host.
A month after longtime Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker lost his re-election bid to Democrat Tony Evers, Republican lawmakers moved forward with legislation to curb his successor's power over a key economic development agency and over state litigation, including a lawsuit over Obamacare. The measure, which will be voted on Tuesday, would also limit early voting to two weeks. Another proposal to move the date of the 2020 presidential primary, so as not to coincide with the re-election of a conservative state supreme court justice, did not advance out of committee.
We are now making it clear to China that after years of targeting our industries, and stealing our intellectual property, the theft of American jobs and wealth has come to an end.
Today's misguided ruling will not deter us: our coalition will continue to fight in court for the health and wellbeing of all Americans, said Becerra, who is leading a coalition of states defending the ACA.
Nancy Pelosi capped her unlikely comeback this past week surrounded by children. The California Democrat was elected, once again, the Speaker of the United States House of Representatives, and become the most powerful woman in American history.
Biden pushed back, though, and stressed he split from the Democratic presidential candidates who supported Medicare for All, including his running mate Senator Kamala Harris, who was his rival in the Democratic primaries.
Republicans need a simple majority to pass it, rather than a supermajority since they're using the budget reconciliation process. They may still have to rely on Vice President Mike Pence to cast a tie-breaking vote. The Senate currently has 52 Republicans and 48 Democrats. That means if all Democrats vote against the bill, only three no votes from Republicans can torpedo it. Even if Republicans are successful in getting it through the upper chamber, they would then still need to reconcile it with version passed by the House in early May, reach a bicameral agreement with House Republicans, and hold votes in the House and Senate on that version again.
In Miami, protesters voiced their frustration.
The incumbent is facing Democratic Rep. Jacky Rosen, who was first elected in 2016 in a district that Mr. Trump won. However, Rosen lacks name recognition across the state. Early polling shows a tight race, with different polls showing either candidate ahead by one percentage point or less.
Well, I had never heard the expression, 'Get a life,' but then I did! she laughed.
Tuesday is the last day to sign up for Obamacare in 36 states, while another 14 and Washington, D.C. have later dates. The federal health insurance program — accessible at healthcare.gov — has seen a crush of signups as the open enrollment deadline approaches, and coronavirus cases continue to surge.
Washington — The Senate Judiciary Committee is set to convene Monday for the first day of confirmation hearings for Judge Amy Coney Barrett, President Trump's nominee to the Supreme Court, in what is expected to be a fiercely partisan battle over the future of the high court.
She has such a complex and nuanced plan, Clinton said after referencing her mother's record from when she was a New York senator. That's why Paul Krugman and others have said hers goes the farthest to regulate and rein in Wall Street and to increase the chance that we will never have 2008 ever again.
In downtown Los Angeles, thousands gathered outside city hall chanting Love, not hate, makes America great, reports CBSLA's Margaret Carrero.
The Obama administration initially said it wanted to enroll seven million Americans in the new marketplaces by the end of the six-month open enrollment period, aligning its goals with nonpartisan projections about the marketplace's popularity. Yet when the marketplaces opened for enrollment in October, the significant technical problems with HealthCare.gov and some state-based Obamacare websites seriously slowed down the process.
CBS News political unit associate producer Eleanor Watson says several of the candidates were asked about this over the weekend but did not bite.
Premium increases are also expected to hit employer-sponsored plans in 2017, but employers often offset those rises by passing on the costs to employees in the form of higher deductibles, co-pays and other out-of-pocket payments.
Democrats were able to retake the House in large part because they campaigned on health care issues, warning that Republicans would try to strip away some of the more popular provisions of the ACA, such as protection for pre-existing conditions. Around 130 million people in the United States have pre-existing conditions, and without the ACA, insurers would no longer be required to cover those conditions.
7:35 p.m. ET Donald Trump just delivered a pre-debate statement with women who have accused President Bill Clinton of sexual assault or rape including Juanita Broaddrick. Full story to come on CBSNews.com.
As we work to defend our people's safety, we must also ensure our economic resurgence continues at a rapid pace.
This isn't a zero sum world that we live in, her, partner John Shepherd, said of what he hopes Republicans will understand. And it doesn't have to be that way, yet it seems as though it is. If I have a primary motivator it's that everyone's lives should be better. Not just mine – everyone's.
Menendez won his primary with only 62 percent of the vote against a primary candidate who barely campaigned. Menendez will probably prevail against Republican Bob Hugin, but the margin of victory may be smaller than expected, depending on how many people cast a protest vote. Hugin has also injected over $15 million in his own campaign.
To help support working parents, the time has come to pass school choice for America's children. I am also proud to be the first President to include in my budget a plan for nationwide paid family leave — so that every new parent has the chance to bond with their newborn child.
Romney said that our plan was a state solution to a state problem, and his is a power grab by the federal government to put in a one sized fits all plan across the nation.
That was locker room talk. I'm not proud of it. I am a person who has great respect for people, my family, the people of this country, Trump said.
However, the president has repeatedly said he wants the court to overturn the law. Barrett is expected to be confirmed by the Senate next week, giving conservatives a 6-3 majority on the court.
Just what kind of health insurance do federal judges and Supreme Court justices have?
I understand the tax code better than anyone who's ever run for president, he said. I pay tax and I pay federal tax, too.

VIA CBS NEWS CAMPAIGN REPORTER CARA KORTE The big question in last month's debate for Bernie Sanders was how he would perform just a few weeks after his heart attack, a test he passed easily. Since then, Sanders has seen bumps in polling while Warren has struggled.
The next major priority for me, and for all of us, should be to lower the cost of healthcare and prescription drugs — and to protect patients with pre-existing conditions.
As the first woman elected Speaker of the House, her place in history was already secure. But her defining role in history may lie ahead of her.
Barrett has written that abortion is always amoral, and in 2006, she signed on to an anti-abortion newspaper advertisement that opposed abortion on demand. In 2013, Barrett's name also appeared in an advertisement sponsored by the group University Faculty for Life, which said we affirm our full support for our university's commitment to the right to life.
Even as primary season continues, several Senate races are taking shape, with some incumbent Republicans and several incumbent Democrats in danger of losing their seats. The blue wave may be coming for the House of Representatives, but it is less likely to crash over the Senate, where Democrats are likely to lose seats and widen the gap between the majority and the minority. Here is an updated look at Senate races to watch as November approaches.
But also casting a shadow over Barrett's confirmation hearing are possible legal showdowns stemming from the November election, as Mr. Trump has predicted the outcome of the presidential race could be decided by the Supreme Court.
At the center of the case before the Supreme Court is the constitutionality of the so-called individual mandate, an original statute of the act that required those who could afford health insurance, but opted out, to pay a fee when they filed taxes. Congress passed tax legislation in 2017 that eliminated the unpopular fine, and a federal appeals court determined the mandate was unconstitutional at this time last year. Texas and other conservative-led states have since argued that the mandate's unconstitutionality renders the entire ACA unconstitutional.
Let us work together to build a culture that cherishes innocent life. And let us reaffirm a fundamental truth: all children — born and unborn — are made in the holy image of God.
I will bring our energy companies back, said Trump, who added that the EPA is so restrictive it's putting energy companies out of business.
While Biden and Sanders did release a platform to ensure universal health care, it is not Sanders' Medicare for All plan. The platform recommends an affordable and government-run public option health care plan to be made available through the Obamacare exchanges.
Health insurance is meant to help people pay their medical expenses and avoid potentially catastrophic bills. Before Obamacare, however, using your insurance could cause you to lose it.
He added, She doesn't quit. She doesn't give up. I respect that. She's a fighter.
Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer reported the president said he'd keep the government closed for a very long period of time, months or even years – a promise Mr. Trump confirmed at a press briefing later that day.

Alice's story underscores the disparities and unfairness that can exist in criminal sentencing — and the need to remedy this injustice. She served almost 22 years and had expected to be in prison for the rest of her life.
I want to know what it is that you're going to do assure that people like me who work hard, we do everything we're supposed to do, can stay insured, she asked Mr. Trump.
Nearly three-quarters of Americans said Senate Republicans should discuss their health care plans publicly, according to a CBS News poll released Tuesday. A quarter of the public, by contrast, said it should be developed in private. It also found 57 percent said Obamacare needs some changes, 28 percent said it should be repealed entirely and 12 percent said it should be kept in place.
And in Michigan, where Democrat Gretchen Whitmer defeated incumbent Gov. Rick Snyder, Republicans put forth proposals to give the legislature authority in legal fights and to create a commission to oversee the state's campaign finance laws, according to the Detroit News. The moves come nearly two years after the Republican legislature in North Carolina made similar efforts, some of which are being challenged in court, to lessen the power of Democrat Roy Cooper, after he narrowly defeated GOP incumbent Gov. Pat McCrory.
The hearings will be a venue for Democrats to air their criticisms of Republicans' response to the pandemic, as well as to gauge how the senators — and Barrett — react to the public safety threat. Barrett contracted the virus and recovered from it over the summer, according to The Washington Post. The White House said on October 2 she tested negative after the September 26 event.
The agenda I will lay out this evening is not a Republican agenda or a Democrat agenda. It is the agenda of the American people.
To bolster their case against Barrett, Democrats cite an essay she wrote in 2017, in which Barrett was critical of Chief Justice John Roberts' majority opinion in the blockbuster 2012 Supreme Court case upholding Obamacare's individual mandate.
The veto was expected. But Republicans claimed victory with the vote, arguing that they met two goals by finally passing a repeal bill: keeping a promise to voters in an election year, and showing that they are capable of repealing the law if a Republican wins November's presidential election.
Pauley asked, Did you learn that from the experience of being a target?
Sinema would likely prefer to face a more extreme figure like Ward or Arpaio. However, McSally is the front-runner to win the nomination, making it less likely that moderates will flock to Sinema.
The CBO didn't release its cost estimate on the House bill until May 24, which projected that 23 million more people would be without health insurance over the next decade under the bill.

The fourth is to limit medical malpractice lawsuits. And the fifth is to make health care more competitive in part through co-insurance products that give consumers more of a stake in the overall cost of their care.
Senator Dianne Feinstein of California, the ranking member of the committee, has been criticized for questioning Barrett's Catholic faith during the 2017 confirmation hearings for Barrett's nomination to the federal appeals court on which she currently serves. If Feinstein or any other Democrats ask questions about how Barrett's faith influences her decision-making on critical issues like abortion, Republicans may take the opportunity to paint them as being anti-Catholic.
President Biden was clear: we need to strengthen the Affordable Care Act and give more Americans access to health care, especially during this pandemic, which has further demonstrated the importance of having the right coverage, Health and Human Services Acting Secretary Norris Cochran said in a statement.
He spent Tuesday in Arizona — a state President Trump won in 2016 — where he said you don't often see presidential candidates.
Republican-led legislatures in Wisconsin and Michigan in lame duck sessions are aiming to limit the powers of incoming Democratic governors in their states, prompting sore loser allegations from opponents who say lawmakers are undermining voters. But the moves also raise broader questions about whether such efforts have become the new normal in a political environment in which state bodies are becoming more partisan--and more powerful.
The Kaiser analysis also shows that so far, marketplace premiums are rising faster for 2017 then they have in years past.
As we speak, large, organized caravans are on the march to the United States. We have just heard that Mexican cities, in order to remove the illegal immigrants from their communities, are getting trucks and buses to bring them up to our country in areas where there is little border protection. I have ordered another 3,750 troops to our southern border to prepare for the tremendous onslaught.
Trump said he has already proposed 20 possible nominees and said he would pick people who respect the Constitution and the 2nd Amendment.
Senate Democrats will likely push Barrett to commit to recusing herself from any election-related disputes that come before the high court. But it's unlikely she will do so, as each individual justice decides whether to sit out a case.

We must choose whether we are defined by our differences — or whether we dare to transcend them.
Over at the bar at Schlafly's, Inskeep met a progressive couple who favors Democrats, but they know much of their conservative state will not.
Senate Republicans unveiled a discussion draft of the bill Thursday of their plan to repeal and replace Obamacare that would end the health care law's penalties for people who don't buy insurance, cut back an expansion of Medicaid, but would keep protections for people with pre-existing conditions, compared to the House-passed bill.
Although Barrett is expected to garner support from most, if not all, 53 Republican senators, most Democrats will likely oppose her confirmation. Barrett has only been on the federal bench for three years, but she has conservative bona fides and credits the late Justice Antonin Scalia with shaping her judicial philosophy.
On the other hand, fewer high-income beneficiaries would face premium surcharges if Obamacare went away. Private Medicare Advantage plans could reduce costs and improve coverage. Also, a 0.9 percentage point increase in the payroll tax on higher-income workers would be repealed.
He made a variety of claims about the health care system, health care proposals and the scientific realities of COVID-19. Here are some of the highlights, as well as fact checking and context for his statements.
VIA CBS NEWS CAMPAIGN REPORTER TIM PERRY Heading into the debate, Kamala Harris has seen a sharp decline in her poll numbers and has had to make major layoffs and changes with her staff. When asked how she plans to prepare for such a crucial debate, Harris jokingly said prayer, but added, I'm going to just be present.
The reality of a herd immunity, which appears to be what the president meant by herd mentality, is not so clear. The scant scientific research the world has so far suggests antibodies only last several months after infection, which seem to make it possible to be reinfected.
Then, in 2019, Barrett joined a dissent from the denial of rehearing of a challenge to an Indiana law that would have required doctors to notify the parents of a minor seeking an abortion. A three-judge panel found the law was unconstitutional.
Clinton alluded to the fact that Trump might not have paid federal income taxes for up to 18 years, according to a recent New York Times report about Trump's 1995 tax returns.
The two men hit the campaign trail together in 2000, during McCain's first presidential bid for the GOP nomination. That race didn't go McCain's way, but when South Carolina voters promoted Graham to Congress' upper chamber in 2003, they collaborated on legislation that would have major impacts on foreign policy. Their Senate gang once included now-former Sen. Joe Lieberman, an Democrat-turned-independent, until his retirement announcement in 2012. They were, the three Amigos. When Lieberman left the Senate, that trio became a duo.
To defend the dignity of every person, I am asking the Congress to pass legislation to prohibit the late-term abortion of children who can feel pain in the mother's womb.

Peter Bronson was in South Florida on vacation from New York. He drove down from Deerfield Beach to voice his concerns over the Trump administration.
We will not avert our eyes from a regime that chants death to America and threatens genocide against the Jewish people. We must never ignore the vile poison of anti-Semitism, or those who spread its venomous creed. With one voice, we must confront this hatred anywhere and everywhere it occurs.
But how do you get at least 50 votes in the Senate, especially after efforts to repeal and replace Obamacare failed to garner the support of all Republican senators?
Over at the bar at Schlafly's, Inskeep met a progressive couple who favors Democrats, but they know much of their conservative state will not.
With no penalty, there's no tax, the plaintiffs, a coalition of Republican-led states, argued in the Texas case. The plaintiffs also argued that the individual mandate is so essential to the entire law, so that if it's unconstitutional, the rest of the law must also be thrown out. U.S. District Court Judge Reed O'Connor agreed on that point, too.
Well, the Speaker has awesome power. But if the President of the United States is against governance and doesn't care whether people's needs are met or that public employees are paid or that we can have a legitimate discussion, then we have a problem, and we have to take it to the American people, she replied.
But it's unlikely Barrett will divulge her views on abortion or those cases, as nominees typically avoid weighing in on issues that may come before them as a jurist.
Clinton said she wants to choose someone who understands the way the world really works and people who have real-life experience.
But we must reject the politics of revenge, resistance, and retribution — and embrace the boundless potential of cooperation, compromise, and the common good.
Over the weekend, the Sanders campaign also launched a second digital ad featuring Ocasio-Cortez. We're building the largest grassroots movement of working class Iowans our state has ever seen, said Sander's Iowa Field Director Michael Fasullo in a statement. With these new offices, we're expanding our reach across the state and giving our supporters the tools they need to bring new folks into the political process and win the caucus in February.

9:49 p.m. ET Martha Raddatz said the leaked emails of Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta showed excerpts from Clinton's paid speeches to Wall Street and that Clinton said you need both a public and private position on certain issues. Uncommitted voters asked if it's okay for politicians to be too-faced.
Trump claimed that in San Bernardino last year many people saw the bombs all over the apartment.
Mitt Romney speaks on health care at the University of Michigan, May 12, 2011.
Both Romneycare and Obamacare infringe upon individual freedom and exponentially increase the government's healthcare cost burden, he said. Romneycare has, in fact, not made healthcare better or saved costs in Massachusetts. It's done just the opposite. This is not a failure of execution, but a lack of foresight on Governor Romney's part to understand the implications of his policy proposals. We need leaders who believe in the American people again, not the power of government to solve our problems.
He sees a chance for Democrats to flip the state if they make it a priority, just as he is.
He's never come up with a plan, the former vice president said. I guess we're going to get the pre-existing conditions plan at the same time we'll get the infrastructure plan.
The savage gang, MS-13, now operates in 20 different American States, and they almost all come through our southern border. Just yesterday, an MS-13 gang member was taken into custody for a fatal shooting on a subway platform in New York City. We are removing these gang members by the thousands, but until we secure our border they're going to keep streaming back in.
I began this evening by honoring three soldiers who fought on D-Day in the Second World War. One of them was Herman Zeitchik. But there is more to Herman's story. A year after he stormed the beaches of Normandy, Herman was one of those American soldiers who helped liberate Dachau. He was one of the Americans who helped rescue Joshua from that hell on earth. Almost 75 years later, Herman and Joshua are both together in the gallery tonight — seated side-by-side, here in the home of American freedom. Herman and Joshua: your presence this evening honors and uplifts our entire Nation.
Everything that has come since — our triumph over communism, our giant leaps of science and discovery, our unrivaled progress toward equality and justice — all of it is possible thanks to the blood and tears and courage and vision of the Americans who came before.
VIA CBS NEWS CAMPAIGN REPORTER JACK TURMAN South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg drew sharp contrasts with his progressive competitors, Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, on health care in the last debate. In contrast to Warren and Sanders' embrace of Medicare for All, which would eliminate most private insurance plans, Buttigieg's health care plan calls for a public option and does not eliminate private insurance plans.
Pauley said, President Trump hasn't given you a nickname, that I know of.
Despite Blackburn's Trumpworld cred, the race remains competitive. Bredesen's campaign recently released an ad highlighting praise that he received from Republicans when he was governor. Blackburn is trying to make the election a referendum on Trump, a strategy which may not work in her favor.

Clinton added that she worked to change the adoption and foster care system and she worked to rebuild New York after 9/11 and get healthcare for first responders.
While he said he has the plan already, Stephanopoulos noted that Mr. Trump has been in office for 3 1/2 years and has not yet presented a plan to replace Obamacare.

His willingness to embrace Mr. Trump may be enough to save Manchin, who is facing Republican state Attorney General Patrick Morrisey in the general election. Recent polling has shown Manchin to be several points ahead of Morrisey. However, if Republicans - with the help of Trump - are successfully able to portray Manchin as just another Democrat, that lead could narrow very quickly.
Over the last 2 years, my Administration has moved with urgency and historic speed to confront problems neglected by leaders of both parties over many decades.
Mr. Trump also said Tuesday night that Biden has agreed to a Bernie Sanders-style health care plan. If you look at what they (Democrats) want to do, where they have socialized medicine, they will get rid of pre-existing conditions.
There are five planks in Romney's proposal. The first is to give more power to states through Medicaid block grants, more flexibility in dealing with the ill and uninsured and limits on federal standards.
Coverage for those who make the deadline will begin January 1, a handful of weeks before the program's most prominent opponent, President Trump, leaves office. Mr. Trump campaigned on repealing and replacing Obamacare during the 2016 election, and kept on message, albeit unsuccessfully, throughout his presidency.
Be willing to change plans. True, all the jumping around in the marketplaces is making it hard for insurers to estimate costs going forward, but from the consumer perspective, this is one of the best options you have to keep premiums down.
Vice President Mike Pence on Friday delivered remarks at an event for Rick Saccone, the GOP nominee running in the special election to fill the seat vacated by former Rep. Tim Murphy, R-Pennsylvania, which is being held on March 13. Conor Lamb is the Democratic candidate running for the seat.
Outside Central Park in Manhattan, thousands of flag-waving protesters lined up. Many in the crowd chanted No ban, no wall. The Trump regime has got to fall. They held aloft signs saying Uphold the Constitution Now and Impeach the Liar.
Romney then offered the outlines of his federal health care proposal, which, he said, would start with an executive order on his first day as president to help states get waivers to opt-out of the federal health care law. Referring to slides, he said he would then look to repeal and replace that law with his proposal.
Mr. Obama was also a topic of discussion at the debate in July when candidates argued over whether or not Obamacare went far enough as well as that administration's immigration policies. On Friday, Mr. Obama indirectly responded to those comments in his interview with Abrams.
Without the ACA, insurers could once again charge copayments or coinsurance for preventive care, including screenings, immunizations, annual checkups and birth control. Medicare beneficiaries could again have to pay for certain services, including screenings for breast cancer, colorectal cancer, cardiovascular disease and diabetes. The law also closed the infamous doughnut hole in Medicare's prescription drug coverage that left many older people paying thousands of dollars out of pocket for their medication.
What we all saw and heard on Friday was Donald talking about women, what he thinks about women, what he does to women, Clinton said. I think it's clear to anyone who heard it that it represents exactly who he is.
Romney, who has been stung by charges of flip-flopping in the past, said his federal health care proposal had not changed from 2008, when he last ran for president -- even though his decision to sign the law has seemingly gone from a political asset to a liability.
No one has more respect for women than me. ~trump
A cost estimate of the bill from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) is expected to be released by early next week. White House staff met with Senate Republican staffers Wednesday night on Capitol Hill to review the bill.
Democrats will also have the majority in the House next year. Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi, the presumptive speaker of the House of the incoming Congress, said that the House will move swiftly to formally intervene in the appeals process to uphold the life-saving protections for people with pre-existing conditions and reject Republicans' effort to destroy the Affordable Care Act. This resolution would allow the House general counsel to defend the health care law on the chamber's behalf.
Mr. Trump, who typically forgoes wearing a mask himself, said there are a lot of people who think that masks are not good. A voter had asked why he doesn't wear a mask more often himself and why he hasn't imposed a national mask mandate.
His comment came after Trump's new campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, reversed her position that Trump should release his tax returns.
But also casting a shadow over Barrett's confirmation hearing are possible legal showdowns stemming from the November election, as Mr. Trump has predicted the outcome of the presidential race could be decided by the Supreme Court.

Governor John Bel Edwards earned a second term by working to make health care more affordable and accessible for the people he serves in Louisiana...House Republicans are likely reconsidering just how eager they are to rubber stamp President Trump's reckless agenda in Washington, said DCCC Chairwoman Cheri Bustos in a statement.
She then slammed the hateful, divisive nature of Trump's campaign and the inciting of violence at his rallies.
Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, said in a statement that he needs to carefully review the text first, but would prefer to address health care reform in a bipartisan manner, accusing Democrats of being unwilling to negotiate with Republicans.
On the other hand, fewer high-income beneficiaries would face premium surcharges if Obamacare went away. Private Medicare Advantage plans could reduce costs and improve coverage. Also, a 0.9 percentage point increase in the payroll tax on higher-income workers would be repealed.

No, I didn't say that at all, Trump said. I don't think you understand what I said...This was locker room talk.
9:35 p.m. ET Clinton was asked to address her husband's comments from this past week about Obamacare being a crazy system. The former president later clarified the comment and said he supports the system.
I think we have a long way to go before we know the answer to that question, Sen. Tim Scott, R-South Carolina, said when asked if it could pass next week, adding that the draft version could be modified before a vote happens. I'm open to moving forward on the legislation. We have a lot of time now -- seven days -- to figure out what parts we like about it, what parts we plan to keep. This is only a draft legislation. We're going to make a lot of changes over the next seven days.
Already, as a result of my Administration's efforts, in 2018 drug prices experienced their single largest decline in 46 years.
10:25 p.m. ET Candidates are asked what they would prioritize as the most important aspect of picking a Supreme Court justice.
Policies also routinely had caps that limited how much insurers had to pay out over someone's lifetime. People who were sick enough could hit those caps and be on the hook for 100% of their medical costs afterward.
Well, that didn't happen, said Sunday Morning anchor Jane Pauley. But Speaker Pelosi is the most powerful woman in American history, and the most powerful woman in American politics. But you can't make the government open?
Even as primary season continues, several Senate races are taking shape, with some incumbent Republicans and several incumbent Democrats in danger of losing their seats. The blue wave may be coming for the House of Representatives, but it is less likely to crash over the Senate, where Democrats are likely to lose seats and widen the gap between the majority and the minority. Here is an updated look at Senate races to watch as November approaches.
Since entering the race last spring, former Joe Biden has slipped eight points in Iowa, according to the latest CBS News Battleground Tracker poll. Biden continues to lead nationally and remains a top-tier candidate for his party's nomination, but in interviews during the first two weeks of November with a dozen top Democratic leaders, officials and strategists, many expressed concerns to CBS News campaign reporters Musadiq Bidar and Adam Brewster about Biden's standing in Iowa.
Thank you. God Bless You, God Bless America, and good night!
I wouldn't count him out, but there's certainly been some troubling signs, said former Democratic political operative Grant Woodard, who worked on Hillary Clinton's 2008 Iowa campaign. A top Iowa Democrat said the former vice president doesn't have the intensity of support that other candidates have shown, adding, If he's not in the top three it's over.
This is the time to re-ignite the American imagination. This is the time to search for the tallest summit, and set our sights on the brightest star. This is the time to rekindle the bonds of love and loyalty and memory that link us together as citizens, as neighbors, as patriots.
Above all, friend and foe alike must never doubt this Nation's power and will to defend our people. Eighteen years ago, terrorists attacked the USS Cole — and last month American forces killed one of the leaders of the attack.
The decision doesn't affect people currently insured in the ACA marketplaces or those who have just signed up for 2019 coverage. Ultimately, however, if the ruling holds it would dismantle the entire law -- that includes many of the popular ACA components such as protections for people with preexisting conditions, mandated coverage of essential health benefits and zero-cost preventive care. Medicaid expansion coverage under the ACA would also be in jeopardy.
This isn't a zero sum world that we live in, her, partner John Shepherd, said of what he hopes Republicans will understand. And it doesn't have to be that way, yet it seems as though it is. If I have a primary motivator it's that everyone's lives should be better. Not just mine – everyone's.
9:25 p.m. ET Martha Raddatz asked Clinton if it was extremely careless of her to operate a personal email server as secretary of state in which 110 classified emails were exchanged.
Everyone in 2019 is probably OK, because the appeals process takes some time, Weber said.
So finding coverage for specialists and out-of-network services isn't as tough a problem for judges as it can be in the often narrow networks ACA enrollees rely on. And federal employees have the option of keeping their coverage into retirement, unlike many private employer plans.
In 2018, when the 7th Circuit weighed whether the full court should rehear a case involving a challenge to an Indiana abortion law that requires fetal remains to be cremated or buried after an abortion, Barrett joined a dissent from the denial of rehearing en banc authored by Judge Frank Easterbrook. In his dissent, Easterbrook took issue with a panel decision striking down a different statute that prohibits abortion based on sex, race or disability.
But Graham made it clear their friendship was much deeper than politics or any single bill.
Senate Democrats have made the future of Obamacare a focal point of their opposition to Barrett's nomination, especially since the Supreme Court is set to hear a challenge to the Obama-era healthcare law November 10, just seven day after the election.
So, impeachment not high on your agenda?
Trump said Clinton wants to move to a single-payer plan like Canada's. He added that it should be repealed and replaced.
Trump said he has already proposed 20 possible nominees and said he would pick people who respect the Constitution and the 2nd Amendment.
Hillary is so strong. I have so much respect for the way she deals with that beast. — Alyssa Milano (@Alyssa_Milano) October 20, 2016
Everything that has come since — our triumph over communism, our giant leaps of science and discovery, our unrivaled progress toward equality and justice — all of it is possible thanks to the blood and tears and courage and vision of the Americans who came before.
9:28 p.m. ET Trump wanted to stay on the issue of emails, but Clinton wanted to move on to additional questions from voters. Clinton said Trump was trying to divert attention from the video of his lewd comments.
The individual mandate is at the center of conservative Constitutional challenges to the health care law.

Millions could become uninsured if the ACA exchanges are shut down, Obamacare's expanded Medicaid coverage is rescinded, and insurers are no longer required to cover children under 26 on their parents' plans. Some employers may continue dependent coverage, since young people in general tend to use less health care. But young people in poor health or with preexisting conditions could be shut out.
She said, You go into the arena and you understand that you will be a target. And that isn't anything that should keep you out of the arena. And so I always say to women, 'Just be yourself. Be who you are.'

Nancy Pelosi is arguably the most galvanizing and polarizing figure in politics. She would not argue, having been featured in thousands of attack ads.
If no candidate gets a majority of votes, there will be a runoff election between the top two candidates. Espy's path to victory is surprisingly plausible: if Espy and McDaniel are the top two candidates, Mississippians may choose the moderate Democrat over the conservative provocateur.
We have unleashed a revolution in American energy — the United States is now the number one producer of oil and natural gas in the world. And now, for the first time in 65 years, we are a net exporter of energy.
There is hatred among different races, separation of races, it needs to stop, we need to find a common good and work together to preserve the United States, said June Martinez.
While he faces an uphill fundraising battle with his delayed entry into the already jam-packed field, Bennet is optimistic about his political future.
Smart money in Texas is not betting that Rep. Beto O'Rourke, the telegenic Democratic congressman from El Paso, will defeat Sen. Ted Cruz. However, despite Mr. Trump's nearly 10-point margin of victory in 2016 and Cruz winning by 16 percentage points in 2012, the buzz around O'Rourke is loud enough to suggest that the conservative incumbent may be in trouble.
In an age of hyper-partisanship, it's unclear whether Donnelly's tactics will be successful, or whether ruby-red Indiana will elect a Republican senator in November.
Here is what to expect for Barrett's confirmation hearings:
Jesse Weber, an attorney and anchor on the Law & Crime Network, told CBS This Morning Saturday that the ruling was not unexpected.
Demonstrators said Mr. Trump has attacked everything they stand for, from his crackdown on immigration to his party's response to climate change and the environment. Meanwhile, supporters of the president have followed his lead, turning on the media and saying they're glad to see Mr. Trump fighting back.
She added that she wants the Supreme Court to reverse Citizens United, to understand that voting rights is still a big country in parts of the country and she wants the high court to respect the Roe v. Wade ruling.
Three decades later, she once again has the top job in Congress, with the best view in Washington – from a Capitol on edge.
Everyone in 2019 is probably OK, because the appeals process takes some time, Weber said.

Clinton said that there have been some divisive, dark things said about Muslims. She added that his demagogic behavior is dangerous and his rhetoric plays into the hands of the terrorists.
8:52 p.m. ET The debate -- a town hall meeting -- will begin in just a few minutes around 9 p.m. ET.
The candidates will likely have to answer whether the party is in a place to win over the roughly eight million voters who went for Mr. Obama in 2012 and Mr. Trump in 2016 as well as motivate turnout among African Americans and Latinos, a major problem for Hillary Clinton in 2016. Democrats scored big wins in Louisiana and Kentucky's gubernatorial races this month. But in both cases, the Democratic candidates did not focus on the ambitious policies frequently discussed in the primary field, such as Medicare for All.
O'Rourke's tour of the state has garnered large crowds nearly everywhere he goes. He has also raised $10 million in the second quarter, compared to Cruz's $4 million. The Cook Political Report has even rated the Texas Senate race as lean Republican, which means they don't believe it is a lock for Cruz.
This is a smart, strategic, see-through steel barrier — not just a simple concrete wall. It will be deployed in the areas identified by border agents as having the greatest need, and as these agents will tell you, where walls go up, illegal crossings go way down.
This new era of cooperation can start with finally confirming the more than 300 highly qualified nominees who are still stuck in the Senate – some after years of waiting. The Senate has failed to act on these nominations, which is unfair to the nominees and to our country.
A new review in Frontiers in Public Health says COVID-19 will likely become seasonal eventually.
But while the president has claimed he would protect preexisting conditions, his administration has been trying to kill the Affordable Care Act in the courts.
By highlighting both Mr. Trump's request to Ukraine and the barbs from foreign adversaries—whom he calls thugs—Biden underscores his foreign policy experience, which he sees as a key selling point to voters. Having spent much of the last 50 years as a powerful lawmaker steeped in foreign policy discussions, he says he knows intimately what makes leaders like Kim and Putin tick. Will he proactively start contrasting this record with the other Democrats?
Two weeks ago, the United States officially recognized the legitimate government of Venezuela, and its new interim President, Juan Guaido.
Here tonight is Debra Bissell. Just three weeks ago, Debra's parents, Gerald and Sharon, were burglarized and shot to death in their Reno, Nevada, home by an illegal alien. They were in their eighties and are survived by four children, 11 grandchildren, and 20 great-grandchildren. Also here tonight are Gerald and Sharon's granddaughter, Heather, and great‑granddaughter, Madison.
Washington — The Senate Judiciary Committee is set to convene Monday for the first day of confirmation hearings for Judge Amy Coney Barrett, President Trump's nominee to the Supreme Court, in what is expected to be a fiercely partisan battle over the future of the high court.
The CDC says masks are most likely to reduce the spread of COVID-19 when they are widely used by people in public settings.
Yet he argued that what was right for his state is not necessarily right for the nation. Romney grounded his argument in the founding fathers' vision for America, saying they didn't want a king-like structure grounded in a central government but rather for Americans to have the freedom to choose our life's course, our enterprises.
Vice president says health insurance sign-ups may be short of the 7 million goal during the open-enrollment period but adds he's optimistic regardless
Clinton went even further, arguing that Sanders' plan would empower Republican governors to eliminate health insurance for low-income and middle-income Americans.
I agree with everything she said, said Trump, who added that he is actually a politician.
I ask the men and women of this Congress: Look at the opportunities before us! Our most thrilling achievements are still ahead. Our most exciting journeys still await. Our biggest victories are still to come. We have not yet begun to dream.
The two appeared on CNN together before the cancer diagnosis in March, and described their camaraderie.
Russia is new in terms of nuclear. We are old, we are tired, we are exhausted in terms of nuclear, Trump said.
He has a more direct approach to politics and policies and how he handles things, and from what I've seen, he seems to care about the issues of Baltimore city, which is something that we desperately need, Baylor said.
That was a mistake. I take responsibility for using a personal email account. Obviously if I were to do it over again, I would not, she said. I am very sorry about that.
9:14 p.m. ET Clinton responded and said with prior GOP presidential nominees, she has disagreed with them on policies, but she said, I have never questioned their fitness to serve. Donald Trump is different.
VIA CBS NEWS CAMPAIGN REPORTER BO ERICKSON If the past is any indication, a solid debate performance by Klobuchar could lead to more money and a bounce in the polls. The Minnesota senator had her best fundraising spree ever after the last debate, quickly raising $1.1 million dollars.
No matter the trials we face, no matter the challenges to come, we must go forward together.
BET noted that the uncommitted African Americans who asked Mr. Trump questions at the Philadelphia town hall did not seem convinced by his answers on a range of topics from health care to inequality. Blaque, the voter suffering from sarcoidosis, told CNN later that the president did not answer her question, and she's now decided who's getting her vote.
How can he keep that momentum rolling in the debate? Essentially, just by maintaining his status quo. His campaign argues that folks at home know Bernie Sanders. They know that his signature policy is Medicare for All. They know that he's 78 years old.
I don't want to see the country sold to the highest bidder. I want to see a system, something like a change in the system that Martin Luther King talked about, that we change the country, the system, that people are treated fairly no matter what station is in life, said Bronson.
In advance of the speech, which the Romney campaign billed as major, the conservative Wall Street Journal editorial page hammered the Massachusetts Republican on the issue, writing: Mr. Romney now claims ObamaCare should be repealed, but his failure to explain his own role or admit any errors suggests serious flaws both in his candidacy and as a potential President.
I'll be candid… one of the areas of agreement in even contentious times in the Obama administration was that our corporate tax rate is way too high, Sayegh said on the latest episode of The Takeout podcast. And it's made us uncompetitive. I mean, that is a point that both Republicans and Democrats largely agree on. We're going to really tackle that tax rate.
The Kaiser analysis also shows that so far, marketplace premiums are rising faster for 2017 then they have in years past.
I'm going to vote for Biden, she said.
If the U.S. Supreme Court throws out the Affordable Care Act, your finances and your future could pay the price.
Our approach is based on principled realism — not discredited theories that have failed for decades to yield progress. For this reason, my Administration recognized the true capital of Israel — and proudly opened the American Embassy in Jerusalem.
Mr. Trump nominated Barrett to the Supreme Court in a ceremony in the White House Rose Garden where there was limited social distancing and few wore masks. Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's leading infectious diseases expert, described the ceremony to CBS News as a super-spreader event because so many of the attendees, including the president and first lady Melania Trump, soon tested positive for COVID-19.
Hillary's acceptance speech should just be, Excuse me, Donald. My turn. — Damien Fahey (@DamienFahey) October 20, 2016
The situation in Syria is catastrophic, Clinton said, adding that she advocates a no-fly zone in Syria to provide humanitarian aid to people suffering and to work with allies.
Republicans insist that the measures are a way to balance government, and point to legislative moves in 2010 to extend union contracts during the lame duck before Walker took office, though that measure did not limit the power of the governor. For all the talk about reigning in power, it really doesn't, Walker told reporters Monday, according to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.
10:14 p.m. ET An undecided voter in the debate hall asked if the candidates can be a devoted president to all people in the United States.
The Affordable Care Act was all built on that penalty, Weber said. The case will now likely go to the Supreme Court, where the five justices who previously voted to uphold the ACA are still sitting. However, Weber noted that the court now has a conservative majority, with the confirmation of Supreme Court Justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh under Mr. Trump.
The race to replace departing Sen. Jeff Flake will put the theory that demographic changes are turning Arizona blue to the test.
We are also joined tonight by Matthew Charles from Tennessee. In 1996, at age 30, Matthew was sentenced to 35 years for selling drugs and related offenses. Over the next two decades, he completed more than 30 Bible studies, became a law clerk, and mentored fellow inmates. Now, Matthew is the very first person to be released from prison under the First Step Act. Matthew, on behalf of all Americans: welcome home.
Mr. Trump said this summer that he was working on an executive order to protect those with preexisting conditions.
Romney said that while pundits have been pushing him to simply admit his decision to sign the Massachusetts law was a boneheaded mistake, he would not do so. That's because, he said, it wouldn't be honest.
When campaigning never stops, governing never begins, he adds.
This entire tax return debate is somewhat confounding to me, in the following sense: I don't think that it creates one job, gets one more individual who does not have health insurance covered by health insurance, particularly under the disaster that has been Obamacare with these private insurers pulling out our exchanges now and reporting billions of dollars of losses, she told CNN.
The senator refers to himself as a pragmatic idealist, looking to herald in a new era of progress for Washington. He told Dickerson that he has a tendency to tell the truth to his constituents in Colorado and now wants the chance to do that with the American people.
Clinton was campaigning in New Hampshire on behalf of her mother, Hillary Clinton, ostensibly to tout the campaign's early childhood education plan. But she took sharp aim at Sanders, who advocates for a single-payer system that would place control of health care in the hands of the federal government.
Celebrities had a lot to say about Wednesday's presidential debate, especially when it came to Hillary Clinton's white pantsuit and Donald Trump's nasty woman and bad hombres comments.
Colorado Sen. Michael Bennet is the latest Democratic contender to enter the packed field of 2020 hopefuls, announcing on CBS This Morning on Thursday that he's running for president.
Sen. Sanders wands to devolve the authority to set up state health insurance programs to individual state governors, Clinton continued. Now maybe if I lived in a place like New Hampshire, with your governor, I would feel okay about that. But if I lived in a state that had a Republican governor, particularly a Republican governor who already turned down Medicaid expansion matching funds, I don't think I would be comfortable, right? Because I don't want to live in a country that has an unequal health care system again.
10:19 p.m. ET Anderson Cooper asked Clinton how she can unite the country after her deplorables remark.
However, the president has repeatedly said he wants the court to overturn the law. Barrett is expected to be confirmed by the Senate next week, giving conservatives a 6-3 majority on the court.
Pelosi is described by friends and foes alike as a master legislative strategist. The first woman elected Speaker of the House in 2007, she was a fierce critic of then-President George W. Bush, but Pelosi rounded up Democratic votes to help him pass an economic bailout package.
He spent Tuesday in Arizona — a state President Trump won in 2016 — where he said you don't often see presidential candidates.
For now, the administration expects to get a cohesive bill in front of the House and Senate committees of jurisdiction in the beginning of September, with mark-up completed by the first half of the month. After an effort to merge a House and Senate tax reform bill together, it's going to get done by late October or November, Sayegh said.
After thousands of Wisconsin voters waited hours in line outside crowded polling stations for that state's recent primary, Maryland sent ballots to eligible voters weeks in advance to encourage as many mail-in votes as possible — in a test of how future elections might safely be held during the pandemic.
Court's decision does not affect this season's open enrollment, reads a notice on HealthCare.gov, where people can sign up for coverage.
No issue better illustrates the divide between America's working class and America's political class than illegal immigration. Wealthy politicians and donors push for open borders while living their lives behind walls and gates and guards.

Over 915,000 people signed up for Obamacare from November 29 to December 5, the fifth week of open enrollment and most recent data released by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services' weekly enrollment snapshot. That's nearly double the week prior, when 523,020 people selected plans, which itself was about a 50% increase from the same time period last year.
Even if you were able to keep your health insurance, experts say you could face caps on your coverage that expose you to enormous medical bills. Preventive care and birth control could cost you more. Medicare beneficiaries could face higher premiums, deductibles and copays. Insurers could cancel your policy retroactively for even minor mistakes on your application.
The stakes are enormous — for all kinds of Americans as well as the broader American economy.
10:07 p.m. ET Trump said that Clinton talks tough about Russia and the U.S. nuclear program has fallen way behind.
And America is a land of preexisting conditions. Half of adults under age 65, or up to 133 million people, had health issues that could cause them to be denied coverage or charged exorbitant premiums, according to a 2017 government analysis.
Donald Trump's longtime adviser Roger Stone said Monday that the GOP presidential nominee should release his tax returns.
Human traffickers and sex traffickers take advantage of the wide open areas between our ports of entry to smuggle thousands of young girls and women into the United States and to sell them into prostitution and modern-day slavery.
In April, Conway told CNN that she'd like see Trump's returns become transparent, but in multiple interviews on Sunday, she said he shouldn't while they remain under audit.

Control of the Senate hinges in part on a race in Missouri. Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill is locked in a close contest with the state's attorney general, Josh Hawley. Missouri voted for President Trump in 2016 and has grown more conservative over time. CBS News contributor and host of NPR's Morning Edition, Steve Inskeep, took a road trip down historic Route 66 for three meals with Missouri voters: breakfast in a small town, lunch in a suburb and dinner in a city.
In an unprecedented Maryland election, three polling centers will be open Tuesday in a special election between Democrat Kweisi Mfume and Republican Kimberly Klacik in a congressional race dramatically reshaped by the coronavirus pandemic.
9:11 p.m. ET Trump is asked by Anderson Cooper if he understood that he bragged about engaging in sexual assault in his comments from 2005 that surfaced on Friday.
Sen. Joe Manchin is an endangered species: the last statewide Democrat standing in West Virginia, which voted for Mr. Trump by over 40 percentage points. If anywhere can truly be defined as Trump country, it is West Virginia, where formerly Democratic Gov. Jim Justice switched to the Republican Party in 2017 at a rally Mr. Trump.
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-New York, noted that the president had asked for a bill with more heart than the House bill, but this bill, Schumer said, is every bit as bad as the House version and maybe meaner. The way this bill cuts health care is heartless, he said on the floor.
Clinton said Trump needs to give Mr. Obama an apology as well as the rest of the country.
In June, the Trump administration asked the Supreme Court to overturn Obamacare, arguing the individual mandate is unconstitutional and so, the rest of the law, which includes preexisting condition protections, should be struck down.
In a departure from his fellow Democratic contenders, Bennet, who supports creating a public option for health care while making private insurances available on Obamacare marketplaces, noted in his campaign rollout video that the answer to the nation's health care woes does cannot be found in far-left policies like Medicare-for-All.
Back then, many people who had health issues — or whose family members did — avoided changing jobs, starting businesses or retiring early because of the risk they couldn't find affordable health insurance.
Republicans want to make sure they are not going to appear to be lap dogs and lay down. They are saying yes, Evers won, but it's not a mandate and he can't arbitrarily throw out everything they've worked on for eight years. That becomes laying down the political gauntlet, says Republican strategist Brandon Scholz, asked about the politics at play. If roles were reversed, and Democrats were fortifying things they'd worked on for eight years, Republicans would say the same thing.
People can still sign up for coverage through Saturday.
Vice President Joe Biden acknowledged Wednesday that the new Obamacare marketplaces may not meet their original enrollment goals. Still, Biden -- who famously called the 2010 passage of the Affordable Care Act a big f**king deal, said that the new marketplaces are nevertheless off to hell of a start.
Democrats, meanwhile, are concerned that she would rule to kill the Affordable Care Act, chip away at abortion rights and expand the scope of the Second Amendment.
Before the ACA, insurers routinely used preexisting health conditions as a reason to deny coverage or charge people more for their insurance premiums. Preexisting conditions typically included serious ailments such as cancer or heart disease as well as more common conditions such as high cholesterol, high blood pressure, asthma, diabetes and obesity, and even temporary conditions including pregnancy. Insurers denied about 1 in 5 applications for individual policies because of preexisting conditions, and some employer-provided group policies required people to wait up to a year before their preexisting conditions were covered.
When I took office, ISIS controlled more than 20,000 square miles in Iraq and Syria. Today, we have liberated virtually all of that territory from the grip of these bloodthirsty killers.
The vice president attacked the Democratic challenger for not revealing his positions on issues such as Obamacare.
In Portland, Oregon, dozens gathered late Monday morning and blocked downtown streets, and a handful of protesters were arrested after refusing to stop blocking traffic, CBS Portland affiliate KOIN reported. Video from the scene showed police making arrests and people laying face down on the ground.
Rick Santorum, one of Romney's likely rivals, released a statement immediately following the speech deeming the Massachusetts health care law the precursor to national socialized medicine.
Mr. Trump repeated a claim Tuesday night he has made in the past — that COVID-19 is probably going to go away now a lot faster because of the vaccine but would go away without the vaccine.
President-elect Joe Biden has nominated California Attorney General Xavier Becerra to serve as his first secretary of health and human services. Becerra was a leading advocate for passage of the ACA as California's attorney general, and has defended the law in federal court, including before the Supreme Court.
No. I don't know. We'll see. We shall see. It isn't so much about him. It's about the office that he holds, the Presidency of the United States. Sometimes I think I respect the office he holds more than he does.
As we have seen, when we are united, we can make astonishing strides for our country. Now, Republicans and Democrats must join forces again to confront an urgent national crisis.
9:18 p.m. ET The next question came from a guy named Jeff from Ohio on Facebook. Jeff asked: Trump said the campaign has changed him. When did that happen? Martha Raddatz piggybacked onto the question and asked when Trump walked off the bus on Access Hollywood at age 59, was he a different man then and did that behavior change?
Ahead of Wednesday's debate, Warren has released two more plans on health care: one indicating that her plan would not increase taxes on middle class families and the other detailing a health care bill that includes an expansive public option that she says she would work to pass before Medicare for All. Meanwhile, two polls in the last week, including a CBS News Battleground Tracker poll, showed Buttigieg rising in Iowa. And with less than 80 days until the Iowa caucus, Buttigieg's competitors may start redirecting their fire toward the millennial mayor. How will Buttigieg fend off potential attacks now that polling shows him in the top tier of candidates?
CBS News' Nancy Cordes and Alan He contributed to this report.
And just weeks ago, both parties united for groundbreaking criminal justice reform. Last year, I heard through friends the story of Alice Johnson. I was deeply moved. In 1997, Alice was sentenced to life in prison as a first-time non-violent drug offender. Over the next two decades, she became a prison minister, inspiring others to choose a better path. She had a big impact on that prison population — and far beyond.
McCaskill received another political godsend in 2018 thanks to the meltdown of the state Republican Party. GOP Gov. Eric Greitens, a conservative rising star, resigned earlier this year amid after being accused of blackmailing and assaulting a woman with whom he had had an affair.
Stephanopoulos pointed out that Dr. Anthony Fauci disagrees with this, but Mr. Trump insisted other doctors like Scott Atlas agree with him.
Well, in either case it doesn't matter to me, Pelosi laughed. What matters to me is that he recognize that the Congress of the United States is the first branch of government, that we're a co-equal branch of government, and that we represent the people. And that when we go to the table to speak with him, we're respectful of the branch that he represents, the Office of the President. And we want him to be respectful of the branch of government we represent. Co-equal.
So now that I'm on the inside, I know something I didn't know then. He's under audit. He's said completely, when audit is completed, he will release, she said on CNN's State of the Union.
The Senate's version was supposedly crafted by a working group consisting of 13 Republican men -- and no women -- but one of the group's participants, Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, said even he had been left in the dark. Lee said the measure was apparently being written by a small handful of staffers for members of the Republican leadership in the Senate.
He lives in an alternative reality, Clinton said. His plan will give the wealthy and corporations the biggest tax cuts they've ever had.

His willingness to embrace Mr. Trump may be enough to save Manchin, who is facing Republican state Attorney General Patrick Morrisey in the general election. Recent polling has shown Manchin to be several points ahead of Morrisey. However, if Republicans - with the help of Trump - are successfully able to portray Manchin as just another Democrat, that lead could narrow very quickly.

Alice's story underscores the disparities and unfairness that can exist in criminal sentencing — and the need to remedy this injustice. She served almost 22 years and had expected to be in prison for the rest of her life.
What we all saw and heard on Friday was Donald talking about women, what he thinks about women, what he does to women, Clinton said. I think it's clear to anyone who heard it that it represents exactly who he is.
That means judges who opt into the system pay premiums, just like the rest of us. They may even pay a bit more than the average private-sector employee. In addition, depending on what type of plan judges pick, like private-sector employees they may have high deductibles or high co-insurance for certain services. As in the marketplaces, it's all about what plan they choose.
He added, She doesn't quit. She doesn't give up. I respect that. She's a fighter.
Mr. Trump's chumminess with Heitkamp has evoked the annoyance of her Republican opponent, Rep. Kevin Cramer, who has suggested that Mr. Trump was not targeting Heitkamp forcefully because of her gender. However, in a June rally, Mr. Trump went after Heitkamp, saying that she was liberal who voted in line with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi.
This fall she even faced a revolt from members of her own party, who called for a new generation of Democratic leaders to take on President Trump.
Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-Louisiana, said he's happy that the bill makes an effort to lower premiums immediately, but he said he wants to ensure that as Medicaid is scaled back, We don't lose the the ability for lower-income folks to be able to afford insurance.
Perhaps we can negotiate a different agreement, adding China and others, or perhaps we can't –- in which case, we will outspend and out-innovate all others by far.
Outside Central Park in Manhattan, thousands of flag-waving protesters lined up. Many in the crowd chanted No ban, no wall. The Trump regime has got to fall. They held aloft signs saying Uphold the Constitution Now and Impeach the Liar.
What can you do if you're looking at a big jump in your premium?
Inspired by stories like Alice's, my Administration worked closely with members of both parties to sign the First Step Act into law. This legislation reformed sentencing laws that have wrongly and disproportionately harmed the African-American community. The First Step Act gives non-violent offenders the chance to re-enter society as productive, law-abiding citizens. Now, States across the country are following our lead. America is a Nation that believes in redemption.
We have to bring back respect to law enforcement, he said.

We have to bring back respect to law enforcement, he said.
Some Democrats in the House and Senate support some version of Medicare-for-All. Progressives in Congress may take the opportunity to try to pass a more comprehensive health care bill, although with Republicans still controlling the Senate, such a measure could die in the House.
So, they have to undermine. But that doesn't bother me. That's their problem.
After 24 months of rapid progress, our economy is the envy of the world, our military is the most powerful on earth, and America is winning each and every day. Members of Congress: the State of our Union is strong. Our country is vibrant and our economy is thriving like never before.
Millions could become uninsured if the ACA exchanges are shut down, Obamacare's expanded Medicaid coverage is rescinded, and insurers are no longer required to cover children under 26 on their parents' plans. Some employers may continue dependent coverage, since young people in general tend to use less health care. But young people in poor health or with preexisting conditions could be shut out.
As part of a bold new diplomacy, we continue our historic push for peace on the Korean Peninsula. Our hostages have come home, nuclear testing has stopped, and there has not been a missile launch in 15 months. If I had not been elected President of the United States, we would right now, in my opinion, be in a major war with North Korea with potentially millions of people killed. Much work remains to be done, but my relationship with Kim Jong Un is a good one. And Chairman Kim and I will meet again on February 27 and 28 in Vietnam.
I know that the Congress is eager to pass an infrastructure bill — and I am eager to work with you on legislation to deliver new and important infrastructure investment, including investments in the cutting edge industries of the future. This is not an option. This is a necessity.
In June, when close to half a million Americans had lost health insurance through their employer due to the economic shutdown brought on by the pandemic, the Trump administration urged the Supreme Court to overturn the Affordable Care Act, which authorized Obamacare. By August, the number of Americans who had lost their health insurance jumped to six million — or, at least 12 million when spouses and children are taken into account, according to research from the Economic Policy Institute.
So far, at least one Democrat on the committee, Senator Chris Coons of Delaware, has committed to asking Barrett about Obamacare.
Trump said that her comment was a great compliment.
In the decade since the ACA became law, many Americans have become so accustomed to the protections and savings afforded by the landmark legislation that they may not realize how much could change if Obamacare were struck down. Its effects on health care are so pervasive that nearly every American could be affected, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation, which tracks health care issues.
Blackburn is focusing her campaign on her support for Trump, who endorsed her in May. At a rally in Nashville in May, Mr. Trump portrayed Bredesen as a tool of Chuck and Nancy. Blackburn has promised to wholeheartedly support Mr. Trump's agenda if elected. Blackburn used clips from that rally in a recent campaign ad touting Trump's endorsement.
The Affordable Care Act was all built on that penalty, Weber said. The case will now likely go to the Supreme Court, where the five justices who previously voted to uphold the ACA are still sitting. However, Weber noted that the court now has a conservative majority, with the confirmation of Supreme Court Justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh under Mr. Trump.
I am asking the Congress to pass legislation that finally takes on the problem of global freeloading and delivers fairness and price transparency for American patients. We should also require drug companies, insurance companies, and hospitals to disclose real prices to foster competition and bring costs down.
The two men hit the campaign trail together in 2000, during McCain's first presidential bid for the GOP nomination. That race didn't go McCain's way, but when South Carolina voters promoted Graham to Congress' upper chamber in 2003, they collaborated on legislation that would have major impacts on foreign policy. Their Senate gang once included now-former Sen. Joe Lieberman, an Democrat-turned-independent, until his retirement announcement in 2012. They were, the three Amigos. When Lieberman left the Senate, that trio became a duo.
We must choose whether we will squander our inheritance — or whether we will proudly declare that we are Americans. We do the incredible. We defy the impossible. We conquer the unknown.
The move to start in Arizona comes as Bloomberg is taking the path less traveled in the presidential race. He will not appear on the ballot in some early-voting states, such as New Hampshire, and he has hinted that he will not compete in other early states like Iowa.
In addition to the Affordable Care Act, Barrett will likely be pressed about Roe v. Wade, the 1973 Supreme Court decision that established a woman's right to an abortion.
When I saw Alice's beautiful family greet her at the prison gates, hugging and kissing and crying and laughing, I knew I did the right thing.
Clinton then began to shift the subject to news about the U.S. intelligence community accusing Russia of hacking into U.S. political groups in an effort to undermine the election. She went on to accuse Trump of having ties to Russia and called on Trump to release his tax returns. He said he'll release them when his audit is over.
Are we going to have religious tests when people fly into our country? Clinton said, adding that what Trump has said was extremely unwise and dangerous.
The November election will test McCaskill's luck, and her campaigning skills.
Our approach is based on principled realism — not discredited theories that have failed for decades to yield progress. For this reason, my Administration recognized the true capital of Israel — and proudly opened the American Embassy in Jerusalem.
I am so relieved it's all over.No more debates.No more threats of theatrics.They were CLEAR- we now know who each is. NOW WE the people vote — Debra Messing (@DebraMessing) October 20, 2016
VIA CBS NEWS CAMPAIGN REPORTER ZAK HUDAK Tom Steyer's ad blitzes have kept him on the debate stage, but the billionaire climate activist will likely need earned media to rise above his middle-of-the-road polling numbers. The debate stage is an opportunity for him to tout his status as the earliest candidate to call for Mr. Trump's impeachment. But with campaign scandals in both Iowa and South Carolina since the last debate, Steyer could himself be a target for any opponent looking to score easy points.
Preliminary reporting shows those predictions are accurate. In a study of 14 major metro areas by the Kaiser Family Foundation, premiums for the second-lowest-cost silver medical plans (the plans that tax credits are based on) are expected to rise an average of 11 percent in 2017. In the cities Kaiser studied, complete data was available on insurer premium change requests. It found the changes range from a decrease of 13 percent in Providence, Rhode Island, to an increase of 18 percent in Portland, Oregon.
The Muslim ban is something that in some form has morphed into some extreme vetting for certain areas of the world, Trump said.
The agenda I will lay out this evening is not a Republican agenda or a Democrat agenda. It is the agenda of the American people.
Still, the insurance isn't as comprehensive as one might imagine a federal judge or Supreme Court justice would get. Unlike the so-called Cadillac plans that top corporate executives often enjoy that fully cover a host of health care expenses, the federal plans have deductibles, premium costs, co-pays and other out-of-pocket expenses.
Jesse Weber, an attorney and anchor on the Law & Crime Network, told CBS This Morning Saturday that the ruling was not unexpected.
9:46 p.m. ET Clinton said that Trump has repeatedly lied about not initially supporting the war in Iraq even though that claim has been debunked.
Democrats will also have the majority in the House next year. Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi, the presumptive speaker of the House of the incoming Congress, said that the House will move swiftly to formally intervene in the appeals process to uphold the life-saving protections for people with pre-existing conditions and reject Republicans' effort to destroy the Affordable Care Act. This resolution would allow the House general counsel to defend the health care law on the chamber's behalf.
But how do you get at least 50 votes in the Senate, especially after efforts to repeal and replace Obamacare failed to garner the support of all Republican senators?
Washington — The federal health insurance marketplace, Healthcare.gov, reopened Monday for a special enrollment period that will run through mid-May as part of efforts by President Biden to ensure that Americans in need of insurance coverage during the coronavirus pandemic have access to health care.
Expected to last four days, Monday's hearing will feature opening statements from the panel's 22 members, as well as introductions of Barrett by Indiana Senators Todd Young and Mike Braun, and Patricia O'Hara, the former dean of Notre Dame Law School.
If there is going to be peace and legislation, there cannot be war and investigation. It just doesn't work that way!
Tonight, I am also asking you to join me in another fight that all Americans can get behind: the fight against childhood cancer.
Pauley said, President Trump hasn't given you a nickname, that I know of.
Clinton said she supports an investigation of the Russians and Syrians committing war crimes in Syria.
Without the ACA, insurers could once again charge copayments or coinsurance for preventive care, including screenings, immunizations, annual checkups and birth control. Medicare beneficiaries could again have to pay for certain services, including screenings for breast cancer, colorectal cancer, cardiovascular disease and diabetes. The law also closed the infamous doughnut hole in Medicare's prescription drug coverage that left many older people paying thousands of dollars out of pocket for their medication.
This new era of cooperation can start with finally confirming the more than 300 highly qualified nominees who are still stuck in the Senate – some after years of waiting. The Senate has failed to act on these nominations, which is unfair to the nominees and to our country.
Are you recalibrating your assessment of how you can work with this president?
Yeah, I think, I think so. If you're effective, you're a target. There's just no question.
It includes humanitarian assistance, more law enforcement, drug detection at our ports, closing loopholes that enable child smuggling, and plans for a new physical barrier, or wall, to secure the vast areas between our ports of entry. In the past, most of the people in this room voted for a wall — but the proper wall never got built. I'll get it built.
So, you have to remind him of that periodically?
Romney, who has been stung by charges of flip-flopping in the past, said his federal health care proposal had not changed from 2008, when he last ran for president -- even though his decision to sign the law has seemingly gone from a political asset to a liability.
If they put everyone on Medicare, we seniors will be next in the line for bullet in the head… because they can't afford Medicare for everyone… it would not work, Greenstreet said.
California's Senate seat will definitely remain in Democratic hands. Incumbent Sen. Dianne Feinstein overwhelmingly won her primary against state Sen. Kevin De Leon, who challenged Feinstein from the left. However, Feinstein and De Leon are both on the November ballot, due to California's practice of advancing the top two vote-getters in a primary, regardless of party.
During a question and answer period following Romney's address, he said the Massachusetts law wasn't perfect, adding that there were a number of things the state could have done differently. But he said he was proud that he signed a law that helped get residents insured and was in the interest of the people of Massachusetts.
Clinton said she supports an investigation of the Russians and Syrians committing war crimes in Syria.
One of the most complex set of challenges we face is in the Middle East.
A cost estimate of the bill from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) is expected to be released by early next week. White House staff met with Senate Republican staffers Wednesday night on Capitol Hill to review the bill.
Republican Gov. Rick Scott, who is prevented from seeking a third term due to term limits, is challenging Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson in one of the country's most contentious races. State and national Democrats are concerned about the prospects of victory for Nelson, who has been in office since 2001.
She said she has a positive and optimistic view of the country's direction.
The vice president attacked the Democratic challenger for not revealing his positions on issues such as Obamacare.
Sayegh's boss, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, and National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn have spent the last few months speaking with over 200 members of Congress, including Democrats, and hundreds of business leaders, trade associations, home builders and manufacturers in order to whip up support for their tax plan.
Honorable mentions: New Jersey, Mississippi and California
Use it — and lose it coverage
In an attempt to address perhaps his greatest political vulnerability, likely 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney on Thursday said there are clear differences between the health care law he signed into law as Massachusetts governor and the Obamacare federal health care law disdained by Republicans.
She said, You go into the arena and you understand that you will be a target. And that isn't anything that should keep you out of the arena. And so I always say to women, 'Just be yourself. Be who you are.'
At St. Louis's Schlafly Tap Room, Inskeep met flight attendant Jana Wayne, who didn't vote in 2016, and bartender Shea Bandera, who voted for Donald Trump. Both say he's done a better job than they expected. But for Bandera, there's one thing he doesn't agree with the president on: climate change.
Control of the Senate hinges in part on a race in Missouri. Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill is locked in a close contest with the state's attorney general, Josh Hawley. Missouri voted for President Trump in 2016 and has grown more conservative over time. CBS News contributor and host of NPR's Morning Edition, Steve Inskeep, took a road trip down historic Route 66 for three meals with Missouri voters: breakfast in a small town, lunch in a suburb and dinner in a city.

To build on our incredible economic success, one priority is paramount — reversing decades of calamitous trade policies.
While Biden and Sanders did release a platform to ensure universal health care, it is not Sanders' Medicare for All plan. The platform recommends an affordable and government-run public option health care plan to be made available through the Obamacare exchanges.
Now is the time for the Congress to show the world that America is committed to ending illegal immigration and putting the ruthless coyotes, cartels, drug dealers, and human traffickers out of business.

If you've ever just went in to open something', there's so many papers, there's so many things you've got to do. There's so many taxes you have to file every month. It's like the system is made to be difficult, Cathy said, sounding a bit more like a Republican than a Democrat. I don't want anyone ever to think that I think a Republican can't help me….It does sound like we have a few things in common, right?
Well, I hope so, Pelosi replied. But the fact is, he has said it again and again.
The reality of a herd immunity, which appears to be what the president meant by herd mentality, is not so clear. The scant scientific research the world has so far suggests antibodies only last several months after infection, which seem to make it possible to be reinfected.
That disease started in my skin, moved to my eyes, into my optic nerves, and when I went to graduate school, into my brain, she said.
We meet tonight at a moment of unlimited potential. As we begin a new Congress, I stand here ready to work with you to achieve historic breakthroughs for all Americans.
I would not use American ground forces in Syria, Clinton said. I think that would be a very serious mistake. I don't think that American troops should be holding territory, which is what they would have to do as an occupying force. I don't think that would be a smart strategy.
Some Democratic leaders and officials cited other hurdles for Biden, such as his struggles with fundraising compared to other top candidates, issues with his campaign's organizing ability, and lackluster performances from Biden at campaign stops in Iowa. While several Democratic leaders and officials echoed that the campaign is in trouble, many acknowledged that Biden has been able to hold on to his initial supporters.
Tens of thousands of innocent Americans are killed by lethal drugs that cross our border and flood into our cities — including meth, heroin, cocaine, and fentanyl.
But mask-wearing has proven to decrease the likelihood of transmission of COVID-19. Centers for Disease Control Director Robert Redfield went as far to suggest in congressional testimony Wednesday that masks might be more effective in fighting the virus than a vaccine for some Americans.
The savage gang, MS-13, now operates in 20 different American States, and they almost all come through our southern border. Just yesterday, an MS-13 gang member was taken into custody for a fatal shooting on a subway platform in New York City. We are removing these gang members by the thousands, but until we secure our border they're going to keep streaming back in.
Meanwhile, working class Americans are left to pay the price for mass illegal migration — reduced jobs, lower wages, overburdened schools and hospitals, increased crime, and a depleted social safety net.
I don't take it as a criticism when people say hey, it's great, Obama did what he did and now we want to do more. That's the point.
As part of our military build-up, the United States is developing a state-of-the-art Missile Defense System.
Retiring early or starting a business might become too hazardous if your access to health insurance isn't guaranteed. You might have to wait a year before preexisting conditions are covered by an employer's plan. Young adults could be kicked off their parents' policies. Millions of people who buy insurance through the ACA marketplaces or who now qualify for expanded Medicaid coverage funded by Obamacare in many states could lose their coverage as well.
The events on the federal holiday didn't draw nearly as many people as the million-plus who thronged the streets following the Republican president's inauguration a month earlier, but the message was similar.
In Chicago, CBS News' Roseanne Tellez covered a protest in the city's downtown, where protesters had signs reading Dump Trump and Repeal and replace Trump, not Obamacare!
On Thursday, the president had kind words for Pelosi. I just want to start off by congratulating Nancy Pelosi on being elected Speaker of the House, he said. It's a very, very great achievement. I think it's actually going to work out. I think it'll be a little bit different than a lot of people are thinking.
Vice president says health insurance sign-ups may be short of the 7 million goal during the open-enrollment period but adds he's optimistic regardless
My Administration has sent to the Congress a commonsense proposal to end the crisis on our southern border.
Trump said that her comment was a great compliment.
Supreme Court to hear legal challenge to Affordable Care Act The U.S. Supreme Court will take up a legal challenge to the Affordable Care Act. At issue in the case is the constitutionality of the law's individual mandate. The justices will hear the case in October, meaning it is likely to become a major issue during the presidential campaign. CBS News chief legal correspondent Jan Crawford joins CBSN with more.
She said Sanders would dismantle Obamacare, the Children's Health Insurance Program, and Medicare -- along with private insurance programs.
Other stars praised Clinton for exercising restraint, while criticizing Trump for seeming tense.
I've gotten to know many wonderful Angel Moms, Dads, and families – no one should ever have to suffer the horrible heartache they have endured.
WASHINGTON -- Protecting his signature domestic achievement, President Barack Obama on Friday vetoed legislation to repeal his health care law, saying the measure would reverse the significant progress we have made in improving health care in America.
10:21 p.m. ET Trump is asked if his recent tweet referring a sex tape involving former Miss Universe Alicia Machado shows that he has strong discipline, but he seemed to deny talking about one and then talked about Clinton's role as secretary of state during the 2012 Benghazi attack.
It's going to get done this year. That is the emphasis, that is the focus, and that is what we have been working toward.
9:54 p.m. ET Candidates are asked what specific tax provisions they will change to ensure the wealthy pay their fair share. Trump said he will cut taxes for the middle class, while he said Clinton will raise everybody's classes massively.
America and Freedom have lost one of her greatest champions, Graham tweeted Saturday night. ….And I've lost one of my dearest friends and mentor.
A final decision from the court is expected by June.
Bloomberg also doubled down on his opposition to Medicare for All and a wealth tax.
Bennet, 54, overcame a bout with prostate cancer earlier this year. He was diagnosed in April and quickly underwent surgery, which his office said was completely successful and would require no further treatment. He told CBS his diagnosis was very clarifying, saying he was disappointed at the possibility of never being able to run.
I have a deep devotion...to making sure that every American feels that he or she has a place in our country, she said.
If they don't [report], it's a very difficult situation for our country, Trump said.
Speaking at the University of Michigan, Romney defended the individual mandate in the Massachusetts plan, saying it was necessary to address the free rider problem of state residents declining to buy health care and then showing up at hospitals for care, leaving taxpayers to foot the bill.
In his veto message to Congress, Obama disagreed. Obama said the Affordable Care Act includes fairer rules and stronger consumer protections that have made health care coverage more affordable, more attainable and more patient-centered. And it is working.
Republicans insist that the measures are a way to balance government, and point to legislative moves in 2010 to extend union contracts during the lame duck before Walker took office, though that measure did not limit the power of the governor. For all the talk about reigning in power, it really doesn't, Walker told reporters Monday, according to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.
For about 20 minutes, protesters had been given verbal warnings to clear the street. Some did, while others kept blocking traffic. Police initially arrested three people, according to KOIN, and at least five others were arrested about 10 minutes later.

In an attempt to address perhaps his greatest political vulnerability, likely 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney on Thursday said there are clear differences between the health care law he signed into law as Massachusetts governor and the Obamacare federal health care law disdained by Republicans.
Senators who emerged from the meeting didn't appear entirely confident it would pass next week.
Even if you were able to keep your health insurance, experts say you could face caps on your coverage that expose you to enormous medical bills. Preventive care and birth control could cost you more. Medicare beneficiaries could face higher premiums, deductibles and copays. Insurers could cancel your policy retroactively for even minor mistakes on your application.
Tonight, I am asking you to defend our very dangerous southern border out of love and devotion to our fellow citizens and to our country.
Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-Louisiana, said he's happy that the bill makes an effort to lower premiums immediately, but he said he wants to ensure that as Medicaid is scaled back, We don't lose the the ability for lower-income folks to be able to afford insurance.
Trump made it clear several months before Conway's interview with CNN in April that his returns are under audit and that he wouldn't release them until it is completed.
Whether we like it or not, there is a problem, he said. We have to be sure that Muslims come in and they report what's going on.
Clinton said there's no evidence that classified information was hacked and ended up in the wrong hands.

I understand the tax code better than anyone who's ever run for president, he said. I pay tax and I pay federal tax, too.
Mr. Trump repeated a claim Tuesday night he has made in the past — that COVID-19 is probably going to go away now a lot faster because of the vaccine but would go away without the vaccine.
Liberal stars took Trump to task about his bad hombres comment. Sophia Bush used it as an opportunity to urge fans to vote.
Phoenix-area Rep. Kyrsten Sinema, the likely Democratic nominee, has tried to carve a niche as a more moderate Democrat. According to FiveThirtyEight, Sinema votes in line with President Trump's policies around 60 percent of the time. She is also a member of Democrats' Blue Dog Coalition, a group of more moderate congressional Democrats. However, local Democrats see Sinema as the party's best chance of taking a still-red state.
Be willing to change plans. True, all the jumping around in the marketplaces is making it hard for insurers to estimate costs going forward, but from the consumer perspective, this is one of the best options you have to keep premiums down.

In Rapid City, South Dakota, hundreds of Trump opponents and supporters also turned out. A larger anti-Trump faction stood on a street corner as part of a Not My President protest, similar to other demonstrations being held across the country. A group supporting the president lined up on a different corner at the same intersection.
Lee, of Utah, and Tillis both tested positive for the virus after attending the White House event, and it's unclear whether they will participate in the hearings in person or remotely.
So you may not know me, but over the years I've learned a lot about what Americans struggle with.
Trump is asked how he would replace Obamacare. He said the U.S. would have so much competition in the insurance industry. He said he's going to block grant into the states.
Sen. Dean Heller is widely considered the most vulnerable senator in the majority and is the only Republican senator seeking re-election in a state that Hillary Clinton won in 2016. Although he avoided a potentially tricky primary with Mr. Trump's help, his close ties with the president and his agenda could be fatal to his campaign. In 2017, Heller co-sponsored a bill to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, which would have reportedly cost Nevada $250 million in federal health care funding. Heller said in August that Republicans made a big mistake by tackling Obamacare as their first major legislative move with Trump in office.
Sen. Rand Paul, R-Kentucky, didn't appear to be a fan of the bill.
The special enrollment period, which extends to May 15, allows Americans in need of health insurance to sign up for coverage through Healthcare.gov. Mr. Biden signed an executive order in late January allowing the Department of Health and Human Services to establish the special enrollment period for uninsured and underinsured Americans to seek coverage through the federal marketplace in light of the exceptional circumstances caused by the pandemic.
10:25 p.m. ET Candidates are asked what they would prioritize as the most important aspect of picking a Supreme Court justice.
Biden repeatedly outpolls Mr. Trump in head-to-head matchups, including in pivotal states like Michigan and Pennsylvania. And a clear majority of Democratic voters say the ability to beat Mr. Trump is the single most important attribute a candidate can possess. Jesse Harris, Biden's senior Iowa adviser, said the campaign is looking to get Biden in front of as many Iowans as possible. In an attempt to reach a wider group of voters, Biden's team in Iowa is targeting not just previous caucus-goers and Democrats, but also independents and Republicans.
Why did they do it? They did it for America — they did it for us.
Tonight, I am asking you to defend our very dangerous southern border out of love and devotion to our fellow citizens and to our country.
Sanders said President Trump is calling on Congress to pass a measure that would replace the Affordable Care Act, which is also known as Obamacare. Mr. Trump, who campaigned on repealing the ACA, said in a tweet that Congress must act.
The winner will serve the remainder of Cummings' term into January. The winner also will run as an incumbent in the state's June 2 primary to be his or her party's nominee for a full term. For the upcoming primary, voters also will be strongly urged to vote by mail.
Democrats, meanwhile, are concerned that she would rule to kill the Affordable Care Act, chip away at abortion rights and expand the scope of the Second Amendment.
On Thursday morning, the Senate Republican Conference sat through a closed-door briefing for an hour and a half to learn about the bill's substance. Many inside the meeting didn't actually see the text even though it was posted online.

Coverage for those who make the deadline will begin January 1, a handful of weeks before the program's most prominent opponent, President Trump, leaves office. Mr. Trump campaigned on repealing and replacing Obamacare during the 2016 election, and kept on message, albeit unsuccessfully, throughout his presidency.
Democratic Sen. Doug Jones' victory Alabama proved that the Deep South is indeed vulnerable to a blue wave. Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith was appointed to replace Sen. Thad Cochran in April, and is now trying to win a December special election. She facing a challenge from the right from conservative state Sen. Chris McDaniel. Democrat Mike Espy, a former congressman and secretary of agriculture under President Bill Clinton, is also in the race.
Clinton was campaigning in New Hampshire on behalf of her mother, Hillary Clinton, ostensibly to tout the campaign's early childhood education plan. But she took sharp aim at Sanders, who advocates for a single-payer system that would place control of health care in the hands of the federal government.
The Democratic party doesn't stand for very much at the national level with respect to what the American people think, argued Bennet. A process like this is long overdue in the Democratic party.
9:29 p.m. ET An uncommitted Missouri voter asked what the candidates will do to bring the cost down of healthcare and make costs better. Clinton and Trump argued over who would answer first. Trump said, I'm a gentleman, and he let Clinton answer first.
Biden conceded his plan will cost $750 billion over 10 years, but will reduce prescription drug prices and address surprise billing.

They did not know if they would survive the hour. They did not know if they would grow old. But they knew that America had to prevail. Their cause was this Nation, and generations yet unborn.
I believe very much in improving and strengthening Obamacare, Mfume said in a recent interview.
We are also joined tonight by Matthew Charles from Tennessee. In 1996, at age 30, Matthew was sentenced to 35 years for selling drugs and related offenses. Over the next two decades, he completed more than 30 Bible studies, became a law clerk, and mentored fellow inmates. Now, Matthew is the very first person to be released from prison under the First Step Act. Matthew, on behalf of all Americans: welcome home.
When I took office, ISIS controlled more than 20,000 square miles in Iraq and Syria. Today, we have liberated virtually all of that territory from the grip of these bloodthirsty killers.
This entire tax return debate is somewhat confounding to me, in the following sense: I don't think that it creates one job, gets one more individual who does not have health insurance covered by health insurance, particularly under the disaster that has been Obamacare with these private insurers pulling out our exchanges now and reporting billions of dollars of losses, she told CNN.
10:34 p.m. ET The last question came from an uncommitted voter in the audience. He asked the candidates if they can name one positive thing that each respects about the other.

Then, in 2019, Barrett joined a dissent from the denial of rehearing of a challenge to an Indiana law that would have required doctors to notify the parents of a minor seeking an abortion. A three-judge panel found the law was unconstitutional.
9:38 p.m. ET A Muslim undecided voter asked what the candidates would do to combat Islamophobia that's on the rise.
Sayegh's boss, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, and National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn have spent the last few months speaking with over 200 members of Congress, including Democrats, and hundreds of business leaders, trade associations, home builders and manufacturers in order to whip up support for their tax plan.
Like the vast majority of federal employees of all ranks, the government's judges have the option of enrolling in plans offered by the Federal Employee Health Benefits system. It includes hundreds of plan choices throughout the U.S. -- far more than even the largest private employers. Many plan options also have broad networks of providers, often nationwide.
Medicaid would be phased out under the bill beginning in 2021, with gradual reductions until 2024 in the amount of federal Obamacare funds that have financed the entitlement program's expansion. The Senate bill would also slash funding to Medicaid from what Republicans call gimmicks that drive up federal costs. President Trump repeatedly promised during the 2016 presidential campaign that he would not cut Medicaid, Medicare or Social Security.
As part of our commitment to improving opportunity for women everywhere, this Thursday we are launching the first ever Government-wide initiative focused on economic empowerment for women in developing countries.
Nonetheless, O'Rourke is a long shot. No Democrat has been elected statewide in Texas in 20 years. As in Arizona, O'Rourke's candidacy is a test of how much demographic changes have shifted a solid Republican state to the left, and whether it's enough to elect a Democrat.
To Debra, Heather, Madison, please stand: few can understand your pain. But I will never forget, and I will fight for the memory of Gerald and Sharon, that it should never happen again.
He is loyal to his friends, said an emotional Graham, fighting tears. He loves his country. And if he has to stand up to his party for his country, so be it. He would die for his country. I love him to death.
McCaskill's Republican opponent, state Attorney General Josh Hawley, has been criticized by some in his own party for being too distant, and not campaigning with sufficient vigor. McCaskill has also outraised Hawley, raking in over $4 million in donations during the second quarter, compared to Hawley's $1 million. Early polling has generally shown McCaskill ahead, although a poll from the Republican firm Remington Research in July showed Hawley edging out McCaskill by two percentage points. McCaskill has also recently been knocked by Hawley for using a private plane during a campaign tour.
America and Freedom have lost one of her greatest champions, Graham tweeted Saturday night. ….And I've lost one of my dearest friends and mentor.
I agree with everything she said, said Trump, who added that he is actually a politician.
To get a broader understanding of Barrett's views on abortion, Democrats will likely ask whether she believes Roe and Planned Parenthood v. Casey, a major abortion case from 1992, were rightly decided, as well as for her views on stare decisis, the legal principle that says courts must follow precedent.
10:29 p.m. ET Clinton said that she respects the 2nd Amendment, but wants comprehensive background checks, to close the gun show loophole and Charleston loophole.
Clinton added that she worked to change the adoption and foster care system and she worked to rebuild New York after 9/11 and get healthcare for first responders.
Clinton said she started off as a young lawyer working to fight discrimination against black children in schools.
Later, at a stop in Portsmouth, Clinton made a trip to G. Wilikers toy store where she perused children's books for her 15-month old daughter, Charlotte.
Tonight, we are also joined by Pittsburgh survivor Judah Samet. He arrived at the synagogue as the massacre began. But not only did Judah narrowly escape death last fall — more than seven decades ago, he narrowly survived the Nazi concentration camps. Today is Judah's 81st birthday. Judah says he can still remember the exact moment, nearly 75 years ago, after 10 months in a concentration camp, when he and his family were put on a train, and told they were going to another camp. Suddenly the train screeched to a halt. A soldier appeared. Judah's family braced for the worst. Then, his father cried out with joy: It's the Americans.
Many childhood cancers have not seen new therapies in decades. My budget will ask the Congress for $500 million over the next 10 years to fund this critical life-saving research.

The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee released a statement this weekend touting Edwards' emphasis on expanding Medicaid. Governor John Bel Edwards earned a second term by working to make health care more affordable and accessible for the people he serves in Louisiana...House Republicans are likely reconsidering just how eager they are to rubber stamp President Trump's reckless agenda in Washington, said DCCC Chairwoman Cheri Bustos in a statement.
I don't think 180 million Americans want to give up the insurance they already have through their work or their union, said Bennet.
Trump, however, slammed Obamacare, the situation involving trade and the U.S. border.
At her December 11th meeting at the White House, Mr. Trump spoke to the press about the insurgency. Nancy is in a situation where it's not easy for her to talk right now, he said.
Pence urged Pennsylvania voters to turn out at the polls next month. He argued that with Saccone in office, Congress would end budget cuts to the nation's armed forces and would pass funding to build a border wall.
Democrats are also mounting a fight over materials they claim are missing from her questionnaire submitted to the committee.
Mr. Trump also said Tuesday night that Biden has agreed to a Bernie Sanders-style health care plan. If you look at what they (Democrats) want to do, where they have socialized medicine, they will get rid of pre-existing conditions.
Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer reported the president said he'd keep the government closed for a very long period of time, months or even years – a promise Mr. Trump confirmed at a press briefing later that day.
She is expected to participate in the hearings remotely from her Senate office, her office said, citing Judiciary Committee Republicans' refusal to take commonsense steps to protect members, aides, Capitol complex workers and members of the media.
Plus, with an annual salary of $255,300 for associate Supreme Court justices, this elite group of jurists likely doesn't feel the pain of out-of-pocket costs as much as the average ACA recipient. The high court doesn't disclose how many justices opt for the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program. They are allowed to receive coverage elsewhere, such as through a spouse's plan.
If we repeal it as Donald has proposed and start over again, all of those benefits I just mentioned are lost to everybody, she said.
And to me, it means one of two things; either he doesn't regard you that seriously, that you need a 'gotta cut her down' nickname, or that he has some respect for you.
9:20 p.m. ET Clinton responded by repeating a line from Michelle Obama's 2016 Democratic National Convention speech, When they go low, we go high.
I think we have a long way to go before we know the answer to that question, Sen. Tim Scott, R-South Carolina, said when asked if it could pass next week, adding that the draft version could be modified before a vote happens. I'm open to moving forward on the legislation. We have a lot of time now -- seven days -- to figure out what parts we like about it, what parts we plan to keep. This is only a draft legislation. We're going to make a lot of changes over the next seven days.
Policies also routinely had caps that limited how much insurers had to pay out over someone's lifetime. People who were sick enough could hit those caps and be on the hook for 100% of their medical costs afterward.
The result? On Thursday, many of her staunchest critics ended up casting votes for Pelosi.
No force in history has done more to advance the human condition than American freedom. In recent years we have made remarkable progress in the fight against HIV and AIDS. Scientific breakthroughs have brought a once-distant dream within reach. My budget will ask Democrats and Republicans to make the needed commitment to eliminate the HIV epidemic in the United States within 10 years. Together, we will defeat AIDS in America.
Added Dave Dillon, fellow at the Society of Actuaries: Insurers developed rates for the exchanges back in 2014 with no data. At best it was an educated guess, he explained. It's no wonder lots of insurers underestimated their costs.
Clinton said, We will have vetting that's as tough as it needs to be, but then she asked about Trump's policy about banning people based on a religion, How do we do that?
Baltimore resident Kyle Baylor said he planned to drop off his ballot with a vote for Mfume at the post office. Baylor cited Mfume's experience.
VIA CBS NEWS CAMPAIGN REPORTER JACK TURMAN At a Nevada Democrats First in the West event Sunday night, New Jersey Senator Cory Booker said the presidential election is not about left or right. It is about right and wrong. At the last debate, Booker kept his focus on Mr. Trump and mostly avoided criticizing his fellow Democrats. And at a California Democratic Party Convention in Long Beach this past weekend, Booker reiterated that Democrats need to concentrate on winning back the White House instead of infighting. I'm happy to be in this field and plan on winning, but the one thing I'm going to stop is us tearing each other down, Booker told reporters. After months of struggling in the polls, will Booker look to throw some punches at his Democratic competitors? Or will he continue to focus on Mr. Trump?
But recall the biggest difference: Feds have dramatically more choices than most employees or people shopping the ACA marketplaces for coverage.
Senator Cory Booker says he wants to stop delineating left from right and said the nominee should have the full support of the party to defeat President Trump. Senator Elizabeth Warren, whose tagline is big, structural change, said she is so grateful for what Obama did on healthcare and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Mayor Pete Buttigieg said he agreed with the premise of Mr. Obama's comments and said the role of activists is to lead the country forward but politicians must still balance competing constituencies.
Asked about the packed field of challengers he now faces, Bennet told CBS that it's phenomenal we have an array of candidates that we have calling it a competition of ideas.
In June, we mark 75 years since the start of what General Dwight D. Eisenhower called the Great Crusade — the Allied liberation of Europe in World War II. On D-Day, June 6, 1944, 15,000 young American men jumped from the sky, and 60,000 more stormed in from the sea, to save our civilization from tyranny. Here with us tonight are three of those heroes: Private First Class Joseph Reilly, Staff Sergeant Irving Locker, and Sergeant Herman Zeitchik. Gentlemen, we salute you.
We'll find out soon which party gets their voters to show up in Missouri. President Trump will be holding rallies in the state twice before Election Day.
But mask-wearing has proven to decrease the likelihood of transmission of COVID-19. Centers for Disease Control Director Robert Redfield went as far to suggest in congressional testimony Wednesday that masks might be more effective in fighting the virus than a vaccine for some Americans.
Mr. Trump also claimed herd mentality will help rid the U.S. of the virus.
Mfume, a 71-year-old Democrat who held the seat for five terms from 1987 to 1996, is trying to regain the office he held before Cummings.
Since then, other candidates like Harris and former Housing Secretary Julian Castro have changed their campaign strategies to free-up cash and refocus their efforts. Klobuchar, meanwhile, recently boasted in New Hampshire that while her campaign prides itself on being frugal, they were looking to add staffers and offices, at least in Iowa. The big moments for Klobuchar at the last debate were her strong but polite criticisms of some progressive policies, such as Medicare for All and forgiving student loans. Klobuchar argues that she can deliver better, more politically realistic policies, such as a public option for healthcare and free community college. What will be the key policy difference she highlights this time?
If no candidate gets a majority of votes, there will be a runoff election between the top two candidates. Espy's path to victory is surprisingly plausible: if Espy and McDaniel are the top two candidates, Mississippians may choose the moderate Democrat over the conservative provocateur.
After thousands of Wisconsin voters waited hours in line outside crowded polling stations for that state's recent primary, Maryland sent ballots to eligible voters weeks in advance to encourage as many mail-in votes as possible — in a test of how future elections might safely be held during the pandemic.
Mfume, a 71-year-old Democrat who held the seat for five terms from 1987 to 1996, is trying to regain the office he held before Cummings.
LOS ANGELES -- Thousands of demonstrators turned out Monday across the U.S. to challenge President Donald Trump in a Presidents Day protest dubbed Not My President's Day.

Mr. Trump, who has not followed through on a pledge in July that he would have a health care plan ready and signed in two weeks, said his administration would not get rid of the preexisting conditions coverage that were implemented by the Affordable Care Act. He was responding to Ellesia Blaque, an assistant professor who lives in Philadelphia, who told him she's paying $7,000 a year for life-saving medicine because of a condition she was born with, sarcoidosis.
Our brave troops have now been fighting in the Middle East for almost 19 years. In Afghanistan and Iraq, nearly 7,000 American heroes have given their lives. More than 52,000 Americans have been badly wounded. We have spent more than $7 trillion in the Middle East.
The issues will Barrett will be questioned on
It's really very interesting, Trump said.
That has not been debunked, Trump responded.
Married at 23, she had five children. While active in politics, she didn't begin a political career until age 47.
Mr. Trump said this summer that he was working on an executive order to protect those with preexisting conditions.
Check, check and check again if you qualify for a subsidy. The government estimates that 87 percent of people who buy marketplace plans can receive a subsidy or premium tax credit to help lower costs. Check with Healthcare.gov and update your income information each year to make sure you're getting the assistance you qualify for.
Of course I do, Trump said. Her donors took massive write-offs.
Hillary's wearing my costume from Defending Your Life. — Albert Brooks (@AlbertBrooks) October 20, 2016
Those on the left, meanwhile, pointed to Romney's past statements seemingly in support of a federal mandate, including a 1994 statement that he would back a federal bill that included a mandate. In 2007, Romney said that once states try out their own plans, we'll end up with a nation that's taken a mandate approach.
Are you recalibrating your assessment of how you can work with this president?
That was a great display of presidential leadership, she said.
The incumbent is facing Democratic Rep. Jacky Rosen, who was first elected in 2016 in a district that Mr. Trump won. However, Rosen lacks name recognition across the state. Early polling shows a tight race, with different polls showing either candidate ahead by one percentage point or less.
Clinton said, We will have vetting that's as tough as it needs to be, but then she asked about Trump's policy about banning people based on a religion, How do we do that?
LOS ANGELES -- Thousands of demonstrators turned out Monday across the U.S. to challenge President Donald Trump in a Presidents Day protest dubbed Not My President's Day.
I apologize to my family and I certainly apologize to the American people, added Trump, who then started talking about ISIS.
For his part, Mr. Trump criticized the ACA and praised Republicans in Congress for excising the individual mandate from the law. He also said he asked his administration to run [Obamacare] as well as you can, and said the cost of premiums have declined.
The move to start in Arizona comes as Bloomberg is taking the path less traveled in the presidential race. He will not appear on the ballot in some early-voting states, such as New Hampshire, and he has hinted that he will not compete in other early states like Iowa.
To any American who's got a problem with John McCain's vote, all I can tell you is John McCain was willing to die for this country, and he can vote any way he wants to, and it doesn't matter to me, the South Carolina senator said.
WASHINGTON -- Protecting his signature domestic achievement, President Barack Obama on Friday vetoed legislation to repeal his health care law, saying the measure would reverse the significant progress we have made in improving health care in America.
There could be no greater contrast to the beautiful image of a mother holding her infant child than the chilling displays our Nation saw in recent days. Lawmakers in New York cheered with delight upon the passage of legislation that would allow a baby to be ripped from the mother's womb moments before birth. These are living, feeling, beautiful babies who will never get the chance to share their love and dreams with the world. And then, we had the case of the Governor of Virginia where he basically stated he would execute a baby after birth.
On Thursday, the president had kind words for Pelosi. I just want to start off by congratulating Nancy Pelosi on being elected Speaker of the House, he said. It's a very, very great achievement. I think it's actually going to work out. I think it'll be a little bit different than a lot of people are thinking.
For the record, Hillary soberly explaining Obamacare made Trump think she's such a nasty woman. It's over, Donny. Bye. #debates — Patton Oswalt (@pattonoswalt) October 20, 2016
In Chicago, CBS News' Roseanne Tellez covered a protest in the city's downtown, where protesters had signs reading Dump Trump and Repeal and replace Trump, not Obamacare!
Trump claimed that in San Bernardino last year many people saw the bombs all over the apartment.
VIA CBS NEWS CAMPAIGN REPORTER ZAK HUDAK Over the past month, Elizabeth Warren has faced more criticism than at any point since the early days of her campaign. The drama began at the last debate when her opponents swung at her from all sides.
The issues will Barrett will be questioned on
9:49 p.m. ET Martha Raddatz said the leaked emails of Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta showed excerpts from Clinton's paid speeches to Wall Street and that Clinton said you need both a public and private position on certain issues. Uncommitted voters asked if it's okay for politicians to be too-faced.
In the last Congress, both parties came together to pass unprecedented legislation to confront the opioid crisis, a sweeping new Farm Bill, historic VA reforms, and after four decades of rejection, we passed VA Accountability so we can finally terminate those who mistreat our wonderful veterans.
They did not know if they would survive the hour. They did not know if they would grow old. But they knew that America had to prevail. Their cause was this Nation, and generations yet unborn.
Well, let me first say that our purpose in the meeting at the White House was to open up government, said Pelosi. The impression you get from the president [is] that he would like to not only close government, build a wall, but also abolish Congress so the only voice that mattered was his own.
Democrats were able to retake the House in large part because they campaigned on health care issues, warning that Republicans would try to strip away some of the more popular provisions of the ACA, such as protection for pre-existing conditions. Around 130 million people in the United States have pre-existing conditions, and without the ACA, insurers would no longer be required to cover those conditions.
Senate Democrats will likely push Barrett to commit to recusing herself from any election-related disputes that come before the high court. But it's unlikely she will do so, as each individual justice decides whether to sit out a case.
The Muslim ban is something that in some form has morphed into some extreme vetting for certain areas of the world, Trump said.
In Salt Lake City, hundreds of protesters chanting This is what democracy looks like marched. The Salt Lake Tribune reports that the crowd marched to push back against Mr. Trump and his administration's stance on such issues as the environment, immigration, free speech and Russia.
Tonight, I am also asking you to pass the United States Reciprocal Trade Act, so that if another country places an unfair tariff on an American product, we can charge them the exact same tariff on the same product that they sell to us.
Garland's failed confirmation in 2016 is providing the backdrop for Barrett's nomination fight. While Democrats say voters should have a voice in choosing the president who fills Ginsburg's seat, Republicans argue this vacancy is different from the fight in 2016, as the same party controls the Senate and the White House.
Republican Sen. Bob Corker's departure has left Tennessee open to Democratic takeover. Rep. Marsha Blackburn, the Republican candidate, is facing a challenge from former Gov. Phil Bredesen, a popular moderate Democrat. Bredesen is ahead of Blackburn in early polling.
This is the time to re-ignite the American imagination. This is the time to search for the tallest summit, and set our sights on the brightest star. This is the time to rekindle the bonds of love and loyalty and memory that link us together as citizens, as neighbors, as patriots.
In a nearly 4-minute long campaign video released Thursday morning titled 7,591 words (a nod to the word count of the U.S. Constitution) Bennet makes the case that politics and governing aren't the same thing.
This year, America will recognize two important anniversaries that show us the majesty of America's mission, and the power of American pride.
The second is plank is to empower individual ownership, in part by giving a tax deduction to those who buy their own insurance. The third is to focus federal regulation, partially by allowing people to purchase insurance across state lines.
In Miami, protesters voiced their frustration.
At issue in the case brought by a group of Republican-led states — which are backed by the Trump administration — is whether the health care law's individual mandate to have health insurance is unconstitutional, since Congress abolished the financial penalty for individuals who do not purchase health insurance in its overhaul of the tax code in 2017. The justices are also tasked with deciding whether the rest of Obamacare can survive if the individual mandate is invalidated.

One of the most complex set of challenges we face is in the Middle East.
Tolerance for illegal immigration is not compassionate — it is cruel. One in three women is sexually assaulted on the long journey north. Smugglers use migrant children as human pawns to exploit our laws and gain access to our country.
Mr. Trump nominated Barrett, a judge on the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, to succeed the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg on the Supreme Court last month. If Barrett, 48, is confirmed, she will be Mr. Trump's third appointment, and her addition to the nation's highest court will expand its conservative majority to 6-3.
In Washington, D.C., several hundred demonstrated. Dozens gathered around the fountain in Dupont Circle chanting Dump Trump and Love, not hate: That's what makes America great.
She added that she wants the Supreme Court to reverse Citizens United, to understand that voting rights is still a big country in parts of the country and she wants the high court to respect the Roe v. Wade ruling.
A new review in Frontiers in Public Health says COVID-19 will likely become seasonal eventually.
While many insurers have put in requests to raise premiums, a lot of marketplaces have new entrants that are offering competitive or below-market rates. That's why it's so important to shop the exchanges every open-enrollment period.
Mr. Obama was also a topic of discussion at the debate in July when candidates argued over whether or not Obamacare went far enough as well as that administration's immigration policies. On Friday, Mr. Obama indirectly responded to those comments in his interview with Abrams.
She has such a complex and nuanced plan, Clinton said after referencing her mother's record from when she was a New York senator. That's why Paul Krugman and others have said hers goes the farthest to regulate and rein in Wall Street and to increase the chance that we will never have 2008 ever again.
Not the one I thought would be wearing a white power suit. #debate — Taran Killam (@TaranKillam) October 20, 2016
A major factor relates to one of Obamacare's greatest strengths. Now that people with preexisting conditions qualify for coverage, insurers may have underestimated the amount of health care services these people need. In addition, special subsidies given to insurers in the beginning of Obamacare have come to an end. That's on top of rising health care costs in general, especially prescription drug costs.
Not one more American life should be lost because our Nation failed to control its very dangerous border.
We will not avert our eyes from a regime that chants death to America and threatens genocide against the Jewish people. We must never ignore the vile poison of anti-Semitism, or those who spread its venomous creed. With one voice, we must confront this hatred anywhere and everywhere it occurs.
10:10 p.m. ET Martha Raddatz said that his running mate, Mike Pence, recently said that the U.S. should be prepared to use military force to strike the military targets of the Assad regime and that provocations by Russia need to be met with American strength.
Thank you. God Bless You, God Bless America, and good night!
Arizona's primary election is on August 28.
9:54 p.m. ET Candidates are asked what specific tax provisions they will change to ensure the wealthy pay their fair share. Trump said he will cut taxes for the middle class, while he said Clinton will raise everybody's classes massively.
VIA CBS NEWS CAMPAIGN REPORTER CARA KORTE The big question in last month's debate for Bernie Sanders was how he would perform just a few weeks after his heart attack, a test he passed easily. Since then, Sanders has seen bumps in polling while Warren has struggled.
Another historic trade blunder was the catastrophe known as NAFTA.
Senate Democrats have made the future of Obamacare a focal point of their opposition to Barrett's nomination, especially since the Supreme Court is set to hear a challenge to the Obama-era healthcare law November 10, just seven day after the election.
Celebrities had a lot to say about Wednesday's presidential debate, especially when it came to Hillary Clinton's white pantsuit and Donald Trump's nasty woman and bad hombres comments.
The Trump White House has said that the law will remain in place for now. The ruling is certain to be appealed.
Expected to last four days, Monday's hearing will feature opening statements from the panel's 22 members, as well as introductions of Barrett by Indiana Senators Todd Young and Mike Braun, and Patricia O'Hara, the former dean of Notre Dame Law School.
Biden was in Minneapolis for a private Democratic National Committee fundraiser but stopped at Moose & Sadie's coffee shop specifically to talk about the Affordable Care Act. He met with four women who were invited there to talk about the law, the Star-Tribune reported.
I ask the men and women of this Congress: Look at the opportunities before us! Our most thrilling achievements are still ahead. Our most exciting journeys still await. Our biggest victories are still to come. We have not yet begun to dream.

The debate comes about two weeks after the two nominees last faced off at their first debate and after major revelations have surfaced about Trump's past.
In this special DEBATE edition of Trail Markers, the CBS News Political Unit gives a rundown of what to watch for from the 10 presidential candidates who made it to the stage plus other political news of the day.
It's no surprise that someone named Obama vetoed a bill repealing Obamacare, House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wisconsin, said in a video released Friday. This law will collapse under its own weight or it will be repealed...Next year, if we're sending this bill to a Republican president, it will get signed into law. Obamacare will be gone.
For weeks, reporters pressed him on using the Defense Production Act to ramp up production of much-needed medical supplies before the president took action. He also claimed the virus would go from 15 cases down to zero quickly, and has insisted that the virus will eventually disappear. He has also been slow to embrace social distancing measures and practices like wearing a mask that scientists have encouraged to arrest the spread of COVID-19.
The president claimed he in fact up-played COVID-19, after telling Washington Post journalist Bob Woodward he always wanted to play it down.
Hillary Clinton's communications director, Jennifer Palmieri, issued a statement on the event.
Always protecting people with pre-existing [conditions], the president said. We're going to do even better.
As we work to defend our people's safety, we must also ensure our economic resurgence continues at a rapid pace.
9:04 p.m. ET Moderators CNN's Anderson Cooper and ABC News' Martha Raddatz are kicking off the debate now.
Wages are rising at the fastest pace in decades, and growing for blue collar workers, who I promised to fight for, faster than anyone else. Nearly 5 million Americans have been lifted off food stamps. The United States economy is growing almost twice as fast today as when I took office, and we are considered far and away the hottest economy anywhere in the world. Unemployment has reached the lowest rate in half a century. African-American, Hispanic-American and Asian-American unemployment have all reached their lowest levels ever recorded. Unemployment for Americans with disabilities has also reached an all-time low. More people are working now than at any time in our history –- 157 million.
If she's president of the United States, nothing is ever going to happen...She's all talk. It doesn't get done.
Trump is asked how he would replace Obamacare. He said the U.S. would have so much competition in the insurance industry. He said he's going to block grant into the states.

In 2003, Bennet became the chief of staff to then-Denver Mayor John Hickenlooper, who is also running for the Democratic presidential nomination. He left Hickenlooper's office in 2005 to become superintendent of the Denver Public School system, where he helped pass a merit pay system for teachers. He was later appointed to fill the Senate seat vacated by Ken Salazar in 2009 and promptly re-elected the following year.
The House bill, which narrowly passed in a 217-213 vote on May 4, would significantly reduce the funding for Obamacare subsidies, revamp tax credits so that they're tied to a person's age, freeze the Medicaid expansion in 2020 and allow states to seek waivers from a rule that requires states to offer essential benefits in their plans and a provision that prevents insurers from charging people with pre-existing conditions more money compared to healthy people. Instead of Obamacare's insurance mandate, the House Republican bill would incentivize people to have continuous coverage. Should coverage be interrupted for more than 63 days, insurers would be able to charge a 30 percent penalty over the original premium for one year.
Absent a vaccine, I think it would quite likely become like seasonal flu or perhaps like some of the other coronaviruses that we are familiar with, Bill Hanage, an associate professor of epidemiology at Harvard University's School of Public Health, told USA Today earlier this year. It is entirely plausible that this could become part of our regular landscape of respiratory viraI infections.

The second is plank is to empower individual ownership, in part by giving a tax deduction to those who buy their own insurance. The third is to focus federal regulation, partially by allowing people to purchase insurance across state lines.
Klacik, 38, has campaigned on economic development. She wants to help struggling parts of Baltimore through a federal program known as opportunity zones. Supported by Trump, the program focuses on increasing private investment in distressed communities with tax incentives for people who invest in real estate projects and operate businesses in designated low-income communities.
Now, though, the fate of an estimated 20 million Americans covered under the ACA lies in the hands of these well-covered judges. Judge O'Connor's Friday ruling that the ACA is unconstitutional came in response to a lawsuit filed earlier this year by a group of Republican governors and state attorneys general.
The Obama administration, he said, citing the health care law, fundamentally doesn't believe in that American experiment. The administration distrusts the idea that states are where the power of government resides, he added.
When ABC News moderator George Stephanopoulos asked the president to clarify if he believes the virus will go away without a vaccine, Mr. Trump responded, Sure, over a period of time.
To Debra, Heather, Madison, please stand: few can understand your pain. But I will never forget, and I will fight for the memory of Gerald and Sharon, that it should never happen again.
Over the last 2 years, we have begun to fully rebuild the United States Military — with $700 billion last year and $716 billion this year. We are also getting other nations to pay their fair share. For years, the United States was being treated very unfairly by NATO — but now we have secured a $100 billion increase in defense spending from NATO allies.
Eyes will also be on Senator Kamala Harris of California, the Democratic vice presidential nominee. A former prosecutor, Harris garnered attention for her questioning of Justice Brett Kavanaugh during his contentious confirmation hearings in 2018.
Nancy Pelosi is arguably the most galvanizing and polarizing figure in politics. She would not argue, having been featured in thousands of attack ads.
Another rally was held midday in Portland and was peaceful, KOIN reported. Both groups were protesting the Trump administration.
The Senate's version was supposedly crafted by a working group consisting of 13 Republican men -- and no women -- but one of the group's participants, Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, said even he had been left in the dark. Lee said the measure was apparently being written by a small handful of staffers for members of the Republican leadership in the Senate.
She also, unlike Sen. Sanders, has articulated how she's going to pay for that proposal, Chelsea Clinton said of Hillary Clinton's plan.
He shared the statement via a Facebook live feed.
Yes, I think he should release his tax returns immediately, Stone said in the interview, first reported by Buzzfeed.
7:30 p.m. ET The second general election debate between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump is slated to kick off in about 90 minutes on the campus of Washington Unviersity in St. Louis, Missouri.
10:01 p.m. ET Trump accused Clinton of being an ineffective senator. Clinton said that as first lady, she helped get through the Children's Health Insurance Fund, which has provided health insurance to 8 million kids, she said.
9:25 p.m. ET Martha Raddatz asked Clinton if it was extremely careless of her to operate a personal email server as secretary of state in which 110 classified emails were exchanged.
She said, When my youngest daughter, Alexandra, was going into senior year, I [said], 'Alexandra, Mommy has a chance to run for Congress. But you have one more year at home, so I'm hesitant to do that. If you don't think I should go, I won't, and I'm happy with that decision.' And she said, 'Mother, get a life!' What teenage girl wouldn't want her mother out of the house three nights a week!
10:37 p.m. ET The debate has ended. Trump and Clinton just shook hands -- they didn't at the beginning.
To ensure this corrupt dictatorship never acquires nuclear weapons, I withdrew the United States from the disastrous Iran nuclear deal. And last fall, we put in place the toughest sanctions ever imposed on a country.
But we must reject the politics of revenge, resistance, and retribution — and embrace the boundless potential of cooperation, compromise, and the common good.
We must choose between greatness or gridlock, results or resistance, vision or vengeance, incredible progress or pointless destruction.
Senator Bernie Sanders opened eight new offices across the state this past weekend, according to the campaign. Sanders now has 22 offices and over 133 staffers on the ground, both among the most of any campaign in Iowa says Bidar. The campaign also says it knocked on more than 11,000 doors in the last 48 hours, adding to the over 100,000 doors they have knocked since the launch of the campaign. This comes after Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez campaigned for Sanders in Iowa this month.
Then again, increased Medicare spending and reduced revenues will deplete the system's trust fund faster. The current insolvency date, with ACA in place, is 2028; after that point, Medicare's revenues won't be enough to cover all of its promised benefits.
8:52 p.m. ET The debate -- a town hall meeting -- will begin in just a few minutes around 9 p.m. ET.
VIA CBS NEWS CAMPAIGN REPORTER JACK TURMAN South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg drew sharp contrasts with his progressive competitors, Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, on health care in the last debate. In contrast to Warren and Sanders' embrace of Medicare for All, which would eliminate most private insurance plans, Buttigieg's health care plan calls for a public option and does not eliminate private insurance plans.
We expect this ruling will be appealed to the Supreme Court. Pending the appeal process, the law remains in place, White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said in a statement.
Still, the insurance isn't as comprehensive as one might imagine a federal judge or Supreme Court justice would get. Unlike the so-called Cadillac plans that top corporate executives often enjoy that fully cover a host of health care expenses, the federal plans have deductibles, premium costs, co-pays and other out-of-pocket expenses.
In advance of the speech, which the Romney campaign billed as major, the conservative Wall Street Journal editorial page hammered the Massachusetts Republican on the issue, writing: Mr. Romney now claims ObamaCare should be repealed, but his failure to explain his own role or admit any errors suggests serious flaws both in his candidacy and as a potential President.
The trip started before dawn at Shelly's Route 66 Café in the small town of Cuba, Missouri – where friends gather, and strangers are made to feel welcome, their slogan goes.
The Democratic party doesn't stand for very much at the national level with respect to what the American people think, argued Bennet. A process like this is long overdue in the Democratic party.
This bill will result in higher costs, less care and millions of Americans will lose their health insurance, particularly through Medicaid, Schumer added.
There could be no greater contrast to the beautiful image of a mother holding her infant child than the chilling displays our Nation saw in recent days. Lawmakers in New York cheered with delight upon the passage of legislation that would allow a baby to be ripped from the mother's womb moments before birth. These are living, feeling, beautiful babies who will never get the chance to share their love and dreams with the world. And then, we had the case of the Governor of Virginia where he basically stated he would execute a baby after birth.
Last week, the administration reported that nearly 3.3 million people have selected marketplace plans as of Feb. 1. Health and Human Services officials have said they are satisfied with the pace of enrollment.
There's riots and people have become so divided. Instead of being American citizens, they decided to either be one side or the other. I think that that is just horrible, Nickel said.
Still, it might be more instructive if federal judges give a little thought to why their health insurance option works so well. That's primarily because federal employees are a large, diversified pool of patients, with varying ages, demographics and health care needs. Such a pool helps insurers spread risk among young, healthy participants and those who are older or have more health care needs. The large pool also helps the government negotiate with insurers to keep costs down.
I began this evening by honoring three soldiers who fought on D-Day in the Second World War. One of them was Herman Zeitchik. But there is more to Herman's story. A year after he stormed the beaches of Normandy, Herman was one of those American soldiers who helped liberate Dachau. He was one of the Americans who helped rescue Joshua from that hell on earth. Almost 75 years later, Herman and Joshua are both together in the gallery tonight — seated side-by-side, here in the home of American freedom. Herman and Joshua: your presence this evening honors and uplifts our entire Nation.
I have also accelerated our negotiations to reach a political settlement in Afghanistan. Our troops have fought with unmatched valor — and thanks to their bravery, we are now able to pursue a political solution to this long and bloody conflict.
Since the first debate, The New York Times has also reported that Trump's 1995 tax returns, which it obtained, show that he posted a $916 million loss that year, which means he could have avoided paying federal income taxes for up to 18 years.
Others took more offense to his nasty woman comment. Leslie Jones tweeted, She is 'nasty woman' he can't take it at all. Just a whiny little b***h!! Debra Messing retweeted a tweet that said, Retweet if you are a #NastyWoman.
Tonight, I am also asking you to pass the United States Reciprocal Trade Act, so that if another country places an unfair tariff on an American product, we can charge them the exact same tariff on the same product that they sell to us.
President Trump was in the spotlight Tuesday night for a rare town hall in Philadelphia with undecided voters, where he fielded questions on topics including the coronavirus pandemic and health care, which have been on the minds of many voters.
We're not surprised to see Donald Trump continue his destructive race to the bottom. Hillary Clinton understands the opportunity in this town hall is to talk to voters on stage and in the audience about the issues that matter to them, and this stunt doesn't change that. If Donald Trump doesn't see that, that's his loss. As always, she's prepared to handle whatever Donald Trump throws her way.
CBS News' Nancy Cordes and Alan He contributed to this report.
The final part of my agenda is to protect America's National Security.
Pressed further to say whether he had actually engaged in such behavior, Trump claimed he hasn't.
The Republican-controlled Senate is charging ahead with Barrett's confirmation at a pace that is uncharacteristic of the upper chamber, as they and Mr. Trump want her confirmed before the general election on November 3. But Democrats are casting Barrett's nomination as illegitimate, citing the proximity to Election Day.
Sen. Rand Paul, R-Kentucky, didn't appear to be a fan of the bill.
In a departure from his fellow Democratic contenders, Bennet, who supports creating a public option for health care while making private insurances available on Obamacare marketplaces, noted in his campaign rollout video that the answer to the nation's health care woes does cannot be found in far-left policies like Medicare-for-All.
The 142-page measure would provide tax credits, based on income, age and geography, which would make more money available to lower income recipients to help them buy insurance. This differs from the House bill, which tied its tax credits to age. Obamacare taxes would be repealed under the bill. The Senate bill would provide for expanded tax-free Health Savings Accounts, and it would also eliminate federal funding for Planned Parenthood.
Arizona has also been a focus of Priorities USA, a Democratic super PAC seeking to mobilize Latinos in Arizona and Florida.
That question seems fair to ask in light of U.S. District Judge Reed O'Connor's ruling on Friday striking down the Affordable Care Act -- the 2010 law passed under President Barack Obama that expanded health insurance to millions of Americans -- as unconstitutional. O'Connor's decision looks certain to be appealed by a group of Democratic state attorneys general, first to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit and then likely to the Supreme Court.
It's already affecting us right now. I mean, we're having record floods, we're having record hurricanes, Bandera said.

Republican-led legislatures in Wisconsin and Michigan in lame duck sessions are aiming to limit the powers of incoming Democratic governors in their states, prompting sore loser allegations from opponents who say lawmakers are undermining voters. But the moves also raise broader questions about whether such efforts have become the new normal in a political environment in which state bodies are becoming more partisan--and more powerful.
10:37 p.m. ET The debate has ended. Trump and Clinton just shook hands -- they didn't at the beginning.
Vice president says health insurance sign-ups may be short of the 7 million goal during the open-enrollment period but adds he's optimistic regardless
Mr. Trump nominated Barrett to the Supreme Court in a ceremony in the White House Rose Garden where there was limited social distancing and few wore masks. Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's leading infectious diseases expert, described the ceremony to CBS News as a super-spreader event because so many of the attendees, including the president and first lady Melania Trump, soon tested positive for COVID-19.
I respect his children, Clinton said, adding that it says a lot about Trump. I don't agree with nearly anything else he does or says.
Biden repeatedly outpolls Mr. Trump in head-to-head matchups, including in pivotal states like Michigan and Pennsylvania. And a clear majority of Democratic voters say the ability to beat Mr. Trump is the single most important attribute a candidate can possess. Jesse Harris, Biden's senior Iowa adviser, said the campaign is looking to get Biden in front of as many Iowans as possible. In an attempt to reach a wider group of voters, Biden's team in Iowa is targeting not just previous caucus-goers and Democrats, but also independents and Republicans.
Here, in the United States, we are alarmed by new calls to adopt socialism in our country. America was founded on liberty and independence –- not government coercion, domination, and control. We are born free, and we will stay free. Tonight, we renew our resolve that America will never be a socialist country.
With the House impeachment hearings in full force, Biden has continued to defend himself and his son, Hunter, from the Trump administration's allegations of wrongdoing in Ukraine. The keen interest the administration has taken in the Bidens is now a main topic of the former vice president's trail speeches, where it is cited as proof that the president thinks Biden would be his toughest general election opponent.
In April, the administration put out a one-page document laying out a rough blueprint of their goals: Reduce seven tax brackets to three and repeal the alternative minimum and death taxes for individuals, as well as cut the business tax rate down to 15 percent. They also promised that more details would emerge in the coming months. Sayegh says those are still being ironed out.
9:07 p.m. ET A voter in the audience asked if the candidates can display appropriate behavior for youth. Clinton, who won the coin toss to answer first, said it is very important for Americans to make clear to children that our country is really great because we're good.
Across the table, Diane Nickel fears social unrest.
A month after longtime Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker lost his re-election bid to Democrat Tony Evers, Republican lawmakers moved forward with legislation to curb his successor's power over a key economic development agency and over state litigation, including a lawsuit over Obamacare. The measure, which will be voted on Tuesday, would also limit early voting to two weeks. Another proposal to move the date of the 2020 presidential primary, so as not to coincide with the re-election of a conservative state supreme court justice, did not advance out of committee.
We passed a massive tax cut for working families and doubled the child tax credit.
Pauley asked Pelosi, Was that bluster? Hyperbole?
Clinton said, We've got to remain energy independent. She said she has a comprehensive energy plan that includes fighting climate change.
The fact is, President Trump is about the only one who's spending any money here and in some of the other swing states around the country, Bloomberg told reporters. That's a big problem for our party, and I am determined to change exactly that.
Barrett wrote Roberts pushed the Affordable Care Act beyond its plausible meaning to save the statute. His decision, she continued, might be explained by the fact that Chief Justice Roberts has not proven himself to be a textualist in matters of statutory interpretation, unlike Scalia, a staunch textualist and originalist.
Some Democratic leaders and officials cited other hurdles for Biden, such as his struggles with fundraising compared to other top candidates, issues with his campaign's organizing ability, and lackluster performances from Biden at campaign stops in Iowa. While several Democratic leaders and officials echoed that the campaign is in trouble, many acknowledged that Biden has been able to hold on to his initial supporters.
How do you stop the descending spiral? says Wisconsin Democratic strategist Joe Zepecki. Every two years this just gets worse and worse...what you're seeing is more behavior in state legislatures and at the state level that is similar to what we're seeing in Congress.
I wouldn't do it if I didn't think I had a chance to win, Bennet, the 22nd Democrat to enter the race, told The Colorado Independent shortly after his diagnosis. I think, like everyone else does, it's a long shot. But I think everyone in the field is a long shot.
10:31 p.m. ET Candidates are asked what steps their energy policies will take to meet Americans' needs while limiting job losses and not damaging the environment.
Caroline Linton contributed to this report.
Sen. Sanders wands to devolve the authority to set up state health insurance programs to individual state governors, Clinton continued. Now maybe if I lived in a place like New Hampshire, with your governor, I would feel okay about that. But if I lived in a state that had a Republican governor, particularly a Republican governor who already turned down Medicaid expansion matching funds, I don't think I would be comfortable, right? Because I don't want to live in a country that has an unequal health care system again.
It's unlikely that Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez is going to lose his re-election effort in New Jersey in November, but it is not outside the realm of possibility. After a hung jury was unable to come to a verdict on federal corruption-related charges, the government dropped the case against Menendez, but the specter of his alleged misdeeds overshadows his campaign.

That gave me a chance to think about whether I really wanted to run or not, he said.
In a statement, Evers called the moves unfettered attempts to override and ignore what the people of Wisconsin asked for this November...this is rancor and politics as usual.
Tolerance for illegal immigration is not compassionate — it is cruel. One in three women is sexually assaulted on the long journey north. Smugglers use migrant children as human pawns to exploit our laws and gain access to our country.
To bolster their case against Barrett, Democrats cite an essay she wrote in 2017, in which Barrett was critical of Chief Justice John Roberts' majority opinion in the blockbuster 2012 Supreme Court case upholding Obamacare's individual mandate.
At issue in the case was the individual mandate, which requires people to have health insurance. The penalty for not having insurance was dropped to $0 in the most recent tax legislation, potentially undercutting the Supreme Court's decision in 2012 that the Affordable Care Act was constitutional because of Congress' ability to tax.
This is a moral issue. The lawless state of our southern border is a threat to the safety, security, and financial well‑being of all Americans. We have a moral duty to create an immigration system that protects the lives and jobs of our citizens. This includes our obligation to the millions of immigrants living here today, who followed the rules and respected our laws. Legal immigrants enrich our Nation and strengthen our society in countless ways. I want people to come into our country, but they have to come in legally.
Medicare for All would destroy our hospital system. Doctors wouldn't be able to make enough money to pay off their loans, he said. People want to keep their private plans.
In Rapid City, South Dakota, hundreds of Trump opponents and supporters also turned out. A larger anti-Trump faction stood on a street corner as part of a Not My President protest, similar to other demonstrations being held across the country. A group supporting the president lined up on a different corner at the same intersection.
The bill would have ended the law's Medicaid expansion and subsidies and would eliminate the tax increases imposed under the law. The legislation would also cut federal funding for Planned Parenthood.
Whatever the case, federal judges' own health coverage probably doesn't weigh too heavily on their decision-making. After all, we've been here before. The Supreme Court upheld the ACA in 2012, saying the individual mandate -- the area of the law under dispute in the Texas case -- was constitutional because of the tax penalty involved. But now that the Trump administration abolished the penalty, the recent lawsuit argued the entire law was no longer constitutional.
If someone with an individual insurance policy got sick, the insurer could scour the person's application looking for errors. Even minor mistakes could cause the company to revoke the policy, a practice called rescission. Under the ACA, rescissions are allowed only if there's fraud or a material misrepresentation of facts.
Clinton then began to shift the subject to news about the U.S. intelligence community accusing Russia of hacking into U.S. political groups in an effort to undermine the election. She went on to accuse Trump of having ties to Russia and called on Trump to release his tax returns. He said he'll release them when his audit is over.
There is hatred among different races, separation of races, it needs to stop, we need to find a common good and work together to preserve the United States, said June Martinez.
10:12 p.m. ET Martha Raddatz asked Clinton if she would introduce the threat of U.S. military force beyond a no-fly zone against the Assad regime.
Donnelly is facing a challenge from Mike Braun, a Republican business executive who sailed to his primary victory as an outsider candidate and spent $4.5 million in the final weeks of the race.
Hillary's acceptance speech should just be, Excuse me, Donald. My turn. — Damien Fahey (@DamienFahey) October 20, 2016
Since then, other candidates like Harris and former Housing Secretary Julian Castro have changed their campaign strategies to free-up cash and refocus their efforts. Klobuchar, meanwhile, recently boasted in New Hampshire that while her campaign prides itself on being frugal, they were looking to add staffers and offices, at least in Iowa. The big moments for Klobuchar at the last debate were her strong but polite criticisms of some progressive policies, such as Medicare for All and forgiving student loans. Klobuchar argues that she can deliver better, more politically realistic policies, such as a public option for healthcare and free community college. What will be the key policy difference she highlights this time?
President Trump delivered his second State of the Union address Tuesday, Feb. 5, 2019, from the House chamber. The White House released the president's remarks as prepared for delivery.
Now is the time for bipartisan action. Believe it or not, we have already proven that it is possible.
It's an ideal situation, one that the ACA tried to replicate in many ways.
10:29 p.m. ET Clinton said that she respects the 2nd Amendment, but wants comprehensive background checks, to close the gun show loophole and Charleston loophole.
Joining Melania in the gallery this evening is a very brave 10-year-old girl, Grace Eline. Every birthday since she was 4, Grace asked her friends to donate to St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. She did not know that one day she might be a patient herself. Last year, Grace was diagnosed with brain cancer. Immediately, she began radiation treatment. At the same time, she rallied her community and raised more than $40,000 for the fight against cancer. When Grace completed treatment last fall, her doctors and nurses cheered with tears in their eyes as she hung up a poster that read: Last Day of Chemo. Grace — you are an inspiration to us all.

This bill will result in higher costs, less care and millions of Americans will lose their health insurance, particularly through Medicaid, Schumer added.
Therefore, we recently imposed tariffs on $250 billion of Chinese goods — and now our Treasury is receiving billions of dollars a month from a country that never gave us a dime. But I don't blame China for taking advantage of us — I blame our leaders and representatives for allowing this travesty to happen. I have great respect for President Xi, and we are now working on a new trade deal with China. But it must include real, structural change to end unfair trade practices, reduce our chronic trade deficit, and protect American jobs.
The remarks were first reported by the New York Times.
We expect this ruling will be appealed to the Supreme Court. Pending the appeal process, the law remains in place, White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said in a statement.
In Wisconsin, Republicans have had full control of the state for the past eight years. And in Michigan, Republicans have had full control since 2011. Democrats in those states, both of which are also critical to the 2020 presidential contest, argue that Republicans are dismissing the will of voters during lame duck sessions.
In the 20th century, America saved freedom, transformed science, and redefined the middle class standard of living for the entire world to see. Now, we must step boldly and bravely into the next chapter of this great American adventure, and we must create a new standard of living for the 21st century. An amazing quality of life for all of our citizens is within our reach.
Many of us campaigned on the same core promises: to defend American jobs and demand fair trade for American workers; to rebuild and revitalize our Nation's infrastructure; to reduce the price of healthcare and prescription drugs; to create an immigration system that is safe, lawful, modern and secure; and to pursue a foreign policy that puts America's interests first.
This is a moral issue. The lawless state of our southern border is a threat to the safety, security, and financial well‑being of all Americans. We have a moral duty to create an immigration system that protects the lives and jobs of our citizens. This includes our obligation to the millions of immigrants living here today, who followed the rules and respected our laws.

10:01 p.m. ET Trump accused Clinton of being an ineffective senator. Clinton said that as first lady, she helped get through the Children's Health Insurance Fund, which has provided health insurance to 8 million kids, she said.
Supporters of the law immediately said they would appeal. California Attorney General Xavier Becerra expressed confidence that the ruling could be overturned, saying the ACA has already survived more than 70 unsuccessful repeal attempts and withstood scrutiny in the Supreme Court.
Medicaid would be phased out under the bill beginning in 2021, with gradual reductions until 2024 in the amount of federal Obamacare funds that have financed the entitlement program's expansion. The Senate bill would also slash funding to Medicaid from what Republicans call gimmicks that drive up federal costs. President Trump repeatedly promised during the 2016 presidential campaign that he would not cut Medicaid, Medicare or Social Security.
When Stephanopoulos pointed this out to the president, Mr. Trump responded, Doesn't matter. I have it already, and it's a much better plan for you, and it's a much better plan.
President Donald Trump is demanding $5.6 billion to fulfill his campaign promise of a wall along the Mexico border. Pelosi has vowed to block any funding to build it. A tense standoff between the president and Democrats at the White House Friday lasted two hours.
The audit on Trump's returns, however, from 2002 to 2008 is complete, and Conway was asked about releasing those returns.
Menendez won his primary with only 62 percent of the vote against a primary candidate who barely campaigned. Menendez will probably prevail against Republican Bob Hugin, but the margin of victory may be smaller than expected, depending on how many people cast a protest vote. Hugin has also injected over $15 million in his own campaign.
My Administration has acted decisively to confront the world's leading state sponsor of terror: the radical regime in Iran.
Clinton said that within hours, I said I was sorry about the way I talked about that.
During the debate, Clinton defended President Obama's signature healthcare law and said, 20 million people have health insurance.
On Thursday morning, the Senate Republican Conference sat through a closed-door briefing for an hour and a half to learn about the bill's substance. Many inside the meeting didn't actually see the text even though it was posted online.
The Congress has 10 days left to pass a bill that will fund our Government, protect our homeland, and secure our southern border.
I know that the Congress is eager to pass an infrastructure bill — and I am eager to work with you on legislation to deliver new and important infrastructure investment, including investments in the cutting edge industries of the future. This is not an option. This is a necessity.
For about 20 minutes, protesters had been given verbal warnings to clear the street. Some did, while others kept blocking traffic. Police initially arrested three people, according to KOIN, and at least five others were arrested about 10 minutes later.

I might even go so far as to say that this face mask is more guaranteed to protect me against COVID than when I take a COVID vaccine, Redfield said Wednesday. ... If I don't get an immune response, the vaccine's not going to protect me. This face mask will.
I will bring our energy companies back, said Trump, who added that the EPA is so restrictive it's putting energy companies out of business.
Well, the Speaker has awesome power. But if the President of the United States is against governance and doesn't care whether people's needs are met or that public employees are paid or that we can have a legitimate discussion, then we have a problem, and we have to take it to the American people, she replied.
9:46 p.m. ET Clinton said that Trump has repeatedly lied about not initially supporting the war in Iraq even though that claim has been debunked.
He's a very confused guy, Biden said. He thinks he's running against somebody else. He's running against Joe Biden. I beat all those other people because I disagree with them.

It's no surprise that someone named Obama vetoed a bill repealing Obamacare, House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wisconsin, said in a video released Friday. This law will collapse under its own weight or it will be repealed...Next year, if we're sending this bill to a Republican president, it will get signed into law. Obamacare will be gone.
Some members of the committee are in tough reelection fights: Chairman Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, and Republicans Joni Ernst of Iowa and Tillis of North Carolina.
In Salt Lake City, hundreds of protesters chanting This is what democracy looks like marched. The Salt Lake Tribune reports that the crowd marched to push back against Mr. Trump and his administration's stance on such issues as the environment, immigration, free speech and Russia.

They also promised that more details would emerge in the coming months. Sayegh says those are still being ironed out.
A major factor relates to one of Obamacare's greatest strengths. Now that people with preexisting conditions qualify for coverage, insurers may have underestimated the amount of health care services these people need. In addition, special subsidies given to insurers in the beginning of Obamacare have come to an end. That's on top of rising health care costs in general, especially prescription drug costs.
Bennet was born in New Dehli while his father served as an aide to the U.S. Ambassador to India. His father then went on to take posts in the Carter and Clinton administrations, while his grandfather was an adviser to Franklin Roosevelt.
The individual mandate is at the center of conservative Constitutional challenges to the health care law.
Considered a relatively moderate Democrat, Bennet has represented Colorado in the U.S. Senate since 2009. Before entering politics, he spent seven years in the private sector where served as director of the Anschutz Investment Company. It was there that he managed the consolidation of three major movie chains into the Regal Entertainment Group.

Preliminary reporting shows those predictions are accurate. In a study of 14 major metro areas by the Kaiser Family Foundation, premiums for the second-lowest-cost silver medical plans (the plans that tax credits are based on) are expected to rise an average of 11 percent in 2017. In the cities Kaiser studied, complete data was available on insurer premium change requests. It found the changes range from a decrease of 13 percent in Providence, Rhode Island, to an increase of 18 percent in Portland, Oregon.
As Congress becomes increasingly mired in gridlock, states have become increasingly empowered and motivated to act on issues of national importance. And more state legislatures have fallen under one-party control; After the 2018 midterm elections, only one state -- Minnesota -- has a divided legislature. Democrats control 19 legislatures while Republicans control 30. And after Democrats made gains in governorships via November's elections, 13 states have one party controlling the executive and the other in charge of the legislature.
Republicans need a simple majority to pass it, rather than a supermajority since they're using the budget reconciliation process. They may still have to rely on Vice President Mike Pence to cast a tie-breaking vote. The Senate currently has 52 Republicans and 48 Democrats. That means if all Democrats vote against the bill, only three no votes from Republicans can torpedo it. Even if Republicans are successful in getting it through the upper chamber, they would then still need to reconcile it with version passed by the House in early May, reach a bicameral agreement with House Republicans, and hold votes in the House and Senate on that version again.
Currently, there's a $19 trillion gap, give or take, between what Sen. Sanders has proposed and how he's articulated paying for those proposals, Clinton said. So that, to me, is troubling.
If you've ever just went in to open something', there's so many papers, there's so many things you've got to do. There's so many taxes you have to file every month. It's like the system is made to be difficult, Cathy said, sounding a bit more like a Republican than a Democrat. I don't want anyone ever to think that I think a Republican can't help me….It does sound like we have a few things in common, right?
Just months ago, 11 Jewish-Americans were viciously murdered in an anti-semitic attack on the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh. SWAT Officer Timothy Matson raced into the gunfire and was shot seven times chasing down the killer. Timothy has just had his 12th surgery — but he made the trip to be here with us tonight. Officer Matson: we are forever grateful for your courage in the face of evil.
Graham, who leads the committee, publicly refused to take a COVID-19 test when challenged by his Democratic opponent last week to do so.
Absent a vaccine, I think it would quite likely become like seasonal flu or perhaps like some of the other coronaviruses that we are familiar with, Bill Hanage, an associate professor of epidemiology at Harvard University's School of Public Health, told USA Today earlier this year. It is entirely plausible that this could become part of our regular landscape of respiratory viraI infections.
That prospect has been the backbone of the president's insistence on the Senate confirming Barrett before Election Day.
Bennet, 54, overcame a bout with prostate cancer earlier this year. He was diagnosed in April and quickly underwent surgery, which his office said was completely successful and would require no further treatment. He told CBS his diagnosis was very clarifying, saying he was disappointed at the possibility of never being able to run.

The CBO didn't release its cost estimate on the House bill until May 24, which projected that 23 million more people would be without health insurance over the next decade under the bill.
Obamacare isn't working. By nearly any measure, it has failed, and no amount of 11th-hour, reality-denying or buck-passing by Democrats is going to change the fact that more Americans are going to get hurt unless we do something, he said on the floor after the bill was posted. Republicans believe we have a responsibility to act, and we are.
A final decision from the court is expected by June.
Did Crooked Hillary help disgusting (check out sex tape and past) Alicia M become a U.S. citizen so she could use her in the debate? — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 30, 2016
Treasury Department spokesman Tony Sayegh is optimistic that tax reform, the next big push for the Trump administration, can be achieved with bipartisan support.
In Afghanistan, my Administration is holding constructive talks with a number of Afghan groups, including the Taliban. As we make progress in these negotiations, we will be able to reduce our troop presence and focus on counter-terrorism. We do not know whether we will achieve an agreement — but we do know that after two decades of war, the hour has come to at least try for peace.
Therefore, we recently imposed tariffs on $250 billion of Chinese goods — and now our Treasury is receiving billions of dollars a month from a country that never gave us a dime. But I don't blame China for taking advantage of us — I blame our leaders and representatives for allowing this travesty to happen. I have great respect for President Xi, and we are now working on a new trade deal with China. But it must include real, structural change to end unfair trade practices, reduce our chronic trade deficit, and protect American jobs.
There's very little decorum left, Scholz says. Everything is going to be a political fight.
Now, as we work with our allies to destroy the remnants of ISIS, it is time to give our brave warriors in Syria a warm welcome home.
The situation in Syria is catastrophic, Clinton said, adding that she advocates a no-fly zone in Syria to provide humanitarian aid to people suffering and to work with allies.
Blackburn is focusing her campaign on her support for Trump, who endorsed her in May. At a rally in Nashville in May, Mr. Trump portrayed Bredesen as a tool of Chuck and Nancy. Blackburn has promised to wholeheartedly support Mr. Trump's agenda if elected. Blackburn used clips from that rally in a recent campaign ad touting Trump's endorsement.
9:35 p.m. ET Clinton was asked to address her husband's comments from this past week about Obamacare being a crazy system. The former president later clarified the comment and said he supports the system.
But GOP Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald acknowledged the political underpinnings at play. We trusted Scott Walker and the administration to be able to manage the back and forth with the Legislature. We don't trust Tony Evers right now in a lot of these areas, he told a conservative radio host.
In an unprecedented Maryland election, three polling centers will be open Tuesday in a special election between Democrat Kweisi Mfume and Republican Kimberly Klacik in a congressional race dramatically reshaped by the coronavirus pandemic.
9:20 p.m. ET Clinton responded by repeating a line from Michelle Obama's 2016 Democratic National Convention speech, When they go low, we go high.
My Administration has cut more regulations in a short time than any other administration during its entire tenure. Companies are coming back to our country in large numbers thanks to historic reductions in taxes and regulations.
With the Supreme Court poised to decide the future of the Affordable Care Act and the Senate set to confirm President Trump's third appointee to the high court, Judge Amy Coney Barrett, health care was a key topic during Thursday night's debate. Mr. Trump and Democratic nominee Joe Biden were asked to detail their health care plans should the justices vote to kill the Obama-era health care law.

Romney said that while pundits have been pushing him to simply admit his decision to sign the Massachusetts law was a boneheaded mistake, he would not do so. That's because, he said, it wouldn't be honest.
Trump then brought up President Bill Clinton's past infidelities.
But in the latest CBS News Battleground Tracker, just 12% of all voters in the early primary and caucus states through Super Tuesday say they are considering Yang. The campaign has done well to build support in online communities, but it is trying to spread the candidate's message to a wider audience. Last week, the Yang campaign launched a 7-figure ad buy in the early primary states with glossy ads focused on his health care policies and economic populism.
Bennet was born in New Dehli while his father served as an aide to the U.S. Ambassador to India. His father then went on to take posts in the Carter and Clinton administrations, while his grandfather was an adviser to Franklin Roosevelt.
7:35 p.m. ET Donald Trump just delivered a pre-debate statement with women who have accused President Bill Clinton of sexual assault or rape including Juanita Broaddrick. Full story to come on CBSNews.com.
I have met the men and women of Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Indiana, New Hampshire, and many other States whose dreams were shattered by NAFTA. For years, politicians promised them they would negotiate for a better deal. But no one ever tried — until now.
Speaking at the University of Michigan, Romney defended the individual mandate in the Massachusetts plan, saying it was necessary to address the free rider problem of state residents declining to buy health care and then showing up at hospitals for care, leaving taxpayers to foot the bill.
We're not surprised to see Donald Trump continue his destructive race to the bottom. Hillary Clinton understands the opportunity in this town hall is to talk to voters on stage and in the audience about the issues that matter to them, and this stunt doesn't change that. If Donald Trump doesn't see that, that's his loss. As always, she's prepared to handle whatever Donald Trump throws her way.
9:22 p.m. ET Trump said that Clinton owes an apology for her thousands of missing emails. He then said, If I win, I am going to instruct my attorney general to get a special prosecutor to look into your situation.
At the center of the case before the Supreme Court is the constitutionality of the so-called individual mandate, an original statute of the act that required those who could afford health insurance, but opted out, to pay a fee when they filed taxes. Congress passed tax legislation in 2017 that eliminated the unpopular fine, and a federal appeals court determined the mandate was unconstitutional at this time last year. Texas and other conservative-led states have since argued that the mandate's unconstitutionality renders the entire ACA unconstitutional.
Simply put, walls work and walls save lives. So let's work together, compromise, and reach a deal that will truly make America safe.
President-elect Joe Biden has nominated California Attorney General Xavier Becerra to serve as his first secretary of health and human services. Becerra was a leading advocate for passage of the ACA as California's attorney general, and has defended the law in federal court, including before the Supreme Court.
The Senate passed the measure last year under special rules that protected it from a Democratic filibuster, and the House passed it this week.
Democratic Sen. Heidi Heitkamp is a major target for national Republicans, although she has a relatively close relationship with Mr. Trump for a Democrat. Heitkamp was considered for a cabinet position, and has sat next to the president at bill-signings and ridden on Air Force One. Mr. Trump once called her a good woman. Heitkamp released an ad touting her bipartisanship, noting that she voted over half the time in line with Mr. Trump's policies.

Our new U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement — or USMCA — will replace NAFTA and deliver for American workers: bringing back our manufacturing jobs, expanding American agriculture, protecting intellectual property, and ensuring that more cars are proudly stamped with four beautiful words: made in the USA.
Clinton slammed Senate Republicans for not taking up President Obama's nominee of Merrick Garland to fill the vacant seat on the Supreme Court, and vowed to immediately move to ensure that we fill that if elected president.
VIA CBS NEWS CAMPAIGN REPORTER BO ERICKSON While Democrats are united in criticizing Mr. Trump for asking the Ukrainian government to investigate the Biden family, it's a much more personal topic for the former vice president.
It's still unclear when that health care plan, which Mr. Trump said would be signed weeks ago, will be released. White House chief of staff Mark Meadows said the plan has a legislative component and an executive action component.
Arizona has also been a focus of Priorities USA, a Democratic super PAC seeking to mobilize Latinos in Arizona and Florida.
When you look at Bill Clinton, he said, There has never been anyone in the history of this nation...who has been so abusive to women.

CBS Los Angeles reported that organizers said they chose to rally on the holiday as a way to honor past presidents by exercising their constitutional right to assemble and peacefully protest.
He's doing things that I cannot even explain, so it's almost hard for me to speak because I can't believe that anybody else doesn't see it! Jerome said.
Are those the voters watching on debate night? Perhaps. But it's more likely Sanders will speak reach these people on the trail, or through door knocking and phone banking. Still, Sanders needs those committed Democrats watching every debate night closely. Can he win them over with a winning debate performance? He hasn't had any major flubs yet on stage, so if they haven't come to him now, will they ever?
One week after votes for the next president are cast, the Supreme Court is scheduled to hear oral arguments in a blockbuster dispute involving the fate of Obamacare.
While he said he has the plan already, Stephanopoulos noted that Mr. Trump has been in office for 3 1/2 years and has not yet presented a plan to replace Obamacare.
But as a nominee to the 7th Circuit, Barrett told the Judiciary Committee she would follow all Supreme Court precedent without fail and during a speech at Notre Dame in 2013 said it's very unlikely the high court would overturn Roe, according to the student newspaper The Observer.

In 2003, Bennet became the chief of staff to then-Denver Mayor John Hickenlooper, who is also running for the Democratic presidential nomination. He left Hickenlooper's office in 2005 to become superintendent of the Denver Public School system, where he helped pass a merit pay system for teachers. He was later appointed to fill the Senate seat vacated by Ken Salazar in 2009 and promptly re-elected the following year.
She said she has a positive and optimistic view of the country's direction.
Mr. Trump said the public option means socialized medicine.
Biden's own proposal calls for building on the Affordable Care Act and for increasing the value of tax credits to lower premiums for Americans. Biden's plan would also offer coverage premium-free to individuals who would qualify under Medicaid expansion, but whose states have chosen not to expand Medicaid.

According to CMS, about 8.3 million people enrolled or were automatically re-enrolled in the program during the 2020 open enrollment period, over 2 million of whom were new consumers. And, as of June 2019, 14 million people who were made newly eligible for coverage under the ACA's Medicaid expansion, adopted by 39 states, enrolled in coverage, according to data from the Kaiser Family Foundation.
The plan I'm going to describe for you is the same, he said. I'm not adjusting the plan to reflect the political sentiment.
So, impeachment not high on your agenda?
We stand with the Venezuelan people in their noble quest for freedom — and we condemn the brutality of the Maduro regime, whose socialist policies have turned that nation from being the wealthiest in South America into a state of abject poverty and despair.
Trump brought up Clinton's remark from a month ago when she called his supporters deplorable. He said that he would help members of the black community and Hispanic community.
Democrats have raised concerns that, if confirmed to the Supreme Court, Barrett would vote to overturn the ACA. She has previously criticized Chief Justice John Roberts' 2012 ruling upholding the law. During her confirmation hearings last week, Barrett declined to weigh in on the constitutionality of the law, since there is a case on the ACA is pending before the Supreme Court.
Pauley asked, Did you learn that from the experience of being a target?
Pelosi again delivered the votes for the Affordable Care Act in 2010, which Republicans derisively called Obamacare. That fall, they retook the House.
Is President Obama right – do Americans want more gradual change?
A strong debate performance, coupled with the massive buy, could provide a one-two punch for Yang and help him connect with voters who really haven't paid much attention to him yet. He will likely stick to his vision of human-centered capitalism to help workers navigate the changing economy and talk about his plan for a new way forward in the 21st century, but voters could also hear more personal stories from Yang. He's recently started branding himself as a parent and a patriot in his ads and on the

I'm upset ... I am very concerned and I would like to see a return to rational reasonable policies based on fact, facts that are not up for debate, said Chris Webber.
I will need some time to absorb this, but I want Cindy —and the entire McCain family — to know they are in my prayers.
Roberts said he believes that if Congress had wanted the full act to fall, it would have struck it down itself, adding that it's not the Supreme Court job's to do so. It's hard for you to argue that Congress intended the entire act to fall if the mandate were struck down when the same Congress that lowered the penalty to zero did not even try to repeal the rest of the act, Roberts told Texas Solicitor General Kyle Hawkins, who argued on behalf of the 18 red states challenging the law.
Sen. Joe Donnelly is perhaps the most vulnerable Democrat in the Senate this election season. Donnelly is running for re-election in a state Mr. Trump won by nearly 20 percentage points. The Democrat has been nervously hewing to the center in recent months, denouncing recent progressive battle cries like implementing Medicare for All and abolishing U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
Congressman Graham, on the most solemn occasion, said, 'You know, where I come from, any man calling a woman at 2 a.m. is up to no good,' McCain said in March of 2017, explaining the history of their friendship on CNN. I knew right then that Lindsey Graham was a guy I wanted to spend time with.
Clinton went on to say Trump never apologized for mocking a New York Times reporter's disability or to President Obama for spreading the birther conspiracy -- that he was not born in the U.S.
If the law is invalidated, it could scrap other well-liked sections of the law, such as the part that allows parents to keep young adult children on their health care coverage until age 26.
Bennet acknlowedged in his campaign appeal that while he may lack in national name recognition because I don't go on cable news everyday, he came to Washington because he wants to pay attention to what would help the people who sent me there make their lives better.
Since then, she's released significant details on her plans to pay for Medicare for All and get congress to pass it. But that's opened her policies to new scrutiny. With the release of a 3-year plan leading up to a push for the original Medicare for All bill, Warren could face attacks from both her right and her left on where she now stands on health care. But while she walked onto the stage last month as the biggest target in the field, Buttigieg's recent polling surge in Iowa could distract some of the candidates looking for blood. Will her rivals continue to pile-on Warren, or will they move on to other top candidates like Biden and Buttigieg?
McCaskill received another political godsend in 2018 thanks to the meltdown of the state Republican Party. GOP Gov. Eric Greitens, a conservative rising star, resigned earlier this year amid after being accused of blackmailing and assaulting a woman with whom he had had an affair.

But it's unlikely Barrett will divulge her views on abortion or those cases, as nominees typically avoid weighing in on issues that may come before them as a jurist.
President Donald Trump is demanding $5.6 billion to fulfill his campaign promise of a wall along the Mexico border. Pelosi has vowed to block any funding to build it. A tense standoff between the president and Democrats at the White House Friday lasted two hours.

At issue in the case was the individual mandate, which requires people to have health insurance. The penalty for not having insurance was dropped to $0 in the most recent tax legislation, potentially undercutting the Supreme Court's decision in 2012 that the Affordable Care Act was constitutional because of Congress' ability to tax.
The election initially was going to be an all mail-in vote, but limited in-person voting was allowed after concerns were raised about people who can't cast ballots by mail, including the disabled and homeless. More than 85,000 votes already have been mailed in.
Asked about the packed field of challengers he now faces, Bennet told CBS that it's phenomenal we have an array of candidates that we have calling it a competition of ideas.
Here's the full text of the discussion draft of the bill.

Romney then offered the outlines of his federal health care proposal, which, he said, would start with an executive order on his first day as president to help states get waivers to opt-out of the federal health care law. Referring to slides, he said he would then look to repeal and replace that law with his proposal.
Mr. Trump also claimed herd mentality will help rid the U.S. of the virus.
Tonight, I ask you to choose greatness.
Well, we will talk about what we talked about in the campaign for the people: Lower healthcare costs by reducing the cost of prescription drugs and preserving pre-existing condition benefit; building bigger paychecks by building the infrastructure of America.

Over the weekend, the Sanders campaign also launched a second digital ad featuring Ocasio-Cortez. We're building the largest grassroots movement of working class Iowans our state has ever seen, said Sander's Iowa Field Director Michael Fasullo in a statement. With these new offices, we're expanding our reach across the state and giving our supporters the tools they need to bring new folks into the political process and win the caucus in February.

Manchin has made his reputation as a conservative Democrat, voting to confirm Justice Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court in 2017 and Gina Haspel as director of the Central Intelligence Agency in 2018.

President Trump was in the spotlight Tuesday night for a rare town hall in Philadelphia with undecided voters, where he fielded questions on topics including the coronavirus pandemic and health care, which have been on the minds of many voters.
Clinton slammed Senate Republicans for not taking up President Obama's nominee of Merrick Garland to fill the vacant seat on the Supreme Court, and vowed to immediately move to ensure that we fill that if elected president.
So you may not know me, but over the years I've learned a lot about what Americans struggle with.
Those on the left, meanwhile, pointed to Romney's past statements seemingly in support of a federal mandate, including a 1994 statement that he would back a federal bill that included a mandate. In 2007, Romney said that once states try out their own plans, we'll end up with a nation that's taken a mandate approach.
She went on to say that Trump has insulted women and members of other communities throughout the campaign.
That argument, however, has not exactly been met with a warm reception by the conservative majority on the Supreme Court. Last month, Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Brett Kavanaugh, one of three justices appointed by President Trump, both signaled they disagree with arguments made by the Republican-led states.
The Sanders campaign says their path to victory is all about turnout, particularly among those who have never voted before. Young people, the working class, and people of color are the wind in Sanders' sails.
Romney said that more specifics about the plan would be forthcoming. But he argued that overall it lowered costs and meant less government spending than the Obama plan, which he cast as a tax-raising, costly bureaucratic nightmare that forces an un-American federal mandate on the American people.
The judges, of course, would still have their federal coverage.

Analysts and advocates who follow Obamacare sign-ups say interest in the program has only grown stronger as the coronavirus pandemic holds its grip on the nation, The Associated Press reports.
Health insurance is meant to help people pay their medical expenses and avoid potentially catastrophic bills. Before Obamacare, however, using your insurance could cause you to lose it.
Bennet acknlowedged in his campaign appeal that while he may lack in national name recognition because I don't go on cable news everyday, he came to Washington because he wants to pay attention to what would help the people who sent me there make their lives better.
It includes humanitarian assistance, more law enforcement, drug detection at our ports, closing loopholes that enable child smuggling, and plans for a new physical barrier, or wall, to secure the vast areas between our ports of entry. In the past, most of the people in this room voted for a wall — but the proper wall never got built. I'll get it built.

In addition to the Affordable Care Act, Barrett will likely be pressed about Roe v. Wade, the 1973 Supreme Court decision that established a woman's right to an abortion.
Senator Dianne Feinstein of California, the ranking member of the committee, has been criticized for questioning Barrett's Catholic faith during the 2017 confirmation hearings for Barrett's nomination to the federal appeals court on which she currently serves. If Feinstein or any other Democrats ask questions about how Barrett's faith influences her decision-making on critical issues like abortion, Republicans may take the opportunity to paint them as being anti-Catholic.

Even minor mistakes could cause the company to revoke the policy, a practice called rescission. Under the ACA, rescissions are allowed only if there's fraud or a material misrepresentation of facts.
It's already affecting us right now. I mean, we're having record floods, we're having record hurricanes, Bandera said.
Human traffickers and sex traffickers take advantage of the wide open areas between our ports of entry to smuggle thousands of young girls and women into the United States and to sell them into prostitution and modern-day slavery.
If there is going to be peace and legislation, there cannot be war and investigation. It just doesn't work that way!
She said, If Hillary Clinton had won and the Affordable Care Act would be safe, I would've been happy to go home. I have options!

Meanwhile, working class Americans are left to pay the price for mass illegal migration — reduced jobs, lower wages, overburdened schools and hospitals, increased crime, and a depleted social safety net.
Smart money in Texas is not betting that Rep. Beto O'Rourke, the telegenic Democratic congressman from El Paso, will defeat Sen. Ted Cruz. However, despite Mr. Trump's nearly 10-point margin of victory in 2016 and Cruz winning by 16 percentage points in 2012, the buzz around O'Rourke is loud enough to suggest that the conservative incumbent may be in trouble.
Tonight, I am also asking you to join me in another fight that all Americans can get behind: the fight against childhood cancer.
That means judges who opt into the system pay premiums, just like the rest of us. They may even pay a bit more than the average private-sector employee. In addition, depending on what type of plan judges pick, like private-sector employees they may have high deductibles or high co-insurance for certain services. As in the marketplaces, it's all about what plan they choose.
I will need some time to absorb this, but I want Cindy —and the entire McCain family — to know they are in my prayers.
Hillary's wearing my costume from Defending Your Life. — Albert Brooks (@AlbertBrooks) October 20, 2016
Republican lawmakers have pushed many repeal measures since 2010, when Obama signed the health care program into law. This was the first of those bills to clear Congress and reach his desk.
In a statement, Evers called the moves unfettered attempts to override and ignore what the people of Wisconsin asked for this November...this is rancor and politics as usual.
Here, in the United States, we are alarmed by new calls to adopt socialism in our country. America was founded on liberty and independence –- not government coercion, domination, and control. We are born free, and we will stay free. Tonight, we renew our resolve that America will never be a socialist country.
Know your options. Having a thorough knowledge of your exchange options can help you when it comes to applying for subsidies. Individual exchanges often change their benchmark plans -- those that qualify for government subsidies. If you stay in your plan from the previous year thinking it will still be the benchmark plan, but then the benchmark plan shifts to a different carrier, you may lose your subsidy.
Speaker Pelosi ushered in a new era of divided government in the midst of a government shutdown – 800,000 federal government employees furloughed or working without pay, national parks and museums closed.
Monday's rallies were the latest in what has been a seemingly endless string of protests against the president. Several cities hosted similar events over the weekend.
The fourth is to limit medical malpractice lawsuits. And the fifth is to make health care more competitive in part through co-insurance products that give consumers more of a stake in the overall cost of their care.
What will we do with this moment? How will we be remembered?
Not the one I thought would be wearing a white power suit. #debate — Taran Killam (@TaranKillam) October 20, 2016
I didn't downplay it. I actually in many ways up-played it in action, the president told the voter who asked him why he would downplay a pandemic that is known to disproportionately harm low-income families and minority communities.
In addition to the short timeline, the recent COVID-19 diagnoses from three Republican senators, two of whom serve on the Judiciary Committee, has further roiled the confirmation process. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell canceled legislative activity until October 19 after Senators Mike Lee, Thom Tillis and Ron Johnson tested positive for the coronavirus, but this week's hearings are proceeding as planned, with members having the opportunity to participate remotely.
Last week, the administration reported that nearly 3.3 million people have selected marketplace plans as of Feb. 1. Health and Human Services officials have said they are satisfied with the pace of enrollment.
If we repeal it as Donald has proposed and start over again, all of those benefits I just mentioned are lost to everybody, she said.
I will need some time to absorb this, but I want Cindy —and the entire McCain family — to know they are in my prayers. — Lindsey Graham (@LindseyGrahamSC) August 26, 2018
Hundreds of plans to choose from
Romney said that our plan was a state solution to a state problem, and his is a power grab by the federal government to put in a one sized fits all plan across the nation.
Is President Obama right – do Americans want more gradual change?
During the debate, Clinton defended President Obama's signature healthcare law and said, 20 million people have health insurance.
Senator Bernie Sanders opened eight new offices across the state this past weekend, according to the campaign. Sanders now has 22 offices and over 133 staffers on the ground, both among the most of any campaign in Iowa says Bidar. The campaign also says it knocked on more than 11,000 doors in the last 48 hours, adding to the over 100,000 doors they have knocked since the launch of the campaign. This comes after Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez campaigned for Sanders in Iowa this month.
We'll find out soon which party gets their voters to show up in Missouri. President Trump will be holding rallies in the state twice before Election Day.
This disease has never had a more worthy opponent, Graham told reporters following the diagnosis.
That's a shame, Trump said, but he added that, There is a problem.
The election initially was going to be an all mail-in vote, but limited in-person voting was allowed after concerns were raised about people who can't cast ballots by mail, including the disabled and homeless. More than 85,000 votes already have been mailed in.
Phoenix — In his second day on the campaign trail, former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg stood in strong contrast to many of his Democratic rivals in the presidential race. He criticized not only their campaign strategies but their policies.
There is a new opportunity in American politics, if only we have the courage to seize it. Victory is not winning for our party. Victory is winning for our country.
He's doing things that I cannot even explain, so it's almost hard for me to speak because I can't believe that anybody else doesn't see it! Jerome said.
I never thought we would be arguing about the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, in the Democratic primary, Clinton told Democrats in Manchester, one of three stops she made during her swing.
No force in history has done more to advance the human condition than American freedom. In recent years we have made remarkable progress in the fight against HIV and AIDS. Scientific breakthroughs have brought a once-distant dream within reach. My budget will ask Democrats and Republicans to make the needed commitment to eliminate the HIV epidemic in the United States within 10 years. Together, we will defeat AIDS in America.
Both parties should be able to unite for a great rebuilding of America's crumbling infrastructure.
Such a nasty woman ~also trump
I'm upset ... I am very concerned and I would like to see a return to rational reasonable policies based on fact, facts that are not up for debate, said Chris Webber.
At her December 11th meeting at the White House, Mr. Trump spoke to the press about the insurgency. Nancy is in a situation where it's not easy for her to talk right now, he said.
We are now making it clear to China that after years of targeting our industries, and stealing our intellectual property, the theft of American jobs and wealth has come to an end.
That argument, however, has not exactly been met with a warm reception by the conservative majority on the Supreme Court. Last month, Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Brett Kavanaugh, one of three justices appointed by President Trump, both signaled they disagree with arguments made by the Republican-led states.
Fellow billionaire Tom Steyer has urged Bloomberg to support a wealth tax, but Bloomberg said other countries have failed to show it can be successful.
It has, in fact, been debunked. He said it on Howard Stern's radio show.
There is a new opportunity in American politics, if only we have the courage to seize it. Victory is not winning for our party. Victory is winning for our country.

Clinton alluded to the fact that Trump might not have paid federal income taxes for up to 18 years, according to a recent New York Times report about Trump's 1995 tax returns.
Some members of the committee are in tough reelection fights: Chairman Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, and Republicans Joni Ernst of Iowa and Tillis of North Carolina.
It all started years ago, during the push for then-President Bill Clinton's impeachment, when Lindsey Graham, then a House member, was presenting the case to senators, including Arizona's Sen. John McCain.
When I saw Alice's beautiful family greet her at the prison gates, hugging and kissing and crying and laughing, I knew I did the right thing.
When McCain cast the deciding vote against legislation Graham introduced to overhaul the Affordable Care Act in September 2017, wrecking Republican chances of Obamacare repeal, some questioned whether their friendship would weather the storm. President Trump tweeted McCain had, let his best friend L.G. down! It would be the first of many verbal attacks Mr. Trump would make over McCain's vote in the months ahead.
He cast the pre-mandate system as the big government approach, since paying for care fell to taxpayers. He contrasted that with the mandate to buy insurance or pay a penalty, which he cast as the personal responsibility option.
So finding coverage for specialists and out-of-network services isn't as tough a problem for judges as it can be in the often narrow networks ACA enrollees rely on. And federal employees have the option of keeping their coverage into retirement, unlike many private employer plans.
9:28 p.m. ET Trump wanted to stay on the issue of emails, but Clinton wanted to move on to additional questions from voters. Clinton said Trump was trying to divert attention from the video of his lewd comments.
Already, as a result of my Administration's efforts, in 2018 drug prices experienced their single largest decline in 46 years.
Pauley asked her, Will the next Congress be remembered for impeachment, or will they be remembered for something else?
10:04 p.m. ET Candidates are asked from an undecided voter what they would do if elected president about Syria and the humanitarian crisis in Aleppo since it's reminiscent of the Holocaust and the U.S. waiting too long back then to take action.
Clinton said that she was alluding to Steven Spielberg's movie about Abraham Lincoln. She said that in order to get the Congress to approve the 13th Amendment, Clinton said he used a principled and strategic approach in which he used an argument with one group of people and another argument with another group of people.
Klacik, a Baltimore County Republican Central Committee member, generated buzz with appearances on Fox News. Her social media posts last year showing trash and blight in Baltimore prompted a call for her to appear on the network's program Fox & Friends. President Donald Trump went on to describe the 7th Congressional District in tweets last year as a disgusting, rat and rodent infested mess where no human being would want to live, at a time when Cummings was the powerful House Oversight Committee chairman, leading multiple investigations of the president at the time.
The veto was expected. But Republicans claimed victory with the vote, arguing that they met two goals by finally passing a repeal bill: keeping a promise to voters in an election year, and showing that they are capable of repealing the law if a Republican wins November's presidential election.
Well, let me first say that our purpose in the meeting at the White House was to open up government, said Pelosi. The impression you get from the president [is] that he would like to not only close government, build a wall, but also abolish Congress so the only voice that mattered was his own.
We eliminated the very unpopular Obamacare individual mandate penalty — and to give critically ill patients access to life-saving cures, we passed right to try.
The situation is dire for low-income consumers. According to a Commonwealth Fund study released Thursday, low-income adults who qualify for Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act but live in a state that hasn't expanded Medicaid will likely pay higher out-of-pocket costs for less comprehensive insurance coverage.
Three decades later, she once again has the top job in Congress, with the best view in Washington – from a Capitol on edge.
In 2019, we also celebrate 50 years since brave young pilots flew a quarter of a million miles through space to plant the American flag on the face of the moon. Half a century later, we are joined by one of the Apollo 11 astronauts who planted that flag: Buzz Aldrin. This year, American astronauts will go back to space on American rockets.
Check, check and check again if you qualify for a subsidy. The government estimates that 87 percent of people who buy marketplace plans can receive a subsidy or premium tax credit to help lower costs. Check with Healthcare.gov and update your income information each year to make sure you're getting the assistance you qualify for.
Clinton went on to say Trump never apologized for mocking a New York Times reporter's disability or to President Obama for spreading the birther conspiracy -- that he was not born in the U.S.
Just not their view of Obamacare, which cut the Jenkins' insurance costs. They want to elect a Democratic Congress to stop the president's attacks on it.
Tens of thousands of innocent Americans are killed by lethal drugs that cross our border and flood into our cities — including meth, heroin, cocaine, and fentanyl.
Whether we like it or not, there is a problem, he said. We have to be sure that Muslims come in and they report what's going on.
Sen. Claire McCaskill is yet another endangered Democrat seeking re-election in a state Mr. Trump won by an overwhelming margin. McCaskill has lucked out in her Republican opponents in previous years; in 2012, the candidacy of Republican Todd Akin was tanked by his comment that legitimate rape could not result in pregnancy.
The two appeared on CNN together before the cancer diagnosis in March, and described their camaraderie.
VIA CBS NEWS CAMPAIGN REPORTER JACK TURMAN At a Nevada Democrats First in the West event Sunday night, New Jersey Senator Cory Booker said the presidential election is not about left or right. It is about right and wrong. At the last debate, Booker kept his focus on Mr. Trump and mostly avoided criticizing his fellow Democrats. And at a California Democratic Party Convention in Long Beach this past weekend, Booker reiterated that Democrats need to concentrate on winning back the White House instead of infighting. I'm happy to be in this field and plan on winning, but the one thing I'm going to stop is us tearing each other down, Booker told reporters. After months of struggling in the polls, will Booker look to throw some punches at his Democratic competitors? Or will he continue to focus on Mr. Trump?
No one has benefitted more from our thriving economy than women, who have filled 58 percent of the new jobs created in the last year. All Americans can be proud that we have more women in the workforce than ever before — and exactly one century after the Congress passed the Constitutional amendment giving women the right to vote, we also have more women serving in the Congress than ever before.
The herd immunity strategy would also yield far more deaths, as Stephanopoulos pointed out.
We are joined tonight by one of those law enforcement heroes: ICE Special Agent Elvin Hernandez. When Elvin was a boy, he and his family legally immigrated to the United States from the Dominican Republic. At the age of eight, Elvin told his dad he wanted to become a Special Agent. Today, he leads investigations into the scourge of international sex trafficking. Elvin says: If I can make sure these young girls get their justice, I've done my job. Thanks to his work and that of his colleagues, more than 300 women and girls have been rescued from horror and more than 1,500 sadistic traffickers have been put behind bars in the last year.
Yet he argued that what was right for his state is not necessarily right for the nation. Romney grounded his argument in the founding fathers' vision for America, saying they didn't want a king-like structure grounded in a central government but rather for Americans to have the freedom to choose our life's course, our enterprises.
Above all, friend and foe alike must never doubt this Nation's power and will to defend our people. Eighteen years ago, terrorists attacked the USS Cole — and last month American forces killed one of the leaders of the attack.
Special Agent Hernandez, please stand: We will always support the brave men and women of Law Enforcement — and I pledge to you tonight that we will never abolish our heroes from ICE.
The founders, he said, chose for American power to be grounded in the states, and codified that impulse in the 10th Amendment.
O'Rourke's tour of the state has garnered large crowds nearly everywhere he goes. He has also raised $10 million in the second quarter, compared to Cruz's $4 million. The Cook Political Report has even rated the Texas Senate race as lean Republican, which means they don't believe it is a lock for Cruz.
My plan is to run for president, Bennet told CBS This Morning co-anchor John Dickerson. I think this country faces two enormous challenges, one is a lack of economic mobility and opportunity for most Americans and the other is the need to restore integrity to our government.
Demonstrators said Mr. Trump has attacked everything they stand for, from his crackdown on immigration to his party's response to climate change and the environment. Meanwhile, supporters of the president have followed his lead, turning on the media and saying they're glad to see Mr. Trump fighting back.
At Wednesday's debate, Biden can be expected to try and turn Mr. Trump's accusations into an advantage. And the former vice president also says that Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un are worried about a potential Biden presidency. North Korean state media recently called Biden a rabid dog, a phrase Biden laughs at.
Clinton scooped up several books and a crochet owl hat to bring back to New York before heading over to the Portsmouth Brewery to host her final town hall of the day, where she faced a question about her mother's ties with Wall Street.
There has never been so many lies, so much deception, he said.
9:03 p.m. ET Check out our live-blog of fact-checking throughout the debate tonight.
Roberts said he believes that if Congress had wanted the full act to fall, it would have struck it down itself, adding that it's not the Supreme Court job's to do so. It's hard for you to argue that Congress intended the entire act to fall if the mandate were struck down when the same Congress that lowered the penalty to zero did not even try to repeal the rest of the act, Roberts told Texas Solicitor General Kyle Hawkins, who argued on behalf of the 18 red states challenging the law.
The House bill, which narrowly passed in a 217-213 vote on May 4, would significantly reduce the funding for Obamacare subsidies, revamp tax credits so that they're tied to a person's age, freeze the Medicaid expansion in 2020 and allow states to seek waivers from a rule that requires states to offer essential benefits in their plans and a provision that prevents insurers from charging people with pre-existing conditions more money compared to healthy people. Instead of Obamacare's insurance mandate, the House Republican bill would incentivize people to have continuous coverage. Should coverage be interrupted for more than 63 days, insurers would be able to charge a 30 percent penalty over the original premium for one year.
10:12 p.m. ET Martha Raddatz asked Clinton if she would introduce the threat of U.S. military force beyond a no-fly zone against the Assad regime.
Then again, increased Medicare spending and reduced revenues will deplete the system's trust fund faster. The current insolvency date, with ACA in place, is 2028; after that point, Medicare's revenues won't be enough to cover all of its promised benefits.
That disease started in my skin, moved to my eyes, into my optic nerves, and when I went to graduate school, into my brain, she said.
My Administration has sent to the Congress a commonsense proposal to end the crisis on our southern border.
If they put everyone on Medicare, we seniors will be next in the line for bullet in the head… because they can't afford Medicare for everyone… it would not work, Greenstreet said.
I have met the men and women of Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Indiana, New Hampshire, and many other States whose dreams were shattered by NAFTA. For years, politicians promised them they would negotiate for a better deal. But no one ever tried — until now.
President Trump signed an executive order in September announcing a steadfast commitment to always protecting individuals with preexisting conditions, but the order alone can't force insurers to offer coverage if the ACA is struck down.
I am asking the Congress to pass legislation that finally takes on the problem of global freeloading and delivers fairness and price transparency for American patients. We should also require drug companies, insurance companies, and hospitals to disclose real prices to foster competition and bring costs down.
The events on the federal holiday didn't draw nearly as many people as the million-plus who thronged the streets following the Republican president's inauguration a month earlier, but the message was similar.
It's unlikely that Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez is going to lose his re-election effort in New Jersey in November, but it is not outside the realm of possibility. After a hung jury was unable to come to a verdict on federal corruption-related charges, the government dropped the case against Menendez, but the specter of his alleged misdeeds overshadows his campaign.
To any American who's got a problem with John McCain's vote, all I can tell you is John McCain was willing to die for this country, and he can vote any way he wants to, and it doesn't matter to me, the South Carolina senator said.
Clinton said, We've got to remain energy independent. She said she has a comprehensive energy plan that includes fighting climate change.
To me, the only way you're going to lift people out of poverty is with employment, and I think that's what really made me want to run for the seat, because I could see the need for career opportunities, not just jobs but actual careers, Klacik said in a recent interview.
CBS Los Angeles reported that organizers said they chose to rally on the holiday as a way to honor past presidents by exercising their constitutional right to assemble and peacefully protest.
He cast the pre-mandate system as the big government approach, since paying for care fell to taxpayers. He contrasted that with the mandate to buy insurance or pay a penalty, which he cast as the personal responsibility option.
Hillary is so strong. I have so much respect for the way she deals with that beast. — Alyssa Milano (@Alyssa_Milano) October 20, 2016
President Trump delivered his second State of the Union address Tuesday, Feb. 5, 2019, from the House chamber. The White House released the president's remarks as prepared for delivery.
She talks tough against Putin and Assad, he added. Every time we take rebels, we're arming people...they end up being worse than the people...almost everything she's done in foreign policy has been a mistake and it's been a disaster.
Cuba is decorated with murals showing famous moments in the town's history, like an 1864 battle during the Civil War. It's a town that knows something about a divided country.
Since entering the race last spring, former Joe Biden has slipped eight points in Iowa, according to the latest CBS News Battleground Tracker poll. Biden continues to lead nationally and remains a top-tier candidate for his party's nomination, but in interviews during the first two weeks of November with a dozen top Democratic leaders, officials and strategists, many expressed concerns to CBS News campaign reporters Musadiq Bidar and Adam Brewster about Biden's standing in Iowa.
Always protecting people with pre-existing [conditions], the president said. We're going to do even better.
Democrat Governor John Bel Edwards will be the first Democrat governor to win reelection in Louisiana since 1975, after defeating Republican Eddie Rispone by just over one percent on Saturday. And after almost two days of no public acknowledgement from Mr. Trump's Twitter account, Edwards spokesperson Eric Holl told CBS News political unit broadcast associate Aaron Navarro the president called to congratulate Edwards in private. At his election night watch party, CBS News political unit associate producer Sarah Ewall-Wice reports Edwards only mentioned Trump briefly in his remarks: You didn't just vote for me, you voted for four more years of putting Louisiana first...And as for the president, God bless his heart.
So first of all, you are taken seriously. I hope you are, he responded. And we are not going to hurt anything having to do with preexisting conditions. We're not going to hurt preexisting conditions. And, in fact, just the opposite.
Clinton also said her mother has a plan to pay for her higher-education proposals, unlike Sanders, who proposed free tuition at public colleges and universities. Clinton has also proposed to make tuition at two-year and four-year public universities free.
I'm going to vote for Biden, she said.
Mr. Trump said in February that the 15 coronavirus cases in the U.S. would soon be zero. He's also said repeatedly that the virus will eventually disappear, without citing evidence.
I'll be candid… one of the areas of agreement in even contentious times in the Obama administration was that our corporate tax rate is way too high, Sayegh said on the latest episode of The Takeout podcast. And it's made us uncompetitive. I mean, that is a point that both Republicans and Democrats largely agree on. We're going to really tackle that tax rate.
I've gotten to know many wonderful Angel Moms, Dads, and families – no one should ever have to suffer the horrible heartache they have endured.
Colorado Sen. Michael Bennet is the latest Democratic contender to enter the packed field of 2020 hopefuls, announcing on CBS This Morning on Thursday that he's running for president.
Klacik, a Baltimore County Republican Central Committee member, generated buzz with appearances on Fox News.

In just over 2 years since the election, we have launched an unprecedented economic boom — a boom that has rarely been seen before. We have created 5.3 million new jobs and importantly added 600,000 new manufacturing jobs — something which almost everyone said was impossible to do, but the fact is, we are just getting started.
In June, the Trump administration asked the Supreme Court to overturn Obamacare, arguing the individual mandate is unconstitutional and so, the rest of the law, which includes preexisting condition protections, should be struck down.
We must keep America first in our hearts. We must keep freedom alive in our souls. And we must always keep faith in America's destiny — that one Nation, under God, must be the hope and the promise and the light and the glory among all the nations of the world!
The Senate passed the measure last year under special rules that protected it from a Democratic filibuster, and the House passed it this week.
We will get through this crisis if we look out for one another and work together to expand coverage, lower costs and ensure that health care truly is aa right for all Americans, the president said.
A second Holocaust survivor who is here tonight, Joshua Kaufman, was a prisoner at Dachau Concentration Camp. He remembers watching through a hole in the wall of a cattle car as American soldiers rolled in with tanks. To me, Joshua recalls, the American soldiers were proof that God exists, and they came down from the sky.
But in the latest CBS News Battleground Tracker, just 12% of all voters in the early primary and caucus states through Super Tuesday say they are considering Yang. The campaign has done well to build support in online communities, but it is trying to spread the candidate's message to a wider audience. Last week, the Yang campaign launched a 7-figure ad buy in the early primary states with glossy ads focused on his health care policies and economic populism.
On Friday, it was announced that we added another 304,000 jobs last month alone — almost double what was expected. An economic miracle is taking place in the United States — and the only thing that can stop it are foolish wars, politics, or ridiculous partisan investigations.
Barrett wrote Roberts pushed the Affordable Care Act beyond its plausible meaning to save the statute. His decision, she continued, might be explained by the fact that Chief Justice Roberts has not proven himself to be a textualist in matters of statutory interpretation, unlike Scalia, a staunch textualist and originalist.
Democrats are also fuming that the confirmation process is happening so close to Election Day, four years after Republicans blocked the confirmation of Judge Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court because it was an election year. Democrats are expected to question Barrett about her judicial record, but they also may use their time to excoriate their Republican colleagues for choosing to hold the hearings now.
Clinton said she would save what works and what's good about Obamacare and provide additional help to small businesses.
In the last Congress, both parties came together to pass unprecedented legislation to confront the opioid crisis, a sweeping new Farm Bill, historic VA reforms, and after four decades of rejection, we passed VA Accountability so we can finally terminate those who mistreat our wonderful veterans.
A federal judge in Texas ruled on Friday the entire Affordable Care Act is unconstitutional due to a recent change in federal tax law. The ruling came a day before the December 15 deadline to sign up for 2019 health coverage through the Affordable Care Act's marketplace.
It has, in fact, been debunked. He said it on Howard Stern's radio show.

Three Republicans are vying to become the Republican candidate for Senate: Rep. Martha McSally, the choice of the party establishment, conservative firebrand Dr. Kelli Ward, and former Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio. Arpaio, who recently received a presidential pardon, will likely leech votes away from Ward, a former state senator who ran in the Republican primary against Sen. John McCain in 2016.
9:38 p.m. ET A Muslim undecided voter asked what the candidates would do to combat Islamophobia that's on the rise.
9:42 p.m. ET Martha Raddatz said that Trump's running mate, Mike Pence recently said that Trump's proposed Muslim ban from last December is no longer their campaign's position. Asked if that's correct, Trump said, First of all, Captain Khan is an American hero.
Well, that didn't happen, said Sunday Morning anchor Jane Pauley. But Speaker Pelosi is the most powerful woman in American history, and the most powerful woman in American politics. But you can't make the government open?
She said Sanders would dismantle Obamacare, the Children's Health Insurance Program, and Medicare -- along with private insurance programs.
But we must do more. It is unacceptable that Americans pay vastly more than people in other countries for the exact same drugs, often made in the exact same place. This is wrong, unfair, and together we can stop it.
Many of us campaigned on the same core promises: to defend American jobs and demand fair trade for American workers; to rebuild and revitalize our Nation's infrastructure; to reduce the price of healthcare and prescription drugs; to create an immigration system that is safe, lawful, modern and secure; and to pursue a foreign policy that puts America's interests first.
I wouldn't count him out, but there's certainly been some troubling signs, said former Democratic political operative Grant Woodard, who worked on Hillary Clinton's 2008 Iowa campaign. A top Iowa Democrat said the former vice president doesn't have the intensity of support that other candidates have shown, adding, If he's not in the top three it's over.
10:10 p.m. ET Martha Raddatz said that his running mate, Mike Pence, recently said that the U.S. should be prepared to use military force to strike the military targets of the Assad regime and that provocations by Russia need to be met with American strength.
The audit on Trump's returns, however, from 2002 to 2008 is complete, and Conway was asked about releasing those returns.
Counting votes is in her blood. She was born the daughter of a Congressman, later the longtime mayor of Baltimore, Tom D'Alesandro. Nancy was the youngest of seven, and the only girl.
We must choose whether we are defined by our differences — or whether we dare to transcend them.
When McCain announced he had brain cancer in July 2017, the revelation rocked Washington, D.C. — but it particularly touched Graham. It was Graham who, after being on the phone with McCain, broke the news to a meeting of fellow senators discussing health care.
Sinema would likely prefer to face a more extreme figure like Ward or Arpaio. However, McSally is the front-runner to win the nomination, making it less likely that moderates will flock to Sinema.
It's really very interesting, Trump said.

.@realDonaldTrump will try to call Not My Presidents' Day rallies in Britain FAKE NEWS, but really they're accurate AF. — Chris Walker (@thatchriswalker) February 20, 2017
Whatever the case, federal judges' own health coverage probably doesn't weigh too heavily on their decision-making. After all, we've been here before. The Supreme Court upheld the ACA in 2012, saying the individual mandate -- the area of the law under dispute in the Texas case -- was constitutional because of the tax penalty involved. But now that the Trump administration abolished the penalty, the recent lawsuit argued the entire law was no longer constitutional.
It was a friendship that would remain strong to the very end. McCain died on Saturday at 81.

Monday's rallies were the latest in what has been a seemingly endless string of protests against the president. Several cities hosted similar events over the weekend.

Clinton said that she was alluding to Steven Spielberg's movie about Abraham Lincoln.

While the ACA's ultimate fate may depend on those courts, here's what to know about the health coverage federal judges and Supreme Court justices can typically expect.
Someone count how many times he is clenching his jaw as she speaks. Crazy. #debates — KATY PERRY (@katyperry) October 20, 2016
Republicans want to make sure they are not going to appear to be lap dogs and lay down. They are saying yes, Evers won, but it's not a mandate and he can't arbitrarily throw out everything they've worked on for eight years. That becomes laying down the political gauntlet, says Republican strategist Brandon Scholz, asked about the politics at play. If roles were reversed, and Democrats were fortifying things they'd worked on for eight years, Republicans would say the same thing.
Trump said he would do away with carried interest, which he said helps the wealthy.
The Sanders campaign says their path to victory is all about turnout, particularly among those who have never voted before. Young people, the working class, and people of color are the wind in Sanders' sails.
In an interview on 610 WIOD Miami radio's Fernand Amandi Show, Stone was asked if Trump is making a mistake by not releasing his returns.
Of course I do, Trump said. Her donors took massive write-offs.

Many childhood cancers have not seen new therapies in decades. My budget will ask the Congress for $500 million over the next 10 years to fund this critical life-saving research.
Premium increases are also expected to hit employer-sponsored plans in 2017, but employers often offset those rises by passing on the costs to employees in the form of higher deductibles, co-pays and other out-of-pocket payments.
Sen. Joe Manchin is an endangered species: the last statewide Democrat standing in West Virginia, which voted for Mr. Trump by over 40 percentage points. If anywhere can truly be defined as Trump country, it is West Virginia, where formerly Democratic Gov. Jim Justice switched to the Republican Party in 2017 at a rally Mr. Trump.
Others took more offense to his nasty woman comment. Leslie Jones tweeted, She is 'nasty woman' he can't take it at all. Just a whiny little b***h!! Debra Messing retweeted a tweet that said, Retweet if you are a #NastyWoman.
Trump, however, slammed Obamacare, the situation involving trade and the U.S. border.
Together, we can break decades of political stalemate. We can bridge old divisions, heal old wounds, build new coalitions, forge new solutions, and unlock the extraordinary promise of America's future. The decision is ours to make.
At first glance, I have serious concerns about the bill's impact on the Nevadans who depend on Medicaid. I will read it, share it with Governor Sandoval, and continue to listen to Nevadans to determine the bill's impact on our state, said Sen. Dean Heller, R-Nevada, in a statement. Heller is up for re-election next year and is considered by Democrats to be one of the most vulnerable Republicans.
As we have seen, when we are united, we can make astonishing strides for our country. Now, Republicans and Democrats must join forces again to confront an urgent national crisis.

But we must do more. It is unacceptable that Americans pay vastly more than people in other countries for the exact same drugs, often made in the exact same place. This is wrong, unfair, and together we can stop it.

She said, If Hillary Clinton had won and the Affordable Care Act would be safe, I would've been happy to go home. I have options!
VIA CBS NEWS CAMPAIGN REPORTER JACK TURMAN Hawaii Representative Tulsi Gabbard, who memorably dinged California Senator Kamala Harris at a debate earlier this year, went on the attack against Elizabeth Warren in the last debate. Gabbard has redirected her focus to Hillary Clinton since then, a response to the former Democratic nominee's insinuation that the dovish congresswoman is a favorite of the Russians. Gabbard's campaign lawyer released a letter to Clinton, who recently indicated that she could still run for president, saying that she defamed Gabbard and demanded a retraction. Will Gabbard try to criticize Warren again and will she continue to go after Clinton?
Use it — and lose it coverage
Medicare for All would destroy our hospital system. Doctors wouldn't be able to make enough money to pay off their loans, he said. People want to keep their private plans.
When American soldiers set out beneath the dark skies over the English Channel in the early hours of D-Day, 1944, they were just young men of 18 and 19, hurtling on fragile landing craft toward the most momentous battle in the history of war.
In addition to the short timeline, the recent COVID-19 diagnoses from three Republican senators, two of whom serve on the Judiciary Committee, has further roiled the confirmation process. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell canceled legislative activity until October 19 after Senators Mike Lee, Thom Tillis and Ron Johnson tested positive for the coronavirus, but this week's hearings are proceeding as planned, with members having the opportunity to participate remotely.

The decision doesn't affect people currently insured in the ACA marketplaces or those who have just signed up for 2019 coverage. Ultimately, however, if the ruling holds it would dismantle the entire law -- that includes many of the popular ACA components such as protections for people with preexisting conditions, mandated coverage of essential health benefits and zero-cost preventive care. Medicaid expansion coverage under the ACA would also be in jeopardy.
