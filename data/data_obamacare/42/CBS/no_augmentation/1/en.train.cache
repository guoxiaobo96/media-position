donald trump: you know the amazing thing to show you the incredible nature of our country. first of all, every major leader and probably less than major le- has called me, i've spoken to many of them and i'll call the rest of them, but and i said, boy, this really shows you how powerful our country is. france and u.k. and i mean everybody, all over asia—and very, just to congratulate. but it really shows the power of our country.

internal trump campaign polling shows the president is struggling in key states and is lagging behind former vice president joe biden, the early democratic front runner. mr. trump has insisted that polls showing that he is vulnerable are fake, fabricated by the media or some other entity, or simply don't exist.
the gop tax plan that passed in december 2017 may still be controversial, but it is a signature campaign promise that the president kept.
i know there are a awful lot of folks out there who are writing off this campaign, biden said at the outset of the speech. well, i've got news for them. i'm not going anywhere.
that sense of community is fracturing across our nation right now, worn down by the petty and vicious nature of our politics. we are tired of the shutdowns and the showdowns, of the gridlock and the grandstanding, she said. today, on this snow day, on this island, we say, 'enough is enough.'
in nevada, longtime clark county commissioners steve sisolak and christina giunchigliani are leading a pack of six democrats vying to replace republican governor brian sandoval and become the state's first democratic governor in almost two decades. the winner will likely face republican adam laxalt, nevada's current attorney general.
after meeting during the day to discuss their options, the house put forward three measures that restore some aspects of government that seemed especially unpopular. earlier that morning, a group of world war ii honor flight veterans who were visiting washington pushed past the barricades blocking access to the world war ii memorial during the shutdown and proceeded with their visit. house republicans who had been appointed as negotiators pointed to the veterans as a reason for the legislation. they should, as americans, as veterans, people who served this country, have the ability to enjoy that site...the silliness that is caused by unwillingness to talk is what we're trying to avoid, and we invite the senate democrats to come and join us, said house majority leader eric cantor, r-va.
john mccain: i am more energetic and more engaged as a result of this because i know that i've got to do everything i can to serve this country while i can.
democrats in the senate said monday that republicans will pay a political price if the case results in the loss of popular obamacare.
clinton: well, 67 percent of the people voted to re-elect me when i ran for my second term, and i was very proud and very humbled by that.
a syrian refugee is one presidential guest to help mr. obama illustrate the situation in the middle east, especially the continuing threat posed by isis. this is a sore point with republican leaders.
the future of obamacare, the health care law implemented by president barack obama, has emerged as the key focus of democrats as they work to shape barrett's nomination and elevate the stakes for the public in hopes of pressuring the gop not to move forward with the confirmation process.
if the whole aca really is unconstitutional then let's just get everyone health care like other developed countries do. come to think of it, let's do that regardless, buttigieg said.
interesting how president obama so haltingly said i would never be president - this from perhaps the worst president in u.s. history! — donald j. trump (@realdonaldtrump) february 17, 2016
schumer urged democratic senators not to congregate in the senate chamber and cast their votes quickly.
margaret brennan: but, for example, in chicago, the mayor has said there that putting teachers ahead of other essential workers wouldn't necessarily be fair. will you put teachers ahead of those other essential workers in 1b?
the president has made lowering rx drug prices a top priority. polls show the majority of consumers are frustrated with the high cost of medicine. the administration's package to lower drug costs is long and complex, but ultimately doesn't offer a whole lot of relief to consumers.
question: what steps will your energy policy take to meet our energy needs, while at the same time remaining environmentally friendly and minimizing job loss for fossil power plant workers?
on the bureau of prisons-- currently 2,100 inmates and over 360 bureau prison staff have tested positive for covid-19. will you make universal testing available to the inmates and the staff?
house democrats and the trump administration had found themselves divided on a number of issues, ranging from the size of the package to its priorities. democrats are seeking funding to support states and local governments, which are facing massive budget shortfalls from the pandemic, as well as a restoration of $600 in weekly supplemental unemployment aid. republicans argue that the latter provides a disincentive for people to return to work.
the administration issued new rules on tuesday that expand the use of what's known as association health plans. they allow small businesses and self-employed individuals to buy health insurance collectively through what's loosely defined as an industry association. by pooling together, members can buy insurance for less expensive group rates, the way employees of large corporations do.

mr. trump also called on congress to repeal and replace the affordable care act, also known as obamacare. rubio said he agrees because people on obamacare are truly uninsured.
beyond assisting people with alzheimer's and other chronic medical conditions, her comprehensive proposal would also call for strengthening medicare and social security, reducing drug prices, creating personal savings accounts to help americans save for retirement and ensure paid family leave for all.
oklahomans will vote on the legalization of medicinal marijuana on tuesday.
the department of justice has determined that the district court's judgment should be affirmed, the justice department wrote in tuesday's memo.
since we passed tax cuts, roughly 3 million workers have already gotten tax cut bonuses – many of them thousands of dollars per worker.
there were reports that several top administration officials had been at odds over the justice department's brief. however, when vice president mike pence's chief of staff, marc short was asked about this by cbs news' major garrett, he denied that there had been much chaos, and characterized the discussion as a healthful conversation.
president donald trump: --a great job with covid.
lesley stahl: let me ask you about obamacare, which you say you're going to repeal and replace. when you replace it, are you going to make sure that people with pre-conditions are still covered?
president donald trump: it is totally true.
the difference is that, while republicans are clearly uncomfortable with trump's behavior, it's not clear at all that democrats or the liberal media feel the same way about excesses from their own side of the aisle. it's hard to take the new york times' calls for civility seriously when they are literally running fantasy fiction about assassinating president trump the day the pipe bomber is caught. hillary clinton's insults about the 60 million american deplorables are only criticized by democrats for costing her votes, not for the disdain of her fellow citizens.
still, tyler argues that there is a path to the nomination for gingrich.
tim ryan biography ryan was born and raised in northeastern ohio in 1973. he played football in high school and was recruited to play for youngstown state university. because of a knee injury, however, he transferred to bowling green state university, near toledo. after graduating from college, ryan earned a j.d. from the university of new hampshire and worked in the office of longtime ohio congressman james traficant, who was expelled from the house after being convicted of numerous counts of tax evasion, bribery and racketeering. at age 26, ryan was elected to ohio's state senate. when his old boss tradicant became embroiled in scandal, ryan ran an underdog campaign to fill his seat and won. at 29, he was the youngest member of congress when he was sworn in 2003. although he has served eight terms in the house, ryan gained notoriety following mr. trump's unexpected election in november 2016. citing democrats' loss of midwestern states during the election -- as well as the lack of youth in the party's leadership -- ryan launched an unsuccessful bid to replace nancy pelosi, then house minority leader. after democrats retook control of the house during the 2018 november midterm elections, the ohio lawmaker again called for someone to replace pelosi. ryan, however, ultimately backed her bid to reclaim the speaker's gavel. rep. tim ryan announces 2020 run 03:08 issues ryan has not staked out a clear ideological agenda during his 15 years in congress.
donald trump: well, i think the electoral ca-- look, i won with the electoral college.
in a press conference on tuesday, gingrich alluded to his recent financial difficulties, telling reporters that i think we can get to tampa despite the fact that clearly we're going to have to go on a fairly tight budget.
in 2014 bertolucci talked with film comment magazine about last tango, his most talked-about film. (schneider complained that bertolucci had not properly warned her about the improvisational sex scenes.) when i started, i didn't know where i could go with marlon brando and maria. because there is something that you can't tell in the screenplays – and it's exactly what's missing from screenplays, which is the flesh and blood of the real people in front of the camera. the script describes the characters, but when you go to shoot, you try to invent life in front of the camera.
the main focus of biden's visit to michigan according to brewster was to highlight new policies about penalizing companies who ship manufacturing jobs overseas and creating incentives for american manufacturing.
the democrats need to flip 23 republican-held districts to take control of the house of representatives this fall, and cbs news rates 4 of the house districts facing primary elections on tuesday as very likely or probably competitive in november (me-2, nv-3, nv-4, and va-10).
when answering questions about health care, harris again was on the defense when pence tried to interrupt her. he interrupted me, and i'd like to just finish, please, harris said after page told her that her allotted time was ending.
9:25 p.m. and just as i promised the american people from this podium 11 months ago, we enacted the biggest tax cuts and reforms in american history.our massive tax cuts provide tremendous relief for the middle class and small businesses, he said. a typical family of four making $75,000 will see their tax bill reduced by $2,000 -- slashing their tax bill in half. this april will be the last time you ever file under the old broken system -- and millions of americans will have more take-home pay starting next month.
lanny davis: i can see why mister giuliani re-- mentions recordings because he flat out lied when he said that there was no mention of cash by president trump on the tape recording that i went on cnn to play. it was mister giuliani who lied about-- that tape recording is evidence that the primary purpose of the payoff of the hush money to miss daniels was the election. it says so on the tape. mister pecker from ami corroborates it and others will corroborate it. mister giuliani going on the air today ignoring the fact the fec never ruled--
president donald trump has vowed to dismantle obamacare -- and con artists have been listening. earlier this year, the government nixed the so-called individual mandate that required all americans to buy health insurance or pay a tax penalty. and last month, new rules were adopted that allow millions of people to buy cheaper temporary health policies if they don't get coverage through work.
fact check: partly true. premiums are going up, but trump is greatly exaggerating how much of a cost increase any given insurance plan has undergone. nationally, premiums on average have increased from 4.4 percent to 13 percent, according to politifact's reported estimates. additionally, the kaiser foundation reported an average increase of 10 percent for their 2016-2017 insurance plans.
for some perspective, the eia said there were 1,458 coal mines in 2008, meaning more than half of the coal mines operating barely a decade ago no longer are.
clinton gave 30,490 work-related emails to the state department in december 2014 and deleted an additional 31,830 she said were personal emails (she did, indeed, say these were related to planning chelsea's wedding or my mother's funeral arrangements, condolence notes to friends as well as yoga routines, family vacations, the other things you typically find in inboxes).
he'll enforce immigration laws to keep us safe, while allowing legal immigrants to bless this nation with their talents and their dreams. he'll take control of our borders, because we must stop the flow of cocaine and heroin coming into our country and killing our kids, she said.
and i was making the point that it is hard sometimes to get the congress to do what you want to do and you have to keep working at it. and, yes, president lincoln was trying to convince some people, he used some arguments, convincing other people, he used other arguments. that was a great — i thought a great display of presidential leadership.
in a glowing profile published by the new yorker last year, patrick said he campaigned during the 2018 midterm elections in congressional districts where democrats had not been competitive in a long time and were running at the grassroots level.
speaker nancy pelosi: that's like five people.
robert o'brien: i-- i have not seen that. and-- and again, why would they have a preference for president trump, who is rebuilding our military, who is giving the ukrainians lethal aid to fight russian troops? so that doesn't make sense. now, look, we want good relations with russia. we'd like to have great relations with russia. i haven't seen any intelligence that there's any active measures by the russians to try and get the president re-elected. and-- and we've got a simple message for the russians or any other country that wants to-- to meddle in our elections, whoever they are behind: stay out of our democratic elections. and-- and we're doing everything we can. we're working with state and local officials. we're going, in many cases--
trump-pence talk with lesley stahl on 60 minutes
days away from the start of his eighth and final year as president, he wants to spotlight the administration accomplishments he thinks are overlooked or taken for granted, and also lay out his vision for the rest of his term in office. he has made it clear he has no interest in cruising gently to the end of his presidency.
john dickerson: and we'll be right back.
a million jobs? jennings questioned in disbelief. great! who here has a great job? or is looking forward to finishing school? do you really feel like you have a job coming up? she asked, looking around the starbucks.
we are the party of new ideas in a world changing faster than ever before. democrats depend on superdelegates and bureaucrats to sneak their agenda through the backdoor. we are the party of the grassroots. we honor what the voters say, he said.
republicans acknowledge that last summer was not the party's finest hour, as former mcconnell adviser josh holmes put it.
on abc's this week on sunday, conway was also asked if trump should be more transparent with his taxes.
lesley stahl: --people can see cases going up all over the-- in the midwest, in the mountain west, record numbers of cases--
we have another audience question. beth miller has a question for both candidates.
about 2,000 voters in montgomery county, pennsylvania, received mail-in ballots for the incorrect party over the past week, reports cbs news campaign reporter zak hudak. because the state holds a closed primary, democrats and republicans can only vote in their own party's races, but voters in the eastern pennsylvania county have been receiving ballots for the other party's primaries. the blunder was the result of a technology issue, said teresa harris, a spokesperson for the montgomery county board of commissioners. the printer removed independent and third-party voters who can't vote in this primary, but accidentally rearranged the remaining voters and parties in its system, mixing them up, harris said. by retracing how it happened, the printer was able to identify the voters who received the wrong ballots. harris said county officials are working with the postal service to expedite the delivery of replacement ballots for those voters. the mistake comes two weeks after the same county said it sent faulty supplemental instructions to tens of thousands of voters. pennsylvania elections offices are facing an unprecedented mail-in challenge in the state, with over 1.6 million residents applying for mail-in or absentee ballots, up from 84,000 in 2016.
for many with obesity, deciding to get the covid-19 vaccine is tough
the president said he kept provisions protecting preexisting conditions, even though his administration has been fighting against those protections in court. the supreme court, which now has only eight justices, will hear arguments on the fate of the aca a week after the election. mr. trump is determined to confirm his replacement for the late justice ruth bader ginsburg before then.
in 1983 as his career was beginning to cool (a screenplay he'd written for the right stuff was rejected), he wrote a memoir of his years in hollywood, adventures in the screen trade, an invaluable treatise on the business and art of filmmaking. other non-fiction books included wait till next year, a collection of sports writing; and hype and glory, about his experience judging the cannes film festival. goldman always wanted to write, but his early aspiration was to be a sports writer, and he did not seem to take the results of his hollywood labors too seriously. in william goldman: the reluctant storyteller, he rejected analysis of his work. i'm just trying to tell a story, he said. i wrote a movie called 'butch cassidy and the sundance kid' and i wrote a novel called the princess bride,' and those are the only two things i've ever written, not that i'm proud of, but that i can look at without humiliation.
in his book, trump also called for a one-time, 14.25 percent tax on individuals and trusts with a net worth over $10 million, which the club for growth called a massive tax hike on americans that would kill jobs and investment.
lesley stahl: well, as i understand it the progressives want radical change. they wanna get rid of obamacare and replace it with medicare for all. i was under the impression that you had said that you do not favor medicare for all, that-- aca, obamacare is better.
speaking at a senate hearing wednesday, redfield also testified that wearing a mask is more guaranteed to protect someone from the coronavirus than receiving a vaccine. we have clear scientific evidence they work, i might even go so far as to say that this face mask is more guaranteed to protect me against covid than when i take a covid vaccine, because the immunogenicity may be 70%, redfield said. if i don't get an immune response, the vaccine's not going to protect me, this face mask will.
joe biden: yeah. and so we'll see. i mean it's a little premature to make the judgment whether or not this is a good deal or not a good deal.
the five ads all unveiled today focus around the argument that joe biden and kamala harris are too weak and too radical to protect americans and keep small businesses safe. in one, a man named scott talks about businesses being burned to the ground. i'm not much for politics but joe biden is so weak, he'll never stand up for folks like us, he says.
senator amy klobuchar: thanks, margaret. hello.
lesley stahl: sir, excuse me, cases are up in about 40 states.
well, you know, people sometimes plead to things that turn out not to be crimes. and as i said, the question of lying, you know, it's something he would know about. on its face, as director comey said, it's not so clear. but the question of materiality is not something he would know about. that's something that the government knows about. and we have now gotten into it, drilled down, obtained new information. and the department of justice is not persuaded that this was material to any legitimate counterintelligence investigation. so it was not a crime.
republicans cite the health insurance provisions as an example of coronavirus overreach by democrats. policy consultant brian blase, a former health care adviser in the trump white house, said most of the additional subsidies for coverage will merely substitute for what private households would have otherwise paid. if made permanent, he predicts that over time the sweeter tax credits will have the unintended consequence of enticing small businesses to stop offering coverage to their workers.
frustration with the president might push sporadic voters who don't typically wade into midterm elections to head to the polls and sway independents and moderates. early vote numbers indicate turnout is already higher than previous cycles — 40 percent of ballots had already been cast as of halloween morning. in key states like georgia, florida, nevada, michigan, and texas, numbers are up significantly, including among young voters, which could be good news for democrats like stacey abrams and beto o'rourke looking for upset victories.
we'll be back in a moment.

senator rick scott: well, we don't agree on much, but i'm glad he cares about prescription drug prices. but the-- the problem the democrats have is everything they keep doing is raising the cost of health care. let's look at obamacare--
the trump campaign on thursday blasted joe biden over his proposed plan.
the ruling thursday by u.s. district judge john bates in washington, d.c., is the second setback in a week for the administration's health care initiatives. on wednesday another federal judge blocked medicaid work requirements for low-income people.
in his first week in office, mr. trump began implementing several of his key campaign promises, largely through executive actions: he's directed federal agencies to ease the financial burden of obamacare, authorized the construction of a u.s.-mexico border wall and temporarily suspended all travel to the u.s. from seven muslim-majority countries.
gillibrand's positions have become more progressive during her time in the senate. issues gillibrand advocated the repeal of the don't ask, don't tell policy on lgbt military service when she got to the senate in 2009. she made a name for herself in the senate by addressing sexual assault in the military. she proposed legislation that would remove sexual assault cases from the military chain of command in 2013, legislation which was co-sponsored by republican senators rand paul and ted cruz. although the legislation failed, it raised her profile as an advocate for women. gillibrand has acknowledged her changed positions on immigration and gun control, saying in a 60 minutes profile in 2018 that she was embarrassed and ashamed of her stances while serving in the house. health care has been an important issue for gillibrand since entering the senate. she came out in favor of single-payer healthcare in 2017 and co-sponsored a medicare-for-all bill introduced by sen. bernie sanders. she was the first sitting senator to call for u.s. immigration and customs enforcement to be abolished, a popular cause on the left. controversy gillibrand has faced criticism for representing cigarette manufacturer philip morris during her time at davis polk, including in civil and criminal investigations by the department of justice. she has also been accused of political opportunism for changing her positions so dramatically when she entered the senate. the new york senator has alienated some in her party with her hardline position on responding to sexual misconduct.
that statement comes after he raised the idea last week of subjecting muslims to take a test and deport those who supports sharia law.
the president has been making versions of this statement since his campaign. on the claim about illegal immigrants causing the loss of many innocent lives, politifact has pointed out that the statement is so vague that sure, it's bound to be true, but it doesn't really say much. university of california, irvine criminology professor charis kubrin points out that it's about as accurate as saying thousands of americans have been killed by men.
trump: ... for weeks — i've been reading now for weeks about mosul, that it's the harbor of where — you know, between raqqa and mosul, this is where they think the isis leaders are. why would they be saying — they're not staying there anymore. they're gone. because everybody's talking about how iraq, which is us with our leadership, goes in to fight mosul.
margaret brennan: and that means a shutdown?
it was truly an honor to introduce my wife, melania. her speech and demeanor were absolutely incredible. very proud! #gopconvention — donald j. trump (@realdonaldtrump) july 19, 2016
susan page: and the president notes correctly that he has gotten several people who had been held in north korea and elsewhere, and-- and got them returned to the united states, and that's-- and that's a fair point. although the bizarre element of that moment i thought was not the prayer, because, understandably, the pastor would say a prayer of gratitude of being back, but the president then asking him, let me ask you, did you vote for me in 2016 when, of course, he was in prison in turkey.
his sudden death will have an immediate impact on the current term, full of controversial cases: regulation of abortion clinics, another challenge to obamacare, affirmative action in college admissions, and presidential power on immigration.
lesley stahl: you can do things lickety-split.
he means a 5% surtax on household incomes over $5 million and a roll back of president trump's 2017 cuts for the wealthy.
asked about court reforms like these during his new york times editorial board interview in january, biden said he did not support any of them.
margaret brennan: are americans going to see a shutdown over christmas?
i have to be honest, i've never liked him much. hasn't been for me. i really probably never will, mr. trump said.
retailers and technology stocks also sank. some of the biggest losses are going to utilities and real estate companies, which have done better than the rest of the market during the turbulence of the last three months.
the democrats need to flip 23 republican-held districts to take control of the house of representatives this fall, and cbs news does not race either of the two house primaries on tuesday as competitive.
gayle king (cbs this morning): what do you want to happen to justin fairfax? why are you coming forward?
here's a breakdown of the women joining team trump:
it takes the votes of four justices for the court to agree to review a case. if kennedy's replacement is a fourth vote for a new case about guns, then roberts might soon have to weigh in on issues like the right carry a concealed firearm in public or bans on assault weapons, winkler said.
however, because many everyday americans would ... face great uncertainty if that ruling were immediately put into effect, o'connor issued a stay to allow for appeals. a group of republican-led states brought the lawsuit forward earlier this year.
lesley stahl: he has been through so much?
dorcas reilly cbs news dorcas reilly (july 22, 1926-oct. 15, 2018) was a campbell soup kitchen supervisor in 1955 when she combined the ingredients of the now-legendary green bean casserole for an associated press feature. the popular dish, made with green beans and cream of mushroom soup and topped with crunchy fried onions, is the most popular recipe ever to come out of campbell's corporate kitchen. in a 2005 ap interview marking the recipe's 50th anniversary, reilly said she didn't remember having a hand in it because the dish was among hundreds that were created during her decades at campbell's. [she also helped create a tomato soup meatloaf, a tuna noodle casserole, and sloppy joe-like souperburgers.''] the recipe is still a fixture on soup-can labels and television commercials. and reilly said she always kept the ingredients for the casserole on hand in her home, just in case someone asked her to whip one up. the recipe's website got 2.7 million visits during last year's holidays, the company said.
during the campaign mr. trump said he would appoint a special prosecutor to look into hillary clinton's email issue.
at the same point in his presidency, obama had taken 10 vacation trips totaling all or part of 61 days.
lesley stahl: how surprised were you?
frankly i think that democrats, nationally, are not counting on north dakota as a place to pick up a house seat. -- dale wetzel, a former ap state capitol reporter
margaret brennan: but what gave pause last time? i mean, sometimes it's hard to predict how judges will actually rule on individual cases. but is there something that we should be scrutinizing here in terms of her stance? i mean democrats are assuming she's against affordable care and against roe versus wade? are those fair assumptions?
president donald trump: no, no. it's wrong.
the aca pushed the number of americans with health coverage to historic highs. but since president trump took office, his administration and republicans in congress have made a series of changes that undermine the law, such as repealing the individual mandate that required people to have health insurance, limiting the amount of time people who have to sign up for health care, drastically cutting the budget for obamacare outreach and allowing states to enact work requirements as a condition of medicaid eligibility.
jamelle bouie: --in the past three years. sanders seems to be the one doing it, right? we see-- we saw this in nevada, pulling together a coalition of union households, of minority voters of working class voters, to young voters into something that looks like potentially an electoral juggernaut. so i-- i sort of think the certainty among the democratic establishment such that it is that sanders is unelectable runs into the fact that looking at what we know so far he appears to be quite electable based on the measures we use for everyone else.
jonah goldberg: and if trump wins fifty-one percent of that argument about defining the terms, it's very good for him. if he loses it, it's very bad for him.
we estimate about $500 billion of tax increases are possible, obviously a smaller number than another potential covid stimulus round, and also smaller than the $1 trillion-plus spending now in play for each of health care and infrastructure, zezas added.
john dickerson: break-- break away from that technology but stay with us until the show's over. we'll be right back.
issues klobuchar is a very active senator who is often willing to work on a bipartisan basis. as of december, klobuchar has sponsored 111 pieces of legislation which have been signed into law. however, klobuchar is also ideologically liberal on several issues. as a member of the senate in 2009, klobuchar voted to pass the affordable care act, commonly known as obamacare. she is pro-choice and supports lgbt rights. she also has an f rating from the national rifle association. klobuchar is a member of the senate judiciary committee, and made a name for herself in 2018 for her calm yet incisive questioning of then-supreme court nominee brett kavanaugh during the hearings investigating claims of sexual misconduct against kavanaugh in september. at one point, when asking if kavanaugh had ever blacked out from drinking, he retorted: have you? the moment quickly went viral, and kavanaugh later apologized. controversy klobuchar was the sole senator from minnesota during the resolution of the contested senate election from january to july 2009, which al franken eventually won. when franken was accused of sexual harassment in december 2017, klobuchar did not call for franken to step down, unlike many other senators. franken resigned shortly after the allegations came to light.
after al franken's senate seat was vacated amid #metoo allegations, how will minneapolis women vote?
i think politically it's not smart, said new york republican rep. tom reed. but more substantively, we should be finding areas where we can fix healthcare, and not continue this division of [repealing] obamacare with no hardcore proposal as to what we're going to do about the millions of folks that are potentially adversely impacted.
he said desantis voted more than a dozen times to repeal the affordable care act, often called obamacare, and told a cancer patient to go to an emergency room to get health care.
if the law is overturned, nearly 20 million people could lose their health insurance. children would no longer be covered until age 26, and it could affect people with preexisting conditions.
the aca helps americans of all ages who don't have access to health insurance through their employers. the aca clearly has flaws, but having lawmakers work together to fix them is a better outcome for this group of americans than outright repeal.
anthony senecal, who worked as donald trump's butler for 17 years at his mar-a-lago estate in florida and knows he billionaire republican presidential candidate well, frequently expresses his hatred for president obama on social media. but his latest missive has drawn the attention of the secret service.
i think we want to get the pain over with, he said.
manuel bojorquez: across the nation of the nearly fifty million doses distributed to states, just sixty percent have been administered. in an effort to speed up the process, fema is now asking the defense department to ready as many as ten thousand troops to assist in vaccine clinics. yet for those who have received the shot, racial disparities persist, with white residents being vaccinated at higher rates than black residents, often double the rate or higher in one survey. at this clinic in south los angeles, a surprise shipment of six hundred doses before closing became a lifeline for those who have struggled to secure appointments.
lesley stahl: okay, but forget him for a minute. you're president--
president donald trump: and on the assumption that the supreme court upholds, we will get great, great health care for our people. we'll have to sit down with the democrats to do it, but i'm sure they want to do it also.
fda moves to pull pork antibiotic linked to cancer
has this been one of the most consequential decisions that you have made as attorney general?
but this is still a republican state, and the latest mason-dixon poll shows reeves with a slight edge over hood. the democrat's internal polling, meanwhile, shows hood beating reeves by a similarly narrow margin.
in addition, the trump administration recently approved walker's plan to lower obamacare premiums in wisconsin, even though the president has yet to endorse walker's gubernatorial bid. a recent nbc news/marist college poll from july shows wisconsin schools superintendent tony evers, the democratic frontrunner, leading walker by 13 points in a head-to-head match-up. but walker is the only governor to survive a recall election, and he also enjoys the support of the koch brothers, who recently expressed dismay with mr. trump. this race is sure to be competitive as walker tries to appeal to two different bases - trump supporters and moderates.
biden: and so we'll see. i mean, it's a little premature to make the judgment whether or not this is a good deal or not a good deal.

miller: this is a- this is a very- if it comes to it, absolutely. this is a very fundamental issue. at stake is the question of whether or not the united states remains a sovereign country. whether or not we can establish and enforce rules for entrance into our country. the democrat party has a simple choice, they can either choose to fight for america's working class or to promote illegal immigration. you can't do both.
a key issue is coverage for the nearly 3 million arizonans with preexisting conditions. in congress, sinema voted to keep that coverage under obamacare. mcsally voted to repeal it, but said she still wants to cover those with preexisting conditions.

and as always, we'll turn to our panel for some perspective on the week that was:
the ceo of the convention, jeff larson, addressed the anti-trump delegate coalition and noted that their efforts to change the rules of the nominating process was a little unfair.
kelsey snell: yeah, you absolutely do. and i think it-- also a big challenge, particularly for democrats in the house who don't want to get into this fight right at the very beginning of taking power, because there won't have to be facing off against the president, and potentially making compromises that many of these people were elected saying that they would never compromise on. so, it-- it would be more difficult for some democrats in particular to move this conversation to january.
john dickerson: but their argument would be if you want to get these problems solved in the senate where you know you need 60 votes when you have-- you need to do a little outreach and- and be ready. if you're gonna say, it's my way or the highway, be-- recognize the fact--

barrett's thoughts on roe v. wade, the 1973 landmark supreme court decision that established a woman's right to an abortion, were also scrutinized by democrats on the panel. she also declined to commit to recusing from any case stemming from the 2020 presidential election that ends up before the supreme court.

sen. barrasso: that said if the mandate goes away then other things go away. you know as a doctor people say to me what does this mean to me. and for right now, very little if you're a doctor, if you're getting treatment if you have a preexisting condition if you signed up for obamacare on this recent sign up period it doesn't change a thing.
robert o'brien: --to paper ballots to make sure that-- that, you know, governments with ill intent can't hack secretary of state websites, can't get involved in our elections, change results. and-- and we're going to work on election security very, very hard through-- across the interagency in the federal government and also with our state and-- and local partners.
lesley stahl: when they demonstrate against you and there are signs out there, i mean, don't you say to yourself, i guess you don't, you know, do i have to worry about this? do i have to go out and assuage them? do i have to tell them not to be afraid? they're afraid.

when i speak, i go out and speak, the people of this country are furious. in my opinion, the people that have been long-term workers at the fbi are furious. there has never been anything like this, where e-mails — and you get a subpoena, you get a subpoena, and after getting the subpoena, you delete 33,000 e-mails, and then you acid wash them or bleach them, as you would say, very expensive process.

democratic group priorities usa announced tuesday it had received $25.1 million in commitments across all of its entities since the beginning of april, and the group's fundraising continues to strengthen. in the first half of may, cbs news political unit associate producer sarah ewall-wice reports priorities usa brought in about $9.3 million with an additional $8.2 million in commitments, up from about $7.6 million raised during the month of april. overall, priorities usa says it raised more than $145 million this cycle including $126 million already in the door and another $19 million in additional commitments, putting it well on its way to surpassing its $200 million budget for the 2020 election cycle. donald trump and his allies have started advertising in battleground states and it's imperative that priorities gives joe biden the air cover he needs as he builds his general election campaign, said priorities usa chairman guy cecil in a statement. so far, our donors are rising to the occasion and we have seen an increase in our fundraising.
in south carolina, democratic senate challenger jaime harrison's campaign announced a $2.1 million fundraising haul in q3, a feat that harrison's team has called record-breaking, in its effort to unseat incumbent senator lindsey graham. harrison raised $1.5 million in the second quarter, and graham doubled that total, bringing in more than $3 million in the second fundraising quarter.
cruz on obama: he's not arming the kurds.
the bill doesn't fulfill the administration's supplemental request for $18 billion in cuts for non-defense domestic programs, according to the senior aide, though a gop aide disputed that characterization and said some of those cuts were already built into individual bills. cbs news reported earlier this month that negotiators were expected to ignore the $18 billion request, partially because it's so late into the fiscal year. instead, the legislation includes spending boosts to domestic programs. if approved by congress, the national institutes of health (nih), for example, would receive a $2 billion funding increase despite the president's request to cut it.

it's a course correction that's enabling senate republicans to motor through their agenda this summer. they're confirming mr. trump's new judges, approving funding bills ahead of a government shutdown deadline and laying the groundwork for a fall vote on supreme court nominee brett kavanaugh. they've decided that forfeiting the august break is a small price to pay to prevent another round of republican-on-republican infighting before the midterm election.

as the senate votes to put forward another bill to repeal the affordable care act, support for the law - also known as obamacare - has dropped since june. then, for the first time since it was passed, more americans approved than disapproved of the law. now 40 percent approve and 52 percent disapprove of the aca, similar numbers to what has been recorded for most of the past twelve months.
donald trump: well, i can't tell you that, but i have made--
cbs news is chronicling what has changed for the lives of residents of some of the biggest battleground states in 2020 amid the coronavirus pandemic. in the latest edition of covid chronicles, cbs news campaign reporter lacrai mitchell continues to examine the economic impacts of the coronavirus pandemic on black business owners, with a dispatch out of north carolina. patrick williams, 45, had just become one of four business partners at pier 34 seafood & pub in goldsboro, when the restaurant closed due to the pandemic. pier 34 continued to offer take-out and delivery options while the restaurant was physically closed but the team barely earned half of what they had been receiving per month. the restaurant has reopened and while it could sustain another six months at its current revenue, williams said that it would be cutting it hard, and his team would eventually have to decide whether to keep their doors open or permanently close. according to research done by the university of california in santa cruz, there were more than a million black-owned businesses in the u.s. at the beginning of february. by mid-april, 440,000 black business owners had permanently shut down — a 41% drop. women-owned businesses saw a 25% plunge.
the supreme court agreed in march to hear the case, and the decision is expected by the end of june 2021. the court upheld the individual mandate in a pivotal 2012 decision, in which chief justice john roberts joined four liberal justices in ruling that congress had the authority to enforce the mandate under its taxing power.

margaret brennan: so you mentioned that one of the issues you're still in disagreement with-- with the union is over vaccination. chicago is one of the few cities in this country that gets its supply directly from the federal government. the federal guidelines prioritize based on age. that's why i was asking cedric richmond, the adviser to the president, about it. i wonder if it would be helpful to you if the biden administration explicitly said to prioritize teachers in the front of the line as essential workers?
rather than pursuing obamacare romney said, the government should leave coverage for the uninsured up to the states. while some have said the president's health care plan has lost popularity among the public because they did not understand exactly what he has been advocating, romney said the democrats have only themselves to blame for their legislative failures.

governor ned lamont: well, i can tell you they gave us-- the previous administration gave us fifty thousand additional doses because we are doing a good job of getting people vaccinated on a timely basis. but i think what's most important right now for the biden administration is give us some transparency, let us know what we can expect next week, what we can expect next month so we know how much to expand our infrastructure. but we're ready to get people vaccinated. you just get us the vaccines.
that didn't work out too well, trump told fox news in an interview on new year's eve. we'll see how she does. i wish her well, i hope she does well. i'd love to run against her. warren frequently taunted mr. trump during the 2016 campaign, and often takes to the president's favorite outlet, twitter, to criticize him and his policies directly. asked by fox news whether warren would be able to win, the president said, well, that i don't know. you would have to ask her psychiatrist.
you've been supporting conservative candidates, kasich said tuesday in comments on a wisconsin radio talk show, first reported by buzzfeed news. they told you in 2014 that they were going to repeal obamacare. do you realize, that's just--that's a big joke?

anderson cooper: what would your criteria be for military action? do you?
the reasons for the increase are varied and still a bit speculative, said sara collins, commonwealth vice president for health care coverage and access. she and her colleagues at commonwealth point to the trump administration's drastic cutbacks on advertising and outreach during open enrollment for the obamacare health care exchanges. many exchanges saw robust signups despite the cutbacks, but overall the number of people who declined to buy insurance increased.

called the lincoln project, the group was founded by eight men and women who had previously worked with republicans such as rudy giuliani, john mccain, and president george w. bush. although it has endorsed the democratic presidential hopeful, former vice president joe biden, the group has said they do not represent any particular candidate, campaign, or party.
senator bernie sanders: no. no. look, yes, trump has an idea on health care. his idea is to throw thirty-two million americans off of the health insurance they have, doing away with insurance for kids who are twenty-six years of age or younger who are on their parent's plans, doing away with the protections that the aca has for pre-existing conditions, margaret. that means if you have cancer, you have heart disease, you have diabetes. if trump gets his way the cost of health insurance for you will be so high that many people literally will not be able to afford it. thousands of people will literally die. that's trump's health insurance plan. my plan's just a little bit different. i think we should join the rest of the industrialized world. guarantee health care to all people as a right. end the absurdity of the united states spending twice as much per capita on health care as any other nation while our life expectancy is actually going down and our health care outcomes are worse than many other countries. and by the way, we pay by far the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs. margaret, let me make a campaign promise to you and you can repeat this, play this tape over if i'm elected president. and that is, if i am elected president i'm going to cut prescription drug costs in this country by fifty percent so that we are not paying any more than other major countries are paying.
tiffany told navarro that he spoke briefly with president trump after his tuesday-night win. trump endorsed tiffany and also joined one of his tele-town halls on monday night with rnc chair ronna mcdaniel. now a congressman-elect, tiffany said his priority is helping congress with the country's reopening. we know who is most affected by this... we need to make sure that we protect those people. we need to make sure that our frontline health care providers are protected, tiffany said tuesday night.
margaret brennan: would you keep these children in detention longer or deport them faster? what would you do?
kelsey snell: yeah. and that is something that i have talked to many senators about their concerns, about backlogging the number of people who need to be confirmed. you got to remember, they still need to nominate, and approve an attorney general. but the thing that i think is interesting about the white house strategy here is they are looking forward to democrats in the house, planning a number of investigations. and i've heard democrats say that they don't think that just getting rid of the head of an agency is going to forestall those investigations. if it's the white house's intent to avoid that, this may not be the strategy that actually gets the outcome that they're hoping for.
in 2000, kavanaugh unsuccessfully attempted to prevent 6-year-old refugee elian gonzalez from being returned to cuba. but later that year, he worked for then-republican nominee george w. bush in bush v. gore, which ended the florida recount after the 2000 presidential election.
eight million kids every year have health insurance, because when i was first lady i worked with democrats and republicans to create the children's health insurance program. hundreds of thousands of kids now have a chance to be adopted because i worked to change our adoption and foster care system. after 9/11, i went to work with republican mayor, governor and president to rebuild new york and to get health care for our first responders who were suffering because they had run toward danger and gotten sickened by it. hundreds of thousands of national guard and reserve members have health care because of work that i did, and children have safer medicines because i was able to pass a law that required the dosing to be more carefully done.
congresswoman marcia fudge of ohio said that at some point the democratic party must reward and recognize its loyal soldiers, namely, black women. fudge also warned that if the party doesn't mobilize black women, democrats can't win in november. the mistake i believe we have made in the last couple of races we've run is we neglect to bring out our base, fudge said. the base of the democratic party clearly is black and brown, but more black than brown.

in april, tillemann leaked a recording of a conversation of a meeting he had with house minority whip steny hoyer to the intercept. in the recording, hoyer encourages tillemann to bow out of the race, making it clear that crow is the establishment favorite. tillemann has used this to burnish his credentials as an outsider fighting against the party machine. the denver post reports, with just weeks left in the race, tillemann has doubled down on that outsider approach by trying to position himself as the true progressive in the democratic primary — arguing that he, not crow, would pursue the impeachment of president donald trump. impeachment is a topic that the establishment is hoping to avoid since they think it could galvanize the right and hurt their chances of winning in the fall.

these reforms will also support our response to the terrible crisis of opioid and drug addiction. never before has it been like it is now. it is terrible. we have to do something about it. in 2016, we lost 64,000 americans to drug overdoses -- 174 deaths per day; 7 per hour. we must get much tougher on drug dealers and pushers if we are going to succeed in stopping this scourge.
john dickerson: and, susan, may-- maybe some people are arguing what led the saudis to believe this is not a lot of scolding on what is happening in yemen. and that there were-- there is a pattern here of, basically, saying either explicitly or implicitly, we're not going to mess with your sovereignty.

but the 37-page white paper falls far short of a full-scale replacement proposal for obamacare and leaves key questions unanswered, including the size of the tax credits, the overall price tag of the plan, and how many people would be covered. republican aides said it's intended as an overall roadmap showing how the gop would approach undoing and replacing obama's health law with a republican in the white house, and specific legislative details would be answered as the actual bills are written next year.
on tuesday, president trump will head to west virginia, home to one of the most competitive senate races in the country. republicans are setting their sights on flipping incumbent democratic sen. joe manchin's seat in a state that mr. trump won by nearly 42 percentage points in 2016 and where his approval rating remains high. a gallup poll following mr. trump's first year in office found that he received his highest approval ratings in 2017 from west virginians.

lesley stahl: and there's going to be a period if you repeal it and before you replace it, when millions of people could lose -– no?
susan glasser: absolutely. i think this is going to emerge as a case study of why words do matter in the trump presidency. and jonah's point is a very important one. what have we seen that's different from president trump from his predecessors, democrat and republican? i would say that it's so much more of a transactional view of america's position in the world. and that is something that's-- that's quite different. certainly, you've had criticism of even barack obama for not emphasizing human rights as much as others. but you've never had a president before who called journalist the enemy of the people. now if you are the crown prince of saudi arabia, do you think you might factor that in to your calculation about what you could do with this particular dissident journalist when you have your good friend and ally, the president, say the journalists are enemies of the people. i think it's-- it's a really interesting example. also, you know, values no longer figures in american foreign policy in the way that it has in the past.
a: many fear it would lead to rising numbers of uninsured, higher out-of-pocket costs as benefits get skimpier, and less affordable coverage - especially for older adults who are more prone to health problems.

in california, where cke has been based for decades (it will soon move its headquarters to nashville, tennessee), labor laws mandate breaks for employees that can conflict with surges in customers coming through the door, he has complained. this leads to long lines and consumer griping. while he doesn't oppose rational increases in the minimum wage, he has said, they shouldn't be so high they kill jobs.
cbs news campaign reporter musadiq bidar says the ad is part of a seven-figure tv, digital, and radio buy the bennet campaign campaign pushed starting last month. earlier this week, the campaign announced it had raised over $2 million in the third quarter and has $1.8 million cash on hand. bennet's campaign says 98% of the contributions it has received have been $100 or less.

but the pentagon's leadership is in a state of flux. on tuesday, mr. trump tweeted that shanahan has withdrawn his name from consideration for defense secretary. instead, army secretary mark esper will serve as acting defense secretary.
and the affordable care act was meant to try to fill the gap between people who were too poor and couldn't put together any resources to afford health care, namely people on medicaid. obviously, medicare, which is a single-payer system, which takes care of our elderly and does a great job doing it, by the way, and then all of the people who were employed, but people who were working but didn't have the money to afford insurance and didn't have anybody, an employer or anybody else, to help them.

after the primary was postponed in march, ohio's mail-in primary ends tuesday, providing a preview of what could come in november's general election if the coronavirus pandemic continues at a high rate. cbs news campaign reporter jack turman reports that ohio secretary of state frank larose sent a letter on thursday to ohio's congressional delegation indicating that some ohioans may not get their ballot in time due to post office delays. in the letter, larose stated that they are hearing reports that first class mail delivery, which is 1-3 days, is taking up to 7-9 days. as you can imagine, these delays mean it is very possible that many ohioans who have requested a ballot may not receive it in time, larose wrote. on friday, larose announced the postal office set up hand-to-hand delivery on saturday for election mail as it went through processing. post offices will track election mail to the ohio board of elections starting monday through may 8. as of monday, there have been 1,975,806 vote-by-mail ballots requested and 1,458,936 ballots cast.

margaret brennan: clearly the white house is going to have to weigh in, and the white house acting chief of staff mick mulvaney was on other television programs this morning saying he can promise no one will be left without health care if obamacare is struck down. but as you've just said there is no plan yet. so how can you promise that- like a state like yours where it has the most people reliant on obamacare of any state- how can you promise them they won't be left hanging?
biden headed into the final 20 days of the election with a more than $107 million cash advantage over mr. trump, reports cbs news political unit associate producer sarah ewall-wice. according to the latest federal election commission filings of fundraising through october 14, biden, the democratic national committee and their joint fundraising committees had more than $331 million cash on hand. mr. trump, the republican national committee and their joint fundraising committees had more than $223.5 million cash on hand heading into october 15. looking at the biden campaign committee, it brought in $130 million in 14 days, including $70 million in direct contributions and nearly $60 million transferred from other committees. that's three times what the trump campaign committee brought in with its $43 million, though it did not transfer funds. the president's campaign now also has more than $1.2 million in debt. with his massive cash advantage, biden's campaign has also spent much more than trump's campaign over 14 days. it had about $143 million in operating expenditures. meanwhile, mr. trump's campaign committee spent $63 million. the president's joint fundraising committee also spent around $34 million, not including money transferred to other accounts, while the biden joint fundraising committees spent just over $29 million on operating expenses. operating expenses for the dnc over two weeks was $45.4 million while the rnc expenditures were $21.8 million.

later in the day, pence visited the youngstown police department. the vice president's press secretary devin o'malley said in a statement that pence's visit to the police department is to highlight their recent innovative police reform effort. youngstown pd recently opened their use of force training to the community in order to promote transparency, open up communication, and build trust, o'malley said. the vice president delivered brief remarks at the police station, saying we don't have to choose between supporting law enforcement and support for our african-american community. pence, who's been referring to george floyd's death as a tragedy and promising justice, continues to also couch the remark with lines like there is also no excuse for the rioting, and the violence, and the looting and the attacks on law enforcement that followed. pence said every american can support law enforcement and the african-american community at the same time while coming together around better public safety.
he's a budget hawk ohio gov. john kasich, who is considering a r... 06:04 kasich's reputation as a budget hawk began during his days as the house budget committee chairman. he rose to the position - already famous for his co-sponsoring an amendment that killed the pentagon's request to build b-2 stealth bombers. he spent his early years in congress writing budgets that made swift and deep cuts to the federal budget. then-house speaker newt gingrich credited him as the person most responsible for writing the 1997 balanced budget act, a bipartisan agreement during the clinton administration to balance the budget by 2002, the last time the federal budget was balanced. he brought that budget fervor to ohio, where law requires that the state budget be balanced. despite facing a nearly $8 billion shortfall when he took office, kasich's first two budgets ultimately produced surpluses and helped replenish the rainy day fund. in the lead-up to his presidential campaign, he created a nonprofit group called balanced budget forever to advocate for adding a balanced budget amendment to the constitution.
stephen miller: obamacare was a disaster. fortunately, again, the president is taking significant action to bring down the price of insurance on the exchanges. but obamacare never worked. for example, even on the issue of preexisting conditions. american families earning eighty thousand dollars a year, with a few children, has to pay exorbitant out-of-pocket costs if they have preexisting conditions.
twice, though, roberts was among a larger grouping of justices in cases that skirted the big issue at stake, but that could return to the court. in one case, the justices rejected a lower-court ruling that set limits on redistricting for partisan gain, but without deciding whether limits ever could be imposed. in another, the court ruled in favor of a baker who would not create a wedding cake for a same-sex couple, yet left on the table the question of whether religious objections could be used to avoid complying with anti-discrimination laws that protect lgbt people.

senator john barrasso: well, the-- the one part of the health care law that we took out with the tax law was the individual mandate that people had to pay a fine. the democrats didn't even offer an amendment to-- to leave it in the bill because they know that, of the people that were paying this fine, millions have paid the fine. most of them earned less than fifty thousand a year. so, it was very punishing, money they could have used to see a doctor for their child or their family--
he suggested cost-control measures could be implemented. one of the things i would tell you is the republican bill has zero cost-control measures in it. they're not going to address affordability. i totally agree with you, affordability is one of the things people care about. and quality — they want to make sure they get good quality. my book is about how can we improve the quality of the system and lower the cost.

clinton: and actually — well, that was very interesting. first of all, china is illegally dumping steel in the united states and donald trump is buying it to build his buildings, putting steelworkers and american steel plants out of business. that's something that i fought against as a senator and that i would have a trade prosecutor to make sure that we don't get taken advantage of by china on steel or anything else.

on the day before the race, voters may have received a robocall from former president obama advocating for hood. an obama spokeswoman confirmed mr. obama recorded the call, in which he talks about hood's pro-medicaid expansion stance.
on immigration, o'rourke has been a supporter of comprehensive immigration reform and but has shifted to a more progressive stance on the issue recently. in 2014, he called president obama's executive action creating the deferred action for childhood arrivals (daca) program to shield young undocumented immigrants from deportation noble but hard to stomach because he believed it bypassed congress. he also backed ohio rep. tim ryan's leadership challenge against then-minority leader nancy pelosi in 2016. o'rourke launched a long-shot, insurgent campaign to oust cruz in 2018. his robust senate bid in texas -- along with his obama-esque oratory powers and social media dominance on the campaign trail -- catapulted him to national fame. although he failed to unseat cruz, o'rourke shattered fundraising records, galvanized a broad electoral coalition in texas -- including the state's large and growing latino community -- and lost by less than three percentage points. no democrat had come that close to winning a senate race in texas since 1988. despite the loss, o'rourke left many wondering if he would be running for president. although he told 60 minutes shortly before the election that he was completely ruling out running for president for 2020, o'rourke admitted shortly after the election that he had become open to the idea. issues in his six years in congress, o'rourke supported the legalization of marijuana, investing in clean energy like solar and wind to combat climate change, more expansive gun control legislation, lgbt rights and had a pro-choice stance on abortion rights.
hyde was looking to unseat democrat representative jahana hayes, and was one of four republicans who had filed to run for the seat. in a wednesday twitter post, romano called hyde's bid a distraction for the democrats to raise money and falsely label all republicans with his antics. in my view he is not helping other republican candidates or @realdonaldtrump win.

and it's worked. multiple polls since the 2016 election have found that a majority of democrats believe the russians actually tampered with vote totals (there's zero evidence that they did) and 74 percent of democrats believe the alleged russian meddling is likely to have cost clinton the election.
sen. sanders: that's not what america is about.
the texas republican blasted boehner, who stepped down from his congressional seat in september after a lengthy career in the house, as symptomatic of everything that is wrong and corrupt with washington.
on a personal level, the juxtaposition between my experience with cancer with the trumps and my experience with the bidens has been the yin to the yang, she said. biden was incredibly there for me and my family, his son beau died of the same cancer that my father had, glioblastoma, so we have this really strange and intense bond. and i love him dearly. if he becomes the nominee, i am going to have to quit television because i can't say anything bad about him.
i am asking both parties to come together to give us the safe, fast, reliable, and modern infrastructure our economy needs and our people deserve.

what you should know before tuesday, august 21: primary overview
in minnesota's very competitive 2nd district in the suburbs of minneapolis and st. paul, incumbent republican rep. jason lewis is facing a slew of controversy over comments he made on a radio show he hosted prior to serving in congress, including complaining that women could no longer be called sluts and equating gay marriage to rape. lewis also wrote a book in which he calls for any state to be able to peaceably leave the union, and equated slavery with taxing rich people. lewis won the district in 2016 with 47 percent, beating democrat angie craig by less than two percent. they will face off again in the fall. some, but not all, of his controversial comments were public during the last race and democrats attempted to use them against him at the time.
jeff zients: well i think that's a fair feeling this is life and death. we need to make sure that every day we're getting more and more people vaccinated, we're increasing the supply, we're increasing the number of vaccinations, we're increasing the places where people can go. so i understand the frustration. and we're doing all we can to move as fast as we can.
the house gop health care plan comes six years after the affordable care act became law, requiring nearly all americans to carry health insurance and employers to offer it. the law's mandates and tax increases have stoked endless controversy and opposition from the gop, yet the number of uninsured people has dropped by about 20 million people to historic lows.
tuesday night could have gone very differently, and republicans knew it. in the past few days, names like christine o'donnell (not a witch), todd akin (legitimate rape) and sharron angle (second amendment remedies) have been popping up in conservative conversations. they're all republican candidates who won primaries in 2010 but, due to their weaknesses or perceived extremism, lost otherwise winnable senate seats in delaware, missouri and nevada.

so i have a comprehensive energy policy, but it really does include fighting climate change, because i think that is a serious problem. and i support moving toward more clean, renewable energy as quickly as we can, because i think we can be the 21st century clean energy superpower and create millions of new jobs and businesses.
there are five primaries on tuesday, june 26: colorado, maryland, new york, oklahoma, and utah. there are also primary runoffs in mississippi and south carolina. there is not really a marquee primary race on tuesday that should dramatically affect the outcome of the midterms, but many of these seats will be critical in the fight for control of the house and senate in november's general election.
mr. trump said he gave him the kind of funeral that he wanted, but i didn't get a thank you. the president was not invited to mccain's funeral in september.
margaret brennan: all right. we will be watching it, and we'll have plenty of analysis then. thanks to all of you for joining us.
the strange thing about the economics profession over the last 35 year is that there has been two strands: one very strongly focusing on the limitations of the market, and then another saying how wonderful markets were. unfortunately too much attention was being paid to that second strand.
margaret brennan: and that is wyoming republican senator john barrasso, who's also a doctor, we should note. he was a key negotiator in the efforts to come up with a republican measure that would replace obamacare. i do want to get to that, but picking up on where stephen just left off, he says shut down may still happen if necessary to get this money for the border wall. it's 5 billion.
anthony salvanto: yeah. he is, and he wasn't always. but this was even done before last night's big win for sanders in nevada. so a couple of things happened here. one is the electability argument. voters look at what's happening in these states and say who do they think can put together a coalition that can win? we see that while joe biden is still widely seen as having a chance to beat president trump. bernie sanders also is. and, quite frankly, when democrats and others look at a match up against president trump across the whole electorate, well, it's tight for all of these democrats. for joe biden, for bernie sanders, narrow leads at best over the president really within the margin of error across all voters.

stan lee reed saxon/ap photo i saw a fly crawling on a wall, and i thought, 'gee, what if a guy could stick to walls like an insect? recalled stan lee (december 28, 1922-november 12, 2018) to cbs' sunday morning in 2016. that sounds good. so i started trying to think of some names. insect-man? nah. mosquito-man? nah. and then i got to spider-man. spider-man, ooh, that sounds dramatic! and if he has spider power, he can shoot a web also. and he could swing ... oh man! and then i figured i'd make him a teenager, and i figured i would do the unthinkable: i'd give him personal problems. i ran into my publisher and i said, 'have i got an idea for you! his name is spider-man ...' and i couldn't get any further. he said, 'stan, that is the worst idea i have ever heard!' the rest, of course, is the stuff of comic book lore, one of the premier characters lee helped create at marvel. he was the comic book company's top writer, and later its publisher. working with artists such as jack kirby and steve ditko, lee's wild ideas helped bring iron man, hulk, thor, the x-men, the avengers, black panther, and the fantastic four to life, making lee a god of the marvel universe. but it wasn't just his childhood fascination with errol flynn that inspired his comic books' derring-do.
eric trump: i think as a family, we've changed, to tell you the truth. i mean, how big this platform is, is incredible. and i have to say, one of the most rewarding things of my life, and i can speak on behalf of really all of us, it's fighting by our father's side every single day as you've gone through a grueling, grueling process like this.
after acknowledging there have been differences in the gop, ryan goes on to deride clinton's candidacy as a third term for barack obama. watch the democratic convention, next week, he instructs. it'll be a four-day infomercial of politically correct moralizing. you'll be able to get through those four days with a little help from a mute button, but four more years? not a chance, ryan says.

we eliminated an especially cruel tax that fell mostly on americans making less than $50,000 a year, forcing them to pay tremendous penalties simply because they couldn't afford government-ordered health plans. we repealed the core of the disastrous obamacare. the individual mandate is now gone. thank heaven.

legislative republicans filed the lawsuit after wisconsin health secretary-designee, andrea palm, extended the safer at home order until may 26 at the direction of evers. they argue the evers administration has overreached its executive powers and say palm didn't have the authority to extend the order on her own. evers and palm have defended safer at home, saying it's working to keep wisconsin safe, and believe the law is on their side. conservatives hold a 5-2 advantage on the wisconsin supreme court.

harris first said this to her opponent when he began to interrupt her answer about coronavirus. harris said both president trump and the vice president knew about the pandemic on january 28 but pence, the head of the white house's coronavirus task force, said they didn't tell anyone because mr. trump wanted people to remain calm.
paul ryan: we don't have control of our borders. we have a broken immigration system while we address the symptom of the problem. that's what the president is saying. and that's perfectly common sense.

we advanced the ball for the dreamers. we're proud of the role we played, said schumer, and how, he said, the senate will now likely work its will on its own. he added, the bipartisan group yesterday was a glimmer of hope that might happen.

so i think you are going to see a more trumpian approach to the united nations, that's also john bolton, his very hawkish national security advisor's made an entire career of u.n. bashing. they're already talking about downgrading the united nations' portfolio with absence of nikki haley is probably no longer going to be a cabinet level position.

what i do want to see is that we have more options for undocumented people to be able to get the health care they need, she explained. it's not only the right and moral thing to do for them. it's also important that we keep ourselves healthy, and public health requires that. so i see this as a two-step process.
the secretary announced tuesday that about 4.2 million americans had signed up for an obamacare plan by the end of february, and she and other officials said they expect millions more to sign up before open enrollment ends on march 31. no one from hhs has acknowledged they may not get 7 million enrollees in 2014, though vice president joe biden has said as much.

if there are roadblocks on capitol hill, the president could take executive action, a power he has resorted to before, despite his frequent criticism of former president obama for the same thing. mr. trump, who worked to deregulate industries and dismantle obama-era programs through executive order, has already threatened to end birthright citizenship with his signature.

sen. sanders: but you have people--
jamelle bouie: i don't think experience per se, but i think biden's particular position in the democratic party in the '70s and '80s and '90s hurts him. he was sort of a very centrist democrat, and on crime and on drugs and on economic policy, he was with the center, even the conservative part of the democratic party.

john dickerson: let me ask you about the moral question here. the president has recently secured the release of andrew brunson from turkey so working on the one hand on that account. but in this account, he said, basically, because there's a hundred and ten billion as he claims arms purchases on-- on order from saudi arabia that-- you know that's-- that's, essentially, more important or has to be weighed here in the response. give me your sense of-- of your reaction to that that moral position the president took?
in the aftermath of that terrible shooting, we came together, not as republicans or democrats, but as representatives of the people. but it is not enough to come together only in times of tragedy. tonight, i call upon all of us to set aside our differences, to seek out common ground, and to summon the unity we need to deliver for the people. this is really the key. these are the people we were elected to serve.

but there are much worse images coming out of aleppo every day now, where in the past few weeks alone, 400 people have been killed, at least 100 of them children. just days ago, the state department called for a war crimes investigation of the syrian regime of bashar al-assad and its ally, russia, for their bombardment of aleppo.
after the virus erupted in the u.s. this spring, the coronavirus aid, relief and economic security act had distributed some 160 million checks to americans, offering cash payments of $1,200 for individuals and $2,400 for married couples, up to some income limits.
today's decision in texas v. azar is a win for all americans and confirms what i have said all along: that the individual mandate, by far the worst element of obamacare, is unconstitutional, the president said in a statement. this decision will not alter the current healthcare system. my administration continues to work to provide access to high-quality healthcare at a price you can afford, while strongly protecting those with pre-existing conditions. the radical healthcare changes being proposed by the far left would strip americans of their current coverage. i will not let this happen. providing affordable, high-quality healthcare will always be my priority. they are trying to take away your healthcare, and i am trying to give the american people the best healthcare in the world.
some of trump's strongest supporters in 2016 were white voters without a college degree and that was no different in missouri. seven in 10 of these voters supported him, many living in rural areas. mccaskill has appealed to some of these voters in the past. while not winning a majority, about four in 10 of whites without a degree backed mccaskill in 2012 and 2006. she can't afford to lose too many of these voters, and at the same time, hawley is looking to perform better with this group than mccaskill's past republican opponents have. nine in 10 black voters backed mccaskill in her previous elections, but black voters made up a slightly smaller share of the state's electorate in 2016 (14 percent) than they did in 2012 (16 percent), and an even smaller share in 2010 (13 percent), which was a midterm election. mccaskill hopes to drive up turnout among black voters.
clinton: well, the situation in syria is catastrophic. and every day that goes by, we see the results of the regime by assad in partnership with the iranians on the ground, the russians in the air, bombarding places, in particular aleppo, where there are hundreds of thousands of people, probably about 250,000 still left. and there is a determined effort by the russian air force to destroy aleppo in order to eliminate the last of the syrian rebels who are really holding out against the assad regime.
by midday monday, the congressional debate had fallen into a predictable pattern and a shutdown seemed inevitable. the house would pass a version of the spending bill that delayed or chipped away at the affordable care act. the senate would proceed to strip the bill of its amendments, pass it, and send it back to the house, and the cycle would start again.
president trump's reelection campaign is pouring cash into digital and television ads in the wake of the impeachment inquiry, but cbs news political unit associate producer ben mitchell says data collected by left-leaning digital strategy firm bully pulpit interactive (bpi) shows the campaign is largely targeting its base, not persuadable voters.

why are democrats all talking about obamacare today? on wednesday, california attorney general xavier becerra, leading a coalition of 20 states and d.c., filed a briefing with the u.s. supreme court to defend the affordable care act. cbs news political unit associate producer sarah ewall-wice says this comes after the high court agreed to review an appeals court decision that found the health care law's individual mandate unconstitutional and called into the question whether the law could stand as a whole.
the new rule will allow groups of businesses to band together to buy insurance across state lines, which will be bad for small firms and their employees because it will lead to higher premiums, unbalanced risk pools and lower-quality insurance, said john arensmeyer, founder and ceo of small business majority.

stephen miller: and we want-- we-- it's time that both parties-- and this is what the american people want. both parties to come together for the sake of american children, for the sake of children all across this hemisphere, to create a lawful system of immigration--
that's not our intention or goal. we want to get this done on time. that's our plan, he said.
the plan, revealed wednesday, relies on individual tax credits to allow people to buy coverage from private insurers, and includes other largely familiar gop ideas such as medical liability reform and expanding access to health savings accounts. it proposes putting $25 billion behind high-risk pools for people with pre-existing conditions and for others, and transforming the federal-state medicaid program for the poor by turning it into state block grants or individual per-capita allotments to hold down spending.
and on wednesday, he said, right now we're not getting along with russia at all.

health care plays a big role in president donald trump's budget released on monday. while the document serves mostly as a wish list -- congress controls the federal purse strings -- it does make clear where the president's priorities are concerning the affordable care act (aca), medicaid, prescription drugs and opioid abuse.
other gop lawmakers said that their plan was a much more sustainable alternative to obamacare.
lesley stahl: you have lobbyists from verizon, you have lobbyists from the oil gas industry, you have food lobby.
cooper: you've said you want to end obamacare. you've also said you want to make coverage accessible for people with pre-existing conditions. how do you force insurance companies to do that if you're no longer mandating that every american get insurance?
with no tax penalty now in effect, the texas lawsuit argues, the individual mandate is unconstitutional and the entire law must fall without it.

the president tweeted early this morning there is nothing nice about searching for terrorists, and in a tweet about airport detentions related to his executive order friday banning travel from seven countries, he said, only 109 people out of 325,000 were detained and held for questioning. big problems at airports were caused by delta computer outage.
because of covid-19, workers already facing terrible health risks are also confronting increased barriers to legal representation and worried the clock will run out on seeking relief, warren said in a statement. our bill will make sure workers' rights aren't thrown off to the side because of a public health emergency by extending the period of time workers have to file claims.

in his campaign announcement video, the democrat claimed that washington is broken, listing problems like rising prescription drug prices, the effects of climate change and crippling student debt. what trump says messam has not yet been a target for president trump.
another subsidy is in play with employer-sponsored health care plans: employers are allowed to deduct the cost of providing health care to employees when they file their taxes. by reducing their corporate income taxes, they're effectively enjoying a subsidy from the federal government.
with the rise, fall and this week's attempts to resurrect the republican bill that would repeal and replace the affordable care act, obamacare users may be wondering exactly what is going to happen to their benefits and premiums. here's what participants can expect from the federal health program in 2018.

they aren't going to be the only two people on the debate stage, a senior campaign advisor told reporters. the way we approach the debate is to use the opportunity to talk directly to the audience at home...we don't hear from voters that we are looking for someone at some point on the ideological spectrum.

during the 2016 primaries i was a radio talk host in atlanta, georgia—a conservative host on a conservative station in a conservative state. i was surprised by the amount of support a big-city, liberal-leaning tv star like donald trump had among people i knew were traditional conservatives who in the past would never support someone with trump's (ahem) troubling background.

the senate voted to acquit president trump on wednesday. however, a republican broke ranks on the first article of impeachment. senator mitt romney was the only republican who voted to convict trump of abuse of power. he joins the 47 other democrats in voting to remove the president for office for this offense. senators voted along party lines on the second article of impeachment, obstruction of justice.
many of the republican candidates seemed determined to lead us right back into the past, she said. without naming him, clinton called out wisconsin gov. scott walker, who has yet to announce his bid for the oval office, for his suggestion of a constitutional amendment to reinstate the power of the states to define marriage.

that didn't work out too well, trump told fox news in an interview on new year's eve. we'll see how she does. i wish her well, i hope she does well. i'd love to run against her. warren frequently taunted mr. trump during the 2016 campaign, and often takes to the president's favorite outlet, twitter, to criticize him and his policies directly. asked by fox news whether warren would be able to win, the president said, well, that i don't know. you would have to ask her psychiatrist.
the senate measure, better care reconciliation act (bcra), would leave 49 million people uninsured in 2026 compared to 28 million people uninsured by that year under obamacare. and by 2026, there would be 15 million fewer medicaid enrollees.
over the weekend mr. trump renewed his attacks on mccain over twitter, blaming him for sending the steele dossier to the fbi and falsely claiming that he was last in his class at annapolis. the dossier, a collection of memos by former british spy christopher steele, contains unverified material detailing possible connections between russian and mr. trump's presidential campaign. the president told reporters on tuesday that he was never a fan of john mccain and never will be.

republicans feel trump has made more progress on some of his campaign promises than others. at least four in 10 see a lot of progress on bringing jobs back to the u.s., cutting taxes for the middle class, defeating isis, and reducing regulations on business. fewer republicans see a lot of progress on repealing obamacare and only one in 10 think trump has made a lot of progress in building a border wall.

the president's opponents believe that his first year is the answer to the question why not? look at the government shutdown, they say.
here are some new things we heard:
on the wealth tax, he said other countries that have used it show it does not work. on medicare for all, bloomberg said he supports updating obamacare. i don't think medicare for all is a solution to the problem. the real answer is to take obamacare and you can tweak it, you can make it somewhat better, you can restore some of the cuts that were taken away, he said tuesday. medicare for all would destroy our hospital system, doctors wouldn't be able to make enough money to pay off their loans…the secret is people want to keep their private plans.
it is good that once again the president seems to be backing off his threat to hold health care and government funding hostage, he said in a statement. these payments are essential to ensuring that millions of americans won't see their premiums skyrocket, and they won't be kicked off their plan. like the withdrawal of money for the wall, this decision brings us closer to a bipartisan agreement to fund the government and is good news for the american people. there are outstanding issues to be resolved, particularly with riders, but this is a positive development for the negotiations.

in 15 minutes of remarks from his new in-home studio in wilmington, joe biden offered a pre-rebuttal of sorts to the president's daily press briefings, according to cbs news campaign reporter bo erickson. these briefings are an important opportunity to inform and reassure the american public they are not a place for political attacks or to lash out at the press, biden said appearing to read from a teleprompter, they're about the american people. the former vice president asked for the unvarnished truth from the president about the current response and chided the president's self-congratulation. trump keeps saying he's a wartime president. well, start to act like one, biden said. while a few kinks are still sorting out, the biden campaign is forced to retool their almost entire approach without public events.
monday marks 10 years since president obama signed the affordable care act, also referred to as obamacare, into law. the anniversary comes at a time of national emergency amid the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, notes cbs news campaign reporter nicole sganga. the ten-year mark also hits just weeks after the supreme court agreed to hear a case brought forward by republican state officials against the law. justices are set to review a federal appeals court decision that found part of the law — congress' 2017 removal of the individual mandate clause, requiring citizens to possess health insurance — unconstitutional. though timing is up to the supreme court justices, oral arguments are likely to fall around the time of the 2020 presidential general election in november, with a decision due in spring or summer 2021. the litigation aimed at eliminating the centerpiece of mr. obama's legacy is backed by the trump administration.
when precinct results started coming in, price said our accuracy and quality check programs found inconsistencies - prompting a full-scale investigation. he said idp staff activated pre-planned backup operations and began entering data manually. price's memo said that idp staff found and resolved a coding issue in the app's reporting system, but found that the underlying data collected in the app was sound. he said there has been cross-checking paper documentation with data recorded in the app to ensure state delegate equivalents were valid and accurate.
margaret brennan: but-- well, that-- that's contradicted by reports that the director of national intelligence, maguire, did brief white house officials. but, more broadly, the fbi director at the beginning of the month, chris wray, testified that russia continues to try to influence the elections mainly through social media manipulation. so, this pattern of behavior has continued, russia is undeterred. are you denying that that is happening?
how good is that? president obama said, when he finished the cards and the mic dropped. you think that's going viral? that's going viral.
as of wednesday morning, the wisconsin elections commission reported that 91,057 people returned absentee ballots out of the more than 191,500 votes cast. during the april 7 election, about 71% of wisconsinites around the state voted by mail.
rep. suzanne bonamici: but-- but part of that is because she has the experience. it's not easy to get through-- the legislative process in congress.

a few hours later, house speaker john boehner, r-ohio, responded with a blistering op-ed piece in usa today. the president isn't telling the whole story when it comes to the government shutdown. the fact is that washington democrats have slammed the door on reopening the government by refusing to engage in bipartisan talks. and, as stories across the country highlight the devastating impact of obamacare on families and small businesses, they continue to reject our calls for fairness for all americans, he wrote. this is part of a larger pattern: the president's scorched-earth policy of refusing to negotiate in bipartisan way on his health care law, current government funding, or the debt limit.
president trump again threatened to close large portions of the southern border on friday if mexico does not halt all undocumented immigrants from entering the country.
ed, let's start with you. bernie sanders making his case, going back to one of the hits, medicare for all, which has now become mainstream. i mean at least five candidates have signed on to his plan that was kind of out there in 2016. should we assume that this is going to be sort of the dividing point for democrats?
president trump later signed off on the bill, officially funding the government through feb. 8 and ending the weekend-long government shutdown. the measure also extends the children's health insurance program through 2023 and suspends three obamacare-related taxes and fees.

after some time away from the campaign trail to prepare for the second and final presidential debate, biden began friday to publicly outline plans for a potential transition into the presidency amid the covid-19 pandemic, reports cbs news campaign reporter alex tin. i'll reach out to every governor in every state, red and blue, as well as mayors and local officials during transition to find out what support they need and how much of it they need. i'll ask the new congress to put a bill on my desk by the end of january, biden said in delaware, as the contest enters its final stretch ahead of election day. both campaigns claim the debate buoyed their prospects ahead of election day. however, mr. biden's opponents have seized on his debate stage acknowledgement that he would transition away from the oil industry, ahead of the former vice president's planned visit to pennsylvania on saturday. though not much of a departure from his campaign's climate plan publicly outlined months ago, the former vice president's remark drew a firestorm from opponents. we'll get rid of the subsidies of fossil fuels, but not going to get rid of fossil fuels for a long time, biden said late thursday as he departed nashville.

sen. scott: it's going to ruin medicare.
manchin's ad is the most visible example to date of how democratic senators running for reelection in states that supported president trump are campaigning in defense of the affordable care act. armed with polling data that shows broad national support for maintaining the law's protections of people with preexisting conditions, candidates like manchin and sens. joe donnelly, d-indiana; heidi heitkamp, d-north dakota; robert casey, d-pennsylvania and claire mccaskill, d-missouri, are campaigning on a pledge to shore up the law – and against republicans who tried unsuccessfully to repeal it last year. on the campaign trail, mccaskill often begins her events by asking crowds to raise their hands if they have a preexisting condition. casey does something similar. and heitkamp often mentions that as a breast cancer survivor, she can personally relate to her constituents with preexisting conditions.
let me tell you, if she's president of the united states, nothing's going to happen. it's just going to be talk. and all of her friends, the taxes we were talking about, and i would just get it by osmosis. she's not doing any me favors. but by doing all the others' favors, she's doing me favors.

but it is important for us as a policy, you know, not to say, as donald has said, we're going to ban people based on a religion. how do you do that? we are a country founded on religious freedom and liberty. how do we do what he has advocated without causing great distress within our own county? are we going to have religious tests when people fly into our country? and how do we expect to be able to implement those?

for somebody who wants to be commander-in-chief of our armed forces, she's literally reading from something somebody else wrote and said, 'well they can get him to read different words from a teleprompter,' conway said. there's not a single job that gets created, not a single uninsured american who gets health care from that kind of nastiness.
dan balz (washington post/@danbalz): well, it's not just unusual it's-- it's-- it's supposedly not allowed. i mean, the national security adviser is supposed to be an official who's dealing only in the national security realm and not involved in partisan politics. and so any-- any suggestion or anything that comes from him that puts him into that realm undermines the role that he's supposed to be playing.

sean kirk: well, it's not like flipping a switch. you know, we build safety into our manufacturing processes from the beginning. we have controls, we have procedures, we have testing. all of that is very complicated, very complex. we're not manufacturing simple items here, we're manufacturing complex biologics. and the concerted effort, the choreography if-- if you will, and the time it takes to ramp that up, it just simply takes time.

when asked by bowman to let him back inside, hal flatly responds, i'm sorry, dave, i'm afraid i can't do that. excerpt: douglas rain as hal in 2001: a space odyssey rain would return as hal in the 1984 sequel, 2010, and was heard in an uncredited performance as a computer in woody allen's sleeper. he also narrated the oscar-winning 1975 documentary, the man who skied down everest. and hal's flat delivery would inspire anthony hopkins' performance as serial killer hannibal lecter. given his half-century career as a stage, radio and tv actor, rain was dismissive of his immortal performance in 2001, which encompassed two days in a sound booth being fed lines by kubrick. if you could have been a ghost at the recording session, rain recalled for the 2010 odyssey archive blog, you would have thought it was a load of rubbish.

if you ask most new hampshirites, they would tell you we're first anyway, susan jamback, chair of the bow democrats, said. iowa doesn't really allow their residents to vote. the caucus is not fair and it doesn't make sense. a victory in iowa is meant to give the winning candidate momentum heading into new hampshire's february 11th primary and the contests that follow. but new hampshire does have a history of ignoring the results out of the hawkeye state. in 2016, for example, senator bernie sanders won new hampshire handily after losing to hillary clinton in iowa. in 2008, new hampshire went for clinton in an upset after then-senator barack obama won the caucuses. the last democratic candidate to win both contests in a contested primary was john kerry in 2004.

i think the only way it's going to change is if the american public is made aware of exactly what services their government does provide, dougan said. a lot of us take those services for granted, and we don't even think about who delivers my mail, how do my roads get fixed, or how can i be sure that the meat i buy in the supermarket is safe to eat?
gillum said he would have pushed for a stronger bill than scott signed.
margaret brennan: i want to get to the issue of health care. the president this week said he wants the courts to strike down obamacare, the affordable care act. but to be fair, senator, you want to replace obamacare, too. you want to replace it with medicare for all, this government-run, government-financed program. so if the courts strike down--

alan diaz alan diaz, wilfredo lee/ap associated press photojournalist alan diaz (may 15, 1947-july 3, 2018) was born in new york to cuban parents, and spent his adolescence in cuba, where he studied photography with alberto korda. diaz was freelancing for ap in november 1999 when a boater found a cuban boy floating in an inner tube in the waters off fort lauderdale. diaz spent the next few months chatting with elian gonzalez's relatives and neighbors, earning their trust by respecting an order from the boy's uncle to not speak to the child. because of those relationships, he was the only photographer to capture the moment when u.s. immigration agents ended a bitter international custody battle with a pre-dawn raid the day before easter in 2000. diaz's pulitzer prize-winning photo shows an armed u.s. immigration agent reaching out toward the terrified six-year-old, seconds before the boy was pulled out of his uncle's little havana home so he could be returned to his father in cuba. after the picture hit the wires and network news, diaz saw how both cuban leader fidel castro and cuban-american community leaders used it to argue that the other side was brutal and heartless. i have no opinion on it. i shot the moment. that's all, diaz said last year. good or bad, that's what happened that morning. during his career diaz, who was known to roar, hello, miami!

since then, mr. trump has repeatedly promised to roll out a new plan to replace obamacare, though one has not yet been unveiled. mr. trump told chris wallace in an interview that aired july 19 he would sign a full and complete health care plan within two weeks, and in a town hall hosted by abc news on tuesday, the president claimed his alternative to obamacare is all ready and would protect those with pre-existing conditions.

sure. i think it's about representing the people of your state, so you've got to be willing to cross party lines, hawley said. you've got to be willing to be independent. i'll work with anybody on any topic if it's good for the people of my state.
president donald trump: excuse me. when they say lock her up, it's not me. they say it. it starts, it-- it ends up being--
like horn, torres small also voiced her disagreement with biden on thursday, tweeting, i will continue to stand up to my party when they're out of touch with the reality on the ground in #nm02. the freshman democrat has been outspoken on the issue before through debates and ads. cbs news campaign reporter alex tin says the oil and gas industry claim to support 51,000 jobs in the district, directly or indirectly, with its revenues accounting for almost 20% of the district's total economy. in texas' 23rd, republican tony gonzales called on democrat gina ortiz jones on friday to pledge to oppose biden's radical environmental policies. jones' spokesperson sharon yang told cbs news political unit broadcast associate aaron navarro that jones doesn't support a ban on fracking and believes energy leaders should be incentivized to participate in more clean technology development. texas is already a clean energy superpower, and gina is committed to building on texas' leadership and investing in our workers so we can address the threat climate change poses to our national security, our economic security, and our public health while creating more good-paying jobs in south and west texas, yang said in a statement. jones is in a competitive race for the state's open seat, left by retiring republican congressman will hurd.
so i believe that this election has become in part so — so conflict-oriented, so intense because there's a lot at stake. this is not an ordinary time, and this is not an ordinary election. we are going to be choosing a president who will set policy for not just four or eight years, but because of some of the important decisions we have to make here at home and around the world, from the supreme court to energy and so much else, and so there is a lot at stake. it's one of the most consequential elections that we've had.
when it comes to pinning blame, pin the tail on the donkeys, he said.

tyler, a former longtime aide to gingrich, is not affiliated with the gingrich campaign, as pacs are prohibited with coordinating directly with the candidates they support. super pacs are able to collect and spend unlimited funds in support of a candidate.
mr. trump has made a similar claim before. if by now he means the u.s. has only now just begun exporting energy, that is false. the u.s. has been exporting coal, and it is true that the u.s. is a net exporter of coal -- that is, that it exports more coal to other countries than it imports. by the end of 2017, the u.s. had also become a net exporter of natural gas, according to the energy information administration (eia).

i am glad he is trying to be transparent – since being on the inside, i've learned that this audit is a serious matter. i also know as a pollster that tax liability is important. we appreciate seeing both plans and who will give people relief, she said.
senator amy klobuchar: there's always room to work on things but the best way and what i believe will happen is this will be stayed in court. so, it continues to take effect. then it will go up on appeal. it will be upheld. but what we should be doing is governing from opportunity and not chaos. that means doing something about pharmaceutical prices and passing my bill to allow medicare to negotiate for less expensive drugs for our seniors and letting less expensive safe drugs come in from other countries so that we can actually have competition, doing something about premiums with reinsurance and some of the things going on in the states. so, yes there are things to do but we should be working to improve the affordable care act not just throw it out and set it on fire.
unlike in past recessions, most of those who lose their job-based coverage will be eligible for health coverage because of the affordable care act, though some may find coverage unaffordable even with subsidies, kff executive vice president for health policy larry levitt said in a statement. as unemployment benefits expire, however, about two million more people in states that did not expand their medicaid programs under the aca will move into the medicaid coverage gap and have no affordable option.
clinton: well, i certainly will, because i think that's a very fair and important question. look, i respect his children. his children are incredibly able and devoted, and i think that says a lot about donald. i don't agree with nearly anything else he says or does, but i do respect that. and i think that is something that as a mother and a grandmother is very important to me.

and trump's move to a free-market loan system won't help any students, either, although banks probably wouldn't mind having that business back. the student loan origination business was mostly shifted to the department of education in 2010, saving taxpayers some $10 billion in bank loan subsidies.
are democrats reading too much into conor lamb's upset victory in last week's special election? that's certainly the gop spin.
well to constitute a false statement, you need two things. one, you need a false statement, lie. and then it has to be material to a legitimate investigation. and i think on the question of lying, it's as comey, director comey said just a few months after this episode, he said it was a close question. and that, while you might make that argument, it was a very close question.

he is not a member of any of the major democratic caucuses in the house, like the pro-business new democrat coalition or the congressional progressive caucus. he once earned an a rating from the national rife association (nra) and has broken with his party to support fracking measures favored by republicans. but ryan has also been supportive of progressive proposals like medicare for all. controversy ryan's tenure in congress has largely been scandal-free, but his repeated challenges to pelosi's leadership are likely to alienate some democratic primary voters. what trump says although ryan has been a fierce critic of the president, mr. trump has not yet tweeted about the ohio congressman.

another reason exchanges are unprofitable for big insurers has to do with the products they are selling. accustomed to offering expansive provider networks and a range of coverage for employer-sponsored group plans, big insurers designed similar high-cost plans for the exchanges. these broader networks are likely to attract patients with health issues who may be willing to pay more in premiums to stay with their doctors and other providers. healthy people, on the other hand, are more likely to go for the lowest-cost plans, usually offered by smaller, regional insurers.

part-timers are those who work fewer than 30 hours a week under the health care law. they must be counted toward what are called full-time equivalent workers. if, for example, a company has two people who each work an average 15 hours a week, they count as one full-time equivalent employee working 30 hours. a company with 30 full-timers and 40 part-timers who average 15 hours a week each has 50 full-time equivalent workers -- and is required to offer insurance.
the group includes many other congressional members and other progressive activists, some who wrote about their initial hesitation in joining the biden working groups. biden also confirmed in a snapchat interview that he has yet to be tested for covid-19 but that his secret service detail has been tested. i should be tested, biden said, so that's, that's in play. we'll see how that goes.

this entire tax return debate is somewhat confounding to me, in the following sense: i don't think that it creates one job, gets one more individual who does not have health insurance covered by health insurance, particularly under the disaster that has been obamacare with these private insurers pulling out our exchanges now and reporting billions of dollars of losses, she told cnn's dana bash.

he's in his second term as ohio governor protestors and union supporters gather as ohio gov. john kasich delivers the state of the state address at ohio statehouse on march 8, 2011 in columbus, ohio. mike munden, getty images had kasich's first term gone as planned, he might have become the union-busting president before wisconsin gov. scott walker did. in 2011, he championed legislation that would have limited the collective bargaining rights of 350,000 public workers, including teachers, police and firefighters. the backlash was intense, and union forces managed to secure a referendum vote on the law. voters rejected it, dealing a blow to kasich and sending his approval rating into the low 30-percent range. but he took the defeat graciously, saying he respected the decision of the voters, and he turned his attention to other budget issues like cutting income taxes and rebuilding the state's rainy day fund (it rose from 89 cents when he took office to more than $2 billion today). he has really not gone back to try to do anything more or be supportive of anything more in terms of attacks on unions, beck said. kasich's approval rating rose, and today he's one of the most popular governors in the nation. he was re-elected in 2014 with a whopping 64 percent of the vote, though that was partially due to the collapse of democratic candidate ed fitzgerald.

before the memorial day weekend, a northern michigan dock company owner said whitmer's husband inquired about installing their family's boat in the water, according to a report from the detroit news. retail businesses and restaurants and bars with limited seating in the upper peninsula and the greater traverse city regions were allowed to reopen on may 22nd, but whitmer encouraged michiganders to think long and hard before traveling to the region. the detroit news reported that whitmer's husband, marc mallory, identified himself as whitmer's husband and asked the company if that would speed up the process of getting their boat placed in the water. whitmer addressed the report at a press conference, saying that her husband made a failed attempt at humor. whitmer said, knowing it wouldn't make a difference, he jokingly asked if being married to me might move him up in the queue. she continued, obviously, with the motorized boating prohibition in our early days of covid-19, he thought it might get a laugh. it didn't…and to be honest, i wasn't laughing either when it was relayed to me because i knew how it would be perceived. he regrets it. i wish it wouldn't have happened. in a statement, michigan republican party chair laura cox said, using your wife's political office to score favors is not a laughing matter. michigan rising action, a conservative group, also seized on the report and sent out a fundraising email criticizing whitmer's blatant hypocrisy.

the poll, which was taken after the unrest in kenosha and both conventions, showed little movement among likely voters compared to the august marquette poll when biden was leading 49% to 44%. the poll found 47% of wisconsinites approve of the protests against police shootings, while 48% disapprove. that's nearly identical to the numbers in august when there was a tie at 48% among those who approve and disapprove.

lesley stahl: did he ever apologize for saying you're not a hero?
past experience has taught us that complacency and concessions only invite aggression and provocation. i will not repeat the mistakes of past administrations that got us into this very dangerous position.
margaret brennan: border patrol though says--
in a motion filed in u.s. district court, federal prosecutors asked the judge to dismiss the single count of making false statements to the fbi, claiming the government concluded that the fbi's interview of flynn was untethered to, and unjustified by, the fbi's counterintelligence investigation.
we're going to be doing some trade deals as soon as we get the health care finished - oh, i'm looking forward to these trade deals, trump said, seeming to sing those last two words as the audience applauded.
right now the economy is good but i think we have some warning signs here, robert head, 80, a farmer who rents his land, said. we're actually paying for these tariffs — not china.
as for dumping the electoral college, if anything, that idea's even more extreme than court packing. and why is it necessary?
but the u.s. is not yet a net exporter of energy sources overall. the eia projects the u.s. could become a net exporter of energy around 2026. -- julia kimani burnham

margaret brennan: senator, we'll be watching your campaign. look forward to talking to you again sometime soon.
democratic congressional candidate jamaal bowman was endorsed by the new york state nurses association tuesday, adding to his list of support in his challenge against congressman eliot engel, reports cbs news political unit broadcast associate aaron navarro. their june 23 primary has turned into a vote-by-mail election, with ballots expected to be mailed out soon. bowman's campaign has been drawing contrasts with engel over who is present and active in the bronx and westchester area district, an epicenter of the covid-19 pandemic. ny-16's nurses and essential workers are grateful for jamaal bowman's partnership throughout the ongoing crisis, including joining nurses rallying at st. joseph's hospital to demand an increased production of ppe, and repeatedly calling out the corrupt price gouging of this life-saving equipment, nysna president judy sheridan-gonzalez said in a statement.

young patriots like preston teach all of us about our civic duty as americans, he said. preston's reverence for those who have served our nation reminds us why we salute our flag, why we put our hands on our hearts for the pledge of allegiance, and why we proudly stand for the national anthem.
lesley stahl: i never did a joe biden interview-
president donald trump: where did i call him an idiot?
also, while the office of management of budget claims that debt under mr. trump's budget would fall from 78% of gdp by 2029 to 71%, the committee for a responsible federal budget estimates that using more realistic assumptions on economic growth, that debt would, in fact, go up to 87% of gdp. the group, a budget watchdog, praised the trump budget's proposals on slowing the growth of health care costs and reforming some spending programs but said that the budget is riddled with gimmicks, like hiding the cost of increased defense spending and depending on overly optimistic economic growth assumptions.
we need only look at the depraved character of the north korean regime to understand the nature of the nuclear threat it could pose to america and to our allies.
a substantial percentage of undocumented immigrants in the u.s. pay billions in taxes annually and own their own homes, according to a 50 state report from the institute on taxation and economic policy.
consider a couple of examples: a hypothetical 45-year-old making $58,000 now gets no aid under the aca. with the bill, they'd be entitled to a $1,250 tax credit, or 20% off their premiums, according to the congressional budget office. a 64-year-old making $19,300 already gets generous subsidies that reduce premiums to $800 a year. but with the bill, that person would pay no premiums for a standard plan.
price said the initial legislation should not change medicare, which covers older people.
trump: but i will tell you, she's all talk. it doesn't get done. all you have to do is take a look at her senate run. take a look at upstate new york.
two democratic senators, patty murray of washington and elizabeth warren of massachusetts, held a forum featuring a current and two previous cke employees complaining they weren't paid for overtime or had to work on breaks. last month, fast-food workers and others held anti-puzder demonstrations in 12 cities.
the group's chief executive, stephen ubl, said in a statement that some trump proposals could help patients afford their medicines, but others would disrupt coverage and limit patients' access to innovative treatments.

6:45 p.m. agriculture secretary sonny perdue will not attend the state of the union address. instead, he will be at an alternate location as the night's designated survivor, in the event that something should go wrong at the capitol, cbs news has confirmed.
but obama economic adviser larry summers has thrown cold water on this methodology, arguing that firms are raising wages because the labor market is tight. he called it a gimmick in an interview a few days ago on cnbc's squawk alley.
margaret brennan: your campaign manager had said second place, there'd be a sigh of relief in south carolina. you disagree with your campaign manager?
klobuchar, who is expected to tout her moderate politics and midwestern roots on the campaign trail, denounced the polarization in washington and the divisiveness in political discourse.
i am asking congress to ensure that, in the fight against isis and al qaeda, we continue to have all necessary power to detain terrorists, wherever we chase them down, wherever we find them. and in many cases, for them, it will now be guantanamo bay.
fact check: true. clips of donald trump talking about muslims has appeared in jihadist propaganda. according to the washington post, a propaganda video from the al qaeda affiliate al-shabab does include footage of trump talking last year about his plan to bar muslims from entering the u.s.
margaret brennan: since that time, a bipartisan senate intelligence committee finding faulted the obama administration for its response and said that the actions taken undermined public confidence in the election and allowed for further russian interference. do you agree with these findings--
biden: that if you got any negative information about someone else from another- from a foreign source, you would not use it. and if you got any information that they were trying to interfere, you'd report it. i took-
here are some of the issues related to the health care law that small businesses need to be aware of:
president donald trump: it was our justice department that is the one that's helping her. my justice department, if you call it that--
trump: well, you owe the president an apology, because as you know very well, your campaign, sidney blumenthal — he's another real winner that you have — and he's the one that got this started, along with your campaign manager, and they were on television just two weeks ago, she was, saying exactly that. so you really owe him an apology. you're the one that sent the pictures around your campaign, sent the pictures around with president obama in a certain garb. that was long before i was ever involved, so you actually owe an apology.
biden: we have to restore the integrity of this country internationally. we have to get off of this god awful effort on this president's part to divide the country. we have to bring the middle class back. we have to have a health care policy that makes sense, that is doable, which i can do by- and by building on obamacare. and we have to have an immigration policy that, in fact, is rational and reasonable and represents who we are. they are all the reasons why i'm running, among others. but look, the next president of the united states also is gonna have to stand on the stage on day one and lead the world. they're going to have to be able to know what they're doing internationally. and the other leaders are gonna have to know who that person is and know that person knows them. and i'm the best qualified person by a long shot of anybody running to do that. that's why i'm running.
issues klobuchar is a very active senator who is often willing to work on a bipartisan basis. as of december, klobuchar has sponsored 111 pieces of legislation which have been signed into law. however, klobuchar is also ideologically liberal on several issues. as a member of the senate in 2009, klobuchar voted to pass the affordable care act, commonly known as obamacare. she is pro-choice and supports lgbt rights. she also has an f rating from the national rifle association. klobuchar is a member of the senate judiciary committee, and made a name for herself in 2018 for her calm yet incisive questioning of then-supreme court nominee brett kavanaugh during the hearings investigating claims of sexual misconduct against kavanaugh in september. at one point, when asking if kavanaugh had ever blacked out from drinking, he retorted: have you? the moment quickly went viral, and kavanaugh later apologized. controversy klobuchar was the sole senator from minnesota during the resolution of the contested senate election from january to july 2009, which al franken eventually won. when franken was accused of sexual harassment in december 2017, klobuchar did not call for franken to step down, unlike many other senators. franken resigned shortly after the allegations came to light.
sen. amy klobuchar of minnesota entered the 2020 presidential race sunday with a speech in the middle of a midwestern snowstorm, joining a record number of women in the most diverse democratic primary field in u.s. history.
dr. travis gayles: there you are.
and, you know, we've been trying to keep our inmates as safe as we can. we let a lot of inmates who are older and don't pose a threat to the community, we've put them on home confinement to get 'em outta the institutions. so we're taking every measure we can to protect those inmates.
north carolina is up for grabs, and the stakes are high: 15 electoral votes in that swing state have become pivotal to both president trump and democratic nominee joe biden.
nevada expanded medicaid, and its current republican gov. brian sandoval strongly opposes obamacare repeal efforts. in addition, mr. trump's immigration rhetoric and policies may also hurt heller in nevada, where approximately 17 percent of eligible voters in 2016 were hispanics. the hill points out that heller is distancing himself from the president on a local issue that matters to nevadans, confronting the trump administration over its plans to reopen the yucca mountain nuclear waste facility.
lesley stahl: but why doesn't anything get done--
former democratic presidential candidate pete buttigieg announced 28 endorsements through his win the era pac, which is aimed at helping and supporting down ballot candidates who represent the next generation of leaders, reports cbs news campaign reporter jack turman. some notable candidates who the pac is endorsing include democratic senate candidates, such as theresa greenfield in iowa, mj hegar in texas and reverend raphael warnock in georgia. in addition to supporting several state house races, buttigieg is also endorsing several congressional members who were in tough races last cycle, including congresswoman elissa slotkin in michigan and congressman andy kim in new jersey. this election, we need to replace the current president and elect leaders at every level of our government who will deliver solutions to the biggest challenges we face, buttigieg said in a statement. i believe the voices of these twenty-eight candidates are essential to changing our politics, and i'm committed to doing everything i can to make sure they are successful on november 3rd. according to a press release, win the era plans to hold virtual campaign events to support these candidates over the next two months.
and that call, there was nothing wrong with it whatever. in fact, it was laudable. he-- and it was nothing inconsistent with the obama administration's policies. and it was in u.s. interests. he was saying to the russians, you know, don't escalate. and they asked him if he remembered saying that, and he said he didn't remember that.
donald trump: at the appropriate time, i will release them. but right now i'm under routine audit. nobody cares. the only one who cares is, you know, you and a few people that asked that question. obviously, the public didn't care because i won the election very easily. so they don't care. i never thought they did care.
house gop leaders expressed confidence earlier that the bill would indeed pass.
lesley stahl: i want to ask you about the tweet that you put out, i think it was last night or the night before, about these demonstrators.
appearing on cbs this morning, emanuel agreed there were unintended consequences of the affordable care act that need to be fixed.
pelosi said mr. trump's decision to not extend the enrollment period is no surprise given his support for a lawsuit to overturn the affordable care act.
mr. trump recently held a rally here to get his base fired up. during his appearance, the president said he was surprised to be in mississippi fighting for a republican to win a gubernatorial race.
paul ryan: i would take issue with that, but go ahead.
klobuchar is the fifth major woman candidate to launch a campaign for the democratic nomination, joining fellow senators kirsten gillibrand, kamala harris and elizabeth warren, as well as hawaii rep. tulsi gabbard.
biden has been the frontrunner in the democratic primary since entering the race. in the most recent cbs news battleground tracker poll, 29% of registered iowa voters who are democrats said biden is their top choice for the nomination, followed by vermont senator bernie sanders with 26% and massachusetts senator elizabeth warren with 17%.
and, yes, when i was a senator, i did vote to close corporate loopholes. i voted to close, i think, one of the loopholes he took advantage of when he claimed a billion-dollar loss that enabled him to avoid paying taxes.
raddatz: thank you very much. we're going to get on to one more question.
challenges over the contraceptive mandate have made their way to the supreme court twice before in disputes brought by employers with religious objections to the requirement they offer health plans that cover contraceptives. in 2014, the high court ruled 5-4 in favor of hobby lobby, a family-owned corporation, and found that forcing it to comply with the contraceptive mandate violated a 1993 federal law that protects religious freedom. then, in 2016, an eight-member supreme court sent another case involving faith-based groups back to the lower court to give the parties an opportunity at an approach going forward.
john dickerson: so where are things in this negotiations as of right now?
margaret brennan: in the sentencing memo that the special counsel wrote that he provided useful information concerning russia-related matters core to its investigation. does that mean-- are you saying that cohen actually has evidence of conspiracy with russia.
governor ned lamont (d-connecticut/@govnedlamont): good morning, margaret.
the third pillar ends the visa lottery, a program that randomly hands out green cards without any regard for skill, merit, or the safety of american people. it's time to begin moving towards a merit-based immigration system, one that admits people who are skilled, who want to work, who will contribute to our society, and who will love and respect our country.
the poll employed a random digit dial methodology. for the landline sample, a respondent was randomly selected from all adults in the household. for the cell sample, interviews were conducted with the person who answered the phone.
[barack obama: we talked about foreign policy, we talked about domestic policy.]
there has been an explosion of health- and health insurance-related scams that use a variety of pretenses to collect personal information or payments for insurance that's never delivered, said youmail ceo alex quilici. crooks see what's in the news, and they try to leverage it. they're consummate marketers -- they're just in the wrong business.
the president's been in discussions with a number of people, senator cornyn among them, about his approach to this issue, and we'll see whether later they decide to make an announcement on that subject, it wouldn't be up to me to make that announcement, said mcconnell.
the open-enrollment period doesn't end until jan. 31, so it's possible an influx of younger people could still boost that percentage, and confusion is still widespread about when to sign up. the henry j. kaiser family foundation found in december that two-thirds of uninsured americans weren't aware of when open enrollment ends.
what was the solution from the obama/clinton team? a hashtag campaign! hillary clinton, as an apologist for an al-qaeda affiliate in nigeria resulting in the capture of innocent young women. is she guilty or not guilty? see, she fights for the wrong people, he said, for example.
in the wake of the pipe bomb scare and the pittsburgh shooting, pundits and anti-trump politicians have been demanding that republicans and conservatives abandon their hateful rhetoric, as the cliché' goes. why aren't trump supporters aren't turning on the president, they demand to know. what's keeping rank-and-file republicans from abandoning trump over his clearly objectionable statements and divisive outbursts?
later tuesday, the president himself took to twitter to thank galifianakis for his role in pointing people to healthcare.gov.
instead he cast himself as a a kasich republican who would be able to get the wheels turning on real change in washington. he said he wouldn't change his identity for south carolina, even though people had warned him that the conservative state would require it.
he attributed the delay in its release to a further examination of the plan's legislative components to determine what can also be done unilaterally due to gridlock on capitol hill.
indiana may be a red state, but we got joe donnelly, she said.
that's what social security does. it provides a mechanism that forces people to pay for their own retirement instead of relying on the goodwill of society to bail them out when they can't afford the basic necessities they need to survive.
the 419-6 vote is a signal of bipartisan unity against a key provision of the affordable care act. the 40% tax on high-cost plans is meant to help subsidize other plans under the affordable care act, but it's become unpopular even among many democrats.
john dickerson: that's right. that's why i wondered if that's where people are going. people are addicted to what they are seeing on the news and we all experience that. those of us who report or live in this world. wouldn't it be-- if you had examples, for example, after this kavanaugh fight if a democrat had said, you know i understand what my republican colleague was-- how passionate they got in defense of this person who was wrongly accused. or if a republican had said instead of calling them evil, had taught people through the power of their example--since everybody's watching anyway--taught people through the power of their example of what it looks like to forgive the other side? we just don't see that.
with seemingly a hard-boiled, obama-era sentimentality, the former vice president is more hesitant than some of his democratic rivals for a wholesale policy shift as they support medicare for all programs, which would move all americans to the same government-run healthcare plan and, in most plans, eliminate private insurance entirely.
vice president mike pence: i think they should adhere to whatever criteria the school administrators and local health officials determine to be appropriate. but really, again, i wanna say, the american academy of pediatricians made it clear early on that distance learning, this online learning, is no substitute for being in the classroom.
in a phone interview earlier this month, south carolina democratic party chair trav robertson told mitchell that it will be interesting to see how patrick and other newcomers to the democratic primary race fare. i think that it is obvious that [patrick]—along with michael bloomberg think that they have a narrative or a certain viewpoint or some type of ability to add to the field, said robertson. this is something that we normally don't see in presidential primaries or nominating processes — people [getting] in later, rather than sooner, and so it's going to be an interesting next couple of months.
raddatz: secretary clinton, we have to...
he confronted the concerns just as some senators are calling for an investigation into those investments as a possible violation of the stop trading on congressional knowledge act, which makes it illegal for legislators and their staff to trade stocks on information that isn't made public.

cary dixon - opioid reform advocate pablo martinez monsivais/ap president barack obama listens as cary dixon describes having an adult child struggle with a substance use disorder, during a community forum at the east end family resource center in charleston, w.va., wednesday, oct. 21, 2015. obama was in charleston to lead a community discussion on prescription drug abuse and heroin epidemic.
democrats hope that if senate republican candidates follow heller's lead and embrace trump on the campaign trail, it will ultimately hurt them in the general election, especially in states like nevada, arizona, and florida, all of which have changing demographics. sunday, potential 2020 hopeful sen. elizabeth warren, d-massachusetts, who mr. trump again referred to as pocahontas, traveled to nevada to support fellow democrats and condemn the president's zero tolerance on the border.
the first thing this budget would do is try to repeal the affordable care act again, said judy solomon, vice president of health policy at the center on budget and policy priorities. it's not likely there's an appetite for that, but it says that it's still an overarching priority for this administration.
democrats are also pushing for employers to make retirement saving easier for the u.s. workforce.
mr. trump could still pick a wild card from the original list of 25 contenders his administration released last year. he is expected to make the announcement monday at 9 p.m. edt from the white house.
republicans could have mounted a highly effective counter attack on health care in 2018. democrats have fumbled the ball and republicans are just looking at it lying on the 50 yard line.
sen. susan collins, r-maine, who has expressed strong concerns about the measure, had been waiting for the cbo score before making a decision about her position.
president donald trump: i would say china. they're an adversary. they're a--
liberals have pushed the #russiagate narrative with the phrase hacked the election, knowing that, to many rank-and-file democrats, those words mean more than just posting facebook ads. the suggestion behind a hacked election is that russia actually changed the vote count and stole the white house from hillary clinton.
lesley stahl: if he does something that you think crossed a line, will you tell him?
the case, known as fulton v. city of philadelphia, involves the city's decision to exclude a religious foster care agency, catholic social services, from its foster care system because the agency declines to place foster children with same-sex couples because of its religious objections to gay marriage.
margaret brennan: the miami herald, as you know, local paper there, says that communities with higher average incomes have been getting more doses than impoverished neighborhoods. why is that happening?
i mean it 100 percent, i understand health care now, especially very well. a lot of people don't understand it, we are going to be, the republicans, the party of great health care, mr. trump said wednesday in an oval office meeting with the interim first lady of venezuela, fabiana rosales de guaidó. the democrats have, they've let you down, they came up with obamacare. it's terrible.
with three weeks to go before election day, ohio is a toss-up, according to the cbs news battleground tracker, which shows mr. trump with 50% support, compared to 49% for biden.
when asked about his thoughts on donald trump's inauguration and all three branches of congress under republican control, mccarthy said the gop know[s] the responsibility that we have.
president trump has spoken with candidates to replace retiring justice anthony kennedy, and whoever he ultimately chooses monday night, it will be a relatively young and conservative nominee.
now that polls are showing that donald trump could be a serious contender for the republican presidential nomination, the real estate developer and reality television personality is getting serious blowback from conservative organizations that are questioning his republican credentials.

some on the left, predictably enough, aren't happy about the slew of centrist vets the democrats are running. if the democrats capture a majority in the house of representatives on november 6…candidates drawn from the military-intelligence apparatus will comprise as many as half of the new democratic members of congress, read an article on a socialist website that quickly made the rounds on progressive social media earlier this month.
we're giving those americans a way to change the channel on washington republicans – and they can do it from their sofa, dccc chairwoman cheri bustos said in a statement.
law enforcement is a noble, essential calling and we all grieve that we've again seen attacks on officers, she said. ohio governors do not have the power to arbitrarily suspend federal and state constitutional rights or state laws as suggested. the bonds between our communities and police must be reset and rebuilt--as we're doing in ohio--so our communities and officers can both be safe. everyone has an important role to play in that renewal.
this hasn't happened, although the administration has looked for ways to do so.
the big issues in this district include health care. culberson opposes obamacare while fletcher says she wants to improve it. immigration is another big issue, and both candidates want better security along the border. but culberson wants to fund the border wall while fletcher does not. there's also flood control: hurricane harvey was devastating, leaving thousands of homes ruined.
miller: i'm not going to negotiate the details on air with you right now--
senator rick scott (r-florida/@senrickscott): well, first of, i'm glad the-- the president cares about health care. i've-- i've-- i ran the largest hospital company. i care about the cost of health care and that's what i've focused on. i know it's going to be tough. i look forward to, you know, to seeing what the president's going to put out. but with nancy pelosi in the house it's going to be tough to get something done. but we do know that medicare for all which senator sanders is all in on is going to just ruin our health care system.
in another letter directed to white house counsel pat cipollone, the lawmakers argued that the president is attempting to override the will of congress and has demonstrated a clear disregard for the obligation to uphold the constitution.
lauren leader, co-founder and ceo of all in together, a non-partisan voter education group, said, women voters have been driving the election outcomes for the better part of the last 30 years.

most significant are the proposals to allow government reimbursements for opioid addiction medications, including for the first time methadone and efforts to cut back on prescribing opioids.
robert o'brien: no. i, look, i think, you know, and again, i-- i don't want to get into private conversations in a-- in a presidential daily brief, but i-- i don't think admiral maguire was necessarily informed of what was going to happen at that hearing in the house either. and-- and again, there's nothing that he's given up-- no information admiral maguire gave us, gina haspel has given us-- director haspel, ambassador grenell the new acting dni, that comports with what was leaked out of that house intel committee. so i haven't seen it. the leaders of the-- of the intelligence community that i have spoken with haven't seen anything that comports with what was leaked out. but, again, those leaks, i don't know if that's what the briefers told the house committee. i mean those were just simply leaked--
donald trump: i think that i would rather not comment on that yet. i don't-- i haven't made up my mind. i respect him a lot. i respect the fbi a lot. i think --
parents of the almost 9 million children who receive coverage under the federal children's health insurance program, or chip, can breathe easier. after months of delay, the senate voted to reauthorize the program for six years as part of a short-term spending bill that is set to end the weekend-long government shutdown.
margaret brennan: but in hindsight, you know where this story ends up.
president trump: he's not a war hero. he's a war hero – he's a war hero because he was captured. i like people that weren't captured, ok.
the company bioengineers bacteria to produce dna and enzymes, the ingredients to generate rna for the vaccine. ginkgo's master stroke was to figure out how to manipulate bacteria to make more of those key ingredients - much more.
you all know what's on the line. the future of education because it doesn't survive another four years under matt bevin. the future of rural healthcare because it doesn't survive another four years under matt bevin. we've got a governor that brags about prosperity, but do you see it right here?
conway served as trump's third campaign manager and largely succeeded in navigating the minefield of rivalries that ensnared other officials. trump is said to have offered her a choice of white house jobs -- either press secretary or communications director. but people with knowledge of conway's plans say she is more interested in serving as an outside political adviser, akin to the role president barack obama's campaign manager david plouffe played following the 2008 election.
the law, she said, has reshaped the individual and small-group insurance markets so the range of choices for consumers is more robust than it has ever been, she said. meanwhile, self-employed individuals and others who previously had no access to private insurance are finally getting coverage.
the dropped plans seemingly violate mr. obama's 2009 campaign pledge that, if you have insurance that you like, then you will be able to keep that insurance.
near the end of his speech, ryan also made a pitch for electing a conservative majority in congress, and exhorted the crowd, what do you say we unify this party, at this crucial moment when unity is everything?
we're going to put new york into play this time around, donald trump, jr. said on the convention floor. it is my honor to able to throw donald trump over the delegate count tonight. congratulations, dad, we love you!
what do you mean, it's not the end of it?
the case hardly marks the first time the supreme court will hear a dispute involving obamacare. most notably, in 2012, the high court upheld the health care law's individual mandate, which is considered to be the heart of obamacare and requires all americans to purchase health insurance coverage, in a 5-4 vote.
for kate spittlemeister, the most important issue to her right now is obamacare: that's been a lifeline for us.
donald trump's new campaign manager kellyanne conway on sunday reversed her position that the gop presidential nominee should release his tax returns while under audit.
in 2010 she beat the odds again by winning the governor's race. but it was a dirty campaign, with both racism and sexual innuendo that would surface again this year.
melania trump: you know, of course, i did many times, from the beginning of the campaign. but…
others say pragmatism is pushing them towards biden.
in a tweet, jennifer palmieri, hillary clinton's communications director, responded to the accusations of politicizing from manafort:
more broadly, warren and representative alexandria ocasio-cortez in late april proposed a moratorium on risky mergers and acquisitions for large companies, private equity firms and hedge funds until businesses stabilize. they have not yet released the text of their pandemic anti-monopoly act.
the information on new sign-ups for health coverage comes from the centers for medicare and medicaid services. the figures are partial because they don't include sign-ups from states that run their own health insurance marketplaces. major states like california and new york aren't counted in the federal statistics.
much of tuesday was spent with the two parties trading barbs about who was responsible for a shutdown. no one seemed to stray from their respective positions: senate democrats refuse to consider anything other than a spending bill with no extra measures attached, and house republicans are seeking last-minute negotiations that could offer a chance to chip away at the health care law.
the bills to fund on-time veterans benefits, re-open the national parks and memorials and let the d.c. government continue running on its own revenue failed in the house tuesday evening, primarily because of democratic opposition; the measures needed two-thirds support to pass. before the house even voted on them, senate majority leader harry reid, d-nev., called the bills just another wacky idea from the tea party republicans, and indicated they had no future in the democratically-controlled senate.

earlier in the day, the former pennsylvania senator charged that obama's agenda is not about you ... it's about some phony ideal. some phony theology. not a theology based on the bible. that prompted obama campaign spokesman ben labolt to call santorum's comment the latest low in a republican primary campaign that has been fueled by distortions, ugliness and searing pessimism and negativity. labolt said it was a stark contrast with the president who is focused every day on creating jobs and restoring economic security for the middle class.
the president said, before he was elected, that it was his objective to have a single-payer system. i think that's where he would like to go, he said. my own view is that if obamacare were allowed to stand ... you would see down the road private insurance getting squeezed out, and ultimately a call for a government insurance plan or a government insurance program of some kind. and ultimately it would take a lion's share of the health market.

jamelle bouie: --(indistinct) of industries. he's calling for a very, very robust welfare state, for more medicare, for free college, for these sorts of things. and if-- and things that are probably popular with the public. and so if you're going to start defining medicare for all or even just medicare expansion, if you're going to start defining free college or any of these programs as socialism, then the other thing that could happen is that voters say, hey, if this is socialism, like, sign me up. like, if this is what it means to be socialist, then i'll take that bet.

sen. klobuchar: we have suggested so many things, comprehensive immigration reform that passed the senate would have brought down the debt by one hundred fifty eight billion and there was significant funding in there for border security. we just did it with the dreamer's deal that was bipartisan that was suggested. so of course we're willing to work with them. but as pointed out by speaker pelosi, there aren't the votes for that wall.
although she rebuked his administration's policies and rhetoric on climate change, political campaign spending, immigration and voting rights, klobuchar never mentioned president trump by name during her remarks. her campaign is hoping her candidacy can get traction in battleground midwestern states like michigan, wisconsin and ohio that mr. trump carried in 2016 election.

prescription drug and health care costs are among the top concerns for voters looking ahead to 2020. president trump campaigned on addressing rising prescription drug costs in 2016, although critics say he has failed to do so. last week, a federal judge blocked an administration rule that would have required drug makers to disclose medicine prices in tv ads.

bernardo bertolucci neal ulevich/ap his early ambition was to be a poet, like his father. instead, bernardo bertolucci (march 16, 1941-november 26, 2018) would establish himself as a major name in international cinema, uncowed in dramatizing stories involving politics, class warfare, spirituality, eroticism and incest. beginning his career as an assistant director for pier paolo pasolini, he made his first film, the grim reaper, about the murder of a prostitute, in 1962. by the early 1970s, he had already directed several acclaimed features, including before the revolution, the spider's strategem, and the conformist, a visually astonishing tale of a bureaucrat (jean-louis trintignant) subsuming himself to the orders of mussolini's secret police. it was his bold and improvisational 1973 feature last tango in paris, starring marlon brando and maria schneider as a middle-aged man and younger woman engaged in a brutal sexual relationship, that earned berlotucci both critical kudos and censorship. (the movie was banned in italy.) he would later win two academy awards for writing and directing the sumptuous 1987 biopic the last emperor (pictured), the first western production to be shot in beijing's forbidden city. bertolucci's other films include the five-hour epic 1900, about italy during the rise of fascism, starring robert de niro, gerard depardieu and dominique sanda; the sheltering sky, based on the paul bowles novel of an american couple's disintegrating relationship during a trip to africa; little buddha, about siddharta; and the dreamers, an erotic drama set against the 1968 student riots in paris.

this is familiar territory for the president. more than a dozen women have accused him of sexual misconduct, including columnist e. jean carroll, who accused him of raping her in a new york city department store dressing room in the 1990s. the ongoing claims waged against trump range from inappropriate comments to sexual assault.
number three, women can't be charged more than men for our health insurance, which is the way it used to be before the affordable care act. number four, if you're under 26, and your parents have a policy, you can be on that policy until the age of 26, something that didn't happen before.
and we want- want to move from a system of immigration based on family relations to one based on skills and merits for what the economy needs. perfectly common sense. here's the issue. if we simply did daca without incumbent reforms, then you'd have a daca problem five years down the road. we want to fix the problem and the root cause of the problem. daca is a symptom of a broken immigration system. we want to fix the root cause of this problem while we deal with daca so that we don't have 700,000 more daca kids in five years. that's perfectly common sense, and that's all the president is saying.

jamal simmons: listen, i think mayor pete buttigieg-- buttigieg is going to be the factor on the debate stage that we will all be talking about afterwards. i mean he is somebody who is willing to say what he thinks. he is the youngest person running, but, yet, he seems to be among the most mature. he is-- he is coming at this with-- with values. he is putting policy on the table. he's been very strong campaigner. i think for vice president biden, the danger i think a lot of people see in him is that he-- this presidential experience may take away all the luster he built up over the time that he was vice president to barack obama, which would then remove him from being kind of a-- a statesman for the democratic party. he could run a campaign, he could win, it could all be fine, or it could be a big disaster.

james billington ap photo during his 28 years as librarian of congress, james billington (june 1, 1929-november 20, 2018), who grew up in a house filled with used books, would bring the world's largest library into the digital age. an expert on russian history when he was appointed by president reagan, he is credited with creating a massive new library of congress online, at loc.gov, making research and legislative databases more easily accessible, and improving the library's preservation efforts. among them: the american memory national digital library program, which features digital copies of more than 24 million books, documents, photographs and other cultural and historical assets. he oversaw the institution of the national film registry and the national recording registry, and built the national audio-visual conservation center in culpeper, va., which stores six million films, tv broadcasts and audio recordings. and in 2010 he added to the library's archive the entire collection of tweets, in the billions, sent via twitter since the company was founded in 2006, and which it continued to archive until the end of 2017. always a research collection, the library's traditional analog collections were doubled during billington's tenure, from 85.5 million items in 1987 to more than 160 million items. among his notable acquisitions: the only copy of the 1507 waldseemüller world map (america's birth certificate) for permanent display, and hundreds of collections from notable americans, including thurgood marshall, irving berlin and jackie robinson. he also co-founded (with laura bush) the national book festival in washington.

arthur mitchell martha swope/schomburg center for research in black culture, new york public library in 1986 arthur mitchell (march 27, 1934–september 19, 2018) told 60 minutes correspondent ed bradley that, when he was a teenager, people did not encourage his pursuit of dance: friends, people that you know in the business, they kept saying, 'why are you studying ballet? there will never be a black man in the ballet until the year 2000.' and the minute they told me i could not become a dancer, that's when that something inside me said, 'oh, really? i'll show you!' born in harlem, the son of a building superintendent, mitchell rose to become a star performer with the new york city ballet under george balanchine, whose pairing of mitchell with a white dancer in the late '50s was deemed audacious. mitchell also choreographed his own works, performed on broadway, and worked with dance companies in other countries. in 1968, committed to living up to the legacy of murdered civil rights pioneer martin luther king jr., mitchell started a school for classical dance at a time when few people of color were performing classical ballet (and even fewer were teaching it). it would grow into the dance theatre of harlem, the country's first major african-american dance company. mitchell would also introduce inner-city children to the arts via dancing through barriers, a program that taught tens of thousands of kids every year in cities from new york to miami to london.

lee's move could portend other gop senate endorsements for cruz, who increasingly believe he is the only candidate capable of stopping donald trump from capturing the nomination. trump is still leading in the number of states won and in the delegate count, but cruz, who was not at the press conference, is the only candidate who's shown the ability to beat the new york billionaire in multiple primaries.

harlan ellison ap photo at 5'5, science fiction writer harlan ellison (may 27, 1934-june 28, 2018) was bullied as a youth, which may have fueled his loud-mouthed attitude, once punching an ohio state university professor who said he lacked writing talent. he brought that pugnacious style to his work, penning nightmarish, sometimes darkly humorous stories. he wrote some 50 books and more than 1,400 articles, essays, tv scripts and screenplays, and earned nearly a dozen nebula and hugo awards. he once said he wanted his stories to grab you by the throat and tear off parts of your body. some of his most popular works were surrealistic fantasies set in grisly worlds run by totalitarians and conformists. a boy and his dog, set in a world devastated by nuclear war, featured a protagonist who communicated with his dog via telepathy; he recently expanded the novella into a full-length novel, blood's a rover. he edited the seminal 1967 sci-fi anthology dangerous visions, and his short story, i have no mouth & i must scream, is about the last humans, eternally tortured by a malevolent, godlike computer. his 1967 star trek episode, the city on the edge of forever, is thought by many to be the best ever, in which a young woman played by joan collins is saved from a fatal accident by the starship enterprise's time-traveling dr. mccoy. later, the ship's capt.

we'll see if democrats are able to translate the rage and anxiety in our communities into voters. women in the suburbs, in particular, are expected to be a decisive voting bloc in dozens of congressional, senate, and other statewide races. the #metoo movement is likely to motivate large swaths of women to head to the ballot box.

early polling on the matter spelled trouble for the gop. a quinnipiac university national poll released tuesday morning shows that by a margin of 72 percent to 22 percent, american voters oppose a government shutdown over attempts to block the affordable care act. and though voters are divided on the law itself, with 45 percent in favor and 47 percent opposed, 58 percent of those surveyed said they opposed cutting off funding a way to stop it from being implemented.
with no penalty, there's no tax, the plaintiffs, a coalition of republican-led states, argued in the texas case. a coalition of states governed by democrats and led by california had a different interpretation -- that the individual mandate isn't unconstitutional if people aren't actually being forced to pay penalties. california also argued that the individual mandate could be severed from the rest of the health care law.

a dismal october wiped out most of the market's gains this year, while an elevated vix, an index that measures market volatility, suggests more day-to-day mayhem is possible. the good news is that the stock market jitters will likely end as soon as the midterms do—regardless of who the winners are. research shows that historically, nearly every u.s. election since the world war ii has been followed by a so-called relief rally, where stocks rise at least modestly.
tulsi gabbard rep. tulsi gabbard launches 2020 campaign 05:28 biography tulsi gabbard was born in american samoa in 1981, and her family moved to hawaii when she was 2 years old. her mother, carol, is a practicing hindu, a religion gabbard adopted. her father, mike, is a member of the hawaii state senate. after growing up in a politically active family, gabbard became a member of the hawaii house of representatives when she was 21 years old in 2002, the youngest woman to be elected to a state legislature at the time. while serving in the state legislature in 2003, she enlisted in the hawaii army national guard. she deployed in iraq and returned in 2006. after returning from her second deployment in 2009, gabbard ran for honolulu city council. she served on the council from 2011 until 2012, when she resigned to focus on her congressional campaign. she was elected to the house of representatives in 2012. she was the first practicing hindu in congress. issues gabbard is very progressive, and one of the few members of congress to endorse sen. bernie sanders during the 2016 democratic primary. she resigned her position as vice chair of the democratic national committee to endorse him. gabbard is a supporter of a woman's right to an abortion and received a 100 percent rating from naral. she has emphasized environmental and economic issues during her tenure, and supports a $15 minimum wage. she also supports medicare for all.
with any type of insurance, you have to buy it before you need to make a claim. any insured population faces the risk that sometime in the future, they may incur an event that would cause them significant financial stress, but they don't know when that event may occur. so they buy insurance to protect themselves and their family.

lesley stahl: it was a pretty nasty campaign. do you regret any of the things you said about her?
robert o'brien: always great to be here, margaret.
paula reid: absolutely not. i mean, the special counsel came out hitting pretty hard this week against these claims by flynn and his lawyers that he was somehow caught off-guard by his fbi interview. and they released a memo and they said, look, you got a call from the deputy director of the fbi. you set up a voluntary interview at the location of your choice, you have three decades of public service, you've worked with the fbi, you know not to lie. we didn't do this to you, you did it to yourself.
the democratic charge on health care represents a turnaround from recent elections. in 2010, just months after passage of the affordable care act, democrats lost control of the house as republicans tapped into fears about the government's growing role in health care. four years later, republicans grabbed senate control following the botched rollout of the health law's online insurance markets and some people's loss of policies that fell short of the statute's coverage requirements.
john dickerson: i want to get to solutions in a minute, but let's stick with the diagnosis for a moment. you are, in fact, able to make this case because you're a politician and so what i want to ask you about is the power of example in politics. there is no more famous person probably in america than the president.

'thank god, i didn't do it.' and i've seen that, and i've seen other things. and i am pro-life.
beto o'rourke beto o'rourke joins the 2020 presidential rac... 02:39 o'rourke was born and raised in the texas border city of el paso. the former congressman tried to topple sen. ted cruz in 2018 and failed, but in the process shattered fundraising records and became one of the best known democrats in the country. at age 46, he's one of the younger contenders for the democratic nomination.
while average premiums will eventually drop, cbo said monday that the senate bill would lead to higher out-of-pocket spending for people and fewer covered benefits.
while the pandemic has transformed and curbed the fundraising scene dramatically, the brady pac, a sister organization of the brady gun control advocacy group, has actually seen an increase in fundraising and interest. brian lemek, executive director of brady pac, told cbs news political unit broadcast associate aaron navarro brady pac has raised $1 million so far in the year, and based off the activity in the past two months, has doubled its election cycle fundraising goal to $5 million.

the next round of presidential nominating contests, which are scheduled for april 4, will now all take place with mail ballots amid the coronavirus pandemic. the alaska democrats on monday canceled in-person voting for their primary in favor of voting by mail. on saturday, democrats in hawaii scrapped their in-person primary voting and said they would offer another round of mail ballots to voters. and earlier this month, wyoming democrats canceled their in-person caucuses and told democrats to submit their votes by mail or drop off ballots to local election officials.
the 142-page measure, released thursday, would end obamacare's penalties for people who don't buy insurance, replacing them with a penalty for lapsed coverage; and it would cut back an expansion of medicaid, but would keep more protections for people with pre-existing conditions, compared to the house-passed bill. it would provide tax credits, based on income, age and geography, which would make more money available to lower-income recipients to help them buy insurance. this differs from the house bill, which tied its tax credits only to age. obamacare taxes would be repealed under the bill. the senate bill would provide for expanded tax-free health savings accounts, and it would also eliminate federal funding for planned parenthood for one year.
he added that nobody should be forced to choose between protecting their health and exercising their constitutional right to vote and vowed that democrats will fight to ensure that voters can safely make their voice heard.
the nonpartisan committee for a responsible federal budget recently estimated that clinton's economic proposals would add $200 billion to the federal debt over the next decade, while trump's would add $5.3 trillion. it's hard to imagine such a jump in the debt being favorable to capital markets. an increasing appetite for federal debt could crowd out other borrowers and leave the country more vulnerable to overseas governments that own our debt.
the trump administration this week released the final rule on short-term health insurance plans that are a cheaper alternative to buying individual insurance on the obamacare exchange but usually offer far less comprehensive coverage.
a government shutdown was avoided friday when president trump signed a short-term funding bill to keep the government running through next week.

president donald trump: we have turned the corner.
and i will not stop until our veterans are properly taken care of, which has been my promise to them from the very beginning of this great journey.
i guess in a way, you could say i'm sticking up for him, trump told listeners, in his lengthiest comments yet about the accusation, which biden addressed directly friday for the first time, unequivocally denying reade's claim.
economists say other relief policies have proved more effective at boosting the economy. for instance, an extra $600 in weekly unemployment pay helped bolster households that had suffered job or income losses — until it expired in july. in may alone, the program boosted personal income by $842 billion, according to the economic policy institute. that money helped support local businesses, keeping the economy from collapsing under the impact of lockdowns.
margaret brennan: south carolina, though, is your firewall.
the failed gop repeal effort helped turn the tables. a wall street journal-nbc news poll last month showed people trust democrats over republicans for handling health care by 18 percentage points. a kaiser health tracking poll in february showed obama's law with a favorable rating from 54 percent of americans, its highest score in more than 80 kaiser surveys since the statute's enactment.

in minnesota, both senate seats are currently held by democrats, sen. amy klobuchar and sen. tina smith. klobuchar is expected to win re-election. jim newberger has emerged as the top republican contender to challenge klobuchar this fall. smith was appointed by gov. mark dayton to fill al franken's seat after he resigned. she is running in a special election in november to fill the remainder of franken's term, which was set to end in 2020. five democrats are challenging smith in the primary: ali chehem ali, gregg iverson, nick leonard, richard painter, and christopher seymore. on the republican side, state senator karin housley is the frontrunner in the primary and won the party's endorsement to compete in the special election to fill franken's vacated seat.

adrian cronauer adrian cronauer, courtesy of paul bottoms; thanks to afvnvets.net during his service as a u.s. air force sergeant in vietnam in 1965-66, adrian cronauer (september 8, 1938-july 18, 2018) opened his armed forces radio show with the phrase, goooooood morning, vietnam! the military wanted conservative programming. american youths fighting overseas, however, were not into drab, sterile announcements with middle-of-the-road music, cronauer told the associated press in 1987. the battle over the airwaves was joined: i wanted to serve the listeners. his military radio antics inspired the character played by robin williams in the film good morning, vietnam, who drops perry como and lawrence welk from his 6 a.m. playlist in favor of the dave clark five. cronauer loved the movie but admitted much of it was hollywood make-believe, explaining, yes, i did try to make it sound more like a stateside station. yes, i did have problems with news censorship. yes, i was in a restaurant shortly before the viet cong hit it. and yes, i did start each program by yelling, 'good morning, vietnam!' the rest was invention on the part of hollywood scriptwriters and williams' improvisational genius. if i did even half the things that robin did in the movie, i'd still be in leavenworth! cronauer told journalist rick fredericksen in 2014. after the military, he worked in radio, television and advertising. he also attended the university of pennsylvania's law school and worked in communications law. he later handled prisoner-of-war issues for the pentagon.

that opt-out process was the subject of a previous supreme court case, but the court, with only eight justices at the time because of the death of justice antonin scalia, didn't decide the issue. it instead sent both sides back to see if they could work out a compromise.
this melding of social and economic issues looks a lot like the strategy mr. trump is likely to deploy next year. beshear, meanwhile, has said repeatedly that he supports abortion rights and accused bevin of opposing the procedure even in cases of rape or incest.
however, as he discussed last night – and i think a lot of people missed this point – he talked about a public-private partnership, and if they're talking about leveraging private funds as a significant portion of that trillion dollars over a 10- or five-year period, i think that is very doable within the context of everything else, rubio said.

because health insurance is so complicated, consumers are going to have to do their homework to figure out if there's something in the bill for them. and health care benefits are not like stimulus checks that can be blasted out. experts say there will be a lag as government agencies, insurers and employers unpack the bill's provisions.
john dickerson: so, these people you're talking about are the ones who would like to tell a pollster they're going to vote, they feel it's their civic duty, but election day comes around, they're busy, they got a couple of jobs, whatever, they're not making it. so, these are the people who are the key to what you have identified which is maybe that's the key to whether the repub-- the democrats take the house or not.

janice jackson: well, the goal right now is to-- to get a resolution. ctu has made it clear that they want a deal. we share those same sentiments, but we're still far apart on a couple of key issues, such as vaccination and how we account for accommodations for individuals who maybe are just, you know, petrified to come back into schools because of covid. we believe that we have to reopen schools. we've been closed for almost a year now. and as a school system, we're starting to see some of the effects of schools being closed. many of our students aren't logging on. we are seeing african american and latinx students, in particular, being especially hard hit. and our goal is to really give every parent an option. those families who want to remain remote will have that option through the remainder of the school year. but we have thousands of families who want an in-person option because they're essential workers themselves.

more people in michigan have had their health care plans cancelled than have enrolled nationwide, house ways and means committee chairman dave camp, r-mich., said in a statement. given that these early enrollment numbers are inflated to include those just 'shopping' for a plan, it is clear that the real truth is even worse than we are being told.
trump: i think aleppo is a disaster, humanitarian-wise.
the general election campaign proved to be as unusual as his fight for the republican nomination.
i think we've sadly stigmatized the issue of mental health and so, so many people experience it every day, said harris. i know enough to know that almost everyone here has experienced this with someone you know, work with, or love. cbs news campaign reporter lacrai mitchell says one of the key points of harris' plan is to focus on vulnerable populations, which would include doubling u.s. departments of defense and veterans affairs research dollars to address and treat ptsd, military sexual trauma, and traumatic brain injury.

lesley stahl: what do you mean by that and what does it make you think about?
i think that's one of the most troubling aspects of this whole thing. and, in fact, i said it in testimony on the hill, i can't remember if it was my confirmation, that i said i was very concerned about the possibility that that dossier and steele's activities were used as a vector for the russians to inject disinformation into the political campaign.

john dickerson: but i'm trying to get answers from you--
as the senate convened for a rare august work period, the late-summer session serves as a reminder of how much has changed in the partnership between senate majority leader mitch mcconnell and president trump.
i can't do anything about the swamp that the president is trying to clean up in washington with all that bickering and things going on. but i can drain the swamp here that tate reeves has created, he said at a tupelo press conference ahead of the president's visit.
margaret talev: i don't think that that shake up is done. in fact, it was only a week ago when the world thought that nick ayers would be the president's next chief of staff, but if he had come in under that arrangement they were discussing, it also would have been interim arrangement. the president wasn't comfortable with that a week ago. part of that interim arrangement would have been to execute the sort of staff overhaul, shake up, whatever you want to call it, that is now kind of slow rolling underway. will mick mulvaney execute it differently than nick ayers? possibly. but it's all up to the president. it's always been up to the president. so, some of the other folks who may or may not be on the chopping block, the education secretary, the commerce secretary. but it will ultimately be up to the president, and always-- always would have been. for months now, they've been looking at those midterm elections as a reset point, understanding that if the democrats took the house, it would change the dynamic of the second two years of the president's term. and now the president is trying to go into this new era in the stronger position as possible. so, folks who have baggage, political weakness that could drag him down, they-- he wants to be able to transition them out in some of these places including interior--

you see them marching and you see them on occasion, at least, i have seen it, where they are essentially calling death to the police. and that's not acceptable whether you like them or don't like them. that, bill, is not acceptable. but i have seen it and you have seen it, trump told o'reilly.
so a guy like saccone, who had a fine resume, plenty of outside cash, and touted himself as a strong trump supporter, should have easily won the district. yet he lost to a guy who ran -- in the heart of trump country -- as a liberal. and to make matters worse for the gop, lamb campaigned directly against the tax cut that the gop had hoped would give them a soft landing in november. if republicans can't run on trump's coattails, and they can't run on tax cuts, what can they run on in november?
a little over a week after ohio's vote-by-mail primary concluded, ohio secretary of state frank larose is proposing voting reforms ahead of future elections. in a fact sheet from the secretary of state's office, some of the reforms include allowing voters to request an absentee ballot online, providing pre-paid postage envelopes in order for voters to mail in their ballots and moving the absentee ballot request deadline to the tuesday before election day.

anthony salvanto: but this year they also say that they are unsatisfied with the direction of the country and they are breaking democratic for that reason. they also tell us that they feel like the republican party works against the interests of women and more for the interests of men. so on a personal level as a-- as a group identifier, group affiliation, you see them breaking more heavily democratic right now.
despite building anticipation, neither candidate has hinted whether they'll throw the first political punch.
we were scheduled to take a walk with the president around the white house grounds.
polling supports the strategy. almost two-thirds of democrats said the court was too conservative, leaving the left's approval rating for the supreme court at 38% according to gallup, the lowest it has been since the end of the bush administration.
mr. trump nominated barrett, a judge on the 7th u.s. circuit court of appeals, to replace the late justice ruth bader ginsburg on the supreme court on saturday, just over a week after the pioneering justice died from complications of metastatic pancreatic cancer. immediately following news of ginsburg's death, senate majority leader mitch mcconnell pledged the president's yet-to-be-named nominee would receive a vote on the senate floor, and the president urged the upper chamber to take up the confirmation before the november 3 general election.
conservatives are called racists for supporting immigration law, haters for defending their faith's long-standing views on sexuality and marriage, deplorables for not supporting president obama's political agenda — and then they've waited (largely in vain) to see anything resembling similar treatment of politicians and pundits of the left.

price dodged the question, saying he believed the fulfillment of those promises should be measured in whether patient care has suffered -- not measured in the dollars funding the programs.
trump: i think that it basically has fallen. ok? it basically has fallen. let me tell you something. you take a look at mosul. the biggest problem i have with the stupidity of our foreign policy, we have mosul. they think a lot of the isis leaders are in mosul. so we have announcements coming out of washington and coming out of iraq, we will be attacking mosul in three weeks or four weeks.
mr. trump wasted no time tweeting about the results:

lanhee chen: --in terms of exactly what the intelligence community is seeing if they are helping bernie sanders. and that is an assessment that they are comfortable with, i think that's something that should be shared. and if there's any confusion, i do think that o'brien's point was right which is the underlying intelligence ought to be declassified. so we can see that the american people--

mike bloomberg is the ninth richest person in the world, worth about $60 billion. his success began in 1981. before pc's or the internet evolved, bloomberg created a data and communications network for wall street. today, the bloomberg terminal is the central nervous system of world finance. but he told us, if he wins the presidency, he'll sell the company.
12:45 p.m. et at least six senators have pointed to tom price's stocks in health care companies as problematic in his position as a congressman and also as a possible hhs secretary, with sen. chris murphy, d-connecticut, being the latest to bring it to the fore.
mccain stayed above the fray during the controversy that ensued, but his relationship with trump was never warm. he was the deciding vote that killed the new president's plan to repeal obamacare.
trump: it is such a great question and it's maybe the question i get almost more than anything else, outside of defense. obamacare is a disaster. you know it. we all know it. it's going up at numbers that nobody's ever seen worldwide. nobody's ever seen numbers like this for health care.
stephen miller: well, we also have to think about--
and i will tell you very strongly, when bernie sanders said she had bad judgment, she has really bad judgment, because we are letting people into this country that are going to cause problems and crime like you've never seen. we're also letting drugs pour through our southern border at a record clip. at a record clip. and it shouldn't be allowed to happen.
lesley stahl: you did go after-- you-- you criticized her--
mr. carter, i have tried my entire life to do what i can to support children and families. you know, right out of law school, i went to work for the children's defense fund. and donald talks a lot about, you know, the 30 years i've been in public service. i'm proud of that. you know, i started off as a young lawyer working against discrimination against african-american children in schools and in the criminal justice system. i worked to make sure that kids with disabilities could get a public education, something that i care very much about. i have worked with latinos — one of my first jobs in politics was down in south texas registering latino citizens to be able to vote. so i have a deep devotion, to use your absolutely correct word, to making sure that an every american feels like he or she has a place in our country.
state attorney general patrick morrisey, who is running against manchin, is tying himself closely to the president and his policies. his campaign issued a memo this past week saying mr. trump's support has a larger impact in this race than any senate race in the country. he is welcoming the president to west virginia with open arms.
the stay-in-session strategy can also be seen as payback to democrats, who often force several days of procedural steps to delay final votes on trump-backed nominees or legislative priorities.
patrick will make his second two-day swing to south carolina since launching his presidential bid this week. as previously reported by mitchell and cbs news campaign reporter nicole sganga, patrick is expected to make a play for moderate voters in the first two early primary states. this visit comes on the heels of the hiring of columbia, south carolina-based political operative lajoia broughton to run the campaign's operation in the state. broughton was a south carolina lobbyist for juul labs before she signed on with patrick.

washington — the nomination of judge amy coney barrett to the supreme court last week set into motion a fast-paced and fiercely political battle over the future of the high court, with senate democrats, who have few tools to block her confirmation by the gop-controlled senate, charging that a vote in favor of barrett is a vote to kill the affordable care act.
the president praised the cajun navy that helped save lives in the wake of hurricane harvey last year. he noted strangers who helped each other after the mass shooting in las vegas.

kavanaugh's nomination now heads to the u.s. senate, which is controlled by a narrow, 51-to-49 seat gop majority. democrats are likely to take issue with a number of kavanaugh's decisions, including ones pushing back on the government's ability to regulate commerce. they are also likely to spend time examining his views on abortion, an issue now- senate democratic leader chuck schumer questioned him about during his 2006 confirmation hearings.

jindal and the republican governors are not alone in bashing washington republicans. that's what sen. cruz is doing, too. but the gop governors are making a different case. their argument is based on results, conservative policies that are sometimes the result of hard-won compromise. or, in some cases, they are boasting about lawmakers who have pushed for conservative legislation dealing with unions or removing regulatory barriers, but who have also decided to accept federal medicaid money as a part of obamacare. that kind of apostasy would not be tolerated by conservative purists in washington, but it's also the kind of purity that governors don't have the luxury for. in 2016 the four biggest governor's races for republicans will take place in pennsylvania, florida, ohio, and michigan. those republican governors all accepted medicaid funds.

clinton has gone on record supporting more regulation and oversight of the banking and financial industries, and she would uphold the dodd-frank act. trump's position on repealing the dodd-frank act is particularly troubling, given such events as wells fargo (wfc) admitting to opening millions of unauthorized credit card accounts for unwitting customers. as with the aca, americans would be better off if congress and the executive branch worked together to improve dodd-frank's protections for consumers, instead of outright repeal.

the siphoning effect. as with association plans, health care advocates worry that inexpensive short-term plans will siphon off healthier patients who feel confident they don't need comprehensive coverage or who can't afford full policies. that will leave individual and exchange insurers covering sicker, more costly patients without the benefit of healthier patients in the insurance-risk pool. the result may be much higher premiums for aca-compliant health plans.

scott gottlieb: yeah. you know, i don't think you can make apples to apples comparisons across these clinical trials. people focused on the fact that the j&j vaccine was seventy-two percent effective in the united states at protecting against moderate to severe disease and the mrna platforms, moderna and pfizer were ninety-five percent protective. and so, you know, there was a presumption that, well, maybe the j&j vaccine isn't as protective. i think that we need to look at what the vaccine is doing. it does appear that the j&j vaccine is inducing what we call a t cell response, meaning that it's protecting against disease. it might not be protecting as well against infection, but it does seem to be protecting very well against moderate to severe covid. and, in fact, in the clinical trial, no patients who received the vaccine were hospitalized or died from-- from covid. and so that's a really good outcome from the clinical trial. we also need to keep in mind that the j&j vaccine is a one dose vaccine. they have a study underway looking at two doses. so, it may well be the case that if you get two doses of that j&j vaccine, which may, eventually, be how we end up using it, it'll be just as protective as the other vaccines. but it's a very good development.

she opened her briefing by talking about the protesters, including some who were armed and entered the capitol building, criticizing some of the attendees. yesterday's scene at the capitol was disturbing, to be quite honest, whitmer said. swastikas and confederate flags, nooses and automatic rifles do not represent who we are as michiganders. whitmer declined to say whether she should remove her name from the list of potential vice presidential nominees, given the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. but she insisted, all of my focus is right here at home in michigan. this is the only place i've ever called home. and this is the place where i always want to be.

there's been tremendous divisiveness -- not in the last year. there's been tremendous divisiveness for many years, he said. i would love to be able to bring back our country into a great form of unity...without a major event where people pull together, that's hard to do. but i'd like to do it without that major event because usually that major event is not a good thing. i would love to do it.
margaret brennan: bernie sanders. can you stop him, in terms of the momentum he has? the bloomberg campaign, as you know, is out saying that for moderates like yourselves, he is going to basically end up with an insurmountable delegate lead because of his early success.
desantis reiterated he would have vetoed a bill signed by republican gov. rick scott three weeks after february's massacre at marjory stoneman douglas high school that raised the age limit to buy a rifle from 18 to 21 and imposed a three-day waiting period on rifle purchases.
paul ryan: i'm saving you time--
senator ben sasse: it has huge downstream implications for shared work together.
margaret brennan: we had this significant decision out of texas on friday with this federal judge striking down obamacare as unconstitutional and you have tweeted, now it's on us and the democratic attorney generals. let's get to work. what does that mean?
i like money and i like trump so i put the two together and i get to go see trump and i get to make a little money, engelskirchea said.
donald trump: no, i'm not gonna take the salary. i'm not taking it.
manchin—a former governor—is well-liked. but he's also a democrat who voted against trump's signature efforts like repealing obamacare and cutting taxes. which is why so many democrats were pulling for blankenship. or as he's known to people who don't follow politics very closely, the china people guy.
margaret brennan: today's washington post makes the observation about president trump that …nearly every organization that he's led in the past decade is under investigation. to help us make sense of where we are in some of those investigations, we're joined now by trevor potter. he is the former chairman of the federal election commission and our cbs news correspondent paula reid, who has been covering the trump investigations. and you have your plateful there, paula, with that description there. first off, i want to let you respond, was there anything there in the defense of michael cohen from lanny davis that stood out to you?
the problem has also seriously alarmed democrats in congress. in recent days, six democrats in the senate -- five of whom are up for re-election next year -- joined onto a bill that would have made the same policy changes to obamacare that mr. obama announced thursday. one of those democrats, however -- sen. joe manchin, d-w.va. -- said the problems with obamacare extend beyond enrollment issues.
employer groups and labor unions are going all out to kill the idea, fearing that taxation will only increase in the future.
the new york board of elections has voted to remove candidates who have suspended their campaigns from the primary ballot on june 23, meaning biden will win all of the 274 pledged delegates, reports cbs news political unit associate producer eleanor watson. the obscure provision allowing the board of elections to do this was entered into the state budget signed by andrew cuomo at the beginning of the month. thousands of sanders supporters signed a petition to keep bernie sanders on so he could amass delegates to influence decisions at the national convention, but that failed to sway the board. the co-chair of the board of elections doug kellner said, i think that it's time for us to recognize that the presidential contest is over. kellner was asked if this means there's no primary, and he said, that's right. joe biden is the only candidate and therefore, he has effectively won the new york primary. in a statement, democratic national committee spokesman david bergstein said any substantive change to a state's first determining step in allocating delegates like this one will need to be reviewed by the dnc's rules and by-laws committee. once the state party submits an updated delegate selection plan, the committee will review that plan and make a determination. bernie 2020 senior adviser jeff weaver also issued a statement, saying today's decision by the state of new york board of elections is an outrage, a blow to american democracy, and must be overturned by the dnc.
at the same time, that does not mean we just flat out open our borders. we can't do that.

they need 51 votes to pass the 142-page measure, which means they need at least 50 senators to support it, with vice president mike pence as the tie-breaking vote. assuming all democrats vote against the bill, more than three republican no votes would kill the legislation. five senate republicans have so far publicly said they oppose the current form: ted cruz of texas, mike lee of utah, rand paul of kentucky, dean heller of nevada and ron johnson of wisconsin. johnson and heller have suggested it will be challenging to persuade them to vote in favor.
sen. sanders: i have no reason not to believe lucy. and- and i think what this speaks to is the need to fundamentally change the culture of this country and to create environments where women feel comfortable and feel safe. and that's something we have got to do.
if you look at bill clinton, far worse. mine are words, and his was action. his was what he's done to women. there's never been anybody in the history politics in this nation that's been so abusive to women. so you can say any way you want to say it, but bill clinton was abusive to women.
miller: we could do so much more--
ramy inocencio: yang min's daughter died, she says, because whistleblowers were muzzled. in state propaganda, only the positive is told. from a new patriotic documentary for the nation to a massive covid exhibition in wuhan. it praises china's president, xi jinping, for victory over the virus. and it is a reality one year later, there has been restoration to society after catastrophe. resumption of movements after isolation, and recovery from tragedy for the city of eleven million on the banks of the yangtze, still looking for answers about covid, now living almost as if it never happened.
lesley stahl: if the supreme court ends this-- obamacare--
mike bloomberg: wall street does not do well with uncertainty. and it's-- the worst thing is nobody knows how bad this is going to get. i can just tell you, in my company, we're splitting in all our big offices into two different buildings, even if it's just a temporary thing. if this flu does strike, and strikes our employees, it won't strike all of them, because we have to continue to provide a service.
maryland's democratic gubernatorial primary race shines light on the struggle for the heart of the democratic party between the progressive and establishment wings. progressive first-time candidate ben jealous, a former naacp president, has been endorsed by potential 2020 hopefuls sens. bernie sanders,i-vermont, kamala harris, d-california, and cory booker, d-new jersey. his main competitor in a crowded field where eight democrats are vying to challenge incumbent republican gov. larry hogan is establishment-backed rushern l. baker iii, a two-term prince george's county executive. jealous and baker are both african american and are hoping to be maryland's first black governor. if progressive jealous wins, it could be a sign for how these potential presidential hopefuls will position themselves and their agendas as they try to unseat president trump in 2020.

mike pence tells lesley stahl, [i]t's probably obvious to people that our styles are different, but i promise you, our vision is exactly the same. and asked whether he could stand up to trump, pence demurred a little, but trump said that if his vice president came and told him he thought he was doing something wrong, he probably wouldn't apologize, but he would very likely listen to him. one topic they don't agree on -- john mccain's valor in the vietnam war.
buttigieg responded to an op-ed in the root calling the millennial mayor a lying m****r****** for his comments on education in a video interview clip that resurfaced from 2011. in the video, buttigieg said that children need to see evidence that pursuing education will come with a reward and a stable life.
america is a nation of builders. we built the empire state building in just one year. isn't it a disgrace that it can now take 10 years just to get a minor permit approved for the building of a simple road? i am asking both parties to come together to give us safe, fast, reliable, and modern infrastructure that our economy needs and our people deserve.
'may the force be with you' came out of medieval christianity, where 'may god go with you' was a symbol that you would be safe. we wanted something as simple as that, an everyday expression that linked to the power of the force that wasn't overbearing.
mccain said her father had designed the funeral to be a bridging and a healing for americans, and she pointed out that both candidates who beat him for president spoke.

margaret brennan: the washington post quoted you this week in a story about afghanistan, saying that back in 2010 you said to richard holbrooke, the then envoy, i'm not sending my boy back there to risk his life on behalf of women's rights. it just won't work. not what we're there for. is that how you remember it?
anonymous donors have pooled together $8 million to pay off college loans for up to 400 students who overcame personal hardships – from homelessness and extreme poverty – to become first-generation college students. the donors are longtime supporters of the bay area nonprofit students rising above (sra), and the money is intended to eliminate student debt for the graduates of the scholarship program. these donors are also passionate about tackling the issue of student debt. on a recent zoom call, sra ceo elizabeth devaney shared the news with the program's alumni and read a short letter from the donors. people lent us a hand and now, we are able to extend a hand to these young people. not to change who they are but to reveal who they are, the letter reads. we believe it is important to leave the world a better place than we came into it. to that end, we have decided to pay off all student loans for the 400 rising star alumni to date. cbs news campaign reporter musadiq bidar says he is one of the 400 alumni benefiting from this generosity. click here to read more about his story and the impact this news will have on other alumni of the scholarship program.
mayor francis suarez: sure, yeah. i've-- i've tried to reach him on multiple occasion to tell him to give us the opportunity, not just here at the city, but in the county, to be able to institute things that we think are common sense, that we think are backed up by science and we can demonstrate are backed up by science. i have a chart that shows demonstrably that masks in public work. thankfully, a lot of our residents are doing it regardless. i think they're, obviously, concerned about their own health. and, certainly, we've been hammering home the point in psas, you know, throughout, you know, the last few months. and i think that's one of the main reasons why our hospitalizations remain low. so i'm very thankful that our residents are listening, despite the fact that it's something that we can't mandate.
senator rick scott: --instead of what the democrats keep doing, is access--
opponents of the affordable care act have been busy. in the midst of several headline-making events on other issues, the trump administration has instigated two major efforts to effectively do what congress could not do earlier this year -- repeal obamacare.
republican political consultant frank luntz held a focus group asked undecided voters to use one word to describe the debate. they used words including improved, civil, an improvement, boring, better and much easier to watch. but only one one person in the focus group said they got what they wanted out of the debate.
mr. trump, who wants to pass a second wave of tax cuts and end birthright citizenship, will find it much harder to accomplish those things legislatively. democrats can quite easily block the president's desired agenda. mr. trump himself admitted the 10 percent tax cuts he wanted for the middle class likely won't happen without republicans at the helm.
based on congressional budget office estimates, repeal would add $193 billion to the federal deficit from 2022-2029, by removing projected revenues off the government's books. the nonpartisan kaiser family foundation expects that about 1 in 5 employers offering health insurance would have at least one insurance plan subject to the tax in 2022, and the share would grow quickly over time.
cooper: ken karpowicz has a question.
barbara harris paramount pictures tony award-winning actress barbara harris (july 25, 1935-august 21, 2018) lent her considerable comic-neurotic charms to the broadway stage and to movies, including robert altman's nashville, alfred hitchcock's family plot, ''freaky friday and a thousand clowns. born in the chicago suburb of evanston, harris was a member of playwrights theatre club (which she joined while still in high school) and the compass players, before forming the inaugural lineup of the improvisation group second city, in 1959. the improvisations were the thing, harris told the los angeles times. it gave you a chance to try. if you died, you really died, but it was a great way to learn. she made her screen debut in 1965 with a thousand clowns, then got back-to-back tony nominations in 1966 and 1967 for two hit broadway musicals: on a clear day you can see forever and the apple tree, for which she won. harris also earned an academy award nomination as best supporting actress in the 1971 film who is harry kellerman and why is he saying those terrible things about me? other film credits included the seduction of joe tynan, peggy sue got married, dirty rotten scoundrels and grosse point blank. in later years she decamped for arizona where she taught acting, telling the phoenix new times in 2002, i used to try to get through one film a year, but i always chose movies that i thought would fail, so that i wouldn't have to deal with the fame thing.
instead of instead of, you know, essentially reading excerpts and saying, do you remember saying that? which seemed to be all for the purpose of trying to catch him in something that could be called a lie. but, again, because the fbi knew about the call, there was nothing wrong with the call, the fbi has the transcript of the call, whether or not he remembered saying something is not material to anything.
margaret brennan: but is she going to get in?
right now, roughly 30 house republicans are driving the bus in washington. along with sen. ted cruz, they have been the titanium backbone, as rep. marsha blackburn likes to call it, in the effort to defund obamacare. they have stood their ground and helped bring the government to a halt. this is either an act of lunacy or a shining example of standing for conservative principle.

after the election? okay. you talk about the importance of timing in this decision. what was the evidence that helped you decide this issue?
with about 71% of the results released by the iowa democratic party, pete buttigieg just ahead of bernie sanders and elizabeth warren also leading biden. while in new hampshire, where next week's first-in-the-nation primary will be held, biden also went after the top two candidates by name in his remarks, a tactic he has rarely used on the campaign trail.
lesley stahl: dr. fauci. you know the president said that he's a disaster, and he and the-- other public health officials around him are idiots. do you care to comment on that?
a major part of president trump's 2016 platform was focused on american manufacturing and trade deals that he argues cost american jobs. biden, though, accused the president of breaking his promises, including a pledge from mr. trump in warren in 2016 that no plants would close if he was elected.
margaret brennan: one of the things that makes sanders, you know, a candidate who is controversial, you know, certainly starkly in contrast to joe biden and what he describes there is also some of his rhetoric. he tweeted and got some guff for it this week, i've got news for the republican establishment. i've got news for the democratic establishment. they can't stop us. that was seen as not a message of unity for the party but one of this is an insurgency--
john mccain brian snyder/reuters he was an american hero and a maverick. by most standards, arizona senator john mccain (august 29, 1936-august 25, 2018) was a man of courage and zealously-guarded ideals. the son and grandson of four-star navy admirals, mccain was a rebellious student who, by his own volition, didn't conform to the rules and regulations of either high school or the naval academy. nevertheless, he volunteered for combat duty during the vietnam war, and was shot down during a bombing mission. severely injured, mccain was captured and held at the so-called hanoi hilton, enduring torture and frequent beatings. he remained in captivity for five-and-a-half years, rejecting an early release when he refused to leave his fellow pows behind. in 1982, he took his fighting spirit to washington, as a congressman and later senator, standing out for his straight talk, especially on subjects like campaign finance and climate change. he ran for president in 2000, and again in 2008, when he won the republican nomination to run against senator barack obama. one of the most forceful voices in the senate, where he led the armed services committee, he wasn't afraid to buck his own party, voting last year against the republicans' attempt to kill obamacare. i was raised in the concept and belief that duty, honor, country is the lodestar for the behavior that we have to exhibit every single day, he told cbs news.
a month before the end of obamacare's open enrollment period, 4.2 million americans - 25 percent of whom were between the ages of 18 and 34 - signed up for coverage through the new health care marketplaces, health and human services secretary kathleen sebelius announced tuesday. the numbers lag behind the administration's original hopes for the program, but officials said the administration expects millions more to sign up before the march 31 deadline.

there are several options, not easy to sort through. some have application deadlines; others do not. and the trump administration, which still plans to ask the supreme court later this summer to declare obamacare unconstitutional, is doing little to promote the health law's coverage. here's a quick look:
9:55 p.m. donald trump says hillary clinton deleted 33,000 emails after receiving a subpoena from congress.
both bagley and levitt said their questions about the administration's intentions arose from language in the justice department brief that specifically singles out sections of the health law that apply to employer plans. the aca strengthened previous protections already in federal law that limited the circumstances and length of time under which an employer could exclude coverage for a worker's pre-existing health problems.

separately, senior republicans in congress are wasting no time in trying to distance themselves from any effort by the administration to undermine popular protections for their constituents. democrats are accusing republicans of yet another effort to sabotage coverage, and plan to take the issue into the fall midterm elections.
on wednesday, vp pence will travel to orlando, florida, where he will meet with governor ron desantis to discuss the state's reopening. pence will also deliver personal protective equipment to a nursing home as part of an initiative to deliver ppe to more than 15,000 nursing homes across america.
biden flatly denied reade's accusation in an interview on msnbc on friday morning, calling upon the national archives to release documents relevant to her allegation.
john mccain: personal? sure. i'd be glad to converse with him. but i also understand that we're very different people. different upbringing. different life experiences.
we have more work to do to finish our long fight to provide universal, quality, affordable health care to everyone in america, clinton said in the statement. already, the affordable care act has expanded coverage to 20 million americans. as president, i will make sure republicans never succeed in their attempts to strip away their care and that the remaining uninsured should be able to get the affordable coverage they need to stay healthy.
after a rally at the south hills country club here, santorum asked republicans to pick any other republican in the country than gop presidential front-runner romney, based on issues that make the former massachusetts governor uniquely disqualified to run against obama.
as joe biden settles into the role of the presumptive nominee for the democratic party, cbs news campaign reporters tim perry and lacrai mitchell report that some are calling on the former vice president to choose a woman of color as his running mate, while others are specifically hoping a black woman will fill the position. conversations with more than a dozen black women in congress and black women political leaders and activists in battleground states revealed this sentiment: it's past time for women of color and particularly black women to be seriously considered for top positions like the role of vice president.

in july, california small business owner stephanie mufson wasn't sure if her company parade guys, which builds floats and large displays for outdoors festivals, would make it. she's an independent artist and typically works with a team of contractors who are experts at painting, sculpting, and building floats for outdoors festivals and parades in the san francisco bay area.
in the end, roberts sided with the liberals, a decision some court observers have attributed in part to concern about public perceptions of the court and the chief justice's desire to be seen as above the political fray.
last week, buttigieg criticized biden as a d.c. insider, an attack biden attempted to rebut on wednesday. the former vice president ticked off a list of accomplishments from his decades in the federal government, including his working passing both obamacare and the recovery act as vice president. is he really saying the obama-biden administration was a failure? biden asked. pete, just say it out loud. the former vice president then seemed to compare his long political resume to buttigieg's. i have great respect for mayor pete and his service to this nation. but i do believe it's a risk – to be just straight up with you – for this party and to nominate someone who's never held an office higher than mayor of a town of 100,000 people in indiana.
i think there are lots of people who are really – they are pretty happy with their private insurance, so the way to go at this is a buy into medicare, no matter what age you are, slotkin said.
in other cases, it's less well understood that failure is the reason for the government to regulate a market, or even provide the goods and services itself. social security and health care come to mind. but once again, the private sector's failure to deliver these goods at the lowest possible price, or to deliver them at all, is at the heart of the government's involvement in these markets.
in 2017, the south carolina veteran suicide rate was significantly higher than the national suicide rate. charleston native stephanie hammond is an air force veteran and says she loved that harris chose to unveil the plan in her home state. i think that that's what's needed, said hammond. being a veteran myself and knowing other veterans that have come back and are dealing with some mental health issues, the unveiling of the plan is welcome in my eyes as a veteran, as well as...for the veterans that i served with, and veterans that are suffering from some mental health illnesses.

verma deflected questions with off-topic responses in which she stressed the cost-savings the trump administration has achieved, the flexibility it has given health care providers and consumers, and the lack of affordability in premiums. at one point, she argued that people don't really have protections for preexisting conditions because they can't afford to buy health insurance in the first place.
the white house held a hastily-arranged conference call with reporters sunday evening to explain the president's extreme vetting executive order issued friday, after visa holders from countries included in the order were detained at u.s. airports this weekend.
the 53-year-old kavanaugh's long march through conservative legal circles was not without its setbacks. after leading the investigation into the suicide of clinton lawyer vince foster, kavanaugh lost his one and only case before the supreme court in 1995 in an attempt to get access to notes exchanged between foster and his attorney.

and on capitol hill, senate democrats, including sens. debbie stabenow and tammy baldwin who are facing re-election this fall, held a hearing with americans they say would be at risk of losing health coverage due to pre-existing conditions if mr. trump and republicans succeed at repealing the aca.
trump's website states that he would bring more competition to prescription drug pricing. in the primary, trump opposed cuts to medicare, although this position conflicts with the republicans' official platform position. trump's support for repealing the aca could undo some features that save costs for the medicare system.
donald trump is desperate to bend this -- to pin the socialist label of socialist, socialist, socialist, on our party. we can't let him do that, biden said, adding that the vermont senator a good man. sanders and his campaign in the past month have regularly criticized biden's long senate record including his vote in favor of the iraq war and previous openness to negotiate cuts to social security in order to balance the federal budget. biden then shifted his focus to another leading contender in the race, pete buttigieg, the former mayor of south bend.
it's amazing to me that judge barrett has publicly criticized the decision by chief justice roberts that upheld the constitutionality of the aca and that president trump is making it clear a vote for judge barrett to be on the supreme court is a vote to repeal the aca and take away health care protection from a majority of americans during a pandemic, coons said.

other add-ons include a seven-year extension of the export-import bank and a renewal of the government's terrorism risk insurance program. the spending package also extends the government's flood insurance program, as well as several visa programs for skilled and seasonal workers.
the trump budget provides more funding to address the opioid abuse epidemic, including the $3 billion congress already approved for fiscal year 2018 and $10 billion for fiscal 2019. although the budget has some back and forth about which government offices will actual oversee efforts to combat opioid abuse, the plan offers other details about how the administration would approach the problem.
you have blocking services like ours that are really reaching scale, and more and more carriers are rolling out tools to block the calls or at least make their customers aware of the type of call that's coming in, he said. there's higher volume because the scammers can't get through, so they have to call again.
often times, that data is derived from or ever prepared by the u.s. digital service, usds administrator matt cutts told cbs news' major garrett. we've got folks slotted in at all kinds of places from the va to cms, the center for medicare and medicaid services.
added julie bataille, a spokeswoman for the centers for medicare & medicaid services, we are confident millions more americans will continue to enroll. bataille declined to say, however, whether the administration still expects to reach its initial goal of getting 7 million obamacare enrollees this year. the total number of enrollees grew by about 900,000 between the end of january (3.3 million) and the end of february (4.2 million). bataille declined to say, however, whether the administration still expects to reach its initial goal of getting 7 million obamacare enrollees this year. the total number of enrollees grew by about 900,000 between the end of january (3.3 million) and the end of february (4.2 million).
donald trump: for certain areas i would, but certain areas, a wall is more appropriate. i'm very good at this, it's called construction.
but mcgahn said democrats' assumptions that barrett would vote to overturn roe and strike down obamacare are not fair assumptions one way or the other.
in a preview of the 2019 budget, the white house on sunday focused on trump's $1.5 trillion plan for the nation's crumbling infrastructure. he also will ask for a $13 billion increase over two years for opioid prevention, treatment and long-term recovery. a request of $23 billion for border security, including $18 billion for a wall along the u.s.-mexico border and money for more detention beds for detained immigrants, is part of the budget, too.
sanders called it an unfortunate statement.
lesley stahl: not at all. same person?
lawmakers are also watching the changing provisions of the law -- and its changing pricetag -- to monitor its success.
both azar and verma have powerful allies in the administration. azar is close to white house counsel pat cipollone and attorney general bill barr, while verma, who oversaw indiana's medicaid program, has close ties to vice president pence.
on its face, this argument is ridiculous. soros has given hundreds of millions of dollars for causes conservatives oppose. criticizing him is no more anti-semitic than criticizing the libertarian koch brothers for funding americans for prosperity is anti….well, whatever religion they are. tom steyer is a prominent liberal bankroller who's an episcopalian but whose father was a non-practicing jew. he's spending millions trying to help democrats take over the house and is believed to be considering a 2020 run from his party's left flank. do republicans really need a religious reason to criticize him?
sen. klobuchar: i think- i- i- i think- i'm thinking the issues you're focused here on, for instance, medicare for all- and i want universal health care, i just got a different way to get there. and as i said in the debate, i don't think that we should take away people's right to their private insurance and kick half of america off of their private insurance. i think there is a better way to do this and that strengthening obamacare, taking on the pharmaceuticals. on free college for all, i made it very clear, i want to expand pell grants, make it easier for kids to go to college. but i don't think- and that's what some of these plans do, that we should be using taxpayer money to finance rich kids to go to college. many of our public universities, something like 10 percent of the kids come from families that make over 200,000 dollars a year.
joe biden's campaign on thursday aimed to push a middle-class centered economic message ahead of the candidate's drive-in town hall in scranton, pennsylvania, on cnn. asked about biden's insistence last week that he would raise corporate taxes on day one of his presidency, campaign policy director stef feldman explained, i think what the vice president was being clear about the fact that he has no patience for people who say that we do not have the capacity to make sure that the super wealthy and corporations pay their fair share. cbs news campaign reporter bo erickson notes conservatives have questioned biden's willingness to raise taxes at all if elected, as the economy tries to rebound from the brunt of the pandemic. in addition to raising the corporate tax rate back to 28%, biden hopes to increase individual taxes for americans making more than $400,000. if enacted, biden's proposed tax increases would be the fifth largest tax increase since the 1940s, according to a nonpartisan tax foundation analysis. and late on thursday, biden along with wife jill, wished a happy new year to jewish americans celebrating rosh hashanah. during the virtual event, biden quipped, the rabbis and i have been learning the same skills recently: how to sermonize over zoom.
congressman tom price will be a great secretary of health and human services.he is the right leader to help congress replace obamacare. — newt gingrich (@newtgingrich) november 29, 2016
in addition, there were 35,000 applications with unresolved questions involving matching social security numbers, which represented $154 million in subsidies for insurance premiums.
lesley stahl: with that in mind, what do you think about your running mate's campaign and the tone and the negativity of it?
there isn't a religious test for service in the government, whether it's in the senate or on the supreme court, he said. what should be raised is her opinions, her speeches, her public statements as a professor and a judge, and whether or not she will uphold precedent.

dr. anthony fauci, m.d. (chief medical adviser to president biden): this is a wakeup call to all of us. we will continue to see the evolution of mutants.
young patriots, like preston, teach all of us about our civic duty as americans. and i met preston a little while ago, and he is something very special -- that i can tell you. great future. thank you very much for all you've done, preston. thank you very much.
with its funds, the group is looking to help boost both incumbents and candidates. on tuesday it endorsed one house democrat challenger, 11 house democrat incumbent frontliners and two senate candidates: barbara bollier in kansas and theresa greenfield in iowa.
but the 3rd u.s. circuit court of appeals sided with the city and found it did not treat catholic social services worse than it would have treated another organization that didn't work with same-sex couples but had different religious beliefs.
he later had solo success with hearts and atlanta lady – and he returned to his folk roots, playing as part of an acoustic trio.
mr. trump said friday he has seen the tape of ahmaud arbery, a 25-year-old black man who was shot while jogging in brunswick, georgia. the georgia bureau of investigation arrested a father and son on thursday, charging them with arbery's murder and aggravated assault. mr. trump called the tape heartbreaking, adding that he has seen pictures of arbery. you know, my heart goes out to the parents and the family and friends, mr. trump said. yet we have to take it – law enforcement is going to look at it and they have a good governor in the state. the president did not indicate federal law enforcement are involved in the case at this time.
if you are saying that the president of the united states has abused his office, if you are suggesting that he's doing things that are clearly impeachable, but then you say, well, but let's not talk about impeachment, that creates an unreality to the discourse, says john nichols of the nation. and i think, frankly, it's not appropriate.
john dickerson: unable to get past it--
senate minority leader chuck schumer, d-new york, also called it a positive development.
donald trump: yeah, some of the election locations are. some of the system is. i hated--
first of all, he has his communication style, but you're not hearing me defend that, haley said. what i will tell you is, if there is anything that he communicates in a way that i'm uncomfortable with, i pick up the phone and call him. i don't need to be public about that. i think that's a private conversation that should happen when i feel it, and i think it's one that he's receptive to when i do.
the race for the gop nomination for mississippi governor is going into a runoff, after mississippi lieutenant governor tate reeves fell short of the 50 percent majority needed in tuesday's primary to advance to the general election. in the aug. 27 runoff election, he'll face former state supreme court chief justice bill waller jr., who received 33 percent of the vote.
tuesday, june 12 will be primary day in five states: maine, nevada, north dakota, south carolina and virginia. there is not really a marquee primary race on tuesday that should dramatically affect the outcome of the midterms, but many of these seats will be critical in the fight for control of the house and senate in november's general election.
the move to start in the southwestern state comes as bloomberg has hinted that he will not compete in other early states like iowa and new hampshire. arizona has also been a focus of priorities usa, a democratic super pac, who said they would include latinos in arizona and florida as part of their 2020 voter mobilization.
mr. trump nominated barrett for the supreme court on saturday, kicking off what is sure to be an intense, partisan confirmation battle in the senate just weeks before november's election.
trump: no, it hasn't. it hasn't. and it hasn't been finished at all.

good morning and welcome to face the nation. it was a big win for senator bernie sanders in yesterday's nevada caucuses with half of the precincts reporting he stands at forty-seven percent. well behind him is former vice president joe biden with nineteen percent, followed by former south bend mayor pete buttigieg with fifteen. massachusetts senator elizabeth warren stands at ten percent followed by amy klobuchar with five percent. and tom steyer with four percent. cbs news elections and surveys director anthony salvanto is here to tell us more. anthony, what is behind the senator's decisive win?
margaret brennan: all that and more, is just ahead on face the nation.
warren sits in macomb county, home to many white working class voters who backed president trump in 2016. but while mr. trump won the county by 11.5 points in 2016, michigan's democratic governor gretchen whitmer won the county by 3.5 points during her 2018 election. winning in macomb county, which is considered the home of reagan democrats, has often been predictive of statewide success. since 2006, every gubernatorial candidate and presidential candidate who has won statewide carried macomb county. that's four wins for democrats and three wins for republicans in the past seven statewide elections.
it includes a permanent funding fix for retired coal miners' health benefits, the senior aide said, as well as $295 million for puerto rico's medicaid shortfall. there are no funding cuts to planned parenthood in the package, the aide added, and it would restore year-round pell grants.
justice roberts and a conservative court has already ruled that the affordable care act is constitutional, klobuchar said, saying the supreme court is unlikely to uphold the judge's ruling, which was issued on friday. there are things to do, but we should be working to improve the affordable care act, not just throw it out and set it on fire.
margaret brennan: and this is his last best chance to get a border wall before democrats take the majority?
in her remarks thursday, ivanka trump told a story about the times trump has worked to help others, even people he didn't know.
douglas rain stratford festival; mgm/warner brothers i am putting myself to the fullest possible use, which is all i think that any conscious entity can ever hope to do. the voice of hal 9000, the murderous computer at the heart of the spacecraft discovery in stanley kubrick's landmark 2001: a space odyssey, was provided by canadian actor douglas rain (march 13, 1928-november 11, 2018). a former student at the bristol old vic theatre school in london, he was head of the english acting section of the national theatre school of canada and a founding member of the stratford festival, in ontario, where he spent 32 seasons performing shakespeare. he was nominated for a tony award in 1972 for his role as william cecil in vivat! vivat! regina! but his most indelible role came as a result of narrating a 1960 national film board of canada short, universe, the visual effects of which had inspired kubrick. the director turned to rain to voice his on-board computer, after deciding the recorded performance by martin balsam was too emotional. a supposedly perfect artificial intelligence who covers up a mistake by attributing it to human error, and whose dialogue drips with irony, hal murders the ship's crew members before he is lobotomized by the mission's sole survivor, david bowman (played by keir dullea). rain was chillingly neutral, whether talking about chess or locking an astronaut outside the ship.
margaret brennan: and i think many would agree with you, i guess it's the getting to that point that's the problem. senator schumer says no way, no how, no wall. period.
so, yes, this is who donald trump is. but it's not only women, and it's not only this video that raises questions about his fitness to be our president, because he has also targeted immigrants, african- americans, latinos, people with disabilities, pows, muslims, and so many others.
meanwhile, republican election officials are also urging people to vote-by-mail. last week, the georgia republican secretary of state's office sent out a press release encouraging absentee ballot voting. nevada's plan to hold an all-mail primary on june 9 was also announced by its republican secretary of state. and in kentucky, the republican secretary of state mailed all registered voters postcards explaining their options for the upcoming june 23 primary, including absentee voting by mail. he's been promoting the portal to request an absentee ballot online, as has the kentucky republican party on twitter, ahead of tuesday's deadline.
john mccain: oh, yeah. i think about ted a lot. ted stayed at his job, kept working. kept going even when he was in a wheelchair. and he never gave up because he loved the engagement.
the ad, which is a six-figure buy running on detroit broadcasts, concludes with slotkin criticizing bishop for his vote to repeal the affordable care act (aca), also known as obamacare.
with the supreme court ruling the trump administration's exemptions can remain intact, between 70,000 and 126,000 women risk losing access to employer-provided contraceptive coverage, according to government estimates.
should the health care law be found unconstitutional by the supreme court, those 20 million people buying health insurance on the individual market would almost certainly see aca protections go away, including the following:
in a press release, larose's office noted that absentee ballot applications did not surpass one million until 28 days before the 2016 election. in a statement, larose said that the high number of applications shows that ohioans trust the state's election infrastructure.
major garrett digs into the politics and process of passing the american rescue plan, and tries to answer the question, $2 trillion for what?
clinton's interview, her first since trump announced his running mate, took place at a campaign stop in cincinnati, and it comes just days before trump is set to be nominated by the republican party at its convention in cleveland. the presumptive democratic nominee has previously and persistently characterized trump as temperamentally unfit to do the job of president, and cast his proposals as dangerous and his style of campaigning as divisive. but her comments to rose on monday went one step further. -- cbs news' hannah fraser-chanpong.
cooper: we've got a question over here from james carter. mr. carter?
i got it done in the first 100 days, that's even nice, he said.
pence dodged multiple questions on the topic from fox news' john roberts, so much so that the president complimented pence on speaking for five minutes without touching roberts' question. there were 27.5 million uninsured americans in 2018.
cindy mccain: i'm still in disbelief that this actually has happened. and then i think, you know, cancer chose the wrong guy. 'cause there-- it's not gonna happen here.
shares of health insurers and hospitals slumped after a federal judge in texas ruled that the 2010 affordable care act is unconstitutional. hospital operator hca dropped 2.5, while health insurer unitedhealth lost 1.9 percent. centene, a health insurer that focuses on medicaid and the affordable care act's individual health insurance exchanges, also lost ground.
price also acknowledged that the aca has had some benefits, saying that the coverage has certainly improved.
larry levitt, executive vice president of kaiser family foundation, said the president's vision is something of a mirage.
former president barack obama headlined a rally in las vegas with jacky rosen, the democratic candidate for senate, and other nevada democrats. he told the roaring crowd to remember who started the current trend of economic growth and the longest streak of job creation on record.
after winning reelection in november 2016 -- the same time mr. trump unexpectedly won the presidency -- inslee declared that washington was, is and will always be a beacon for progressive values. during his second term, inslee has been a frequent cable news critic of the president and, with the help of the state's attorney general, bob ferguson, has challenged some of the trump administration's policies, including the travel ban, through high-profile lawsuits. in a campaign video focused on climate change, inslee announced his white house bid on march 1. issues inslee will make climate change the top issue of his 2020 campaign, hoping to draw sharp contrasts with the environmental policies of mr. trump, who has repeatedly cast doubt on human-induced climate change, and even called it a chinese hoax. he has been an ardent backer of sweeping federal action to mitigate the irreparable harm climate change is having on the global environment since his days in congress. with most 2020 democrats throwing their support for the audacious green new deal proposal introduced by new york rep. alexandria ocasio-cortez, inslee's focus on climate change has the potential to gain traction among democratic primary voters and prompt fellow contenders to discuss the issue even more during the nomination process. inslee is also likely on the campaign trail to tout the growing economy in his deep-blue state, his role in the passage of a net neutrality bill and what he called the best paid family leave and one of the best minimum wages in the country.
margaret brennan: you're watching all of this.
but, you know, let's talk about what's really going on here, martha, because our intelligence community just came out and said in the last few days that the kremlin, meaning putin and the russian government, are directing the attacks, the hacking on american accounts to influence our election. and wikileaks is part of that, as are other sites where the russians hack information, we don't even know if it's accurate information, and then they put it out.
paul ryan: yes. well, i'm not having fun in a government shutdown. i like to get back to work and make sure that we don't defund chip and-- and stop funding our troops.
clinton: ... go to hillaryclinton.com and you can see it.
lesley stahl: now you have the same cancer that ted kennedy had. does what he experienced go through your mind? is it--
tariffs and trade are finding their way into the elections, too. though the white house renegotiated a trade agreement to replace the north american free trade agreement, or nafta, congress must approve it — something that becomes less certain with a democratic-controlled house in january. and the effects of mr. trump's already imposed and threatened tariffs on steel and aluminum, cars and trucks, and goods from china are seeping into corporate finances large and small. millions of jobs are at stake, and prices are rising for consumer goods from autos to food to televisions.
clinton: he never apologized to mr. and mrs. khan, the gold star family whose son, captain khan, died in the line of duty in iraq. and donald insulted and attacked them for weeks over their religion.
after unveiling an all-male economic advisory council last week stocked with billionaires and business acquaintances, donald trump is adding another nine members. this time around, eight of them are female.
i want-- when i leave, that the ceremony is at the naval academy. and we just have a couple of people that stand up and say, 'this guy, he served his country.'
at a time when we must heal the heart of our democracy and renew our commitment to the common good, i stand before you as the granddaughter of an iron ore miner, as the daughter of a teacher and a newspaperman, as the first woman elected to the united states senate from the state of minnesota, to announce my candidacy for president of the united states, she told supporters braving frigid temperatures and relentless snowfall at an outdoor rally along the mississippi river in minneapolis.
caitlin huey-burns: and i think when you look at the two, biden and buttigieg, this boomlet that he is having shows that there is no front-runner in this democratic field. it's pretty amazing that you have a former vice president, a popular former vice president, who hasn't cleared the field. and you're seeing other candidates, bernie sanders among them, beto o'rourke, raising vast sums of money on a grassroots level. and it allows for some of these other candidates, lesser known, to try to make an impact that way because there is no clear front-runner and voters are trying to assess. we'll get a better idea of that with the fund-raising numbers that are coming out, especially as the party is very much focused on these small dollar donations.
in wisconsin, incumbent democratic senator tammy baldwin is running for re-election. she will run in the general election against state senator leah vukmir or veteran and first-time candidate kevin nicholson. baldwin is one of 10 democratic u.s. senators trying to defend their seats in states that trump won in 2016. hillary clinton expected to win the state, but according to the new york times' count, mr. trump won the state by just 27,000 voters. the times went on to point out that turnout in the lowest-income neighborhoods had dropped dramatically -- 19.5 percent from 2012.
melania trump: well, sometimes he-- it got him in trouble. but it helped a lot as well. he had unbelievable following.
vehement resistance from foes. to the ire of liberal opponents, the nominee has a long record of combating government regulation, a $15 minimum wage and obamacare. our system lacks any meaningful mechanism for tracking the cost of regulations, puzder said in congressional testimony in 2012, and balancing that against the need for businesses to use their profits to expand, grow and thereby create jobs.
raddatz: and really, the audience needs to calm down here.
jamelle bouie (the new york times/@jbouie/cbs news political analyst): right. one interesting thing about sanders this time around versus 2016 is how he has sort in the-- in the interim really developed foreign policy ideas, really put himself out there as someone who was trying to lead the democratic field on foreign policy specifically an agenda that treats authoritarian regimes, global kleptocracy, all these things as part of a singular challenge for the united states to face, but threatens global stability and american democracy and it's--
clinton: i would not use american ground forces in syria. i think that would be a very serious mistake. i don't think american troops should be holding territory, which is what they would have to do as an occupying force. i don't think that is a smart strategy.
both tried to dismiss their previous statements and emphasize their current stance of wanting to secure the nation's southern border before any other actions are taken to address immigrants living in the country illegally.

last month on face the nation, in response to the latest gas attack in syria (believed carried out by russian-backed forces), she announced:
when cruz first moved to texas to be with her then-solicitor general husband, she struggled with a bout of depression.
i completely get how upsetting this could be for a lot of americans, particularly after assurances they heard from me, mr. obama said from the white house briefing room. to those americans, i hear you loud and clear.
cruz, in his comments to reporters, later lamented how unproductive congress had been under boehner's leadership, ticking off a number of conservative policy positions that were never passed while boehner was house speaker.
it's deplorable what he said. that's what i called it from the floor of the senate seven months ago, the georgia senator said during the interview, adding that said the president's weekend comments showed a lack of respect for mccain's service. however, he expressed opposition to naming the russel senate office building after mccain, saying that the proposal by senate minority leader chuck schumer to do so was playing politics.

democrats should be pounding home the message that they're the ones who will protect health care coverage for americans and pushing back on disingenuous claims by republicans that they'll protect people with pre-existing conditions. the latest cbs news polling illustrates this point. in florida, arizona, and indiana, where the u.s. senate races remain hotly contested, voters say health care tops their concerns, and protections for pre-existing conditions are a specific factor in determining which party they'll support. voters want to know they're not one illness away from bankruptcy.
well, i said we're gonna get to the bottom of what happened.
we spoke to a group of democratic congresswomen, veterans and freshmen, to ask how she wields her power.
speaker nancy pelosi: well, i think that it--
his vision is called the america first health care plan. the president said the three pillars of his vision are more choice for health care options, lower costs for families and seniors and better care for american patients.
and when republicans see president trump blamed as the sole cause for america's ills, many of them think buddy, i know exactly how you feel.
park worries that with funding for only six years, the chip program will go through this all over again. chip has always been a bipartisan program with widespread support, he said. now that it has become a partisan tool, we wonder about the long-term prospects for the program. next time it comes up for renewal, it may not just be a matter of, 'let's get this done because everyone supports it.'
to launch our national rebuilding, i will be asking the congress to approve legislation that produces a $1 trillion investment in the infrastructure of the united states – financed through both public and private capital – creating millions of new jobs, mr. trump said tuesday night.
susan page: so this was the editorial page ran an op-ed, not the news site. i thought it was good that we gave the president a platform, the arguments he is making in-- in rallies and as he campaigns for candidates in the midterms. there was a big furor because it was not a fact-- there wasn't a fact check article that went with it and provided context and information for readers. i thought that was a legitimate criticism. i am glad that we, eventually, posted a fact checked about it. it's does show how much-- how inflammatory president trump is for both sides. and how much he defines this midterm election that we're going to see in just three weeks.
arguments scheduled for the month of october will follow the same format used for telephonic arguments held in may, in which the typical free-for-all of questioning was replaced by the justices pressing attorneys one by one in order of seniority. chief justice john roberts will kick off questioning, followed by justices clarence thomas and ruth bader ginsburg, and ending with justice brett kavanaugh, the court's newest member.
margaret brennan: trevor, in an op-ed this week, you say that the president could become the target of a very serious campaign finance investigation--a criminal one. one of the defenders of the president say, this-- this is small ball. this isn't something that actually gets-- while it gets to the doorstep of the president, it doesn't actually become something that could really become a legal issue for him. why do you disagree?
in another interview with cnn, manafort called it crazy to think that trump would be cribbing michelle obama's words.
a third approach also is possible, which has been tried without much success. that's sponsoring high-risk medical plans with higher premiums to reflect the increased risk for people with preexisting conditions. predictably, enrollment in such plans has been low because the premiums are often out of reach for the target audience (see below).
john culberson's on the house appropriations committee. he has secured funding, and we can't change horses in the middle of the race, she said.
other top trump allies, notably campaign manager kellyanne conway, have launched a highly unusual public campaign to warn the president-elect that nominating romney would be seen as a betrayal by his supporters. conway's comments stirred speculation that she is seeking to either force trump's hand or give him cover for ultimately passing over romney.
congress shut down the government for almost two weeks in 2013—part of an astonishing string of budget battles that involved the democratic-controlled senate simply refusing to pass a budget for four years—even in 2009-10 when democrats had total control of congress. in 2012, harry reid's senate voted down president obama's budget proposal 97-0(!) the most basic task of congress is collecting taxes and funding the government, and it's been an unseemly mess for at least a decade.
for some south carolinians, kasich's strong finish in new hampshire is inspiring them to jump on board.
if we weren't able to repeal and replace obamacare, it would have been a bad midterm for us. i think we will hold our own, if not pick up seats, he told reporters.
in the case before the supreme court, texas and other conservative-led states argue that the aca was essentially rendered unconstitutional after congress passed tax legislation in 2017 that eliminated the law's unpopular fines for not having health insurance but left in place its requirement that virtually all americans have coverage.
there may not be a federal action to reopen the marketplaces, but 11 states and the district of columbia have established an extended special health insurance enrollment window for those impacted by the coronavirus pandemic. the 11 states are california, colorado, connecticut, maryland, massachusetts, minnesota, nevada, new york, rhode island, vermont and washington. all these states control their own marketplaces.
the former president is campaigning as democrats try to build enthusiasm among young people and minority voters and avoid a repeat of the 2014 midterms, when democratic turnout faltered.
in those closed door meetings, gop leaders are arguing that any other approach would result in millions of people losing the ability to afford insurance and republicans getting the blame.
before mcdermott could finish his question, desantis interrupted and said horowitz's controversial statements had been uttered before he attended the conference. the moderator corrected him, and desantis interjected angrily, well how the hell am i supposed to know every single statement somebody makes?
joe biden: not that i'm aware of.
as president trump has vowed that the republican party will be the party of health care, five democratic committee chairmen are demanding that administration officials turn over documents and information related to the justice department's decision to stop defending the entirety of the affordable care act (aca) in court.
the defense budget has certainly increased under mr. trump, although that doesn't necessarily equal a stronger military. the pentagon failed its first-ever audit released in november 2018, although then-deputy defense secretary patrick shanahan said at the time the pentagon never expected to pass it.
the inspector general estimated that the government spent nearly $1.2 million on price's travel during his seven months in office. that included more than $700,000 in military flights on two foreign and two domestic trips, as well as more than $480,000 for various domestic trips by private chartered aircraft.
stephen miller: --a flawed law-- a flawed law would be off the books. and this president working with members of both parties would be able to replace it with something that not only expands choice, expands competition, enshrines purchasing across state lines, but also protects preexisting conditions in a much better way than the current law does.
a bigger government is not something they want to run on, gop pollster jon mchenry said of democrats.
in a proclamation released before the event, mr. trump said on thursday we join together to offer gratitude for our many blessings and to acknowledge our need for divine wisdom, guidance, and protection.
on cbs' the late show with stephen colbert, liberal celebrity and activist michael moore says it's time to get rid of the electoral college.
the court denied a request by 20 mainly democratic states and the democratic-led house of representatives to decide quickly on a lower-court ruling that declared part of the statute unconstitutional and cast a cloud over the rest.
according to the u.s. chamber of commerce, $1.1 billion worth of indiana exports and 812,000 indiana jobs are threatened by the trade war. in july, the trump administration hit chinese imports with some $34 billion in tariffs. china retaliated with a 25 percent on u.s. agricultural products, including soybeans and corn. the second round of tariffs, totaling $16 billion, went into effect on aug. 23.

we have an increase in murder within our cities, the biggest in 45 years. we have a divided nation, because people like her — and believe me, she has tremendous hate in her heart. and when she said deplorables, she meant it. and when she said irredeemable, they're irredeemable, you didn't mention that, but when she said they're irredeemable, to me that might have been even worse.

the new rules aren't a surprise. the trump administration has been calling for the expansion of association health plans as a way of offering more options outside of obamacare and a way for small businesses and individuals to have access to more affordable group insurance.
that was the slot that the obamacare approach was to take. and like i say, 20 million people now have health insurance. so if we just rip it up and throw it away, what donald's not telling you is we just turn it back to the insurance companies the way it used to be, and that means the insurance companies...

in the roiling debate among republicans between principle and pragmatism, the governors are weighing in. jindal was in town to start the launch of a new ad campaign touting the success of the gop brand in the states. republican governors are driving america's comeback is the tagline. their intent is to highlight their solutions-oriented records and get themselves re-elected. in this cause, they are clearly using sen. cruz and house republicans as a foil. when jindal says, we are not the party of no, the first thing that comes to mind is the group that has become associated with that phrase: republicans in congress.
democracy grinds to a halt without a willingness to compromise; or when even basic facts are contested, and we listen only to those who agree with us, the president said, in a clear repudiation of the republican party's 2016 front runner, donald trump. our public life withers when only the most extreme voices get attention.

tuesday is the third and final day of the 2020 eid al-fitr celebrations. this weekend, muslim communities across the country resorted to new ways to celebrate the holiday marking the end of the holy month of ramadan, reports cbs news campaign reporter musadiq bidar. the three-day holiday after a month of fasting from dawn to sunset is traditionally one that brings families and friends together for large and intimate gatherings, but this year, muslims relied on zoom calls, live-stream sermons and drive-through celebrations. typically, muslims gather at the mosque on the first morning of eid, which was on sunday, for prayers and a sermon. the rest of the day is spent visiting relatives, exchanging gifts — usually cash handouts referred to as eidi — and hosting food parties. the adjustments the muslim community had to make for this cultural and religious holiday might prove as a test run for what could happen if there is a second wave of the coronavirus outbreak that hurts the ability of americans to gather for thanksgiving and christmas.

senator john barrasso: i think government never does big things really well. i'm for more of a step-by-step and i want to start with the first step of people with preexisting conditions. my wife bobbi is a breast cancer survivor. she's been through three operations, chemotherapy twice and i will tell you as a husband, as well as a doctor, i am committed to helping people with preexisting conditions. we can do that, there are a number of ways to do it. one is what maine has done in terms of their high-risk people helping with them with additional subsidies. but at the same time, then it allows insurance to be much cheaper, more affordable for other people. so, i want to do-- our-- our children's health insurance plan that works across the country. it works so well because states have a bigger say in that. when i was in our state senate in wyoming, we knew that what we wanted to do in wyoming may not fit what people would want in new york state. but if you give states that flexibility and freedom to do what works best with the money, i think it works much better for families and for patients.

michigan is one of the states that recently made it easier to vote by mail. in 2018, voters passed a ballot measure to allow for no-excuse absentee voting, which led to an explosion in absentee votes in the state's presidential primary earlier this month. nearly 40% of the people, or 876,845, voted absentee in that election. that was almost double the number of absentee votes from the 2016 presidential primary in michigan. jocelyn benson, michigan's secretary of state, told cbs news campaign reporter adam brewster that the big challenges for expanding access to voting by mail are educating voters about the process and securing the infrastructure to tabulate votes securely and quickly. that includes providing postage on ballots, ballot tracking technology, more access to high-speed ballot processing and counting machines and, in some cases, hiring more workers to process the ballots. those of us who have been doing this work for a long time know exactly what we need and the tools we need for the most part to administer elections by mail or where the majority of citizens are voting by mail in a crisis like this, benson said. the gap in between what we know needs to happen and our ability to make it happen is all in funding. while it took longer for michigan to report its full results due to the influx of ballots, benson said communities that were staffed similar to general elections were typically better equipped to handle the increased number of absentee ballots.

america could be faced with a choice this fall of either americans being able to vote - which means voting by mail - or not voting at all, said oregon democratic senator ron wyden on monday. wyden, along with democratic senator amy klobuchar of minnesota, introduced a bill last week to expand voting access. it includes, among other measures, requiring states to have 20 days of early in-person voting and no-excuse absentee voting by mail. americans are facing unprecedented disruptions to their daily lives and we don't want them to lose the ability to have a say over their own government, klobuchar said on monday. we've already seen some of the primary elections postponed and we won't want that to happen in november. and one of the things we can do to make it safer for everyone is to just get those ballots out there with postage.

anthony salvanto (cbs news elections and surveys director/@salvantocbs): well, we talked about nevada being the most diverse electorate the democrats would face. well, look at how well bernie sanders did with key parts of it. latino voters, who make up a large part of it, fifty-one percent, well ahead of everybody else. let me also show you, young people, core of bernie sanders' coalition, very well with them again. and let me also show you labor union households where he also won despite some back and forth controversy during the campaign. all of this, margaret, is going to bolster sanders' argument that he can put together a diverse coalition of democrats going forward.
democrats' control of the house also means they will run all of the lower chamber's committees. from the house oversight and government reform committee, to the house ways and means committee, democrats will control the agenda, the schedules, and what kind of investigations they pursue.
raddatz: tell me what your strategy is.
any form of outsized federal spending would likely juice the economy even more by spurring investment and hiring. but it will have a downside: rising interest rates. unless the democrats can wrangle a partial repeal of last year's tax cuts or institute a new tax on wealthier americans — possibilities wall street views as unlikely — further spending will have to be deficit-financed. meanwhile, the deficit has tripled since 2007, and treasury secretary steve mnuchin recently surpassed his predecessor's record for the amount of of notes and bonds the government issues to fund its debt.

john dickerson: yes. susan page, what jonah says is-- is amazing when you think about where nikki haley once was in 2016 giving a republican response to the democratic president, she talked about angry voices within the republican party, which nobody mistook for anything, but a shot at donald trump. yet, then she goes into the cabinet and now is-- goes into the administration is now leaving, managed pretty nicely. does this-- give me your thoughts on that and then also-- well, just give me your thoughts on that.

missing from that policy preview list was health care. the senior administration official declined to say whether that would be included in the president's address. after the gop failed multiple times to repeal and replace obamacare last year, congress appears to be moving on to other matters.

the white house is calling it the most progressive bill ever passed because it will also provide money for obamacare premiums, tax credits for parents, funds to fight hunger and to help boost schools for years.

scott gottlieb: yeah, a lot, and the fact that they're also increasing the amount of supply that they'll flow into the states right now. you know the states need to set up vaccination sites and have a predictable flow coming through those sites. they need to book appointments two, three weeks out. and so giving the states visibility on what the supply is going to be allows them to set up systems where people can go online and book an appointment two or three weeks out. a lot of people are willing to wait to get vaccinated. they just want to know when they're going to get vaccinated. so, i think giving more certainty to more people about when their time is going to come, when they can get an appointment, is going to be very important.
stephen miller: well, obviously there's no change immediately in obamacare. there hasn't been a nationwide injunction. obamacare was ruled to be unconstitutional. we've always known that obamacare was unconstitutional. the more important question is whether democrats are going to work with republicans once obamacare is ultimately struck down, which we believe it will be, to come up with a replacement plan that protects preexisting conditions, helps the twenty-eight million americans who because of obamacare still don't have access to health insurance and keeps prices low through robust competition.
our nation must be governed not from chaos but from opportunity. not by wallowing over what's wrong, but by marching inexorably toward what's right, she added.

president donald trump: well, i don't know. he hasn't told me that.
one day after every florida county entered into a full phase 1 reopening across the state, the number of covid-related deaths surpassed 2,000 in florida on tuesday. the full phase 1 reopening allows for restaurants and retail establishments to expand indoor occupancy to 50% and also permits museums, libraries and gyms to operate at 50% of their buildings' capacities. during a virtual press conference with the florida democratic party, demings and state leaders, cbs news campaign reporter lacrai mitchell asked what the leaders thought about this new phase of the state's re-opening. our economy is suffering, this is florida where tourism is so critical. but to reopen while our numbers are continuing to increase — and look, i know also that the rate of increase has gone down somewhat — but we have to be so careful and so, strategic in terms of reopening, said demings who added that she did appreciate the idea of a phased re-opening but countered that floridians have received mixed messages from the state's governor. florida democratic state senator victor torres said that idea of a gradual re-opening isn't being adhered to by some patrons in restaurants, salons, and bars. that's where i have a problem because guess what? if this comes back, it's gonna come back double the amount, said torres during the virtual press conference tuesday. we're gonna really face a challenge in the safety for our people.

sen. scott: well, we don't agree on much, but i'm glad he cares about prescription drug prices. but the- the problem the democrats have is everything they keep doing is raising the cost of health care. let's look at obamacare--

lesley stahl: i thought you liked spy-- sparring--
caitlin huey-burns: right. well, i think it shows the perils of waiting and lingering about making a decision about whether to get into this race. the longer that he waits out there, the more scrutiny is applied to him and his record, especially as these voters are getting a look at all of the other options that they have available to them. it also shows this kind of contrast that biden will be faced with within his own party, a party that has been dramatically changed in the era of me too. i have-- we'll say that i've been reporting in new hampshire and iowa and south carolina, following all these candidates, and every time i ask a voter about what they think of joe biden, almost to a tee they say, i love him so much, i just don't want him to run. and part of that is that they feel kind of personally invested in his legacy and they know what a presidential race could do to him. and they want him to be a player, but not necessarily inside. now, he does have high name recognition.
speaker nancy pelosi: and we've been here three months. hey, may i introduce you to the idea of the spout-- power of the speaker is to set the agenda. we didn't have a speaker who would bring a gun bill to the floor. we didn't have a speaker who would bring a dreamers issue to the floor. we do now. and that's a very big difference. the power of the speaker is awesome. awesome.
john dickerson: and maybe he is just saying out loud what previous presidents just wouldn't have said out loud. but there is-- there are american jobs to be thought about here, and that this is perfectly in keeping with president trump's kind of vision of foreign policy.

he is ramping up now, though. trump's rally in reno, nevada last week was his first campaign stop on a sunday. that same weekend - he gave two speeches on the same day in iowa - a rarity. on tuesday, he gave three speeches in iowa - one in which he was endorsed by 2008 vice presidential nominee sarah palin - only adding to the circus. it was the first time as a candidate that trump has given three speeches on the same day.
margaret brennan: governor, we've talked about your state being a-- an outperformer in terms of actually getting vaccine supply out to constituents, and i wonder what your advice to the biden administration would be. should they continue prioritizing states based on population or reward good behavior by giving more vaccine to states that can actually put it in arms?

we also have to recognize that states like massachusetts, connecticut, new jersey and new york – states right on our borders and just a few hours away – are still confronting massive outbreaks and it only takes one spark, or one unhelpful decision, to reignite this fire. we all need to continue to be smart, cautious and disciplined to preserve our hard-earned gains, vermont governor phil scott said friday, reports cbs news political unit broadcast associate aaron navarro.
you may want to consider many other details and nuances regarding the candidates' positions on these issues. and neither has yet taken positions on other issues that could improve the overall security of americans' retirement, such as expanding retirement plan coverage to the half of the workforce that doesn't now have it. however, overall, clinton's policies and positions appear to be much more favorable for the retirement of working americans than trump's.

the dispute from pennsylvania is before the supreme court for a second time, though now republicans are asking the high court to rule on the merits of the case. at issue is a pennsylvania supreme court decision extending the deadline for mail-in ballots to be accepted by three days. under the state high court's ruling, mail-in ballots postmarked by election day will be counted so long as they are received by november 6. ballots received within that period that lack a postmark or have an unclear postmark are presumed to have been mailed by election day and therefore must be accepted, the pennsylvania supreme court said.
as a result of the supreme court's action in the legal fight, democrats won't gain access to the materials until after the november 3 election. if mr. trump loses the white house or republicans take control of the house, it could foreclose the need for a ruling from the supreme court.
sen. klobuchar: there's always room to work on things but the best way - and what i believe will happen - is this will be stayed in court. so it continues to take effect. then it will go up on appeal. it will be upheld. but what we should be doing is governing from opportunity and not chaos. that means doing something about pharmaceutical prices and passing my bill to allow medicare to negotiate for less expensive drugs for our seniors and letting less expensive safe drugs come in from other countries so that we can actually have competition doing something about premiums with reinsurance and some of the things going on in the states. so yes there are things to do but we should be working to improve the affordable care act not just throw it out and set it on fire.

senator chris van hollen: look, no-- no donald-- donald trump when he goes say go beat the crap out of them at a rally and then he says i'm going to pick up your legal bill. i mean look, the guy-- the guy knows no bottom, but the reality is what democrats are saying is that we are locked in a pitched political battle and we are going to engage fully. i mean this is political trench warfare and we're going to engage in that battle. and that's why democrats in the senate are doing a lot better than people expected us to do more than a year ago when republicans said they were going to win a net of eight seats.

controversy inslee's tenures in congress and as washington's governor have largely been scandal-free. however, some of his decisions as governor, including his backing of a controversial union legislation, have garnered opposition in washington. what trump says mr. trump has yet to tweet about inslee or his presidential aspirations. in february 2018, however, the washington governor confronted the president in the white house about his idea to arm teachers in the wake of multiple deadly school shootings. i just suggest we need a little less tweeting here and a little more listening. and let's just take that off the table and move forward, inslee told the president during a meeting with other governors in the east room. although he initially pushed back by saying he supported arming certain teachers, mr. trump listened with his arms crossed while inslee pleaded for him to drop the idea and embrace other gun control measure

mcgahn: i think- i think the president has made an outstanding choice in nominating her. he promised justices in the mold of antonin scalia, a great justice. she clerked for scalia, became a protege of his and i think she's a fantastic judge. there's no reason why the senate shouldn't confirm her. and i think she's already had a distinguished career on the bench and it will continue on in the supreme court.
sen. klobuchar: yeah, i just went back and looked at that testimony. i look at the face of that sweet little girl - 7-year-old jakelin caal. she looks like the faces of the kids that were in my daughter's second grade class. and he came and testified before us and i asked him if he regretted any of the trump immigration policies and he said he did, but he didn't even mention that this had happened. under law they're supposed to tell congress within 24 hours if someone dies. so we clearly have to get to the bottom of that. but the second thing is comprehensive immigration reform, so that we can have some order at the border and that we can have a smart plan that works for our country, including a path to citizenship and doing something about states like mine where we don't have enough workers in our fields and in our factories. making sure that we have smart policies that work with fencing and other things. and that's not what they're talking about what they're talking about is chaos.

since taking control of the house in 2011, republicans have repeatedly promised to repeal and replace obamacare and have voted on this nearly 60 times. but none of their legislative proposals has made it to president obama's desk and the supreme court ruled on a key element of the healthcare law in june, upholding its subsidies.
president donald trump: you've discredited yourself.
and when you talk to larry kudlow and he talked about the patriotism of our farmers, i'm in a very heavy ag state. iowa, my neighbor is a heavy ag state, north dakota. i've talked to farmers in those areas and what they tell me is, they're not going to get that soybean market back in one year because that market has gone to farmers in other countries. and so that's why there's an urgency to this when we have an 891 billion dollar trade deficit, which is the worst that we've seen. you can't just keep talking about it. you actually have to get it done.

for white house veterans, this week has reminded them of the intensely negative publicity, scrutiny and skepticism that surrounded the administration's initially plodding response to the gulf oil spill. in those difficult days, obama and senior officials realized nothing could be communicated about cleanup efforts or economic intervention to assist affected states until, as several officials phrased it then, someone plugged the damn hole spewing oil into the gulf.

if a high-deductible plan is all you can afford or otherwise makes the most sense for you, compare options carefully to find what each policy covers before your deductible is met. under the law, annual physicals and some preventive care screening such as mammograms are covered 100 percent before the deductible.

on tuesday, the president defended his campaign spending, claiming they had to put up a lot of money to combat stories about the coronavirus. he said would put up his own cash for his re-election bid if he has to, but said they are doing very well. neither trump nor biden's campaigns have announced how much cash on hand they had at the end of august, but earlier last month biden's campaign revealed it had nearly closed the gap over the summer after facing a nearly $200 million cash disadvantage earlier this year. so where has some of the president's campaign cash all gone?

senator bernie sanders: --contributions. i'm not quite sure. but i am enormously impressed by the many, many, hundreds of thousands of americans who are making contributions. many of them are very small contributions. i am also impressed by the fact that we have over one million people from every state in this country who have volunteered to work on what will be an unprecedented grassroots campaign. look, margaret, the way we win the democratic nomination, the way we beat trump--who in my mind is the most dangerous president in modern american history--is through a massive grassroots effort, which demands that we have an economy and a government which works for all of us and not just the one percent. that we end this massive level of income and wealth inequality where three of the wealthiest people own more wealth than the bottom half of americans, while at the same time over half the people in this country are working paycheck to paycheck and cannot afford a health care.
for all his votes on the conservative side of issues, roberts has had his critics on the right. they include mr. trump, who once labeled roberts an absolute disaster for the chief justice's critical vote to uphold the affordable care act in 2012. mr. trump has not publicly criticized roberts since he's been president.

he also declared that the american people have a choice to make when it comes to the starkly different views between democrats and republicans over how to address income inequality. seemingly dismissive of conservative economic concerns, the president said, food stamp recipients didn't cause the financial crisis; recklessness on wall street did. immigrants aren't the reason wages haven't gone up enough.

jonah goldberg: and so you have this, sort of, cross messaging going on where the situation down there is very, very dire. added to the problem is that while i'm sympathetic to the idea of more border security, a wall isn't what's going to solve the actual crisis that's going on down there. that requires a change in policy, a change in law, and so none of the messaging is lining up with the reality on either side.

the two events are a first for the biden campaign as they begin targeting specific swing states ahead of november's election. recent polls give biden a single-digit edge over president trump in florida and the stops – or whatever we're calling them – are designed to shore up support in two corners of the state where a democratic presidential candidate can do well: jacksonville, which has a large african-american population, and tampa, which sits at the western edge of the famed i-4 corridor that white house campaigns always target in pursuit of swing voters.

as you recall, in january, general flynn moved to withdraw his plea, and also alleged misconduct by the government. and at that time, i asked a very seasoned u.s. attorney, who had spent ten years as an fbi agent and ten years as a career prosecutor, jeff jensen, from st. louis, to come in and take a fresh look at this whole case. and he found some additional material. and last week, he came in and briefed me and made a recommendation that we dismiss the case, which i fully agreed with, as did the u.s. attorney in d.c. so we've moved to dismiss the case.
yeah, i'm prepared for that. i also think it's sad that nowadays these partisan feelings are so strong that people have lost any sense of justice. and the groups that usually worry about civil liberties and making sure that there's proper procedures followed and standards set seem to be ignoring it and willing to destroy people's lives and see great injustices done.

the back and forth between trump and newsom comes after the republican national committee along with the national republican congressional committee and the california republican party, filed suit sunday night to reverse newsom's order to automatically send every registered voter a ballot ahead of the november presidential election. republicans are claiming newsom's recent executive order to mail every registered voter in the state a ballot is an illegal power grab that redesigns the election system. one point of argument for republicans has been mailing ballots to inactive voters because they say it leads to fraud. ballots are mailed to all registered voters. there is a category of inactive voters that i think is the focus of their attention that don't receive these ballots, california's secretary of state alex padilla said in an msnbc interview on tuesday. now, republicans are claiming this is a reversal of newsom's executive order and that padilla has promised the state would not send ballots to inactive voters. republicans are also calling on democrats in the state to clean up their active voter rolls, as five percent of voters in imperial, fresno, and la counties have moved or passed away. read more here about the lawsuit and newsom's executive order that earlier this month made california the first state in the nation to mail voters a ballot ahead of the presidential election as a response to the coronavirus pandemic.

sanders apologized to the two women who had settled with becker, and said that he was not aware of the settlement. what trump says president trump has alternated between praising sanders and insulting him as crazy. as some of mr. trump and sanders' populist ideas overlap, mr. trump often said during the 2016 campaign that sanders voters would defect to him over hillary clinton in the general election. mr. trump also accused clinton of cheating to take the nomination away from sanders, and criticized sanders for eventually endorsing clinton. while bernie has totally given up on his fight for the people, we welcome all voters who want a better future for our workers, mr. trump tweeted in july 2016. wow, my campaign is hearing from more and more bernie supporters that they will never support crooked hillary, he wrote in another july tweet. in several subsequent tweets, mr. trump has called sanders crazy bernie. he has often referred to the 2016 democratic primary during his two years in office, sometimes in an effort to cast him as the face of the party's more extreme elements.
jamelle bouie: i mean, it could get-- it could get very big. it's still-- it's still very early in the process. and so there is probably space-- space for someone like stacey abrams and, hopefully, space for other candidates. but i do think as time goes on, as there are debates, as there's more fund-raising, as all these-- as all the barriers and hurdles start coming up for progressing, i think this field will shrink considerably. the-- the fact that beto, that senator sanders, that senator harris are the three candidates who have been able to really take in large hauls to me at least suggests that those three at least have a very durable base within the party that can expand. everyone else--

a new poll from monmouth university on monday shows governors are exceeding mr. trump in handling the coronavirus outbreak, reports cbs news political unit associate producer eleanor watson. according to the poll, 72% of those surveyed said their state's governor has done a good job and 18% said their governor has done a bad job in handling the pandemic. the reviews are bipartisan, with 76% of democrats, 73% of republicans and 67% of independents saying their governor has done a good job in dealing with the outbreak. the positive reviews even come from residents of the four states with the highest number of coronavirus cases: california, new jersey, new york, and washington. in these four states, 74% say their governor has done a good job. more americans said mr. trump has done a good job (50%) than a bad job (45%), but the reviews of how mr. trump has dealt with the crisis are more partisan. about 89% of republicans say he is handling it well while only 48% of independents and 19% of democrats approve of his administration's handling of the situation. the poll shows how governors across the country have taken charge during the outbreak. new york governor andrew cuomo has received praise across the country for his daily briefings that include powerpoint presentations about the outbreak in the state. during the sunday white house covid task force briefing, mr. trump said he spoke with cuomo. he's working hard, mr. trump said. we're all working hard together.
the report comes as house democrats under speaker nancy pelosi, d-calif., are moving to shore up the aca, including trying to undo some of trump's insurance changes. although such a rollback seems unlikely to succeed under divided government, there has been bipartisan support for measures that would help reduce premiums and guarantee coverage for pre-existing conditions. restoring the ad budget for healthcare.gov slashed by mr. trump is also a possibility.

many leaders said that race shouldn't be the top or only factor in choosing the right running mate. and all of the black women political leaders that cbs news spoke with said the eventual vice-presidential pick must have a strong grasp on the problems facing the black community and particularly black women. perry and mitchell reported on cbsn that while prominent black women like former georgia state house leader stacey abrams and senator kamala harris of california were mentioned as viable prospects, activists in battleground states like wisconsin believe that senator elizabeth warren of massachusetts is the candidate who can deliver on issues that are important to black women. [warren] works with people and listens to people and will continue to push the work of making racial justice a priority, advocating for black women's leadership across the country [and] lifting up especially in those down ballot races where there are so many powerful black women running in their communities, said priscilla bort, who is an organizer for the wisconsin working families party.
sen. barrasso: and i want to work with additional democrats, but what we're seeing right now from the democrats side- and you see whether it was bernie sanders or so many of the democrat candidates for president in 2020, they're talking about a different step away from obamacare as well. they agree that obamacare hasn't worked and they're talking about a program of a complete government takeover of healthcare, with increased taxes and fewer choices and longer lines. and that to me doesn't help people in the- in the long run. i talked to people yesterday- i was in wyoming at a wreath ceremony, at our- at our cemetery- talked to somebody on medicare. they said, we don't want medicare for all, we paid into medicare our whole life. this isn't the time to put more people onto that program. we want to make sure that that is saved and strengthened and- and- and held for people that are already on the program and have paid in over their lifetime.
meanwhile in colorado, the democratic congressional campaign committee's (dccc) efforts to back democratic candidate jason crow in colorado's competitive 6th district garnered some negative attention. crow, an attorney and army veteran, appeared to have establishment-backing early on. but that did not stop levi tillemann, a former official in obama's energy department, from moving home to run against coffman as well.

still most of the women reiterated that the ultimate goal for black women has been the same since the beginning of the primary: defeating president trump. regardless of who vice president biden chooses as his running mate, i'm going to be out there making sure that we get out the vote, said georgia democratic party chair nikema williams, who is also a georgia state senator. but i think at some point we want to see ourselves reflected in the leadership that we're voting for.

although she began her career opposing lgbtq rights, she is now a supporter of lgbtq issues and has apologized for her previous views. controversy gabbard's father was an anti-gay activist whose views influenced his daughter during her early political career. when she ran for the hawaii state legislature in 2002, gabbard boasted about supporting her father in his effort to promote the constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage passed in 1998. after her election, she continued to espouse anti-gay views. in 2004, she opposed a bill legalizing civil unions. to try to act as if there is a difference between 'civil unions' and same-sex marriage is dishonest, cowardly and extremely disrespectful to the people of hawaii, gabbard said at the time, according to cnn's kfile. as democrats we should be representing the views of the people, not a small number of homosexual extremists. gabbard apologized to lgbtq activists in the state when running for congress in 2012. she apologized again after launching her presidential campaign. gabbard has invited controversy for her iconoclastic views on foreign policy. in january 2017, she visited syria and met with syrian dictator bashar al-assad. a few months later, the u.s. bombed the syrian airfield thought to be the origin of a government-ordered deadly chemical attack. gabbard called the u.s. bombing reckless and questioned whether assad was behind the attack, garnering criticism from other democratic politicians.
on the intelligence committee, swalwell has also strongly defended special counsel robert mueller's now-concluded investigation and voiced his concerns about the trump campaign's contacts with people affiliated with the russian government, including the infamous trump tower meeting between donald trump jr. and other campaign officials and a russian lawyer who claimed to have dirt on hillary clinton during the summer of 2016. issues swalwell will look to make gun safety reform an integral part of his presidential campaign. he has been strongly critical of the national rifle association's (nra) sway in congress and has repeatedly lambasted republicans for not supporting gun control measures. he is hosting a town hall on gun control in florida tuesday alongside survivors of the stoneman douglas high school massacre, in which 17 students and staff members were killed by a gunman. last week, the california democrat shared a voicemail his office received in which an individual is heard making a death threat against him because of his stance on gun rights. we're going to war. and you're going to be the first motherf***ing casualty, the person in the voicemail posted by swalwell on twitter is heard saying. in his post, swalwell wrote, i'm not afraid of this guy. i'm not afraid of the nra. i'm not afraid. no fear. #endgunviolence.

pro-biden super pac american bridge 21st century has launched an 11-day, $1.6 million paid media blitz - primarily in pennsylvania - targeting seniors, veterans, and the small-town, rural voters, report cbs news campaign reporter nicole sganga and political unit associate producer sarah ewall-wice. the new spots include broadcast, cable, digital and radio ad buys, mail, as well as billboards and postcards. a new advertisement highlighting a former trump supporter -- preacher -- will begin airing on pennsylvania tv and radio this weekend, up through election day. american bridge will roll out two new pennsylvania digital ads: harold and pennsylvania lives. while the american people knew this president could not be trusted to tell the truth, the covid-19 pandemic gave donald trump's dishonesty and incompetence new meaning for millions of families -- and they are ready for a change, said american bridge 21st century president bradley beychok. american bridge 21st century began our first ever paid media program with a clear mission to undercut trump's support with seniors, rural communities, and the white working class voters who propelled him to narrow victories in pennsylvania, wisconsin, and michigan in 2016. in the final days of this election, it's never been more clear that the president has no path to reelection without these blue wall states. american bridge 21st century is closing out the election with a final push to ensure pennsylvania goes blue, fighting as hard as we can up until the minute polls close to elect joe biden the next president of the united states.

the interesting thing is he said 'that i've ever worked with,' cruz said of boehner. i've never worked with john boehner. the truth of the matter is -- i don't know the man. i've met john boehner two or three times in my life. if i have said 50 words in my life to john boehner i'd be surprised, and every one of them has consisted of pleasantries.
anna palmer: clearly, the president thinks it does. he brought it up at a state of the union, and has been doing it several times at all the campaign rallies. i think democrats are concerned about it, though. i think, you know, you don't see nancy pelosi and others wanting to carry the banner of socialism or democratic socialism at all. you know, and i think you have this, again, i kind of brought it up earlier, but this push-pull in the democratic party of where you have the bernie sanders, the aocs of the world and where the democratic establishment is and where they think they can win in a lot of these more moderate districts and in some of these states that are going to be up in 2020, that running the bernie sanders playbook is not going to work.
margaret brennan: and, dan, it was your paper, the washington post, that reported russia is attempting to help sanders' presidential campaign as part of an effort to interfere with the democratic contest. what is unusual is to have the national security adviser talk about this in a political context. and there was reaction to o'brien commenting in this way. it's unusual for someone in that position to do so.

higher interest rates are great for savers — but they can be a significant damper on business growth, since they make it more expensive to fund long-term investment. it also means that when interest rates shift even a little bit, there's there's a lot of treasuries behind that, said slok. already, the fastest-growing part of the federal budget is not new spending — it's interest payments on the public debt we've already incurred.

the fact that joe biden even has a healthcare proposal is proof that obamacare was a colossal failure from the beginning. premiums went through the roof, choices dwindled, and people suffered under the twin lies that they could keep their doctors and their existing healthcare plans, said tim murtaugh, trump 2020 communications director. biden's new proposal would lead to a government takeover of the entire healthcare system and would end with the elimination of employer-provided health insurance for 180 million americans.

so i have very clear views about what i want to see to kind of change the balance on the supreme court. and i regret deeply that the senate has not done its job and they have not permitted a vote on the person that president obama, a highly qualified person, they've not given him a vote to be able to be have the full complement of nine supreme court justices. i think that was a dereliction of duty.

bill daily nbc actor bill daily (august 30, 1927-september 4, 2018) was an affable second-banana to astronaut larry hagman on the 1960s sitcom i dream of jeannie. a jazz musician and improv comic who had dyslexia, daily had been in the background of a reading for the jeannie pilot when producer sidney sheldon noticed him, and created the role of roger healey for daily. he later played the next-door neighbor of bob newhart on the comedian's 1970s series, and psychiatrist larry dykstra on alf. he also directed theater, and was a frequent panelist on match game. in a 2003 interview for the television academy foundation, daily said reading scripts was always difficult (no one knew he was dyslexic), and that he had trouble going up for commercial or movie auditions because he wouldn't be allowed to do improvs instead, and had to find other ways to impress others with humor. i'm incredibly lazy, and if i could read, i wouldn't have used that part of my brain that i have to use … if things were easy for me, i would never have gotten anywhere, i wouldn't have done anything.

bondi is no stranger to controversy involving mr. trump. last year, a florida state prosecutor said a bribery complaint against mr. trump and bondi lacked enough evidence to move forward. the complaint was filed over a $25,000 campaign contribution bondi received from mr. trump through his foundation in 2013, around which time bondi's office was being asked about alleged fraud at trump university.
margaret brennan: what do you make of the democratic problems here within the party--the party within the dem-- problems within the democratic party? had a hard time getting that one out. with aoc. she sent this tweet last night that some republicans might welcome but some democrats felt a little bit of a discomfort with. she said the dcc's new rule to blacklist and boycott anyone who does business with primary challengers is extremely divisive and harmful to the party. you had some other progressives kind of joining her in this. what should people at home understand about what's happening within the party?
asked about the fact that the president is a christian, santorum answered: he says he's a christian, he's a christian, and would not elaborate on how to balance competing ideas about contraception within the broader faith. but he was firm in painting the president as promulgating a new moral code that he contended was intolerant of the church.

will you remember that, texas? will you remember that pennsylvania? oklahoma? ohio? mr. trump said during thursday's debate, after biden said he'd transition away from fossil fuels to eventually replace them with renewable energy source. while oklahoma is not a battleground state for the presidential race, the mention may have been a reference for the state's 5th district, one of the most notable pickup opportunities for republicans. oklahoma's 5th district has several major oil and gas companies that use fracking, and while she has spoken out against a ban on it before, freshman democrat kendra horn was quick to show some distance between her and biden. here's one of the places biden and i disagree. we must stand up for our oil and gas industry. we need an all-of-the-above energy approach that's consumer friendly, values energy independence, and protects ok jobs. i'll keep fighting for that in congress, horn tweeted after the debate. her republican opponent, state senator stephanie bice, called on her to outright disavow biden's transition away from the oil industry. national republican groups such as the national republican congressional committee or the congressional leadership fund have been highlighting biden's comments to target horn, several democrat challengers in texas and congresswoman xochitl torres small in new mexico's 2nd. congresswoman torres small and joe biden will both say whatever it takes to get elected, but the one thing that remains true is that they are both dead set on ending good paying energy jobs, clf press secretary will reinert said in a press release.

house speaker nancy pelosi rejected that $1.8 billion offer, arguing that it did not do enough on provisions such as testing and tracing and on funding for child care. treasury secretary steven mnuchin has said the administration's priority is to use $300 billion left from the coronavirus aid, relief and economic security, or cares, act to fund the paycheck protection program with $130 billion, as well as to provide aid to the ailing airline industry.

we have the greatest testing program in the world, president trump said thursday, in marinette. we've developed it over a period of time. we're up to almost 30 million tests. that means we're gonna have more cases. if we didn't want to test or if we didn't test we wouldn't have cases. in a call with reporters thursday, center for disease control director robert redfield said for every reported case of covid-19, there are 10 more undetected infections. johns hopkins university has tracked over 2.4 million confirmed coronavirus cases in the us. based on the cdc's new estimates of unreported cases, over 20 million americans have had the virus.

another factor may be related to the so-called coverage gap. when the aca was passed, it mandated that all states expand their medicaid coverage, including increasing qualifying income limits. at the same time, the aca ruled that people whose income fell below 100 percent of the poverty level would not qualify for the aca's government subsidies to help pay health insurance premiums. the assumption was these people would be covered by expanded medicaid coverage, collins explained.

peter daszak: let history be the judge.
according to the centers for medicare and medicaid services, the trump administration is actively considering launching a special enrollment period for americans facing the ongoing covid-19 crisis. the special approval would allow 32 states reliant on federal healthcare exchange to re-open enrollment, permitting americans to sign up for coverage under the affordable care act although open enrollment ended on december 15th for these states. the kaiser family foundation says nearly 28 million people in the united states lack health insurance. according to a gallup poll released earlier this month, 52% of americans surveyed approve of the affordable care act and 48% of the population disapprove.
nearly 160 million workers and family members have coverage through employers, although the number covered by small employers is much smaller.

stephen miller: this is a-- this is a very-- if it comes to it, absolutely. this is a very fundamental issue. at stake is the question of whether or not the united states remains a sovereign country. whether or not we can establish and enforce rules for entrance into our country. the democrat party has a simple choice. they can either choose to fight for america's working class or to promote illegal immigration. you can't do both.
the bill would change the formulas for health insurance tax credits to make them more generous for most people, and also allow a wider number of individuals to qualify. that makes coverage more attractive for people who are considering whether to buy and more affordable for those who already have it, mainly low-to-moderate income working people.
trump: ... 600 — wait a minute, anderson, 600 times. well, she said she was awake at 3 o'clock in the morning, and she also sent a tweet out at 3 o'clock in the morning, but i won't even mention that. but she said she'll be awake. who's going — the famous thing, we're going to answer our call at 3 o'clock in the morning. guess what happened? ambassador stevens — ambassador stevens sent 600 requests for help. and the only one she talked to was sidney blumenthal, who's her friend and not a good guy, by the way. so, you know, she shouldn't be talking about that.
on thursday, president donald trump visited the villages in florida to sign an executive order protecting medicare from socialist destruction. the executive order calls for reducing medicare fraud and supporting privatized medicare plans, but the president spent a large chunk of his remarks criticizing the medicare for all plan supported by some democratic presidential candidates, according to cbs news political unit associate producer ellee watson.
senator chris van hollen: well, what we've said from the beginning is this is a very tough political map for senate democrats. probably the toughest we've seen in sixty years. the fact that people were talking about democrats taking back a majority of the senate, shows how strong we have been and what kind of momentum we got. so i have said from day one, that we have a credible path to a democratic senate majority. it is a narrow path. and there are so many very tight seats that this is all about turnout at this point.
it's about being able to come up with a melody and a rhythm on the spot, something that comes out of your heart. if truth be told, there were a lot of musicians back in the day who didn't read or write, but they were just able to make music. and if you had that in your heart, and in your ear, you had a lot more to grab from than people who are more technical. not that the technical part is not important, because it is; you have to have dexterity. it's kind of like a perfect marriage, having that balance between that dexterity and what you have in your heart.

after longtime new jersey senator frank lautenberg died in the summer of 2013, booker ran to fill his seat and defeated a little-known republican mayor in a special election. in 2014, he won reelection to serve a full term in the senate. during his years in the senate, he has sought to promote bipartisanship through conciliatory rhetoric. booker announced he was running for president on feb. 1, 2019, the first day of black history month. issues he has made criminal justice reform and the decriminalization of marijuana integral issues of his agenda in the senate. pointing to the disproportionate incarceration of minorities for marijuana-related offenses, he crafted the marijuana justice act in the summer of 2017. the bill would remove marijuana from the 1970 controlled substances act, withhold federal funding for states which continue to criminalize the substance, require courts to expunge convictions for marijuana use or possession and establish a federal fund to help low-income communities affected by the so-called war on drugs. the junior senator from new jersey is one of the chief architects of the first step act, a landmark bill that president trump signed into law in december after rare overwhelming bipartisan support in congress. the legislation increases investment in programs to curb recidivism among federal prisoners and modifies several sentencing laws, including mandatory minimum sentences for nonviolent drug offenders. although he hopes to tout it as a signature achievement of his career in congress, booker acknowledged that the bill is just one stepping stone to overhaul the criminal justice system.

scgop chairman drew mckissick says no former lobbyist who supports policies like impeaching president trump, the green new deal, and socialized healthcare is going to beat senator graham. however during a campaign kick-off event earlier this week, cbs news campaign reporter lacrai mitchell says harrison had a message for dubious voters. when i travel around the state people say that they're pulling for us, but they don't know if we can win in a red state, said harrison. we represent a new south that is bold, that's inclusive, that's diverse, and powerful [and] my friends, that new south is rising and it's time to let them hear our voices.
controversy although she is likely to cite her long career as a prosecutor on the campaign trail, harris is poised to face scrutiny from some progressives for her law enforcement work. some factions on the left have denounced aspects of her record as a district attorney and state attorney general. critics have pointed to california's overcrowded prisons and to her defense of controversial convictions to challenge the notion that she was a progressive prosecutor. if kamala harris wants people who care about dismantling mass incarceration and correcting miscarriages of justice to vote for her, she needs to radically break with her past, wrote law professor lara bazelon in an opinion piece for the new york times. what trump says although mr. trump has not yet tweeted about harris, the white house has previously criticized the california senator. in the summer of 2018, the white house twitter account wrote, @senkamalaharris, why are you supporting the animals of ms-13? you must not really know what ice does. harris has said that lawmakers need to reexamine the role of immigration and customs enforcement (ice).

joachim roenneberg alastair grant/ap in february 1943 world war ii saboteur joachim roenneberg (august 30, 1919-october 21, 2018) headed a five-man team that daringly blew up a plant producing heavy water, depriving nazi germany of a key ingredient it could have used to make nuclear weapons. roenneberg, then 23, was tapped by the special operations executive, or soe (britain's wartime intelligence gathering and sabotage unit) to destroy key parts of the heavily-guarded plant in telemark, in southern norway. parachuting onto snow-covered mountains, the group was joined by a handful of other commando soldiers before skiing to their destination. they then penetrated the fortress-like heavy-water plant to blow up its production line. roenneberg said he made a last-minute decision to cut the length of his fuse from several minutes to seconds, ensuring that the explosion would take place but making it more difficult to escape. the group skied hundreds of miles across the mountains to escape, and roenneberg (wearing a british uniform) ended up in neighboring neutral sweden. for this and other operations as part of the resistance movement, roenneberg received norway's highest military decoration, and was honored by the u.s., british and french governments as well. in a 2014 norwegian documentary about operation gunnerside, roenneberg said the daring operation went like a dream – a reference to the fact that not a single shot was fired.
i think it's too early to predict that--i wouldn't say we're to that point, he said. i think a clear leader could still emerge in the field.
those remarks followed the justice department's filing tuesday of a brief supporting the complete invalidation of the aca, a departure from its previous stance that the individual mandate, requiring most americans to carry health insurance, should be stricken down, but the rest of the law, including the protections for pre-existing conditions, should remain in place.
personal issues. press reports on monday disclosed that puzder had employed an undocumented immigrant as a housekeeper. two of president bill clinton's nominees in 1993, zoe baird and kimba wood, were forced to drop their bids for attorney general for using nannies who were illegally in the u.s. but the trump administration, unlike clinton's, has shrugged off the incident.

mike bloomberg: plain and simple: you get some experts. you put 'em in a room and say, okay, now who should we go hire to do this job? who's the best person in the world? we'll start there. asking what party they're a member of, how they voted the last time, it is so nonsensical. if you are sick, do you really wanna go to a doctor who was politically correct? or somebody that knew how to treat your disease? i'll rest my case.
in 2016, we lost 64,000 americans to drug overdoses: 174 deaths per day. seven per hour. we must get much tougher on drug dealers and pushers if we are going to succeed in stopping this scourge, he said. my administration is committed to fighting the drug epidemic and helping get treatment for those in need. the struggle will be long and difficult -- but, as americans always do, we will prevail.
but if you look at russia, just take a look at russia, and look at what they did this week, where i agree, she wasn't there, but possibly she's consulted. we sign a peace treaty. everyone's all excited. well, what russia did with assad and, by the way, with iran, who you made very powerful with the dumbest deal perhaps i've ever seen in the history of deal-making, the iran deal, with the $150 billion, with the $1.7 billion in cash, which is enough to fill up this room.

vice president mike pence campaigned in ohio friday for the second time this week. pence said mr. trump took the fight straight to joe biden and he won that debate hands down. laughing, pence said, it was amazing, i saw joe look down at this watch, i figured he was trying to figure out how soon this thing's gonna be over. pence also picked on biden saying he would eventually replace the oil industry. america's strength comes in part from our vast natural resources, pence said. we are going to continue to develop all of the resources of this land and drive a boundless american future, he added.
it's equally true that insurance companies want to keep the march 31 deadline because they are eager to acquire customers and the premiums they pay to finance insurance coverage the law requires for new and existing consumers -- a topic discussed wednesday when more than a dozen health insurance ceos met with white house chief of staff denis mcdonough, senior adviser valerie jarrett and health and human services secretary kathleen sebelius.
the dnc war room plans to make the case that mr. trump's reelection launch represents a new campaign with more broken promises, arguing the president has sold americans short. they will particularly focus on his tax cut plan, arguing it's given cuts to the wealthy but not to average americans, and that he's flooded the swamp he promised to drain with special interest lobbyists. they also plan to attack mr. trump's promise that he'd make health care cost less, save manufacturing jobs, and stand up to drug companies, arguing that he hasn't done any of those things. during mr. trump's rally, the dnc will be offering their own fact check of mr. trump's claims.
i believe it's director comey and the deputy's office.
the race for the republican nomination is really down to donald trump and ted cruz. but if neither candidate clinches the delegates needed to win the nomination before the convention, in theory, almost anyone could be the gop's pick. we look at some of the most likely of the unlikelies.
the gop's official platform devotes all of three paragraphs, out of 62 pages, to college costs. in the past, trump has favored abolishing all or part of the u.s. department of education, although that statement is neither on his website nor in the gop platform statements. to date, trump hasn't elaborated on which parts of the education department he would cut.
the trump presidency isn't some strange, extra-democratic phenomenon. it's precisely what happens when the american people give a guy like donald trump and his political party in congress the power to govern. it's no more perilous than when they did the same with barack obama and the democrats a decade ago, or bill clinton and his party in 1992.
if an insurer incurs claims in excess of the aggregate premium payments, it needs to raise premiums for the current insured population. this could cause some people to drop coverage, which in turn might cause yet another premium increase as healthy people drop out of the insured pool. in the insurance business, this is called a death spiral.
if not, we will be reluctantly forced to find, with all of the jobs and economic development it brings, another republican national convention site… in a press conference on tuesday, cooper said he's really not surprised at anything that happens on twitter and added that while its ok for political conventions to be political, the pandemic response cannot be. we're continuing our discussions with the rnc and [are] going to continue to put health and safety at the forefront, said cooper, who added that his team has asked the rnc to present a plan laying out various options. …we have to have options regarding how this convention is going to be run depending on where we are with the virus in august…i hope that we can find some kind of reasonable accommodations but we're not going to sacrifice the health and safety of north carolinian and that's the bottom line. cbs news has previously spoken to party officials as they wrestle with the economic and image implications of hosting traditional gatherings, as well as local business owners and leaders on their take of hosting conventions amid the pandemic. democratic party officials have also told cbs news that they've been forced to dramatically re-think their convention which has already been pushed back to august.

the democratic senate campaign arm has endorsed a candidate in iowa to challenge ernst, but has not focused as much attention on the iowa race, compared with other battleground contests. mr. trump won iowa by 10 points in 2016, but a recent morning consult poll found 55% of voters in iowa disapprove of mr. trump, while 42% approve of the job he has done.

a texas state court of appeals on friday upheld a lower court's decision that blocked governor greg abbott's order limiting counties to one drop-off site for mail ballots, reports cbs news campaign reporter adam brewster. republicans are expected to appeal the decision to the texas supreme court, so it's unclear if more drop-off sites will open. this is separate from a federal case where an appeals court ruled that abbott's order was valid. texas does not offer no-excuse mail voting. to vote by mail, voters have to be either 65 years or older, disabled, out of the county on election day and early voting period, or in jail but otherwise eligible. more than 787,000 texans have already voted by mail, but another 5.6 million have voted early in-person. combined, more than 37.7% of registered texans have voted and already turnout is at 71% of the total turnout from the 2016 presidential election.

as we rebuild america's strength and confidence at home, we are also restoring our strength and standing abroad.
well, history is written by the winner. so it largely depends on who's writing the history. but i think a fair history would say that it was a good decision because it upheld the rule of law. it helped, it upheld the standards of the department of justice, and it undid what was an injustice.
i never use the word 'lie.' i can't get into a politician's head, kessler said.
washington — top health care officials in the trump administration said wednesday they are not aware of a health care plan to replace the affordable care act from the white house, revelations that come as president trump and his top aides continue to assert a proposal will soon be unveiled.

single-payer health care has long been the objective of liberals who would like to see a single government entity, like medicare, provide health care for everyone.
margaret brennan: who informed you of that? was it facebook or have u.s. intelligence officials told you about some kind of meddling with the campaign?
even if we get the hardware and software working exactly the way it's supposed to, with relatively minor glitches, what we're also discovering is that, you know, insurance is complicated to buy, he said. and another mistake that we made, i think, was underestimating the difficulties of people purchasing insurance online and shopping for a lot of options, with a lot of costs and a lot of different benefits and plans, and somehow expecting that that would be very smooth, and then they've also got to try to apply for tax credits on the website.
washington — judge amy coney barrett's nomination to the supreme court cleared its final procedural hurdle sunday, setting up a final vote on her confirmation expected on monday evening, just days before the presidential election.
the ap reported that about 56% of people in the 7th congressional district voted by mail during that election. president trump won the district by more than 20 points in 2016, but a university of virginia analysis found that during the april election, the conservative supreme court nominee beat his liberal challenger by just 6 points in the district.
but the debt under mr. trump has continued to soar, and it's unclear whether he's willing to take the unpopular steps to change that trajectory. most fiscal experts say non-discretionary spending — programs like medicaid, medicare and social security, the largest drivers of the debt — must be slashed in order to reverse the trend. the national debt, which was just shy of $20 trillion when mr. trump took office in january 2019, surpassed $22 trillion for the first time ever in february of this year.
donald trump: no, i think it's a moment in time where politicians for a long period of time have let people down. they've let 'em down on the job front. they've even let 'em down in terms of the war front. you know, we've been fighting this war for 15 years--

margaret brennan: so you are- i mean you- you- you call yourself a pragmatist. you're, in many ways--
i'm very concerned about doing anything that's going to tinker too much with medicare. i protect the senior citizens, trump said. i think paul ryan is too far out front with this issue.
if these three republicans join all democrats in voting to subpoena witnesses, then they'd only need one more republican to join them to summon witnesses the house did not hear from. democrats have asked to hear from four government witnesses, including acting chief of staff mick mulvaney and former national security adviser john bolton. mcconnell warned democrats on tuesday that he couldn't imagine that only the witnesses that our democratic colleagues would want to call would be called.
mr. trump's advisers, such as top economists larry kudlow, have tried to explain the president meant he would cut debt-to-gdp, although mr. trump also hasn't accomplished that, and that was not his original wording.

cleaver told cbs news campaign reporter musadiq bidar that her goal is to proactively reach out to voters and guide them through the process. we're not even looking at this point to increase turnout, we are just looking to maintain an acceptable level of turnout because it is entirely possible that if people don't navigate the vote-by-mail process that we will have midterm level turnout in a presidential election year, cleaver said.
the gop's failed attempt to repeal obamacare in 2017 had a galvanizing effect among democrats. cbs news exit polling from the 2018 midterms found health care to be the top issue for voters in an election where democrats picked up 40 house seats. and 54 percent of midterm voters disapproved of the president.
donald trump: we never discussed what was said about each other. i said terrible things about him, he said terrible things about me. we never ever discussed what we said about each other—
lesley stahl: are you ready for some tough questions?
ed o'keefe: --being uncle joe, well, up against the party that now exists and the activists who will fill those arenas and those coffee shops and be the most active on the street in these early primary states, you wonder whether people are really going to want to have to justify and explain that to voters--
rep. jacky rosen, d-nev., seeking to oust gop sen. dean heller, has run an ad saying, repeal and replace sen. dean heller that highlights his support for repeal legislation after initially opposing it.
susan glasser: well, just a quick thing. i-- i do think nimble is a very charitable word, you know, for somebody who has really-- donald trump hasn't changed but many of his critics have changed in how they approach and-- and frame him. she did leave the oval office saying that jared kushner was a hidden genius in the administration the same week that this-- this saudi controversy has arisen. and this goes to the point of, you know, what is the administration's foreign policy increasingly these days? i think we see a situation where it's less and less true that there's a trump administration foreign policy and a trump foreign policy. since president trump got rid of rex tillerson, his first secretary of state, got rid of h. r. mcmaster, replaced them with mike pompeo and john bolton. both of them come out of certainly much more of a classic, very conservative, very hard line republican foreign policy establishment. they differ on their own policy positions from president trump. but he's made it very clear that he doesn't want to have any more public disagreements and it appears that they have not challenged him as much, even privately as their predecessors did. nikki haley is someone who did speak up repeatedly at various points in time where she disagreed on russia, for example, and on other aspects of foreign policy.
margaret brennan: and we will be tracking that.
all americans deserve accountability and respect, and that's what we are giving to our wonderful heroes, our veterans. thank you.
john dickerson: what does that mean then, susan glasser, for the foreign policy? does this tell us anything about the current makeup of the foreign policy team and then what does it mean going forward?
margaret brennan: what does this signal that he was able to get mitch mcconnell to give some precious time to this bill?
factcheck.org doesn't have a rating system, but they call politicians out in a contextual way.
senator amy klobuchar: thank you so much. it's great to be on, margaret.
and that's why i've tried to put forth specific policies and plans, trying to get it off of the personal and put it on to what it is i want to do as president. and that's why i hope people will check on that for themselves so that they can see that, yes, i've spent 30 years, actually maybe a little more, working to help kids and families. and i want to take all that experience to the white house and do that every single day.
margaret talev (bloomberg news/@margarettalev): yeah. but shutdown light happens to affect border agents and tsa agents at a time of the year when both of those issues, one for travel reasons, the other for political and policy reasons are very much on everyone's mind. there are kind of two factors that i see at play here, and one is that the president himself has been fascinated with the idea of how to use a shutdown to get a message across for months. maybe for more than a year, let's say, basically since the beginning of the administration. so, inside the white house as well as on the hill, a lot of republicans are like, don't do it, it's a bad idea, and-- and he keeps-- he is so attracted to the idea. on the other hand, he wants to be having the fight with democrats, not with his own party. it's easier to have the fight with democrats when democrats are in charge. so, i think if there's a patch of four weeks or something like that, that's the fight that he gets to have. and-- and maybe that's the way this will shake out.
parents are not going to send their 14-year-old daughters into the shower or bathroom with 14-year-old boys. it's not going to happen, said patrick, who added that mr. obama is probably paying back the lesbian, gay and transgender community that helped him defeat hillary clinton in 2008 or he believes in this policy.

i think it's been hard for mitt romney to close the deal because he has had such an inconsistent record compared to what he's saying today, tyler said. i don't know that i want to say he's a phony, but i don't understand how, why he could be so inconsistent.

still, the texas court case would potentially eliminate many more aca provisions, including the premium subsidies so many exchange customers rely on, essential health benefits and medicaid expansion, said eliot fishman, senior director of health policy at families usa. that said, fishman believes the court case will take time, so consumers who are planning on signing up for exchange coverage for 2019 at the end of this year should not be dissuaded from doing so.
you know, because it sounds like you're in the business or you're aware of people in the business — you know that we are now for the first time ever energy-independent. we are not dependent upon the middle east. but the middle east still controls a lot of the prices. so the price of oil has been way down. and that has had a damaging effect on a lot of the oil companies, right? we are, however, producing a lot of natural gas, which serves as a bridge to more renewable fuels. and i think that's an important transition.
tiffany trump: i mean i don't think we can really prepare for our father becoming president. but we were all there together with everyone that's worked so hard. and my dad has worked so hard. and it's just – it's really awe-inspiring.
there are several ways for the republican party to evolve. the new firebrands who have captured the attention of the nation may be at the start of a conservative constitutional revolution in the party. or they may be taking a party that is shrinking and driving it to an ever-narrower base of tea party loyalists that represent about a fifth of the country. or, washington is a sideshow and the republicans in the states who actually have to accomplish something are where the real long-term energy in the party is. that was the message jindal came to town to sell. it remains to be seen whether he or another pragmatic republican governor can get back behind the steering wheel.
cbs this morning host charlie rose asked conway thursday: did [trump] believe it?
but yet, we know that talks are good, but i just don't see this president- when you look at what happened in iran when he got out of that agreement and we were 10 minutes away from war and a month away from them blowing the caps when it comes to uranium- enriching uranium. when you look what he did with the nuclear agreement with russia, he is constantly- climate change pulling us back from working with our allies to try to solve these problems.
in the past, we have foolishly released hundreds and hundreds of dangerous terrorists, only to meet them again on the battlefield -- including the isis leader, al-baghdadi, who we captured, who we had, who we released.
i know that when people tell him it can't be done, that guarantees he's going to get it done. i know that when someone tells him that something is impossible that's what triggers him into action, he said. rather than give up he changed the entire skyline of new york. i've seen it time and time again... that look in his eyes when someone says it can't be done.
lesley stahl: ok, but what about – they're in every city.
unfortunately, we are just not in a position to confirm any of the numbers that are coming out of china, o'brien said, after acknowledging the relationship between xi and mr. trump. there's no way to confirm any of those numbers. there's lots of public reporting on whether the numbers are too low. you've got access to those reports that are coming out of the chinese social media and some of the few reporters that are left in china. we just have no way to confirm any of those numbers.
ray emory marco garcia/ap ray emory (c. 1921-may 13, 2018) lived through the early morning japanese aerial bombing at pearl harbor on december 7, 1941, firing rounds at attacking airplanes, but he never forgot those who didn't survive. he spent the past few decades doggedly pushing to identify unknown remains and have them returned to their families. in 2003, the military agreed to dig up a casket that emory (who'd meticulously studied records) was convinced included the remains of multiple servicemen who'd died on the uss oklahoma. emory was right, and five sailors were identified. it helped lay the foundation for the pentagon's decision more than a decade later to exhume and attempt to identify all 388 sailors and marines from the ship, who had been buried as unknowns in a national cemetery in honolulu. since those exhumations, 138 sailors have been identified, though dna testing and other methods. about 77 have been reburied, many in their hometowns, bringing closure to families across the country. these guys got killed in battle for their country and they should be so recognized, period, emory told luke burbank for npr's morning edition in 2005. emory, who recently moved to boise, idaho, to live with his son, visited pearl harbor one last time in june (pictured), where more than 500 sailors stood side-by-side on ships and piers to surprise him, greeting him with salutes and cheers.

fact check: false. to this day, no one has said they've seen bombs in the apartment of the san bernardino shooters' apartment. an unidentified man noted that he saw suspicious activity surrounding their apartment, but made no mention of weapons or anything actionable. as the man told cbs' los angeles affiliate, we noticed, one day like six middle eastern guys walk by across the street, kind of dressed nice, and they would walk around and go over to state street and eat there, because i saw them eating there when i went to the paint store, and we sat around thinking what're those guys doing in this neighborhood?

kelsey snell: i mean i was out in several of these majority maker districts, districts where the democrats beat republicans in 2018. and i talked to voters there who say when they hear the word democrat they hear socialist and they don't make those distinctions. they don't hear the policies. they hear the word. and i saw people showing up at town halls yelling-- abigail spanberger in virginia out there at her town hall had people showing up and, specifically, wanting to ask her, are you a socialist? you're a democrat, does that mean you're a socialist? that's not something that, you know, moderates like her want to talk about.
very soon, auto plants and other plants will be opening up all over our country. this is all news americans are totally unaccustomed to hearing. for many years, companies and jobs were only leaving us. but now they are roaring back. they're coming back. they want to be where the action is. they want to be in the united states of america. that's where they want to be.
by siding with the republican attorneys-general who are seeking to invalidate the aca in the u.s. supreme court, trump has made clear where his priorities lie. not with protecting the millions of people who depend on the exchanges for their health coverage. not with ensuring that more than 100 million people with pre-existing conditions won't be denied coverage or charged more by their insurers. not with the thousands of americans who may develop new 'pre-existing conditions' due to their battle with covid-19. not with the young people who can now stay on their parents insurance until 26. not with women, who will no longer be protected against being charged more for their insurance, presumptive democratic presidential nominee joe biden said in a statement.

the following is a transcript of the interview with independent sen. bernie sanders of vermont that aired sunday, march 31, 2019, on face the nation
the legislation is laced with provisions reflecting divided power in washington. republicans maintained the status quo on several abortion-related battles and on funding for mr. trump's border wall. democrats controlling the house succeeded in winning a 3.1% raise for federal civilian employees and $25 million for gun violence research after more than two decades of gun lobby opposition.
priebus suggested that republicans care more about improving the country than democrats do and he blasted hillary clinton, her policies and what her administration would mean for the nation.
in january 2018, former democratic senator al franken resigned amid sexual misconduct allegations. on tuesday, minnesotans will choose who will compete in a fall special election to complete the remainder of franken's senate term through 2020. depending on tuesday's results, this could shape up to be a race between two female candidates -- incumbent democratic senator tina smith, who gov. mark dayton appointed to fill franken's seat after he resigned, and republican state senator karin housley.
a quinnipiac poll released this week did show that american voters favor a generic democrat on the 2014 ballot over a generic republican by nine points -- the widest democratic margin so far in this cycle. that said, a generic ballot like that should be taken with a large grain of salt. in 2012, house democrats actually won 1.36 million more votes than republicans, but it didn't matter because of the way districts are gerrymandered.
lesley stahl: and that's what it was like. (laugh) and, you know, you have this--
but of course they can, because while it's certainly true that the democratic party is moving left in many ways, they're running a host of only moderately liberal candidates in november. this includes vulnerable incumbent democratic senators like joe manchin and on tester, as well as numerous house candidates who, like lamb, have military and intelligence backgrounds.
i said in december that i wouldn't vote for a cr without the dream act, and i won't do so now, she said in a statement released by her office. i'm also hopeful that we can get away from continuing resolutions and get back to regular order. we can't solve problems by funding the government a few weeks at a time. as a longtime member of the appropriations committee, i know the importance of funding the military and government agencies for a full-year.
still, the president needs the support of congress as he looks towards for major infrastructure funding, border wall funding and other priorities mr. trump has placed on his agenda for 2018. congress and the administration only have weeks to find a legislative solution to the deferred action for childhood arrivals (daca) program, and some democrats and republicans have already all but deemed the legislative framework the white house presented thursday as dead on arrival.
margaret brennan: we'll be right back with our political panel.
we've had to get very, very creative with executive powers to try to figure out what we can do to substantially affect the health care costs and bring it down through executive action, meadows said. it's more of an executive action with a legislative component that is more visionary.

nevada's democratic governor steve sisolak late wednesday released a letter that was sent to vice president mike pence decrying mr. trump's recent campaign rallies in the state, expressing confusion and utter disbelief over rallies held in defiance of the state's caps on mass gatherings and social distancing guidelines, reports cbs news campaign reporter alex tin. the president has repeatedly denounced nevada's governor after the campaign's initial plans ran afoul of nevada's coronavirus measures, accusing sisolak of being a political person in a recent white house briefing and linking his criticism to the state's recent move to expand mail-in voting amid the pandemic. it's the secretary of state here, who happens to be a republican, who oversees the election here as well as our administrators, our local registrars, nevada attorney general aaron ford, a democrat, told fox news. there won't be any cheating on behalf of the governor or anyone here.
if hillary clinton can't give us the truth, why should she give us the presidency? she said. that's right, hillary for prison. she deserves to be in stripes.

jonah goldberg: i-- i think it is perfectly in keeping. and, you know, when he says i don't want to jeopardize this hundred and ten billion dollars in orders to-- i wish someone would ask him, okay, so how many journalists does saudi arabia get to kill before it might jeopardize it, right? i mean, this is a problem with the rhetoric. and it's also a problem with the relationship and it makes a lot of sense to me or at least it's perfectly defensible to have a better relationship with saudi arabia to work this out as a counter aid to iran, all of those things are fine or at least defensible. but it has to be-- when you get into this situation, it is clear that no one communicated to saudi arabia that if we're going to go down this path you cannot embarrass us or put us in a situation like this. and so now we're at this stage where there are no really very good options, the white house is in a bind on this. and it's because they went down this cul-de-sac to begin with without a proper line of communication, someone led the saudia arabian government to believe that they could get away with this that this wouldn't be a problem. and that's why it's a mess now.
stephen miller: --continue to take advantage--
one of them, a lifelong republican who by his own admission would be a ted cruz or marco rubio man explained his support for trump over the rest of the gop field by listing a litany of letdowns from the republican party (immigration, foreign interventions) and instances of gross incompetence by the government in general—they can't pay the bills, can't balance the budget, can't fix obamacare, and so on.
even the pre-rally soundtrack is not what you would expect at a republican political rally, where country music often plays on a loop. trump's playlist typically consists of opera, adele, elton john and selections from thephantom of the opera soundtrack. the playlist is handpicked by trump and sometimes is at odds with his audience. at a november rally in beaumont, texas - a number of attendees tried to implore the audio technician to play better music. the beatles' hey jude, elicited a more positive reaction -- many started waving phones in the air.
during a daylong visit to the white house by the cast of the broadway hit hamilton, its star and writer-composer, lin-manuel miranda, joined the president in the rose garden for some freestyling.

but as cnn notes, after mr. trump made a not-so-subtle threat that he might oppose heller's re-election efforts if he bucked him on health care, heller softened his criticism of the president and voted to repeal obamacare and to reform the tax code. mr. trump ultimately endorsed heller and helped convince danny tarkanian, his primary republican challenger, to run for the house instead. although his worst primary fears were averted, heller's support for mr. trump's policies may hurt him in the general election.

margaret brennan: jamal, last time you were on you were talking about some of the limits though of bernie's appeal.
medicaid, the federal-state program that currently covers more than 70 million low-income people, would cease to be an open-ended federal entitlement. though federal funding would be limited, states would get more leeway to run their programs. a richer funding stream for adults newly covered under former president barack obama's law would be eliminated.
susan glasser: well, that's right. it's interesting that he started to-- to do so, as you know, his major health care initiative failed, essentially, which was the repeal of obamacare, which was something that president trump as well as republican party for years campaigned upon, it failed by a single vote. trump is still interestingly bashing the late senator john mccain for his decisive vote on that. he did that in an interview with fox this week, you know, even because he understands that, you know, they haven't really come up with a convincing answer to it. interestingly, tax cuts doesn't figure on that list. i did-- that-- call it crazy or what you want, effort of binge-watching all six hours and fifty-one minutes of president trump's six rallies so far. there was another one last night for my column in the new yorker this week. so that's almost seven hours of trump. interestingly, tax cuts which was going to be the centerpiece of republican campaigns, generally, came in at about the fifty-one-minute mark to his rallies. these are not about--
so, you talk about friend? go back and take a look at those commercials, a race where you lost fair and square, unlike the bernie sanders race, where you won, but not fair and square, in my opinion. and all you have to do is take a look at wikileaks and just see what they say about bernie sanders and see what deborah wasserman schultz had in mind, because bernie sanders, between super-delegates and deborah wasserman schultz, he never had a chance. and i was so surprised to see him sign on with the devil.
it sounds to me like one of your objectives is to never allow the justice department to be used as a political weapon. that's what you're saying you think happened here?
will immigration controversy spark more republicans to stand up to trump?
potentially working against barrett is her relatively short tenure in federal court. the notre dame law school graduate has only served on the u.s. court of appeals for the seventh circuit since fall 2017. because she has served on the bench for such a short period of time, she has few opinions to dissect that could offer insight into her judicial philosophy and predict potential future positions.
we're going to do it; we're going to do it, the president said, though not with the vigor that marks his signature lines. he said he was determined to get the legislation passed in some form.
he said democrats are interested in gaining power and control over the american people by growing the federal government.
puzder also has drawn brickbats for airing racy tv ads featuring scantily clad models munching hamburgers, which democrats castigated as showing no respect for women. puzder's response: i like beautiful women eating burgers in bikinis.

margaret brennan: but is there room for democrats to work on those sort of issue specific things with republicans?
raddatz: and, secretary clinton, i do want to follow up on e- mails. you've said your handing of your e-mails was a mistake. you disagreed with fbi director james comey, calling your handling of classified information, quote, extremely careless. the fbi said that there were 110 classified e-mails that were exchanged, eight of which were top secret, and that it was possible hostile actors did gain access to those e-mails. you don't call that extremely careless?
ripping the electoral college out of the constitution, packing the u.s. supreme court and wiping out the party of lincoln wouldn't have sounded extreme three years ago. no, it would have sounded insane.
i am finally seeking this help after struggling to do so in the past, and i am ready to admit that i, like countless other americans, suffer from this disease. hard work and determination — which have brought me success in life — have not been enough to win this battle. other than being a wife, mother, and grandmother, the most important job in the world to me is representing my fellow arizonans. i know i must get better in order to do my best in each of these roles, kirkpatrick wrote in a statement.
donald trump: it-- it's irrelevant because it was already settled. it's law. it was settled in the supreme court. i mean it's done.
the white house has signaled other issues the president will raise by the guests invited to watch the speech from a seat in the first lady's box in the gallery of the house chamber.
the trial is set for tuesday.
like a lot of trump rhetoric, it isn't entirely accurate. it claims, for instance, that elizabeth warren's medicare for all plan would cost taxpayers 52 trillion dollars – undoubtedly raising taxes on the middle class to pay for it. the plan she released specifically avoids increasing taxes on the middle class.
certainly not everyone has prospered. overall, the median household income has dropped since 2009 by $1,268, to $53,657.
but the republican national committee issued a statement highlighting what it described as voter fraud that could result from vote-by-mail. while we have always supported absentee voting, california is a case study in why automatically sending this many ballots is a problem, the rnc statement said. just last year, a court found that l.a. county had 1.5 million ineligible voters on their registration lists, meaning there were 112% more registered voters than adults living in the county. we are weighing our legal options to ensure the integrity of the election. trump campaign communications director tim murtaugh made a similar argument, calling it a thinly-veiled political tactic by newsom to undermine election security. there's a vast difference between people voting absentee by mail because they can't be at the polls on election day versus mailing everyone a ballot, murtaugh said. sending everyone a ballot - even those who didn't request one - is a wide open opportunity for fraud.
this generated an average annual fiscal deficit (benefits received minus taxes paid) of around $14,387 per household, their analysis said. this cost had to be borne by u.s. taxpayers. amnesty would provide unlawful households with access to over 80 means-tested welfare programs, obamacare, social security, and medicare. the fiscal deficit for each household would soar.
ted cruz: we have seen now in six years of obamacare that it has been a disaster. it is the biggest job-killer in this country. millions of americans have lost their jobs, have been forced into part-time work, have lost their health insurance, have lost their doctors, have seen their premiums skyrocket. 
the city saw a declining population due to the loss of factory jobs, but it has increased since buttigieg took office. he has focused on improving higher education and health care in the city. in the video announcing his exploratory committee, buttigieg emphasizes the need for a fresh start in american politics. he also discusses the issues important to him as a member of the millennial generation, saying: we're the generation that lived through school shootings, that served in the wars after 9/11, and we're the generation that stands to be the first to make less than our parents. unless we do something different. controversy buttigieg has very little controversy around him, other than his age and sexual orientation, which some consider to be automatic strikes against him. in his first term as mayor, he dealt with a scandal at the local police department, which led him to demote the first african american chief of police of south bend. what trump says president trump has not tweeted about or insulted buttigieg as of now.
i ask hillary, why doesn't — she made $250 million by being in office. she used the power of her office to make a lot of money. why isn't she funding, not for $100 million, but why don't you put $10 million or $20 million or $25 million or $30 million into your own campaign?

raddatz: but what would you do differently than president obama is doing?
there are gubernatorial primaries in maine, nevada and south carolina. in maine, four republicans and seven democrats are running to succeed gov. paul lepage. maine now uses a ranked-choice system. the wall street journal explained how this works: in contests with three or more candidates, voters rank the candidates in order of preference. if no candidate gets more than 50% of the first-choice votes, a process is triggered in which the lowest-ranked candidate is eliminated. the voters whose first choice was eliminated then have their ballots reallocated to their next highest-ranking choice. this process continues until two candidates are left and someone has majority support.
trump announced the campaign promotions early wednesday morning, after a week of plunging poll numbers and controversies surrounding campaign chair paul manafort and his connections to foreign firms. manafort, according to conway, is still there as chairman and retains his title.

a three-judge panel ruled tuesday that the new york democratic presidential primary may proceed as planned on june 23rd. cbs news campaign reporter nicole sganga says the decision by the u.s. court of appeals for the second circuit follows new york state's appeal of a federal judge's order last month that required new york state hold its election, returning all qualified candidates – including senator bernie sanders – to the ballot. we have reviewed all of the remaining arguments raised by defendants on appeal and find them to be without merit, judges wrote in a joint decision, tuesday. new york state board of elections co-chair douglas kellner confirmed another appeal would not be filed following the opinion.
margaret brennan: you're watching all of this.
he told the magazine he believes democrats lost the presidency in 2016 because they failed to listen. i would say we get the government we deserve in a democracy, he said. and if we want better government we have to engage, and a lot of folks have been disengaging for a long time, and not without reason.

financial forms for amy kennedy, who's running against jeff van drew in new jersey's 2nd, show investments with several corporations that are either based in or work with chinese companies. a majority of these are made through the buena vista asian opportunity hedge fund, and include two education-related companies and a state-owned life insurance company. the value of her listed assets collectively ranges from $20,000 to $120,000. earlier this month, the national republican congressional committee sent out a press email with a story about her assets calling her a pawn of communist china. kennedy's campaign did not respond to a request for comment.
we share the view of working to ensure that individuals with pre-existing conditions can have access to affordable health insurance, azar said. the president has always shared that and we look forward to working with congress under all circumstances towards achieving that.
so we're going to get a special prosecutor, and we're going to look into it, because you know what? people have been — their lives have been destroyed for doing one-fifth of what you've done. and it's a disgrace. and honestly, you ought to be ashamed of yourself.
in an article published tuesday, former congressman henry waxman, former health and human services deputy secretary bill corr and former adviser to the department of health and human services kristi marin expressed similar concerns even while praising the overall efforts. as a package, the proposals could help decrease patient costs for drugs and reduce federal spending … but it's likely that more policies will be needed to control the drivers of drug spending, the trio wrote.
senator ben sasse: yeah. i mean you're right. i mean the-- the senate should be an institution of a hundred people who get sent from their communities where they really are from and want to return to. and they go and have to build relationships and build a temporary community in the senate of people who actually listen to one another. we don't do that very much right now because cable tv news has swallowed the senate whole. right now, we live this sort of frenzied media circus--that's not to beat up on the media, that's to beat up on the senate as a place that people are more thinking about those distant tribes and the things we're screaming at each other against, rather than the things we should be for together. you should be for the place where you're from, the neighborhood in the city or the small town farming community where i am from. but when you're temporarily thrown together in a new community the senate should be a place that actually does some empathy and we're pretty crappy at that right now.
our sunday profile this morning is of nikki haley, our outspoken ambassador to the united nations. she talks with rita braver:
donald trump: well, i would say there was more than one thing, there were three things, it was healthcare, there was immigration and there was a major tax bill lowering taxes in this country. we're going to substantially simplify and lower the taxes--
cory booker cory booker launches 2020 campaign 02:57 biography cory booker was born in washington in 1964 and raised in the affluent suburbs of northern new jersey. he received a bachelor's degree in political science and a master's degree in sociology from stanford university, where he also played tight end for the football team. after graduation, booker was awarded a rhodes scholarship to study at the university of oxford, earning a master's degree in modern history. he returned to the u.s. for a law degree at yale. after working as a public-interest attorney and housing advocate in newark, booker decided to run for the city's municipal council in 1998. he managed to topple a long-time incumbent and, at age 29, become the youngest-ever member of the council, where he gained notoriety for fasting outside a housing project to denounce the intensifying crime and drug use in some of newark's neighborhoods. after launching an unsuccessful bid in 2002 against incumbent mayor sharpe james, booker ran again in 2006 and defeated deputy mayor ronald rice. during his seven-year tenure as mayor, booker was praised for attracting large companies to newark and revamping the city's downtown. but he was also criticized by local residents and officials for appearing out-of-touch and focusing on his national image. the only way you can see the mayor is if you turn on 'meet the press,' newark's current mayor, ras baraka, said when he was a councilman during booker's mayoral administration.
some politicians advocate offering tax credits to purchase individual health insurance or allowing citizens to put money away for insurance in health savings accounts. at best, these are band-aid solutions to america's health care challenges. they don't come close to overcoming the two health care elephants, particularly for low- and middle-income citizens.
jamelle bouie (the new york times/@jbouie/cbs news political analyst): right. right.

lesley stahl: it kind of just took your breath away? couldn't talk?
volinsky, running as a progressive who has supported the black lives matter movement, said in an apology he recognizes there's a different context to calling past, white nominees unqualified. there is a long history of black people who have been unfairly dismissed as 'unqualified'; i failed to take that context into account when opposing these nominees. i look forward to engaging in honest and candid dialogue with black lives matter manchester and take to heart their criticisms about my words, he wrote.
lesley stahl: but personal. i'm talking about man to man--
democrats are happy to be discussing health care, two days after attorney general william barr dealt a blow to the president's opponents by revealing that the special counsel investigation found no instance of collusion with russia during the 2016 election. the justice department also determined that the president had not obstructed justice, though mueller did not reach a conclusion in the matter. the trump administration's newly stated policy on obamacare allows democrats to pivot to talking about an issue with which they stand on firmer ground.
the fact of the matter is health care is personal to me. obamacare is personal to me. when i see the president try to tear it down — and others propose to replace it and start over — that's personal to me too, biden says in the ad.
trump has flirted with running for president numerous times before, but he's never quite taken the plunge. now that he's officially in the race, he said tuesday, he feels liberated.
the utah senator's endorsement of cruz, which came just hours before a republican debate, is a blow to the campaign of florida senator marco rubio, who had courted and co-sponsored legislation with lee. the press conference's location in the debate spin room guaranteed the presence of over two dozen cameras with the major cable networks carrying lee's remarks live. earlier in february, lee campaigned with both rubio and cruz in south carolina.
margaret brennan: and don't expect a wholesale plan until after 2020?
speaker pelosi criticized attorney general william barr's summary of the report as condescending and arrogant and said it wasn't the right thing to do.
joe biden: what's happening is you have steyer spending hundreds of millions, tens of thousands of dollars, millions of dollars, out campaigning there. and so i think a lot's happening in terms of the amount of money being spent by the billionaires to try to cut into the african-american vote. i think that has a lot to do with it.
susan page: you know when president obama was very unpopular to midterm he started to stay out of the news. when president george w. bush was unpopular to midterm, he tried to stay away. president trump is as unpopular as they were and he is pushing himself out there in a way we've never seen a president for a midterm election. for a president who's been four or five days a week doing rallies around the country it makes it impossible for this election not to be about him.
paul ryan: we did. we passed a bill. it's sitting in the senate. they've-- they've filibustered--
margaret brennan: all right. ambassador o'brien, thank you for joining us.
but republicans argue the situation this year differs from that of four years ago, as the same party controls the white house and the senate. mr. trump has also said nine justices are needed if the supreme court is tasked with deciding the outcome of the presidential election, which it did in 2000.
paul ryan: they don't get paid--
well, i think they are bigger because i hope that it sends the message that there is one standard of justice in this country. and that's the way it will be. it doesn't matter what political party you're in, or, you know, whether you're rich or poor. we will follow the same standard for everybody. was there a crime committed, do we believe a crime was committed? and do we have the evidence to prove it beyond a reasonable doubt? and we don't think either of those standards were applicable here.
your all or none approach is hurting hard-working americans who need help now, mnuchin said.
meanwhile, the democratic house campaign arm has made it clear that in the 167 days until election day, they will be focused on health care. in a joint memo with virtually all campaign arms up and down the ballot, democrats say they'll continue to bring up the ongoing legal efforts to eliminate obamacare and the votes of congressional republicans to repeal the affordable care act. it is the worst possible time to try to dismantle our health care system. but republicans at every level of the ballot are fighting in court to take away people's health care – or blocking millions of working families from life-saving medicaid coverage, a joint statement by the committee chairs reads.
we are adoptive parents and we deal with a lot with medical issues and learning disabilities that are not covered by private insurance that we struggle to get help with, christi said while admitting private insurance right now is a great thing to keep.
clinton: now, maybe because he has praised putin, maybe because he says he agrees with a lot of what putin wants to do, maybe because he wants to do business in moscow, i don't know the reasons. but we deserve answers. and we should demand that donald release all of his tax returns so that people can see what are the entanglements and the financial relationships that he has...
congress controls the nation's purse strings. that, slok notes, could produce quite a changed landscape in what's possible with congress.
we passed in december funding for these natural disasters and the hurricanes, and the senate democrats have been filibustering these bills. so the point i'm trying to make, john, is the senate democrats have chosen: filibuster chip, filibuster appropriations, filibuster getting these things done. and then blame the dysfunction on everybody else.
according to leader, women on both ends of the political spectrum are unusually energized this year … a trend that has been building since 1980, when ronald reagan won the presidency. women have always been very committed to voting, she said. at least since 1980, they've been outvoting men. but i think this level of the sense 'our vote is fundamental to the future' is new and different.
president donald trump: --where we're heading.
sen. scott: --instead of what the democrats keep doing, is access--
trump's campaign provided no proposals from the candidate specific to social security's financing or benefits design. instead, it reiterated his campaign positions about building the wall, reforming individual and corporate income taxes, renegotiating trade agreements, reforming immigration policies, repealing obamacare and repealing the dodd-frank act, which reformed the financial industry following the recent financial crisis.
a year after president donald trump was sworn into office, he continues to receive historically low and highly partisan approval ratings, despite widely positive views of the economy. he gets at least some credit for the economy, but most americans don't feel they've personally benefitted from his policies – only 22 percent think they've been directly helped.
kirsten gillibrand sen. kirstin gillibrand announces 2020 presid... 09:35 biography kirsten gillibrand, born in 1966, is not the first woman in her family to become involved in politics. her grandmother, polly noonan, was the founder of the influential albany democratic club and was a major player in albany mayor erastus corning's political machine. gillibrand, the daughter of two attorneys, was raised in albany. she attended dartmouth university and ucla school of law. gillibrand worked at the private manhattan-based law firm davis polk in the early 1990s, although she took a brief leave in 1992 to serve as a law clerk to circuit court judge roger miner, a ronald reagan appointee. she served as special counsel to then-hud secretary andrew cuomo in the final year of the clinton administration. she was a strong supporter of hillary clinton, and worked on her 2000 senate campaign. clinton became a mentor to gillibrand, and encouraged gillibrand to run for office in 2006 rather than in 2004, believing that running two years later would give her a greater chance of winning. gillibrand defeated four-term rep. john sweeney, who represented a conservative district, in 2006. gillibrand was a moderate congresswoman and a member of the conservative democrat blue dog caucus. she supported a bill to withhold funds from sanctuary cities, and received a 100 percent rating from the national rifle association. after clinton left the senate in 2009 to become secretary of state, gov. david paterson appointed gillibrand to replace her.
the u.s job market has been a bright spot in recent months, helping drive the unemployment rate to its lowest level in years. and, notably, it is small and midsize businesses that have led the way. we look at why the stronger hiring by smaller companies is such a good sign for the economy.
there are two steps here, the democratic presidential front-runner said in a televised town hall on cnn. if someone can afford to pay for an insurance policy off the exchanges that were set up under the affordable care act, i support that.

in the house, he was a member of the pro-business new democrat coalition and received donations from the oil industry, which will likely not bode well with progressives who are pressuring the democratic party to support more audacious efforts, like the green new deal, to mitigate climate change. during his senate campaign, o'rourke refused to back medicare for all, a proposal many 2020 democrats have vouched their support for. medicare for all emerges as first litmus test for 2020 democratic contenders

both hhs secretary alex azar ii and seema verma, administrator of the centers for medicare and medicaid services, both public critics of obamacare, said recently the trump administration should be credited for these improvements. president trump tweeted the same.
i would also consider arming the kurds. the kurds have been our best partners in syria, as well as iraq. and i know there's a lot of concern about that in some circles, but i think they should have the equipment they need so that kurdish and arab fighters on the ground are the principal way that we take raqqa after pushing isis out of iraq.

no matter which supreme court seat was vacated, from anthony kennedy to elena kagan, team trump was going to pick a brett kavanaugh or raymond kethledge or amy coney barrett -- just as if hillary had won, she'd want another ruth bader ginsburg or sonia sotomayor.

it's largely democrats who have become more negative about the trump presidency. republicans are mostly positive about the president's first year: eight in 10 republicans approve of the job donald trump is doing and most are just as optimistic with him in office now as they were right before he was sworn in as president. seven in 10 say he has been a very good or good president.

the president suggested more accusers could come out against the former vice president in the future. he'll probably have others come out. he might, trump said. at this point, reade is the only woman who has ever alleged that biden sexually assaulted her.
that's not stopping democrats from featuring health care in the campaign's earliest ads.
but what the president doesn't mention is that since he took office, the number of deaths has continued to rise. from june 2016 to june 2017 the number of overdose deaths increased by 16 percent, to 66,817.

both sides regularly say they want infrastructure progress. vice president mike pence told the hill this week the administration wants to push ahead with infrastructure during the lame-duck session following the election. while mr. trump's approach may be different from house democrats' vision, the shared goal may leave room for a joint effort, rep. steny hoyer, a maryland democrat, told the new york times.
removing the tax penalty and opening up more affordable options was able to save taxpayer dollars, give families more choice, without destabilizing the exchanges, he said.
to make matters worse, you have no plan, you can't produce a document, you can't give us a detail, you're skirting the issues and all we are getting are talking points, said democratic representative raul ruiz of california.
trump has left the white house
former president obama released a video urging people to enroll under the aca on twitter this week, mentioning the memes, the funny interviews, and the stunts he has used in the past to push the uninsured to enroll and get insurance coverage. the aca was his signature domestic legislative accomplishment.
steve bannon added to national security team
asked whether there are enough votes in congress for an infrastructure spending program, republican sen. marco rubio of florida said it depends. he said it would be very difficult if all of the $1 trillion were to be funded by taxpayer money.
9:03 p.m. et republican national committee chairman reince priebus attempted to present a stark contrast between with the gop would offer americans and what would happen to the country if democrats continue to occupy the white house.
the president said that he's urging the supreme court to overturn the affordable care act when it's taken up in the supreme court later this year. what's your position? is that something the justice department will continue to back?
the court wrestled with whether it could get rid of just the government-debt restriction or would have to invalidate the entire ban on cellphone robocalls. no one wants robocalls on their cellphone, roberts said, though he typically votes for the challengers in free-speech cases.

in december, texas-based u.s. district judge reed o'connor agreed with republicans that congress had rendered the law unconstitutional when it zeroed out the tax penalty imposed on those who didn't buy insurance. the law's supporters appealed.
for all the sound and fury of trump and his twitter feed, it has signified very little when it comes to our democratic institutions. trump haters are right when they argue that he presents an unusual -- even extreme -- test of america's political institutions. where they are wrong is conflating my team is losing with the system is failing and must be destroyed!
biden: we'll see. i mean, look, you guys love this stuff. i'm not into this. let's just see what happens.
questioned about mr. trump's historically low approval ratings just as he takes office, the california republican dismissed the recent polling.

indiana republican mike braun is not a witch. he hasn't suggested second amendment remedies for an overreaching congress, nor does he have anything to say about legitimate rape.
margaret brennan: you're in republican leadership. senator john cornyn, your colleague, said there's no plan right now from the white house. did you hear a plan here today, do you know what the white house is asking you to do?
vice president mike pence: lesley, president trump is a man who speaks his mind. i think it's one of the great strengths that he's had--
still, barrett is likely to face pointed questions about obamacare from democrats when she testifies before the senate judiciary committee next month.
margaret brennan: so, that could be a-- another compromise like senator susan collins was out there talking about a two and a half billion-dollar compromise rather than the five billion that the president is asking for.
anthony salvanto: so, underneath that shrinking lead for joe biden you just described there's two big things. one is while he's still on top with african-american voters who will make up most of the democrats in this primary, that lead is so much smaller now, and he's got to share a lot of that support now with bernie sanders and with tom steyer. also, when you look at who black voters think understands their concerns. well, that's still joe biden, but it's also increasingly bernie sanders they say and also tom steyer. the other part of this is frankly not winning. this is the mechanics of momentum that all the pundits talk about. voters in south carolina say they think it's less likely that joe biden will ultimately win the democratic nomination so that makes them start to look at other candidates and think, okay, what is it that those other voters in those other states know that we should maybe reassess?
health care is on their mind every day, and i understand that, tucker said of area voters in an interview.
it's also running in florida as part of an ad partnership with everytown for gun safety victory fund. at the same time, the super pac meidastouch started airing an ad wednesday that includes clips of president trump promising to repeal and replace obamacare on the 2016 campaign trail before moving on to clips as mr. trump as president promising to unveil a health care plan. in the years since efforts to repeal and replace obamacare failed in congress in 2017, the president has said on numerous occasions republicans would put forward their own health care plan, but it has not yet happened.

the biggest winners will be the more than 11 million people already enrolled in obamacare as well as those who are now shopping for healthcare.gov coverage. biden has opened up a special sign-up period through may 15.

what seems to work best for doing business in the exchanges is a strategy of offering smaller networks of providers, including primary care physicians and specialists, to keep costs low. while this often results in lower premiums, it can also mean consumers have trouble finding their doctors in a plan's network, or they may not have access to the specialists they need. this is especially true in areas where only one or two insurers are participating in an exchange, said corlette.
the senate is seen as a moderating influence. and president donald trump, who once promised insurance for everybody, will have to weigh the specifics of what he's lately acknowledged is a complicated issue.
in kentucky, republican governor matt bevin is looking to keep his job amid a strong challenge from democrat andy beshear, the state's attorney general. meanwhile in mississippi, democrat jim hood could pull off an upset win against republican lieutenant governor tate reeves, the gop's gubernatorial nominee.
divesting his company holdings. this is a thorny and potentially time-consuming problem because cke is not a public traded company. the goal is to prevent any possible conflict of interest with regulating an investment puzder might hold, such as interest in a fast-food enterprise with thousands of employees.
biden: look, you guys can do all the pontificating about what it means. i'm not going to- that's not my job. my job is to go in and make the best case i can. and i think we're gonna do well, and i think we're going to go on to super tuesday and do very well.
joe biden: we're alive, and we're coming back, and we're going to win.
average premiums under the bill would increase in the nongroup market before 2020 and decrease after that, cbo said. average premiums for single people under benchmark plans, for example, would be about 20 percent higher next year and 10 percent higher in 2019, compared to current law. by contrast, cbo said that in 2020, average premiums for single people under benchmark plans would be about 30 percent lower than under current law. by 2026, the analysis projects such premiums will be 20 percent lower than under obamacare.
senator john barrasso: you know as a doctor people say to me what does this mean to me. and for right now, very little if you're a doctor, if you're getting treatment, if you have a preexisting condition, if you signed up for obamacare on this recent sign up period, it doesn't change a thing.
sen. klobuchar: well what that means is because you have an administration - and you just heard it - that basically is standing while the house is burning down and instead of going in there and putting out the fire they're throwing lighter fluid on it in terms of tweets and rhetoric and things they're saying. the ruling was absurd. justice roberts and a conservative court has already ruled that the affordable care act is constitutional unlike what mr. miller said. and in fact you can have part of it not exist and you can still have the rest of it protect americans. and that is exactly where this is headed and i can say that this is about first of all throwing people off of their insurance. no protection with preexisting conditions, kids staying on their parent's insurance until they're 26 years old. a very popular and important protection. medicaid expanded for millions of americans. that's what we're talking about here. and for them just to throw up their hands and say, well i'd be great if we just started from scratch. that's not what the american people believe. just look at the results from the last election.
where is the line? when are you guys going to say enough and stand up and saying, 'i'm not backing any of this,' amy haskins of manning, who identified herself as an independent, asked ernst, berating ernst and her senate colleagues. you still stand there silent, and your silence is supporting him and not standing up. you swore an oath. you didn't pledge an oath to the president. you pledged it to our country. you pledged it to our constitution, she said to applause.
already on the docket for the supreme court this term are blockbuster disputes involving the affordable care act and special counsel robert mueller's investigation into russian meddling in the 2016 election. court watchers are also warning the 2020 general election could bring with it a legal battle that puts the supreme court in the middle of the contest between mr. trump and former vice president joe biden.
he wants you to believe that he's not under investigation, he said. why would an undercover fbi agent posing as a contractor give him a $1,000 ticket to 'hamilton?'
lesley stahl: what about vacations? you're not going to take any vacations? you've said that.
margaret brennan: we're also seeing the financial market show some nervousness right now about the trade dispute with china, about slowdown in europe, about brexit, where do we start the new year on the foreign policy front, ed?
just last week vice president biden warned the american people that president trump could use the current crisis as an excuse to postpone the november election. well, he now has a precedent thanks to new york state.
when the law was proposed, friends and foes of obamacare agreed that the tax was essential to persuade healthy people to get insured, thereby keeping premiums in check. but this year — the first time no fines will be collected — the number of people signing up for subsidized private insurance through the affordable care act slipped only slightly.
we know that faith and family are at the center of american life, trump says
caitlin huey-burns: he was the vice president to a very popular president for democrats. so, that's why you're seeing him lead the polls, and there certainly is time for him to make a real campaign. but i think the response to this shows that he doesn't have a campaign operation ready to go and operating to respond to these kinds of attacks. so that's what leaves open those questions.

governor ned lamont: i don't think so. they've done a relatively good job of getting us the vaccines when we need it. our hospital systems and federally qualified health centers, they do things by appointment. that clears up a lot of the confusion you see in some other states. but i do know that one or two of these systems maybe overpromised and, you know, had more people than they had vaccines. we're watching that very carefully. do it by appointment. clear up the confusion. get people vaccinated.
president trump celebrated the end of the mueller investigation out on the 2020 campaign trail this week.
mr. trump has previously expressed support for government-funded health care. in an interview with 60 minutes as a candidate in 2015, mr. trump said that the uninsured will be taken care of much better than they're taken care of now and the government's gonna pay for it.

in 2015, bevin beat his democratic opponent in a surprise landslide, with voters decisively breaking his way in the week before election day. it was something of a comeback win for bevin, a millionaire businessman who had never held elected office but who had tried to beat senator mitch mcconnell in the 2014 republican primary. mcconnell won that race by nearly 40 points.

william goldman ap photo nobody knows anything. that was the sage advice of oscar-winning screenwriter william goldman (august 12, 1931-november 16, 2018) when asked for the secret of what made a successful film. he should have known; goldman won academy awards for writing butch cassidy and the sundance kid and all the president's men (for which he coined the immortal phrase follow the money). he also wrote the screenplays for the princess bride, marathon man and magic (each adapted from his own novels), harper, the hot rock, the stepford wives, the great waldo pepper, misery and the ghost and the darkness, among others. after the chicago-born goldman received his master's degree from columbia university in 1956, he penned a novel, the temple of gold, in under two weeks, and sold it to knopf. more than 20 novels followed (some published under pen names), including soldier in the rain and no way to treat a lady, both of which became films. goldman found work in movies himself (as did his older brother, james goldman, who would win the oscar for adapting his historical play, the lion in winter). in addition to his own screenplays, he also found service as a highly sought-after script doctor on such films as a few good men, twins, dolores claiborne, malice and indecent proposal.
that didn't happen. is it really the case that there is no way to resolve those differences? roberts asked at one point.
paul ryan: you can't blame donald trump for the senate democrats shutting down the government. they shut down the government with no end game in sight. i frankly don't think they felt we were going to pass our bill. and when we passed our bill, funding children's health insurance, keeping the troops funded, preventing the medical device tax from- from kicking in in a few days which
the second pillar fully secures the border. that means building a great wall on the southern border, and it means hiring more heroes, like cj, to keep our communities safe. crucially, our plan closes the terrible loopholes exploited by criminals and terrorists to enter our country, and it finally ends the horrible and dangerous practice of catch and release.
donald trump: don't be afraid. we are going to bring our country back. but certainly, don't be afraid. you know, we just had an election and sort of like you have to be given a little time. i mean, people are protesting. if hillary had won and if my people went out and protested, everybody would say, oh, that's a terrible thing. and it would have been a much different attitude. there is a different attitude. you know, there is a double standard here.
senator marco rubio: well, i respect carlos tremendously. he's been a leader on that topic. my view is climate, sea level rise, these are measurable things. you can measure that. so there-- it's not even a scientific debate. at some point, it's just a reality debate. you can measure whether sea levels are higher than they used to be, warmer than used to be and the like. for, as a policymaker the fundamental question is, what can we do about it? and if, in fact, humans are contributing to that, what public policy can we pursue that you can actually pass, does not destroy your economy and can be effective.

health insurance markets also have well known market failures. the first is, once again, moral hazard, and it's similar to the moral hazard problem in retirement insurance markets. people know that a compassionate society will care for them if they break an arm, contract a life-threatening disease or have some other severe health problem. they can always go to the emergency room at society's expense, and for that reason many will choose to go without insurance.

caitlin huey-burns: well, democrats have been saying since 2017 and the lead-up to the midterms that they wanted to focus on issues, mostly because the mueller report, the conclusions at that time were unknown. and we saw health care as the top issue for democrats in the 2018 election. it helped them to win back, you know, forty seats and, eventually, win back the house. they saw the president's unlikely pivot to health care as a welcome move from the president. and they believe that this is a winning issue for them. and it also removed some of the pushback or criticism that they would have been getting from republicans who were kind of really eager not to talk about their own health care plans, but to harp on the democrats' plans. you talked to bernie sanders earlier about medicare for all, which has become, kind of, a baseline for entries--
pennsylvania's highest court made several rulings thursday that have the potential to help biden in the state, reports cbs news campaign reporter zak hudak. first, the state supreme court ruled that the green party's presidential candidate can't be on the general election ballot because of a failure to closely follow nomination procedures. then, the court ruled that pennsylvanians will have a three-day extension to return mail ballots with the postal service and the option to return them in drop boxes. that decision could mean many more democratic votes are counted in pennsylvania. in the state's june primary, over twice as many democrats as republicans applied to vote by mail. in that election, counties received nearly 100,000 mail-in ballots after election day, the majority of which came in the three days following it, the secretary of the commonwealth testified in another court case. that's over twice as many votes than mr. trump won the state by in 2016.

beto o'rourke beto o'rourke joins the 2020 presidential rac... 02:39 biography o'rourke was born and raised in the texas border city of el paso. although his legal first name is robert, he has been known as beto, the nickname spanish-speaking communities give names that end in berto, like roberto and alberto, since childhood. he was an avid musician as a teenager and was part of various rock bands, including the el paso-based punk group foss after graduating from columbia university in new york in 1995. o'rouke's music career, however, was short-lived and he spent several years working in start-up companies and civic groups when he returned to el paso from new york city. after working on several local political campaigns, o'rourke ran for the el paso city council in 2005 and defeated a two-term incumbent. he served two terms in the council and spearheaded a controversial effort to revamp the city's downtown. in 2012, o'rourke, who speaks fluent spanish, announced his candidacy for the democratic primary in the race to represent texas 16th congressional district, a latino-majority district encompassing el paso and the surrounding communities. he managed to topple eight-term incumbent silvestre reyes in the primary and defeated his republican challenger in a landslide general election victory. while in congress, the texas democrat compiled a moderate voting record during his three terms, where he served on the armed services and veterans affairs committees.
scott gottlieb: there's some-- there's some evidence right now that does suggest that it is more pathogenic, that it does cause more severe illness. and we do know that it's about fifty percent more transmissible. but what we also know from the data, at least the data we have so far, both experimental evidence as well as the data that's come out of some of these vaccine trials like the johnson & johnson vaccine trial and the one with novavax is that immunization and prior infection appears to be protective against the b117 variant, as protective. that's not the case with the brazilian and the south african variant p1 and b1351, where prior infection, immunity you get from being infected as well as the immunity you get from vaccination, does not appear to be as protective against those variants. so the good news with b117, if there is good news is that as we vaccinate more of the population, it should be a backstop against the continued spread of that variant.

president donald trump's re-election campaign has spent over $54 million on facebook and google advertisements since the 2018 midterm elections. by comparison, the biden campaign has spent just under $19 million on the same platforms since his 2019 launch. while the president has outspent joe biden digitally overall, biden has outpaced mr. trump specifically in facebook spending since the end of march. according to bully pulpit interactive's 2020 campaign tracker, mr. trump has spent $7 million on facebook and google while biden has spent $5.3 million from march 28 to april 25, but biden has spent $4.3 million to trump's $4.1 million on facebook.
that same morning, he met us for a flight to his boyhood home.
in a senate where democrats have the slimmest majority possible, any one democratic senator effectively has a veto. and when it comes to taxes, we expect many of the biden administration's proposed taxes won't pass muster with democratic moderates, zezas said in an analysis.

the democratic base has certainly rendered its verdict. in the latest gallup poll, donald trump's approval rating among democrats is seven percent. as in single digits. it's never been above 13 percent among democrats at any point during his presidency.
it's amazing to me that judge barrett has publicly criticized the decision by chief justice roberts that upheld the constitutionality of the aca and that president trump is making it clear a vote for judge barrett to be on the supreme court is a vote to repeal the aca and take away health care protection from a majority of americans during a pandemic, he said sunday on face the nation.
the orders are big wins for gov. tony evers and attorney general josh kaul, both democrats who ran on the promise to get wisconsin out of the lawsuit seeking repeal of the health care law. former republican gov. scott walker, an opponent to the affordable care act also known as obamacare, approved wisconsin joining the lawsuit.

john dickerson: this is the scenario it's actually they do this time.
we're at war in the middle east that mccain pushed so hard, trump said. calling bush all the time, get into the middle east.
in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic, the trump administration on thursday urged the supreme court to overturn the affordable care act. the late-night court filing came on the same day the government reported that close to half a million people who lost their health insurance amid the economic shutdown have gotten coverage through healthcare.gov.
meanwhile, ryan's plans to cut benefit programs faced the acid test last year as well, during last year's health care debacle. he succeeded in passing a repeal of obama's health care law through the house last year that would have capped the medicaid health program for the poor and disabled, cutting more than $800 billion from the program over 10 years. ryan called it the most fundamental entitlement reform in a generation.

cedric richmond: look, i think you see us doing everything humanly possible to make sure we ramp up vaccinations. we're delivering another million six to the states every week. so we bumped up to order. we just purchased another two hundred million vaccinations so that we can vaccinate the whole three hundred million adults that we need to do. and so we're going to keep pushing. we're going to keep sending vaccines to the states and asking the states to hurry up and make sure that they get them all out. but our plan and why we need to pass the american rescue plan is to make sure that we give the school systems the ability to buy the masks, the ventilation systems, all of those things that's needed to open up.
on wednesday, navarro reports bustos and guinn addressed several campaign topics that'll be in play these next two months. when asked about public safety and the civil unrest over police brutality, bustos pointed to the passage of the george floyd justice in policing act.

the 2020 strategy for the republican party of texas was recently unveiled — to texas democrats. the dallas morning news reports that a draft of the gop plan ended up in democratic emails monday night, and it includes a list of 12 targeted state house districts and a preliminary digital advertising plan to attack democrats. their strategist memo also had a clause about potential decreased gop turnout due to never trumpers, and a suggestion to prepare to target these voters to still vote for republicans down ballot, reports navarro.

meanwhile in utah, mitt romney, another long-time critic of mr. trump who once called him a phony and a fraud, has been notably more silent in his condemnations since starting his campaign to fill retiring republican senator orrin hatch's seat in utah. he faces a conservative primary challenge on tuesday from state rep. mike kennedy.

senator rick scott: i had the same issue when i ran a large hospital company. and i said-- i did the exact same thing, i said i had hospitals in europe. i said i'm not paying more for drugs in europe than i'm paying in the united states. it's-- it's not-- it's not fair to americans and that's why i'm going to-- i'm going to work hard to get that passed--
meanwhile in the house, republican incumbents fighting to hold onto seats in suburban, affluent, and educated districts will have to thread the needle of appealing to the base while distancing themselves from some of the administration's more divisive policies. while mr. trump has made it clear he is willing to travel and help in the midterms, some of these campaigns may not welcome him in their districts.
the trump administration has opted against reopening the marketplaces on healthcare.gov for a special enrollment period to accommodate those who have lost employer-sponsored healthcare amid the coronavirus pandemic, a senior administration official confirmed to cbs news. millions of americans who filed for unemployment benefits last week can still apply for insurance under the affordable care act, but freelancers or part-time employees who have had sources of income disappear will not be eligible to file under a qualifying life event.
but fear that barrett could be a deciding vote in dismantling the nation's health care law is something he believes should be a topic of the hearings. in fact, obamacare has been a major theme of questioning monday — each of the democratic senators has brought it up and highlighted constituents from their states whose lives have been changed by the law.
more democratic candidates jumped into the presidential race in 2019 than america has seen since the inception of the modern primary system. here's a look at all the democrats who campaigned for a chance to take on president trump in november 2020.

suggestions from democratic senate leader chuck schumer that trump should pick an obama-backed liberal jurist like merrick garland aren't just politically ridiculous, they're anti-democratic. millions of americans voted for trump in part because they didn't want hillary clinton picking judges.
trump: first of all, captain khan is an american hero, and if i were president at that time, he would be alive today, because unlike her, who voted for the war without knowing what she was doing, i would not have had our people in iraq. iraq was disaster. so he would have been alive today.
president trump has been trying to throw out the affordable care act for four years. the republican party has been trying to eliminate it for a decade. twice already the supreme court has upheld the law. and the congress, expressing the popular will of the american people, has rejected president trump's efforts as well, biden said in delaware. now, all of a sudden this administration believes they've found a loophole in the tragedy of justice [ruth bader] ginsburg's death.
las vegas — house minority leader nancy pelosi said wednesday health care was on the ballot and health care won. the cbs news exit poll showed the majority of voters said it was the most important issue and a major factor in the senate race in nevada.

tuesday night marks the first time that colorado's 1.2 million unaffiliated voters can cast ballots in the primary elections. but the denver post reports: hundreds of unaffiliated voters' ballots that have been turned in won't be counted, however, because they didn't follow regulations for the new opportunity. specifically, those voters didn't heed a rule requiring unaffiliated voters to send back only a republican or democratic primary ballot — not both.
we look at it as an expansion at a critical and busy time for the campaign, she said. when it comes to personnel and it comes to senior-level staff, more is more -- the more big minds, and broad shoulders we can get inside the door.
donald trump: everybody said, that was so great. i have been, you know, i've been-a supporter.
while analysts at the conservative heritage foundation concede undocumented immigrant households do contribute tax revenue, they make the case that what they contribute is far outweighed by what their presence here in the u.s. costs taxpayers.
insurers who have made money on the exchanges, such as centene (cnc) and molina healthcare (moh), usually offer narrow provider networks and have experience with low-income patients. the companies that are doing well may see aetna's departure as an opportunity, said sabrina corlette, a research professor with the georgetown health policy institute. she believes aetna's move is part of a natural adjustment process. the exchanges are still quite new, she said, adding that there is still a lot to learn about the best ways to do business in them.
police chief calvin williams said the city added 300 more bicycles for the convention, hoping that officers would be more maneuverable and less threatening.
the website also weighs in on impeachment, which is weighing over the white house this holiday season after mr. trump became only the third u.s. president to be impeached. it reiterates the president's claim that there was no quid pro quo with ukraine.
i think this administration was creating the tone with north korea to remind them exactly what could happen to them if they threaten the united states, haley replied. no one wants war. the president doesn't want war. i don't want war. no one wants war. but it is an option.
but they have a history of going head-to-head.

roy hargrove claude paris/ap many of his peers regarded him as the greatest trumpeter of his generation. two-time grammy-winner roy hargrove (october 16, 1969-november 2, 2018) provided his jazz sound across a vast range of styles, through his own bands and as a sideman. hargrove brewed his jazz with african and latin sounds, r&b, soul, pop, funk and hip-hop. he led the progressive, genre-melding group the rh factor; played in sessions for common, d'angelo and erykah badu; and collaborated with jazz giants, including herbie hancock and wynton marsalis. a native of waco, texas, hargrove was discovered by marsalis while playing at a performing-arts high school in dallas. he went on to the berklee college of music in boston and then transferred to the new school in new york, where he joined in jam sessions at jazz clubs in the evening, including at the blue note. hargrove released his first solo album, diamond in the rough, when he was only 20 years old. he won his first grammy in 1998 with his afro-cuban band crisol for its album habana, then won another in 2002 for directions in music: live at massey hall, featuring a band he led with hancock and saxophonist michael brecker. play excerpt: roy hargrove performing ms. garvey, ms. garvey play excerpt: roy hargrove performing mambo for roy from the album habana in 2012 hargrove told the san jose mercury news, if you have the tools to play jazz, you can do anything, because you have what it takes to make spontaneous music.

margaret brennan: we spoke to the national security adviser to the president, who is denying that the white house was informed of the preference for trump. but-- but you and i both know that in 2016, that was the intelligence community's clear--

john dickerson: --with senator rubio. you are on the environmental committee and in the senate. what did you make of the senator's remarks?
barrett is likely to be confirmed by the full senate over the objections of democratic lawmakers.
and i think that taxpayer money is better used to get free community college, to help kids get certifications, when those are some of the fastest growing degreed jobs we have in this nation. and so to me, this is a legitimate policy argument about how we help people afford college, help them pay off their loans, make bold policy changes, which this president is not doing. but i think there's room in our party for a legitimate debate. i just think it's important to realize there's a lot more that unifies us than separate- that there's a lot more that unifies us than there is that divides us, and that divide right now is with the american people and the president. he promised them pharmaceutical prices going down, they've gone up. he promised them infrastructure, he has done--
now the court will consider allowing the trump administration to enforce rules that allow more employers to deny insurance coverage for contraceptives to women.
pence says manchin has voted 'no' time and again on the policies that west virginia needs.
an estimated 27 million people may have lost job-based coverage due to layoffs, and it's unclear what — if anything — they're turning to as a fallback. people who lose employer health care are eligible for a special sign-up period for subsidized plans under the obama-era law. many may also qualify for medicaid.
they could be missing out on premium assistance that's part of the law, carey said about the uninsured who qualify for subsidies, citing a study from the kaiser family foundation. the study finds that 4.2 million uninsured people could get an aca plan for 2019 and pay no money in premiums even after factoring in tax credits.

but everybody else, the 170 million of us who get health insurance through our employees got big benefits. number one, insurance companies can't deny you coverage because of a pre-existing condition. number two, no lifetime limits, which is a big deal if you have serious health problems.

on this issue, let's rate clinton's and trump's positions as a tie, although it's troubling that trump supports repealing the aca without a specific plan to reinstate its cost-savings features.
we believe in a country where we take the threat of terrorism seriously. we name it for what it is: radical islamic terrorism. and we do everything in our power to eliminate it - to ensure our safety. why? because america deserves better, said walker, who dropped out of the presidential race early on last fall.
tuesday's election is a runoff, a result of the fact that no candidate won 50 percent of the vote in the april 18 jungle primary. ossoff received 48.1 percent and handel came in second with 19.8 percent in the 18-candidate field, including 11 republicans, 5 democrats, 2 independents.
the republican-led house on friday plans to vote on a bill called keep your health plan act, which would allow plans that existed on the individual market as of jan. 1, 2013 to stay in effect through 2014. while the legislation would enact a policy change similar to the administration's, the white house has said it opposes the bill because it would allow insurers to sell 2013 plans in 2014 to anyone, not just customers who already have those plans. that, white house spokesman jay carney told reporters tuesday, creates all sorts of problems for insurers trying to meet the basic standards set by the affordable care act, undermining the whole law.

ginsburg is an enormously popular figure in the democratic party, a truth that has been evident throughout the democratic primary process — her portrait is frequently seen beaming on colorful t-shirts and tote bags. some suggest that by tying his campaign to protecting her legacy, biden would also highlight his previous pledge to nominate the first black woman justice if he is elected.
experts agree that number of uninsured people has risen because of layoffs, perhaps by 5 million to 10 million, but authoritative estimates await government studies due later this year.

margaret brennan: that's the president at a friday rally in las vegas claiming that reports of russia interfering in his favor was democratic disinformation. when we were in las vegas saturday i spoke with the white house national security adviser robert o'brien, who was in our washington studio. i asked him if he had assured the president that this particular u.s. intelligence finding was real. he strongly disputed it.
we'll be on 24-hour call if we're back in our districts, to come back and vote on whatever the next level of support is. but we've been there all along, important to remember it was mitch mcconnell who was calling for this pause 120+ days ago, bustos said.
but advocates worry that the move is a return to the bad old days before insurers had to adhere to standard regulations that protected consumers from paying insurance premiums, only to find coverage wasn't there when they needed it.

trump: well, i actually agree with that. i agree with everything she said. i began this campaign because i was so tired of seeing such foolish things happen to our country. this is a great country. this is a great land. i've gotten to know the people of the country over the last year-and-a-half that i've been doing this as a politician. i cannot believe i'm saying that about myself, but i guess i have been a politician.
the supreme court will weigh in on contraceptive coverage under the nation's health care law this term, agreeing to hear a case involving the obamacare rule requiring large companies to help pay for their employees' birth control. the high court will review whether the trump administration was on solid ground when it gave religious employers and universities broader religious and moral exemptions to the obamacare contraception mandate, which requires health care plans to offer free birth control.

when mr. obama called boehner on monday, the speaker told the president that obamacare is costing jobs and that american families are being denied basic fairness when big businesses are getting exemptions that they are not, boehner spokesman brendan buck said.
senator rick scott: well, first off i'm glad the- the president cares about health care. i've- i've- i ran the largest hospital company. i care about the cost of health care and that's what i've focused on. i know it's going to be tough. i look forward to, you know, to seeing what the president's going to put out. but with nancy pelosi in the house it's going to be tough to get something done. but we do know that medicare for all which senator sanders is all in on, is going to just ruin our health care system.
senator ben sasse: one of the things is we are going to have to develop habits for the technological age that get back to an awareness of-- embodied flesh and blood neighbors actually matter a lot. there's a whole bunch of tech addictions we all have to our smartphones. we know it's a problem when it's our kids. i have fourteen- and seventeen-year-old daughters. but it turns out we the adults are also addicted to technology that helps us flee the place where we're actually called to live and love our neighbor.

the first full day of government shutdown ended in another stalemate as democrats rejected an attempt by house republicans to restore funding to delayed veterans benefits and closed national parks and memorials, and to give the district of columbia the authority to use local revenue to continue operations.
margaret brennan: i want to read a statement from the vice president who said, it- it's a lengthy one but in just part of it he says, in my many years on the campaign trail and in public life, i've offered countless handshakes, hugs, expressions of affection, support and comfort and not once, never did i believe i acted inappropriately. if it is suggested i did so, i will listen respectfully but it was never my intention. that's a general denial, but ms. flores was on cnn this morning, senator and she said that really this needs to be taken more seriously as a party, suggesting that democrats aren't taking it seriously enough. and she said she's coming forth--
lesley stahl: let me ask whether any of you think that the campaign has hurt the trump brand.
ed o'keefe: it's funny how he fact checked you but then couldn't answer the question--
while the colorado judge is conservative, he also has a sterling reputation. the white house believed he was unlikely to elicit a massive senate democratic uprising. this week, that belief will be put to the test. democrats must decide whether this is the time to oppose a qualified conservative nominee. as a conservative replacing scalia, gorsuch wouldn't change the balance of the court. if enough democrats oppose him, it would force sen. majority leader mitch mcconnell to invoke the nuclear option to get gorsuch confirmed with a simple majority.
mr. trump filed for reelection the day he was sworn into office, but is ceremonially launching his reelection campaign tuesday night with a campaign rally at the amway center, the home of the nba's orlando magic. the democratic national committee says it's joining the florida democratic party, which is spearheading a rally outside the amway center ahead of mr. trump's 8 p.m. kick-off.
there is some good news. medicare beneficiaries who pay the most for medicines would pay less under the trump budget. medicare patients who reach the maximum of $8,418 in total costs would no longer have to pay the 5 percent co-pay on prescription drugs. other medicare patients, however, would pay more out of pocket for medicine because manufacturer discounts would no longer be counted toward their total drug spending.
not to be deterred, he turned around and drove to franklin, tennessee - eleven hours from virginia beach - to see a trump rally there. he even flew out his 12-year-old son robbie from buffalo for some father-son bonding over trump.
i think when the president makes a nomination, he's obligated to do so under the constitution, mcgahn said, adding that there have been election-year nominations to the supreme court more than 20 times before. this idea that somehow this is out of the norm simply doesn't ring true.
mcgahn: i don't think they're fair assumptions one way or the other. we've heard this for decades in washington, d.c. i remember being a- a very young law student and hearing this about robert bork and hearing this about clarence thomas and hearing this about virtually every justice that's been nominated by a republican. you cannot guarantee results with judges. what you can guarantee is that they are going to approach the task of judging as a judge. they're not going to substitute their own policy views for the will of the people. they're going to try to play it straight and read the law as passed by congress and as found in the constitution, not based upon what they think it ought to be, but what it is. i disagree that there is any hesitancy or pause last time. she was a relatively new federal judge. she was placed on a short list. the public found out about the short list because it was publicly announced. so the process has really been transparent. recall the president, even as a candidate, put out not one, but two lists of judges who could be on the supreme court; he's updated it a few times since. so i think that at the time, brett kavanaugh was the right person at the right time. and i think amy- judge amy barrett is the right person at the right time now.
president donald trump: i doubt it. i doubt it. i really doubt it.
last year, embracing nonpartisan estimates for the affordable care act, health and human services secretary kathleen sebelius set a benchmark for the new insurance marketplaces: success looks like at least 7 million people having signed up by the end of march 2014, she said to nbc.

in 1985, he made his first appearance on face the nation. by 2008, he had set a record for the most appearances on the broadcast. he did it on the sunday after winning the republican presidential nomination, with what may have been be the most unusual strategy in political history.

with regard to mr. trump's russia controversy, she has said let's see where the facts take us but has also called the controversy noise. on health care, she's been lukewarm on the gop effort to repeal and replace obamacare, saying that the house bill isn't perfect. handel is trying to sell herself as fiscally conservative and an independent while slamming ossoff as too liberal for the district. mr. trump tweeted his support handel on monday, slamming democrats' efforts to stop tax cuts, good health care and border security.
cbs news political unit associate producers sarah ewall-wice and eleanor watson note a review of the facebook ad library found many of the ads that biden has aired on the social network over the past month involve healing the soul of the nation, taking on mr. trump, teasing his vp pick, defeating the nra, protecting obamacare, touting endorsements and meeting fundraising goals. the president's ads on facebook, meanwhile, have focused on slamming biden and democrats, building a wall, promoting online events, selling merchandise and reaching fundraising deadlines.

controversy although he has a liberal voting record in the senate and has been a staunch critic of the trump administration, booker has faced criticism from some progressives for receiving large donations from pharmaceutical corporations and banks. in what he touted as his spartacus moment, booker claimed to have released confidential committee documents during the contentious senate confirmation of justice brett kavanaugh. his republican colleagues accused him of grandstanding and said the documents had already been cleared. what trump says in an exclusive interview with cbs news face the nation host margaret brennan the same day booker announced his candidacy, president trump said he thinks booker has no chance in the 2020 election. when asked why, mr. trump replied: because i know him. he has no chance. in a november interview with the new york post, the president said booker ran newark into the ground and falsely accused him of not living in the city when he was mayor. during the 2016 campaign, mr. trump claimed to know more about booker than the new jersey senator knew about himself. if cory booker is the future of the democratic party, they have no future! i know more about cory than he knows about himself, mr. trump tweeted in july of that year.

well, as i said, this is a particular episode. and it has some troubling features to it, as we've discussed. but i think, you know, that's a question that really has to wait an analysis of all the different episodes that occurred through the summer of 2016 and the first several months of president trump's administration.
the package doesn't include any funding for the wall president trump wants along the u.s.-mexico border or a deportation force, according to a senior congressional aide. in fact, the legislation specifically states that there can't be construction of a new wall, the aide said. the white house backed off of its demand for wall funding last week after democrats made it clear they would oppose any bill that includes it. instead, it includes $1.5 billion for border security, which would cover technology and repairing existing infrastructure, which covers some of mr. trump's request.

and for all the talk about trump destroying our democracy, it should be noted that the most democratic institution of all, the congress, is working largely as designed. while the gop-controlled senate has backed trump's judicial choices, it has not rubber-stamped the rest of his agenda. republicans stopped the trump-backed obamacare repeal and forced serious modifications of his original tax-cut proposals. congress has yet to appropriate money for his border wall with mexico, and trump's policy proposals on immigration can't get a congressional majority from his own party, much less the congress as a whole.
attorney general william barr, thank you very much for joining us here at cbs news.

for now, at least, the unitedhealth announcement has not set off a succession of me-too moves. in a conference call with analysts thursday after reporting first-quarter results, aetna ceo mark bertolini reiterated his support of the company's obamacare efforts, saying the company is on track to meet its goals for improving operating margins in these programs. bertolini also said the company is committed to working with the administration and lawmakers to improve the exchange program.

the number of uninsured americans has increased since 2016, according to the report, reversing years of decline since the aca was passed in 2010. the number of uninsured adults between the ages of 19 and 64 rose to 15.5 percent in march 2018, up from 12.7 percent in 2016. an estimated 4 million people lost individual coverage during that period, while the number of people with employer-sponsored coverage stayed steady.

senator rick scott: i-- you know-- whatever happens with obamacare--
president trump here has promised to protect people with pre-existing conditions but doesn't have a plan to execute. this is something of a mirage, he told cbs news. much of the president's record has been to weaken protections, including his effort to try to get aca overturned. i do think the fact that the president is saying people with pre-existing conditions should be protected shows how far this debate has shifted since the affordable care act has passed.

the pro-trump america first action pac launched a new round of tv ads in michigan, wisconsin and pennsylvania friday taking aim at joe biden. it's part of the group's $10 million investment in the battleground states through the end of may. in michigan, an ad titled china prosperity has clips of biden praising china; in wisconsin, an ad titled stop china also uses video of biden remarks to accuse the presumptive democratic presidential nominee of trying to protect china amid the coronavirus outbreak; and in pennsylvania, the ad titled travel ban uses a clip of biden criticizing the china travel ban. it's the latest in a series of efforts to paint biden as aligned with china over u.s. interests. at the same time, democratic groups have made similar efforts to tie trump with china as well for his initial praise of china's coronavirus response.
controversy although she is likely to cite her long career as a prosecutor on the campaign trail, harris is poised to face scrutiny from some progressives for her law enforcement work. some factions on the left have denounced aspects of her record as a district attorney and state attorney general. critics have pointed to california's overcrowded prisons and to her defense of controversial convictions to challenge the notion that she was a progressive prosecutor. if kamala harris wants people who care about dismantling mass incarceration and correcting miscarriages of justice to vote for her, she needs to radically break with her past, wrote law professor lara bazelon in an opinion piece for the new york times. what trump says although mr. trump has not yet tweeted about harris, the white house has previously criticized the california senator. in the summer of 2018, the white house twitter account wrote, @senkamalaharris, why are you supporting the animals of ms-13? you must not really know what ice does. harris has said that lawmakers need to reexamine the role of immigration and customs enforcement (ice).

senator elizabeth warren on tuesday pressured treasury secretary steven mnuchin to require that all large and mid-sized businesses getting pandemic aid from a $500 billion federal reserve fund keep their workers on payroll. mnuchin declined to make such a commitment, citing payroll requirements for airline bailouts and the main street lending program. and the rest was left up to you and what you're saying is that you won't do it…you're boosting your wall street buddies and you are leaving the american people behind, warren said in a senate banking committee hearing, according to cbs news campaign reporter zak hudak. mnuchin, who has the authority under the cares act to set the terms of pandemic relief bonds purchased by the federal reserve, said he had set the terms based on bipartisan discussions. i think that's a very unfair characterization, he said. and these issues were discussed with both republicans and democrats at the time. you were not necessarily part of those discussions but these were completely discussed. the federal reserve has set some restrictions on companies from whom it will buy bonds, including that a majority of their employees are in the united states and that they are not already receiving other cares act support. ahead of the hearing, warren sent a letter to the federal reserve in boston and new york, requesting that executives of companies receiving that aid be subject to criminal and civil penalties, including disgorgement, if they provide fraudulent or misleading information or misuse funds.

sen. scott: well first off, i'm going to make- i- i think it's first off it's very important that we make sure that people have a pre-existing condition can get in- can get a health care plan. getting the health care plan that they can afford and i- and i want to work on that with other senators to make sure that happens. we talked about it at the budget committee last week and everybody was supportive of that. i want to make sure individuals can stay on their parent's plans. but- but this idea of taking- the government taking over health care and running all of health care has never worked. it's not going to work. we're going- we're going to ruin the entire system. let's focus on the problem we have. the problem is not access, the problem is the cost of health care and the unbelievable inflation we've seen. let's start with drug prices. why are drug prices going up the way they have?
don mcgahn: thanks for having me.
it's one of the few regrets of my presidency - that the rancor and suspicion between the parties has gotten worse instead of better, mr. obama said in a uniquely humble moment of his address. i have no doubt a president with the gifts of lincoln or roosevelt might have better bridged the divide, and i guarantee i'll keep trying to be better so long as i hold this office.
lanhee chen: which is not unusual. and that may be true. but i think the-- what we really could benefit from here is some clarity--

when asked by cbs news if dr. redfield stood by his comments after the president publicly contradicted him at today's news conference, redfield said in a statement, i 100% believe in the importance of vaccines and the importance in particular of a covid-19 vaccine. a covid-19 vaccine is the thing that will get americans back to normal everyday life. the best defense we currently have against this virus are the important mitigation efforts of wearing a mask, washing your hands, social distancing and being careful about crowds.

the legal battle before the justices was brought by a group of republican-led states challenging the constitutionality of obamacare's individual mandate. as part of the gop's overhaul of the tax code in 2017, congress abolished the financial penalty for people who do not purchase health insurance, and the gop states believe the individual mandate — a key pillar of the obama-era health care law — is now unconstitutional.

hey, if she had a problem — for 30 years she's been doing this, anderson. i say it all the time. she talks about health care. why didn't she do something about it? she talks about taxes. why didn't she do something about it? she doesn't do anything about anything other than talk. with her, it's all talk and no action.
the supreme court previously ruled that the affordable care act was constitutional because congress has the power to tax people. it held that if people had to pay a penalty for not buying insurance, that payment was effectively a tax.

after months of virtual campaigning due to the coronavirus, in-person activity is slowly starting to creep back up depending on where states are with reopening, reports cbs news political unit associate producer sarah ewall-wice. on thursday, the progressive turnout project, whose mission is to get democrats to the polls, announced it will begin door-to-door canvassing in some metro areas saturday. the pac, which is investing more than $52 million this election cycle, will have upcoming activity in georgia, iowa, kansas, maine, new hampshire, north carolina, wisconsin and colorado.
most recently in early august, the president teased an executive order to require health insurers to cover pre-existing conditions, but that has not yet been unveiled. this comes as less than a week ago, the biden campaign also started airing another ad in which biden talks about his experience with health insurance, saying obamacare is personal to him and taking aim at the president. right now, a lawsuit backed by the trump administration is asking the supreme court to strike down the entire affordable care act (obamacare), including the provisions protecting people with pre-existing conditions. that case goes before the court in november, one week after election day.
here's a refresher on what to know about gorsuch:
arizona, as you know, is a crucial battleground state, but you don't often see presidential candidates around here. and the fact is, president trump is about the only one who's spending any money here and in some of the other swing states around the country. and that's a big problem for our party and i am determined to change exactly that, he told reporters in phoenix.
republicans so far are keeping up their demand to revisit the obamacare debate in the government spending debate, even though polls show most disagree with the strategy -- and even as several hundred thousand federal employees are going without a paycheck and some critical government services like food assistance are threatened.
alternatively, a handful of undecided voters also spoke favorably about a single-payer healthcare system like medicare for all.
well, i think initially, you know, at the very beginning of the crisis, before we knew very much — and while, in some places, the infection rates were skyrocketing and threatening to overwhelm our health care system, you know, the initial limitations may have been defensible. but as time goes by, it's harder to justify those kinds of blanket restrictions on religious practice.
senator john barrasso: that said if the mandate goes away then other things go away.
he added that uniformed military will remain on normal duty status but to the defense department's civilian force, he said, i know the days ahead could mean more uncertainty, including possible furloughs.
now that the new obamacare insurance marketplaces are opening, more than 4,800,000 people across the country are being dropped from their insurance plans, according to the latest cbs news tally. plans are being canceled if they fail to meet the health care law's 10 minimum standards, including maternity care, emergency visits, mental health treatment and pediatric dental care.
president donald trump: yeah, i think i can. people that love our country. more than anything else and they like to see our country thrive.
skimpier coverage. short-term plans are not required to provide coverage for the 10 essential health benefits other insurers must cover under the affordable care act. for instance, according to kaiser family foundation data, only a fraction of short-term plans covered prenatal and maternity care, mental health care, drug treatment or prescription drugs.
but, early in this process, the fda approved what's called off-label use where physicians could prescribe hydroxychloroquine in terms they deemed appropriate. so my physician has not recommended that, but i wouldn't hesitate to take the counsel of my doctor. any american should do likewise.
laid-off workers should be able to get their children covered even if the adults in the family cannot help. the federal-state children's health insurance program and medicaid cover kids in families with incomes well above the poverty level. medicaid is open year round if you are a parent with kids who need coverage, said joan alker, director of the center for children and families at georgetown university. children's coverage predates the aca.
morgan told cbs news the pac is focusing on battleground races where it can make the most difference, but because access to the ballot is core to its mission, the group is also concentrating on a slate of candidates who support legislation focused on voting access like the for the people act and the voting rights advancement act.
margaret brennan: --is- is trimming away at your support?
the issue of health care is again center stage for democrats as their 2020 presidential primary ramps up. most candidates have embraced some form of universal health care, and many support sen. bernie sanders' medicare for all plan. republicans see an opportunity to exploit that support, painting democrats as advocating for socialized medicine.
we need a nominee who can help democrats up and down the ticket, biden argued. but if senator sanders is the nominee for the party, every democrat in america…will have to carry the label senator sanders has chose for himself…he calls himself a democratic socialist.
a federal appeals court has determined the individual mandate in the nation's health care law is unconstitutional. the 5th circuit court of appeals announced the decision on obamacare wednesday, sending the case back to a lower court in texas to determine whether other parts of the affordable care act can continue to exist.
mr. trump's claims about it taking 10 years to get a permit approved for a simple road suffers from a lack of data, and the washington post has also critiqued previous comparisons of this nature, pointing out that previous comparisons of this nature do not compare like with like. mr trump is contrasting the swift construction time of a pre-planned project which may have taken years to come to fruition with the planning time it takes to bring a project to the construction phase. -- markham nolan

in 2017, republican efforts to repeal obamacare failed in congress. president trump has said on several occasions since that republicans would unveil their own health care plan, but it has not yet materialized. now, as the coronavirus strains health care systems across the country, some question whether the entire system needs to be examined, including progressives who've long pushed for medicare for all.
sen. barrasso: which would be a conte-- we have a different make up of the supreme court. it may be several years till it gets there. but as a doctor, i will tell you, i focus on people with preexisting conditions i've always been focused as i was working on health care legislation to make sure people could get the care they need from a doctor that they choose at lower costs. and we didn't get that in wyoming. we had- after obamacare was passed many people lost their insurance, premiums doubled. so that wasn't- that doesn't give people affordable insurance that's appropriate for them and their families

sen. scott: premiums went up, co-payments went up--

americans should know that if they are temporarily unemployed, there are coverage options available to them, including cobra and the individual exchange, where individuals experiencing a qualifying event such as a job loss can enroll for coverage, the senior administration official added.
for decades, open borders have allowed drugs and gangs to pour into our most vulnerable communities. they've allowed millions of low-wage workers to compete for jobs and wages against the poorest americans. most tragically, they have caused the loss of many innocent lives.
trump: it's just words, folks. it's just words. those words, i've been hearing them for many years. i heard them when they were running for the senate in new york, where hillary was going to bring back jobs to upstate new york and she failed.

but if, you know, if we were to find wrongdoing, in the sense of any criminal act, you know, obviously we would, we would follow through on that. but, again, you know, just because something may even stink to high heaven and be, you know, appear everyone to be bad we still have to apply the right standard and be convinced that there's a violation of a criminal statute. and that we can prove it beyond a reasonable doubt. the same standard applies to everybody.
margaret brennan: so you are saying that it is not, in fact, the u.s. intelligence community's assessment that russia has a preference for president trump?
raddatz: we've sneaked in one more question, and it comes from karl becker.
senator chris van hollen: well, i don't think democrats overreached. democrats wanted a thorough fbi investigation. in the end, it was mitch mcconnell--senator mcconnell--who really cut that short and did not allow a full investigation, but what i have seen actually is that the kavanaugh hearings have actually energized a lot of democrats especially younger voters and women voters. yes, they've energized some republicans. it just goes to show that turnout is really important in these midterm elections.
as it did at the end of its last term, the high court will hear oral arguments for its first sitting remotely and by telephone, as the coronavirus pandemic forced the supreme court in march to close its doors to the public indefinitely. the 10 cases slated to be argued remotely in october were initially scheduled for march and april, but postponed because of the pandemic. it's unclear whether the supreme court will resume in-person arguments in november.
most importantly, these four pillars will produce legislation that fulfills my ironclad pledge to sign a bill that puts america first. so let's come together, set politics aside, and finally get the job done.
our major concerns in these negotiations have been about funding for the wall and uncertainty about the csr payments crucial to the stability of the marketplaces under the affordable care act. we've now made progress on both of these fronts, she said. more progress needs to be made on some of our priorities, and we continue to be concerned about poison pill riders that are still in this legislation. our appropriators are working in good faith toward a bipartisan proposal to keep government open.
donald trump, jr.: you know-- we-- we know him pretty well. and we've got to, you know, be by his side for many years, both as a father and in business. so, you know-- the tenacity that he's always shown-- was just there. but it was just so much more. when i was watching him working 20-hour days, doing seven major speeches to tens of thousands of people and just saying, well, it wasn't triage. which state are we gonna do today, it's, we're just gonna do 'em all. we're gonna speak to all of these people. and i think people saw that energy. they fed off that energy. that energy was so much of the movement-- that he was able to create. and, you know-- it-- it only furthered what i already knew.
although charge-off rates remain near historic lows, indicating that many americans continue to pay their credit card bills on time, wallethub analyst jill gonzalez worries that people are putting major expenses like their rent and mortgage payments on plastic.

about running for president, haley says, i don't think about it. no one wants to believe this. but people spend more time talking about my future. my job is to be the best u.n. ambassador i can possibly be and make sure that people are proud of it. i don't think about the future, and honestly, i don't have time. between north korea, russia and syria, the last thing i'm thinking about is what i'm gonna do in the future.
asked if donald trump should be bemoaning how bad things are, ryan said, i think that's what happens in presidential primaries, but he declined to comment specifically on any candidate.

with the latest news and analysis from washington, don't miss margaret brennan (@margbrennan) on face the nation (@facethenation).
comstock has largely voted in favor of mr. trump's policies since he took office, and as the washington post points out, her campaign mailers remind voters that she is pro-border wall, pro-life, and pro-2nd amendment. but comstock's campaign is not just focused on red-meat issues. comstock is a leading voice in the charge to reform sexual harassment reporting on capitol hill, and she has also bucked the republican party on some key issues. comstock voted against a republican effort to repeal obamacare because it didn't protect people with preexisting conditions. she also sided with house democrats and voted against an amendment that would have blocked an obama-era practice requiring the pentagon to pay for gender transition surgeries and hormone therapy.
senator rick scott: --i want to focus on driving down costs.
during his second term, inslee has been a frequent cable news critic of the president and, with the help of the state's attorney general, bob ferguson, has challenged some of the trump administration's policies, including the travel ban, through high-profile lawsuits. in a campaign video focused on climate change, inslee announced his white house bid on march 1. issues inslee will make climate change the top issue of his 2020 campaign, hoping to draw sharp contrasts with the environmental policies of mr. trump, who has repeatedly cast doubt on human-induced climate change, and even called it a chinese hoax. he has been an ardent backer of sweeping federal action to mitigate the irreparable harm climate change is having on the global environment since his days in congress. with most 2020 democrats throwing their support for the audacious green new deal proposal introduced by new york rep. alexandria ocasio-cortez, inslee's focus on climate change has the potential to gain traction among democratic primary voters and prompt fellow contenders to discuss the issue even more during the nomination process. inslee is also likely on the campaign trail to tout the growing economy in his deep-blue state, his role in the passage of a net neutrality bill and what he called the best paid family leave and one of the best minimum wages in the country. controversy inslee's tenures in congress and as washington's governor have largely been scandal-free.
president trump announced monday evening that he is nominating judge brett kavanaugh to the supreme court seat being vacated by retiring justice anthony kennedy. he said of kavanaugh that he has impeccable credentials and unsurpassed qualifications, and a proven commitment to equal justice under the law and referred to him as a judge's judge.

in connecticut, democratic incumbent governor dannel malloy is not seeking re-election. the democratic primary race is between ned lamont and bridgeport mayor joseph ganim. ganim served a seven-year prison sentence for corruption charges but voters still elected him mayor. ganim also ran for governor in 1994, but he dropped out of the race. similar to ganim, lamont ran for governor in 2010, but lost to malloy. he also defeated sen. joe lieberman in the primary, but lost to lieberman in the general election when lieberman ran as an independent. lamont was also a businessman as he started his own company in the telecommunications industry. lamont said that if ganim won the primary, he would not support him. ganim portrayed lamont as an established millionaire candidate. the republican primary race includes danbury mayor mark boughton, tim herbst, veteran steve obsitnik, former dfc global executive bob stefanowski, and hedge fund founder david stemerman. boughton ran for governor in 2010 and 2014, but lost each time. the two favorites in the race are lamont and boughton as they each won their party's nomination.
among the more moderate democrats, they're not going to want to increase the deficit too much. that's obviously going to be a limiting factor, he adds.
meanwhile, president trump reiterated support for the republican-led effort today. we're not doing anything, we're staying. in other words, we're staying with the group, with texas and the group, he said in the oval office. obamacare is a disaster, but we've run it very well. and we've made it barely acceptable, he added.
regarding the cost issue, it's an inescapable fact that collectively the institutions, employers or citizens who have money will need to subsidize some portion of medical costs for the citizens who don't. otherwise, as a society, we need to accept that the less fortunate among us won't be treated.
we will always protect patients with preexisting conditions, he said.

last, let the other party go on and on with its constant dividing up of people ... always playing one group against the other, as if group identity were everything, he said. in america, aren't we all supposed to see beyond class, or ethnicity, or all those other lines drawn to set us apart and lock us in groups?

the new york board of elections originally voted to remove candidates who have suspended their campaigns from the primary ballot under an obscure provision entered into the state budget signed by governor andrew cuomo in april. that decision said joe biden, the presumptive democratic nominee, would receive all the 274 pledged delegates. that is no longer the case.
trump would repeal the aca and has no plan that would allow pre-age-65 retirees to purchase much-needed medical insurance. this is a crucial difference from clinton. he would also allow individuals to deduct the cost of health insurance premiums, but this feature isn't worth much if you can't buy coverage at any cost due to preexisting conditions. and he would encourage the use of health savings accounts (hsas), but this would do little to pay for potential catastrophic medical conditions.
if he wanted to, house speaker john boehner, r-ohio, could put the senate-passed bill on the floor that would re-open the government for a few more months without any conditions. so far, however, tea party-aligned republicans have put more pressure on boehner than house moderates.

trump: you were in total contact with the white house, and perhaps, sadly, obama probably still listened to you. i don't think he would be listening to you very much anymore.

margaret brennan: but back in 20-- back in 2016 in october of 2016, when russia was doing this disinformation campaign, the obama administration did declassify information at that time. so there is a precedent. why doesn't the trump administration do that?
democrats greeted trump's declaration with glee, having won their house majority largely by campaigning on the issue of health care. republicans, meanwhile, were left scratching their heads, wondering why the president would bring up a sore subject when he had better news to tout.
early wednesday, trump phoned into nbc news for a today show interview, where he called himself obama's worst nightmare.
the house gop on wednesday is efforting to bring the three bills back up for a vote but with a rules change requiring a simple majority to pass instead of a 2/3 majority.
but the obamacare repeal effort imploded in the senate, leaving the growth of medicaid untouched and the health care law's subsidies in place. politically, the effort both angered the gop base and whipped up the democratic opposition.

senator amy klobuchar: yeah, i just went back and looked at that testimony. i look at the face of that sweet little girl seven-year-old jakelin caal. she looks like the faces of the kids that were in my daughter's second grade class. and he came and testified before us and i asked him if he regretted any of the trump immigration policies and he said he did, but he didn't even mention that this had happened. under law they're supposed to tell congress within twenty-four hours if someone dies. so, we clearly have to get to the bottom of that. but the second thing is comprehensive immigration reform, so that we can have some order at the border and that we can have a smart plan that works for our country, including a path to citizenship and doing something about states like mine where we don't have enough workers in our fields and in our factories. making sure that we have smart policies that work with fencing and other things. and that's not what they're talking about. what they're talking about is chaos.
stephen miller: one of the great tragedies that is going on in our country today is the loopholes in our immigration laws and the deficiencies in our immigration laws. and left wing, activist judicial rulings that incentivize the most vulnerable populations to come to our country. last year--
here's a closer look at the limitations of short-term health plans and what you need to watch out for.

late monday night, in a last ditch effort to end the ping-ponging between the house and senate, house republicans offered to setup a bipartisan conference committee to negotiate the differences between the house and senate bills. senate majority leader harry reid, d-nev., rejected that proposal outright, repeating his mantra that the senate isn't interested in passing anything but a clean spending bill and that they won't be forced to negotiate with a gun to our head. senate democrats also pointed out that they had been calling for a bipartisan conference for months, a request that had been brushed off by house republicans.

i've only been spending my entire life making sure that as many people as possible get health insurance, he said on cbs' face the nation sunday. the affordable care act, which i helped write, which i voted for, supported, has done some good things. no question. but we have got to go beyond that. we've got to join the rest of the industrialized world. healthcare for all as a right.

the new online tool available at voteamerica.com allows voters to check their voter registration status and apply for an absentee ballot. cleaver explained that voter registration tools are much easier because every state except wyoming and new hampshire will accept the same form. but registering to vote-by-mail is a bit more complicated, cleaver said, because it's all state and election specific. cleaver said her organization's new tool gives voters who want a mail-in ballot the right form and it also gives you the right mailing address. there are 10,000 mailing addresses and it is so much more complicated than voter registration.
but the most notable difference between the two gop candidates is their approach to governing as a conservative.
terrorism and islamic extremism have risen dramatically as a concern since the recent attacks in paris and california. now one in five americans volunteer either terrorism generally (14 percent) or islamic extremism specifically (5 percent) as the most important problem facing the country today, compared to just 2 percent combined in october. for the first time since 2006, terrorism outstrips the economy as the country's top concern.

trevor potter: correct. the-- the owners of the national enquirer who agreed, apparently in a meeting with candidate trump to use their corporate money to buy the story and prevent the american public from knowing about it right in the middle of the run-up to the general election.
analysis on that story and others, are just ahead on face the nation.
john dickerson: can you give me your assessment of the president as a negotiator on this daca question?
yeah, a lot of memories from 2016, gabbard said. but, you know, i'm grateful that he's become a friend over the years. and no matter what else is going on, when we bump into each other on the campaign trail now, there's always a warm hug and a laugh and a check-in from both of us about how each other's doing.
margaret brennan: but it could if the supreme court upholds this ruling.
manuel bojorquez: there are also questions about how the vaccines will stand up to new strains. johnson & johnson, which is set to ask for emergency authorization of its one-dose vaccine this week, noted that its efficacy dropped from seventy-two percent in the u.s. to fifty-seven percent in south africa, where the mutant strain is driving new cases.
what boehner is angry with is that conservatives said if we promised to repeal obamacare, let's actually stand up and repeal obamacare, cruz said. what boehner is angry with is if we said we promised to stop amnesty, let's actually honor our promises and stop amnesty. what boehner is angry with is if we promised to stop the debt that is bankrupting our kids and grandkids, let's actually do something meaningful to honor those commitments.
less than two months until election day, president trump unveiled a new slate of 20 potential nominees to the supreme court, wednesday, in the event of a vacancy - highlighting a cornerstone of his presidency among republicans and a major campaign issue responsible for coalescing conservative and evangelical support around him in 2016, reports cbs news campaign reporter nicole sganga.
i think he made a mistake when he said that. it's just incorrect information, the president told reporters during a white house briefing. that is incorrect information. mr. trump did not offer a specific timeline for distribution, saying only that the vaccine would be ready very soon.
so, tonight, i am extending an open hand to work with members of both parties, democrats and republicans, to protect our citizens of every background, color, religion, and creed. my duty, and the sacred duty of every elected official in this chamber, is to defend americans, to protect their safety, their families, their communities, and their right to the american dream. because americans are dreamers too.
mr. trump hasn't given up on repealing and replacing obamacare. the budget supports eliminating aca premium subsidy payments and medicaid expansion, and distributing that money to the states in block grants they can use to run their own health care programs. block grants were the backbone of the plan republican sens. lindsey graham (south carolina) and bill cassidy (louisiana) introduced last fall that went nowhere.
the president also said his administration will be adding 2 or 3 additional members to the task force with a renewed focus on re-opening the country. i look forward to when we can close the task force, because then the job will be essentially, hopefully over, mr. trump later added.
john dickerson: but i want to know why a president who came-- just what's gone wrong? why has he not been able to apply? he came in as the great negotiator. what is it that has made it impossible for a person who ran on fixing the system
margaret brennan: what-- are you laying responsibility on the u.s. government for this little girl's death?
and perhaps most pointedly, team mcconnell worked aggressively to counter bannon's influence, mocking the strategist's support for controversial candidates, including roy moore in the alabama special election, which cost republicans the long-held senate seat.
the only possible candidate this fall is the trump-pence republican ticket, he said. that way, we have a republican ticket to implement republican principles in washington.
margaret brennan: so, to be clear there, you're predicting that this goes to the supreme court and that the supreme court ultimately strikes down?
mayor francis suarez: well, you know, we've been restricted from being able to put in mitigation measures. i had implemented a mask in public order back when we were allowed to do that during the summer, and that drove down cases by ninety percent. now, we're not allowed to implement a mask in public order. it's something that i had been speaking to the coronavirus task force about. the good news is that as-- as opposed to the summer where we had twenty-three hundred covid patients countywide, which was a tremendous strain on our hospital system, now we have less than a thousand patients. so, you know, even though, we are, you know, obviously, battling with-- with a new strain, that is not thankfully at this point materializing into more hospitalizations.
president trump and republicans in congress tried several times to repeal and replace the aca in 2017, but were unsuccessful. the repeal of the individual mandate was included as part of the tax overhaul passed at the end of last year.
ed o'keefe (cbs news political correspondent/@edokeefe): it's certainly one of them. and-- and, you know, a lot of people commented as he was entering the race that in some ways bernie sanders should kind of won the 2016 cycle because all of his ideas have now become, essentially, party orthodox here or at least open for more vigorous debate. and when it comes to medicare for all, certainly that is one of them. the fact that the party is now comfortable having a-- a more robust discussion about it, i think is a signal that he and-- and elizabeth warren certainly have dominated the first few months when it comes to the ideas debate.

margaret brennan: so, the president said yesterday he wants repeal and replace handled a little bit differently, reference to failed attempt by republicans in the past, and that he'll sit down with democrats if the supreme court upholds the ruling. so, are you predicting that you spend the next year crafting a new law from scratch?

i have read through whether it's the whistleblower complaint, i've read through the transcript, and just on its face value, i don't think there is anything there, per se, ernst said. the whistleblower acknowledges this is second-, third-hand information. so the senate intelligence committee, they will sort through all of that. and if there are additional witnesses that need to come forward, or they need to visit with they should do that.

the supreme court refused tuesday to consider a fast-track review of a lawsuit that threatens the obama-era health care law, making it highly unlikely that the justices would decide the case before the 2020 election. the decision comes hours before chief justice john roberts will preside over the president's impeachment trial.
i have been with donald for 18 years. he never had a hidden agenda, she said. like me, he loves this country very much.
president donald trump: no, but you start with me.
the senator's plan would task the department of health and human services with setting fair prescription drug prices. the price would be determined in part by looking at the prices for the drug in other industrialized countries such as the united kingdom and canada. and if the companies continue to sell the drug at a higher price than the one set by hhs, harris would have the government tax their profits from the drug at 100%, with the money reallocated to consumers in the form of rebates.
the report filed by the officer read that he believed that she was a danger to herself and took her to an undisclosed facility.
a white house official confirmed that the two have fought over the administration's efforts to come up with a replacement to the nation's health care law, the affordable care act. politico first reported their battles over an obamacare alternative, stating that verma spent six months developing a proposal, only to have azar scuttle it before president trump could see it. according to politico, azar thought verma's plan would end up strengthening the aca, rather than replacing it.
jamelle bouie: it is divisive. i'm not sure-- i guess my perspective on these sorts of things is informed by previous election cycles, which is compared to some of the language that emerged in 2016 or 2008 or 2004, it's not that divisive, right? i-- i distinctly remember in the 2008 pri-- democratic primary, the candidates clinton-obama throwing extremely hard punches at each other saying things that in the moment made it feel like there may not be unity once the primary ended, but what happened was unity the party got back together. so sanders calling out the republican establishment, the democratic establishment, that's-- should have been his brand--
you say who's making these deals? we're going the make great deals. we're going to have a strong border. we're going to bring back law and order. just today, policemen was shot, two killed. and this is happening on a weekly basis. we have to bring back respect to law enforcement. at the same time, we have to take care of people on all sides. we need justice.
while republicans largely oppose obamacare on its merits, they have not been able to coalesce around an alternative when they controlled both chambers of congress and the white house. in a divided government, the task is infinitely more difficult. and republicans lack a central figure to effectively make the case to the public.

kavanaugh was finally confirmed in 2006 and has since made his name as a reliably conservative judge, although he does have his detractors on the right who have questioned his rulings involving contraception and obamacare. but he has a resume and background that would make it hard for anyone to argue that he is unqualified for the supreme court.

what action has the justice department taken today in the michael flynn case?
melvin dummar ap photo melvin dummar (august 28, 1944-december 9, 2018) maintained that in late december 1967, he found an unshaved man with long stringy hair and baggy clothes face-down and bloody on a dirt road near lida, nevada. the man claimed to be howard hughes, an aviation and business tycoon who spent years in seclusion. he told me who he was, but i didn't believe him, dummar told the ap in 2006. i thought he was just a bum or a prospector or something. dummar ended up driving the man nearly 190 miles to las vegas before giving him some pocket change and dropping him off behind the sands hotel. about eight years later, after hughes died, a handwritten will, rife with misspellings, was dropped off at dummar's gas station, addressed to the mormon church. the will named the church of jesus christ of latter-day saints as beneficiary of $156 million – a 1/16 share of the hughes estate – and also bequeathed $156 million to dummar for rescuing him in the desert. for years dummar, whose story was depicted in the 1980 film melvin and howard (starring paul le mat as dummar and jason robards as hughes), fought legal battles over the authenticity of the will. jurors and judges decided against him. i've been called everything from a crook to a forger, dummar told the ap in 2007 in utah, where he was then running a business selling frozen meat.
no american should be denied health coverage based on their pre-existing medical conditions, sen. orrin hatch, r-utah, said wednesday. hatch chairs the finance committee, which oversees health care and tax law. he supported repeal of the aca's insurance mandate, but draws a line on pre-existing conditions.

the vast majority of those people are eligible for coverage under the affordable care act, including 12.7 million through medicaid and 8.4 million in the aca marketplaces. another 5.7 million are not eligible and would have to pay the full cost of their coverage, and more will likely remain uninsured.

paula reid: rudy giuliani and others, they've consistently said for months that it's wrapping up. i think just a couple of moments ago, he said, oh, it's just down to parking tickets. well, that's just not true. and we know that's not true for a few reasons. first of all, we still have the outstanding issues surrounding the prosecution of paul manafort. he won't even be sentenced until february in one case, and then march in another. we also know that the grand jury continues to hear from witnesses. now we know they've called witnesses regarding roger stone. we know they are in talks with jerome corsi about a possible plea deal that appears to fall through. i mean, to resolve all of these things, this is going to take months. so, anyone that suggests that this is all wrapping up, that is just not true.
without faster job growth — unlikely at this stage of the recovery — or increased fiscal aid, households, businesses and state and local governments will be increasingly susceptible to a deterioration of the health situation, noted gregory daco, chief u.s. economist at oxford economics.

we estimate the expiry of the [lwa] program will create a $600 billion (annualized) income cliff leaving household income roughly 3% below its pre-covid level in october, daco wrote. with over 20 million individuals still claiming unemployment benefits, such a shortfall could have even deeper local consequences.
the question remains, why can't big insurers make obamacare work? one important reason: not enough healthy people sign up.

neil simon rene perez/ap photo although he was known for memorable comedic moments, prolific playwright and screenwriter neil simon (july 4, 1927-august 26, 2018) had a difficult childhood growing up in the bronx, as his father frequently left the family. humor helped get him through the difficult times. well, it explained things to me anyway, he told sunday morning in 2006. it made it easier to deal with if you were able to laugh at it. simon often used his own experiences for comic material, from biloxi blues to brighton beach memoirs and broadway bound. writing gags for tv, especially sid caesar's your show of shows, would also inspire his play laughter on the 23rd floor. many of his biggest broadway hits, including barefoot in the park, the odd couple, last of the red hot lovers, sweet charity, the prisoner of second avenue, plaza suite, the sunshine boys and chapter two, would be adapted for films and tv. he also wrote original screenplays, including after the fox, the heartbreak kid, the out-of-towners and the goodbye girl. in all, simon earned four oscar nominations, won three tony awards and a golden globe, and received the pulitzer prize (for lost in yonkers). being the toast of broadway meant something quite personal for simon. as he told sunday morning, many times i would go to the theatre and stand in the back and people would come up and they say, 'how do you know my father?' 'how do you know my cousin?'
raddatz: thank you, mr. trump. i want to move on. this next question from the public through the bipartisan open debate coalition's online forum, where americans submitted questions that generated millions of votes. this question involves wikileaks release of purported excerpts of secretary clinton's paid speeches, which she has refused to release, and one line in particular, in which you, secretary clinton, purportedly say you need both a public and private position on certain issues. so, tu (ph), from virginia asks, is it ok for politicians to be two-faced? is it acceptable for a politician to have a private stance on issues? secretary clinton, your two minutes.

steve ditko marvel comics/jim lee via twitter at marvel comics stan lee originally asked his artist on fantastic four, jack kirby, to take a stab at creating spider-man, but lee was unsatisfied and gave the gig to steve ditko (november 2, 1927-c. june 29, 2018).the son of a johnstown, pa., steel-mill worker, the army vet who began working in comics in the 1950s in new york created the look of peter parker and his alter-ego spidey in 1962 in an issue of amazing fantasy. a year later, ditko introduced the world to surgeon-turned-metaphysical superhero doctor strange. ditko left marvel in 1966, and would work at dc, before returning in 1979 and creating machine man, the micronauts and squirrel girl. while lee embraced his status as a creative god among comics fans, ditko was a recluse who nonetheless won the worship of the most hardcore comic-book geeks. scott derrickson, director of the 2016 movie doctor strange, told the hollywood reporter that ditko was like author j.d. salinger: he is private and has intentionally stayed out of the spotlight. writer neil gaiman praised the artist's contribution to the marvel universe to the washington post: without steve ditko, there would have been none of the weird stuff off to the side.

we've gone from caring about character, rule of law, defending the constitution, a cogent national security policy, free trade. where are all those issues? said co-founder john weaver, a strategist who previously worked with mccain and john kasich. imagine if you had traveled the country for 30 years, fighting for republican principles, and you learn it was all a lie. no one cares about all the issues that we fought for.
without ever explicitly naming trump, mr. obama scolded the 2016 candidate for proposing to ban all muslims from the u.s. when politicians insult muslims, whether abroad or our fellow citizens... that doesn't make us safer, he said. that's not telling it like it is. it's just wrong. it diminishes us in the eyes of the world. it makes it harder to achieve our goals. and it betrays who we are as a country.

margaret brennan: well, i think everyone wants that safety. i want to ask you about the aid package you're referencing there. this morning, as you know, a group of about ten republican senators sent a letter to the president and they say they just want a meeting. they have a proposal that they say mirrors many of the same things the president wants, including money for vaccine and health supplies, targeted stimulus checks, slightly different from what the president's proposing, enhanced unemployment. is the president open to these ideas? and will he meet with them?

but the meta-message of the trump movement is that washington just doesn't work, that the swamp needs to be drained, that both parties are more interested in politics than people. and every congressional failure, from the obamacare repeal fiasco to the #daca shutdown, feeds that overarching message.

during a press conference after announcing her exploratory committee, warren pushed for more accountability in the economy and pledged to go after drug companies. the problem is washington works great for those with influence. warren also came out against political action committees to fund campaigns. democrats are the party of the people -- we join together and we fund our campaigns, she told reporters. we make our campaigns work through the people. controversy warren's claims of native american ancestry, which her opponents say she used unfairly to get ahead, have been the source of controversy since her first run for the senate. in an attempt to silence critics --namely, president trump -- ahead of a presidential bid, warren released the results of a dna test in 2018 that showed a tiny portion of native american heritage, along with a campaign-like video about her family history. the move backfired, inviting criticism from tribal leaders and native american groups. and it raised questions about how effectively warren will be able to compete with president trump. what trump says the heritage controversy put warren high on mr. trump's hit list. he frequently refers to her as pocahontas, and while campaigning over the summer, he pledged to give $1 million to charity if she would take a dna test. he later denied making the pledge once she released the results of the test but has continued to criticize warren over the backlash to her dna video. she did very badly in proving that she was of indian heritage.

margaret brennan: because i know you've been critical of senator sanders for not being strong enough in his condemnation of some of the vitriolic sentiment online. and senator sanders has come out with a statement saying, and he said it on the debate stage as well, that perhaps some of this may be fueled by the russians. in other words,--

when roberts asked how people can find insurance before any mitigation efforts are put in place, before they get sick, pence struggled to answer. pence pointed out that the administration has extended waivers to states to expand coverage for coronavirus testing and treatment, and extended waivers for medicare, and said medicaid can serve lower-income populations.

years before biden was the democratic party's presumptive nominee and mark kelly was the best-funded senate candidate in the country, republicans say they were already ramping up their operation to defend arizona. the state is now a key battleground where democrats, citing promising polls and a recent senate victory, hope to score a win in a state that last elected a democrat to the white house nearly three decades ago. arizona democrats claim they are planning their largest ever ground operation this cycle. but mr. trump's team already has more than 30 staff on the ground, with thousands more arizonans trained through their volunteer program. the rnc understands, and the president understands, that arizona is a top priority state and the resources are following, greg safsten, executive director of arizona's republican party, told cbs news campaign reporter alex tin this week as mr. trump made his second visit to the state in under three months.
experts counter russia and syria's explanation of chemical attack
while democrats argue barrett's writings indicate she would kill the health care law, the dispute before the supreme court in november raises different issues than the 2012 case, including whether the individual mandate is severable from the rest of obamacare if the mandate is deemed unconstitutional.
trump made it clear several months before conway's interview with cnn in april that he was under audit and that he wouldn't release his tax returns until it is completed.
on his way to ohio, biden told reporters barrett's catholic faith shouldn't be a factor in democrat senators' questioning this week.
trump: absolutely. i mean, she calls our people deplorable, a large group, and irredeemable. i will be a president for all of our people. and i'll be a president that will turn our inner cities around and will give strength to people and will give economics to people and will bring jobs back.
sen. sanders: they cannot afford a health care--
the former vp wrote in his statement that any complaints by reade — if they exist — should be released by the secretary of the senate. senate personnel records are managed by the secretary of the senate, who did not respond to requests for comment. some have questioned whether there is a mention of reade in biden's personal senate papers, housed at the university of delaware. biden insists there is not, and said he doesn't want them released yet because they are mostly political. the papers are scheduled to become public two years after biden leaves public office.

margaret brennan: but you're asking for it?
trump: she said a lot of things that were false. i mean, i think we should be allowed to maybe...
ivanka trump: i think it's impossible to go through this journey and not change for the better. you meet-- and in my father's case, literally millions of americans, and they speak to you with a candor about their struggles, their challenges. they share with you their most intimate stories. so you connect with people in a different way. and you grow.

cbs news political correspondent ed o'keefe reports that trump also told the governors his administration will step in if needed to assist states with reopening plans but didn't specify when or how exactly federal intervention would occur. our gradual reopening plans are moving along and they're moving along very rapidly, the president said, according to audio of the call obtained by cbs news. the governors are making their decisions, and want to make their decisions, and that's the way i want it too, and we will step in if we see something going wrong, or if we disagree, and some people say that's nice, and some people say i shouldn't be doing that, but we're going to do it if we see something wrong. melania trump also called on governors to focus on the physical and mental health of young children during the pandemic. children need us in this time more than ever, the first lady said, adding later she's especially worried about younger kids because they don't have anybody to turn to when they're, we could say, locked up at home because of no school, no kindergarten. i'm worried about them and we need to take care of them and go and check on them.
the agency was founded as a solution to the obamacare website's repeat system crashes. though president trump has taken issue with many things his predecessor put into action, his administration has been leaning heavily on the program.
mike bloomberg: the middle of the road doesn't want extremism. they want evolution rather than revolution. and if bernie sanders is the candidate, donald trump will win. donald trump not only will win, but the house will go back to being in republican hands, the senate will stay in republican hands. downstream, a lotta the state houses will flip back republican. and when that happens, you're gonna have gerrymandering at the local level and judicial appointments at the federal level that will last for decades. and so, what's really at stake here is the future of this country for a very long time. and that's why i'm running.

donald trump supported the invasion of iraq. howard stern interviewed donald trump on sept. 11, 2002, noted buzzfeed, and he asked trump, are you for invading iraq? trump responded, yeah, i guess so.
mike bloomberg: yeah, sure. there's an election seven or so days later. there's another one 14 days later. there's a number of elections after that.

margaret brennan: we're back now with our panel. anna, can you pick us up here? i mean, we-- we started off the program with bernie sanders, someone who embraces the term democratic socialist, who is embracing government-run and government-financed health care. the president is trying to use a lot of those principles as a kind of a rallying cry for his own supporters, saying reject socialism. it's socialism or me. does this actually resonate?
bill whitaker: what are some of the things people have said to you when they finally get to you?
biden: --looks like several thousand people to make sure that we have a place from which we can operate, if in fact, you find that there's a re-amassing of taliban capacity, excuse me, of al-qaeda and or isis capacity to strike the united states like happened in 9/11.

so how will democratic senators fare in states where mr. trump won and remains more popular than the national average? will they hold their punches against the president, or stand up to him when they disagree? the ap points out that in north dakota, heitkamp has chosen a mix of both as she seeks to relay to north dakotans that she is fighting for their best interests. she has championed mr. trump's de-regulation policies that benefit north dakota's farmers and mining industry and has voted to confirm the majority of his cabinet and judicial nominees. but at the same time, she has criticized mr. trump for his trade policies that could hurt north dakota's farmers and ranchers. will heitkamp's efforts be enough to win re-election, or will these red state voters reject any democrat that trump opposes?

democrats on thursday focused on health care as the trump administration faced a deadline to file a brief with the supreme court to strike down the affordable care act. this comes as coronavirus cases in the united states surge and nearly 20 million people are facing unemployment due to the pandemic, reports cbs news political unit associate producer sarah ewall-wice. in march, the supreme court agreed to hear a case at the request of democratic attorneys general seeking to reverse a lower court ruling. the initial case was brought by texas, other republican state officials and backed by the trump administration seeking to dismantle the health care law. the case will be heard during the next term, which does not begin until october. the aca is more popular than ever for one simple reason: it works, said dnc chairman tom perez thursday in a statement ahead of the expected filing. the aca has significantly reduced the ranks of the uninsured; it's helped americans can get the health care they need and helped keep them from being bankrupted just because they get sick.

lamb ran as a moderate on guns and an opponent of democratic leader nancy pelosi, saying that he wouldn't vote for her for speaker. fair enough. but he also embraced obamacare, said that congressional republicans would go after entitlements, and argued that the gop tax cut was a giveaway to the rich. he ran, in other words, as a liberal, if in some respects an old-school one.

margaret brennan: but the candidates get a chance to throw some elbows and distinguish themselves on the debate stage on tuesday that will be right here on cbs. who succeeds in that arena?
at issue in the case brought by a group of republican-led states — who are backed by the trump administration — is whether the health care law's individual mandate is unconstitutional, since congress abolished the financial penalty for individuals who do not purchase health insurance in its overhaul of the tax code in 2017. the justices are also tasked with deciding whether the rest of obamacare can survive if the individual mandate is invalidated.
the apparent snag is puzder's difficulty selling his holdings in privately owned cke restaurants, the parent corporation of hardee's and carl's jr. until he worked out a plan to do that and filed a financial disclosure, his nomination couldn't go forward. but after he filed his paperwork, apparently laying out such a plan, the new hearing was slated for feb. 16.

even though they have obamacare coverage… their deductibles are so high that, in essence, they'd have to spend money they don't have before they can even begin to use the plan, rubio said. now that doesn't mean you throw those people out in the street, it doesn't mean we go back to the system we had before 2010. i don't want to go back to that either. i want to replace it with a system that for the vast majority of americans means they're going to be able to access private health insurance that's more affordable and covers the things they want in a vibrant, private marketplace.
monday night, house republican leaders unveiled changes to the bill that would help older americans with expenses, and would immediately prohibit additional states from opting into the obamacare medicaid program. they would also, however, allow states to opt into traditional medicaid block grants.

their 2020 goal is to knock on more than 10 million doors and get out the vote in 17 states for the presidential and senate races. according to ptp, conversations will focus on helping voters make a plan to vote safely including by mail. they're targeting a mix of voters including those under 35, voters of color and people who stayed home in 2016. donald trump's response to the pandemic and recent protests further prove that he is fundamentally incapable of doing his job, said executive director alex morgan in a statement. it's essential that we get to work now by having the kind of early, face-to-face conversations that our research shows boost democratic turnout.
that uncertainty has biden uneasy on the campaign trail as he hopes to both defend the law from republican-led efforts to dismantle it and talk up the 2010 obama feat to democrats who have somewhat adopted medicare for all as seemingly a requirement for candidates.

there were reports that several top administration officials had been at odds over the justice department's brief. however, when vice president mike pence's chief of staff, marc short, who was present for the conversation about the challenge to aca, was asked about this by cbs news' major garrett, he denied that there had been much chaos, and characterized the discussion as a healthful conversation.

penny marshall paramount television/abc in 2012 actress and director penny marshall (october 15, 1943-december 17, 2018) told cbs this morning that she had been sent by her father to the university of new mexico (and her brother, director garry marshall, to northwestern) in order to lose their bronx accents. it didn't work, she said, not that she had to. marshall's distinctive voice and smart-alecky delivery were the bedrock of her character laverne defazio, a brewery worker who dreams of better things, in the top-rated '70s sitcom laverne & shirley. the series would take her character from milwaukee to california during its eight-year run (with even a cartoon spinoff along the way). her early roles also included myrna, oscar's secretary, in the odd couple, and appearances on the mary tyler moore show and love, american style. but she became a formidable force behind the camera, as the director of the comedies big (featuring tom hanks as a 12-year-old boy magically transformed into a 30-year-old boy), and a league of their own (in which hanks' coach memorably castigates a player with there's no crying in baseball!). both movies passed the $100 million gross mark, blazing a trail for female-directed films. marshall's other credits included awakenings, starring robin williams and robert de niro (only the second film directed by a woman to be nominated for a best picture oscar), the preacher's wife, and riding in cars with boys.

according to bpi, only 35% of mr. trump's facebook ads that mention impeachment — less than $200,000 of the roughly $2 million spent — target voters in swing states. the buy suggests that accusations of a democratic overreach on impeachment might not be a winning message with people who aren't already trump supporters, but the president's massive fundraising haul in the third quarter shows that playing to the base can have a massive strategic upside.

to paraphrase that great political philosopher syndrome from the movie the incredibles, it's because when everything is trump's fault, nothing is. and from his first day on the campaign trail until the anti-semitic massacre on saturday, the media appear to have the same news story logged into their computers, one in which the details change, but the ending is always the same: …and that's why it's all trump's fault.

nicolas roeg wenn/photofest via ap images nicolas roeg (august 15, 1928-november 23, 2018) had already written himself into the film history books when he shot second-unit footage for david lean's epic lawrence of arabia, and was cinematographer on the masque of the red death, fahrenheit 451 and petulia. but by 1970 he had turned to directing himself, with the mick jagger film performance. he would later direct david bowie in the sci-fi classic the man who fell to earth. known for provocative stories, he was perhaps best known for the 1973 thriller don't look now, based on the daphne du maurier tale, about a couple (donald sutherland and julie christie) mourning their daughter's death, who encounter strange goings-on with a psychic in venice. other notable credits include walkabout, set in the australian outback; bad timing: a sensual obsession; insignificance; and roald dahl's the witches. much of roeg's acclaim for his work, from critics, other filmmakers, or ticket buyers, came after-the-fact, long after his films first hit screens, a fact that did not strike him with pleasure in a 2011 guardian interview, when it was suggested he was ahead of his time. i hate that expression, roeg said. i don't want to be ahead of my time. this is my time. it's marmite, isn't it? you like it or you don't.

trevor potter: well, i-- i think the point there is that you have the defenders of the president as well as the president himself saying that violations of law don't matter. and i don't think that's where we are as a country. we believe in the rule of law. you could make the argument, well, it's more or less important. i obviously think it's more important. but to-- to say we're just going to ignore violations of law because it's politically convenient to, we don't want to talk about it is i think a real problem for the-- the country. these are laws that were enacted after the watergate reforms, when we learned the problems of corruption, of secret money in elections, of payments of hush money. richard nixon's lawyer went to jail for payments of hush money that were cash payments not disclosed. and i-- and i think the-- the point that paula makes is an important one which is there are a lot of investigations all of a sudden. you open every door and there is potentially illegal activity behind it. the inaugural committee we now know about. last week, the plea by the russian woman who was working with the nra and organizing trips to moscow and organizing russians to meet american politicians, all of this connected to different aspects of the trump campaign with a number of u.s. attorney's offices looking at it.

senator john barrasso: which would be a conte-- we have a different makeup of the supreme court. it may be several years till it gets there. but as a doctor, i will tell you, i focus on people with preexisting conditions, i've always been focused as i was working on health care legislation to make sure people could get the care they need from a doctor that they choose at lower costs. and we didn't get that in wyoming. we had-- after obamacare was passed, many people lost their insurance, premiums doubled. so, that wasn't-- that doesn't give people affordable insurance that's appropriate for them and their families.
margaret brennan: how can you stop--
as the only incumbent republican senator running in a state that hillary clinton won in 2016, heller would much rather focus on tax reform and the economy than immigration or repealing obamacare -- which republicans have so far failed to do. heller supported the comprehensive immigration reform bill in 2013, which the president and his allies have assailed. and although he ultimately supported mr. trump's obamacare repeal efforts, he did so only after much public deliberation, taking hits from the left and the right, both left unsatisfied in a state that expanded medicaid.

she's a fan of her husband's method of coping with stress
sen. barrasso: i think government never does big things really well. i'm for more of a step-by-step and i want to start with the first step of people with preexisting conditions. my wife bobbi is a breast cancer survivor. she's been through three operations, chemotherapy twice and i will tell you as a husband, as well as a doctor, i am committed to helping people with preexisting conditions. we can do that- they're a number of ways to do it. one is what maine has done in terms of their high risk people helping with them with additional subsidies. but at the same time, then it allows insurance to be much cheaper, more affordable for other people. so i want to do- our-our children's health insurance plan that works across the country. it works so well because states have a bigger say in that. when i was in our state senate in wyoming, we knew that what we wanted to do in wyoming may not fit what people would want in new york state. but if you give states that flexibility and freedom to do what works best with the money, i think it works much better for families and for patients.
defenders of the affordable care act argued that the issues raised by the case are too important to let the litigation drag on for months or years in lower courts, and that the 5th u.s. circuit court of appeals in new orleans erred when it struck down the health law's now toothless requirement that americans have health insurance.

marc bayard, the director of the institute for policy studies' black worker initiative, told cbs news that in some ways this data was unsurprising and ties into the much larger racial inequities and economic injustice that african-americans have faced for a long time. if we think about the black-owned businesses that we've grown up with, they're smaller, they're individual entrepreneurs, they weren't well capitalized before, said bayard. …without the working capital, without the ability to access the federal loan programs…it's pretty cataclysmic, the impact of some of the inability to get capital for these small businesses in this pandemic.

president donald trump: i'd like not to, but, you know, perhaps everybody has to take a little responsibility for it. but when people put out phony witch hunts, you know, when they spy on your campaign, you have to fight back. and if you don't fight back, you're not sitting here very long. you go back home.
for the last year we have sought to restore the bonds of trust between our citizens and their government.

people do unexpected things and pigeon holes ignore gray areas in the law, gorsuch told south carolina senator lindsey graham, who was the only senator on the judiciary committee who showed up at gorsuch's 2006 confirmation hearing to question him in person. my personal views, as i hope i have made clear, have nothing to do with the case before me in any case.
joe biden (former vice president/@joebiden/democratic presidential candidate/@joebiden): it's also been about--
earlier this week the commonwealth fund released its annual affordable care act tracking survey, and the news isn't good for consumers struggling to afford individual health insurance coverage.
he said the heroes of his youth were president john f. kennedy and martin luther king, jr., but he switched to the republican party because of ronald reagan and signed on for the reagan revolution.
margaret brennan: but democrats, voters, and even president trump are asking the question.
the trump campaign responded to biden's ohio trip with mockery. campaign manager bill stepien made fun of the former vice president monday, claiming he had traveled to ohio to speak to a handful of people.
the pair had been sparring publicly since biden was a member of the senate and warren was a harvard law professor. in 2002, warren called out the then-senator from delaware in a new york times op-ed over bankruptcy legislation being debated in congress. they later butted heads over the same issue at a 2005 senate judiciary committee hearing.

sen. amy klobuchar unveiled a plan on cbs this morning friday to provide a cure and treatment options for some of the most aggressive chronic conditions facing the country's elderly population, including alzheimer's disease, by 2025. the 2020 democratic presidential candidate considers the issue to be one that hits close to home; her father has struggled with alzheimer's.

there is no vacancy on the supreme court, but it is possible the next president will appoint at least one justice in years to come. justice ruth bader ginsburg, who has emerged as the high court's liberal icon in recent years, faces health challenges. the bench's longest serving member, justice clarence thomas is 72. justice stephen breyer turns 83, next week.

obama's response: the same time everybody else learned it -- through news reports.
president trump said monday that he would reveal his supreme court nominee in a prime time announcement on tuesday from the white house.
we've got to remain energy-independent. it gives us much more power and freedom than to be worried about what goes on in the middle east. we have enough worries over there without having to worry about that.
if ossoff wins, it'll give heart to democrats that the enthusiasm among democratic voters and activists who oppose mr. trump can make a difference in midterm races, even in some republican districts. mr. trump's opponents around the country -- democrats and anti-trump independents -- will have some proof that mr. trump can be a political liability and they'll get a huge lift in terms of energy and enthusiasm for recruiting candidates and for fundraising.
carol gayman of manchester said that her new hampshire family and friends appeared more anxious than in previous years. democrats like her are desperate to beat president trump in november, and feel that the pressure is on to pick the right nominee. i think we're all very, very nervous. and hopeful at the same time that our country can move forward and get back to where we were morally. everyone is just so worried that we'll make the wrong decision, gayman said. it's sad for iowa. but now the onus is on new hampshire, she said, smiling. which is a good thing.
the house passed a continuing resolution on friday to keep the government open, which was rejected by the senate. house speaker paul ryan of wisconsin told cbs news' face the nation on sunday that the house would back a revised version being discussed in the senate that would extend funding until feb. 8. he joined us to discuss the shutdown and the possible paths forward as we head into the work week.

here's a short excerpt of the interview:
he spoke in toledo about his jobs and economic recovery plan and then will attend a get-out-the-vote event in cincinnati.
des moines, iowa — as a seemingly endless parade of democratic presidential candidates filtered through the iowa state fair this past weekend they were faced with many choices: which fried foods should be eaten in front of the camera? whose hands must be shaken? what's the best way to win over this narrow yet deeply important slice of the the party's electorate?
senate democrats are meeting thursday with white house officials, including white house chief of staff denis mcdonough, one day after house democrats met with members of the administration and demanded that by friday, the president put forward a plan to address the problem of dropped plans. house democrats are also scheduled to receive a briefing thursday afternoon from mcdonough.
before heading to new hampshire, tom steyer on tuesday stopped in nevada for a brief appearance at a las vegas middle school. cbs news campaign reporter alex tin says the event marks his 15th total day stumping in nevada, more than any other candidate, as rivals have dispatched surrogates to the state or battled it out on the airwaves. he kicked off his appearance asking whether the crowd had seen the news out of the delayed iowa caucus, where he has yet to pick up a delegate. there is such a big muddle that in fact they have put this into your hands, steyer remarked.
trump victory spokesperson samantha zager said the gop's path to winning back the house runs through california. zager added that despite the best attempts of gov. gavin newsom and california democrats to rig the election in favor of their failed candidate, californians rejected their tired socialist policies in favor of mike garcia. eight house seats, including the one california's 25th congressional district will be up for re-election this november.
john dickerson: he says he wants it to be a referendum on him and it turns out the voters are seeing it that way.
jeff zients: right. this is absolutely ours. and president biden, within the first couple of weeks, secured enough vaccines that by july 31st, there's enough to vaccinate 300 million americans.
ed wong (the new york times/@ewong): i think it shows that both republicans and democrats want to sort of take back the narrative of american values and sort of the values that we placed behind human rights and other issues like this. and-- and push back strongly against sort of the more transactional nature of president trump's policies. and so, i think that going into the new year in 2019 will see more that both, they-- they can't-- both houses will take up the yemen war resolution again and also rebuke against mbs, and i think we'll see more debate on that. and i think that there's strong momentum in both sides to sort of push forward with that.
health care was the number one issue in the 2018 midterms, and the persistent messaging on the issue helped flip the house to democratic control. democrats targeted republicans who voted to repeal the affordable care act with no plan to replace it, and those who supported the ongoing lawsuit in texas claimed the aca is unconstitutional.
chief justice john roberts, a key vote on a court split between conservatives and liberals, suggested that the trump administration's reliance on a federal religious freedom law to expand the exemption was too broad.
barrett is expected to jump right into the fray, and was greeted on her first day on the job with a petition from the board of elections in luzerne county, pennsylvania, to recuse herself from consideration of a case involving the state's deadline for mail-in ballots.
nancy wilson ronald zak/ap photo the polished pop-jazz vocals of nancy wilson (february 20, 1937-december 13, 2018) made her a platinum artist and top concert performer. influenced by dinah washington, nat king cole and others, wilson covered everything from jazz standards to little green apples, and in the 1960s alone released eight albums that reached the top 20 on billboard's pop charts. born in chillicothe, ohio, the eldest of six children of an iron foundry worker and a maid, wilson sang in church as a girl and by age 4 had decided on her profession. in high school she won a local tv station's talent contest and was given her own program. when she later moved to new york, she soon had a regular gig at the blue morocco. then, a demo recording of guess who i saw today got her a phone call from capitol records. within six weeks i had all the things i wanted, she said in an interview. sometimes elegant and understated, or quick and conversational and a little naughty, she was best known for her breakthrough guess who i saw today, and the 1964 hit (you don't know) how glad i am, which drew upon broadway, pop and jazz.

republican strategists offer mixed views on the issue's impact, with the most optimistic hoping to damage democrats by accusing them of favoring government-financed health care. about a third of senate democrats and two-thirds of house democrats have backed such legislation, a favorite with the party's most liberal voters, which republicans say will prompt government decision-making about care and tax increases to finance the proposal's huge costs.
lastly in special election news, there will be a debate on monday between republican tom tiffany and democrat tricia zunker in wisconsin's 7th district, formerly held by republican sean duffy.
even if a future speaker pelosi wanted to moveon.org, she couldn't—any more than republicans could avoid voting on an obamacare repeal-and-replace plan once trump was in the white house. a party can't spend years telling voters this [obamacare or trump] is so horrible, we must end it, and then, once in power, simply tell its base to put down the pitchforks, douse the torches and go home. if the democrats elected by their trump-hating base won't get rid of him, these primary voters will find some who will in 2020.
the dccc's hub also highlights the upcoming special election in california's 25th district, where democrat christy smith is facing republican mike garcia for katie hill's former seat. president trump began tweeting about the election tuesday night, pointing out her past comments about garcia's military service, and pushing the republican argument that smith voted to fire teachers. while smith has apologized about her comments on garcia, she pushed back against mr. trump's argument about her vote, saying that no teachers were fired.
the president and republican party's fundraising includes $76 million raised over the four days of the republican national convention. according to the trump campaign, august was the largest online fundraising month for the re-election effort ever.
donald trump: very much try and keep that. adds cost, but it's very much something we're going to try and keep.
she was the first senator to call on sen. al franken to resign in 2017 after he was accused of sexual harassment by several women. a few big democratic donors, including billionaire george soros, have said that they will not support gillibrand because of her position on franken. she has also distanced herself from the clintons. in november 2017, she said that president bill clinton should have resigned after his affair with white house intern monica lewinsky became public. what trump says president trump tweeted at gillibrand in december 2017 after she called on the president to resign due to sexual misconduct allegations against him. lightweight senator kirsten gillibrand, a total flunky for chuck schumer and someone who would come to my office begging for campaign contributions not so long ago (and would do anything for them), is now in the ring fighting against trump. very disloyal to bill & crooked-used! mr. trump tweeted. critics interpreted the words begging and used in the tweet as having a sexual connotation. you cannot silence me or the millions of women who have gotten off the sidelines to speak out about the unfitness and shame you have brought to the oval office, gillibrand wrote on twitter in response.
lesley stahl: does he listen to you?
cbs news political unit broadcast associate aaron navarro reports that the democratic congressional campaign committee immediately showed their support for eastman, and released an internal poll showing her beating bacon by 1% (48% eastman vs. 47% bacon). the poll also shows biden with a double digit lead over trump in the omaha metro-suburban district, biden 52% vs. trump 41%.
not that president trump's rhetoric is standard issue. it's not. his attacks on mexican-americans and women and muslims and pretty much everyone else are beyond anything america has ever seen from a president. and he's been denounced for it by members of his own party. polls show republican voters don't like what trump does on twitter. in theory, there should be common ground for a conversation about civility.
blankenship's attempt to run as a trump wannabe suffered a setback when the actual donald trump tweeted out don blankenship, currently running for senate, can't win the general election in your state...no way! remember alabama. vote rep. jenkins or a.g. morrisey!

robert o'brien: well, there's no briefing that i have received, that the president has received, that says that president putin is doing anything to try and influence the elections in favor of president trump. we just haven't seen that intelligence. if it's out there, i haven't seen it. i'd be surprised if i haven't seen it. the leaders of our-- the ic have not seen it. so i-- again, i don't know where this is coming from. i've heard these rumors and these leaks from adam schiff's committee, but i-- i have not seen them myself and i've seen no intelligence along those lines.
the senate then convened for a rare weekend session to clear the last hurdles before moving to the vote to confirm barrett, which is set to take place monday evening, just eight days before the presidential election.

randy weston cheung ming/verve records growing up, randy weston (april 6, 1926-september 1, 2018) was exposed to all genres of music by his parents – everything from jazz, gospel and calypso to classical and opera. returning home from world war ii, the army vet worked at his father's caribbean-style restaurant, trios, in brooklyn. there he befriended such music greats as louis armstrong, ella fitzgerald, dizzy gillespie, and igor stravinsky. he would eventually become a musician and composer whose work fused american jazz and blues with african rhythms, melding such influences as max roach, count basie, art tatum, thelonious monk and duke ellington. his first album, in 1954, reinterpreted cole porter standards, and he would collaborate with poet langston hughes on uhuru afrika. his subsequent releases showed an increasing reliance on the music of africa, and he traveled extensively on the continent, exploring his musical roots. a tour for the state department in the 1960s landed him in morocco, where he settled for five years, running the african rhythms club in tangiers. over the years weston would record 50 albums, including 1992's the spirit of our ancestors. play excerpt: african village bedford stuyvesant 1 by randy weston in 2014 weston told the telegraph newspaper, the great thing about african music is it's not music for the young, or the old, it's music for everybody.
despite his corporate work, patrick has remained engaged in democratic politics and helped campaign nationwide for congressional and gubernatorial candidates. since leaving the statehouse, patrick has remained tight with a small cadre of consultants who advised him during his deliberations last year over whether to mount a campaign.
a federal judge in florida ruled on sunday that a state law that prevented formerly incarcerated people with prior felony convictions from voting due to an inability to pay fees and fines was unconstitutional. u.s. district judge robert hinkle of the northern district of florida called the law a pay-to-vote system, adding in part that the requirement to pay fines and fees that are unknown and cannot be determined with diligence as a condition of voting is not constitutional. cbs news campaign reporter lacrai mitchell reports that in 2018, florida voted to pass the voting rights restoration for felons initiative — also called amendment 4 — so that most people with prior felony convictions who had served their sentences could vote. but the inability to pay unknown court fines and fees could still prevent some from enjoying their restored voting right. florida congresswoman and vice presidential contender val demings weighed in on the decision in a tweet on tuesday. florida voters overwhelmingly supported amendment 4, declaring that voting is a right, not a privilege, tweeted demings. glad to see judge hinkle uphold this cherished ideal and take us one step closer to true enfranchisement. florida democratic party chair terrie rizzo called the ruling a victory for american democracy and floridians in an emailed statement. the united states constitution once again proved stronger than trump, desantis and the florida gop's efforts to shred it.
that is why, tonight, i am asking congress to pass legislation to help ensure american foreign-assistance dollars always serve american interests, and only go to friends of america, not enemies of america.
this is the most important election that i've ever had in my whole life, said vivian thomas mccoy, who will take her frustration to a polling place. i think [trump] should wait like the lady on her dying bed asked him to do – wait, and then, whoever the president is, whether it's him or biden, then that person be put in office, because they wouldn't let obama do that.
coffman has called for a permanent daca solution and has pushed for a vote on it in the house. but although coffman stood up to the administration and its policies, it's telling that he did not criticize the president heading into his primary but rather cast the blame on his senior policy advisor stephen miller. this is indicative of the predicament of house republicans in competitive seats that the democrats are fighting to flip this fall. while these vulnerable republicans want to distance themselves from mr. trump's more controversial policies, they fear poking him too much and facing the wrath of him or his supporters, who they need to turn out to vote for them in the fall.
the city cut off foster care referrals to catholic social services in 2018 after learning it didn't work with same-sex couples, and in may of that year, the agency and a group of foster parents sued, arguing catholic social services was targeted by city officials and the decision to halt the referrals was unconstitutional.

ben domenech: i think it's very significant. i mean, the-- the fact is that there had been a real push within the republican coalition for criminal justice reform at the state level backed by the koch brothers and other groups that really wanted to see it as something that was part of the republican policy portfolio. that really was short circuited by the existence of the donald trump 2016 candidacy running on the law and order message that sounded more familiar to those who think that we might still be living in the late '70s. and-- and frankly, the-- the nomination and approval of jeff sessions as attorney general was something that really short-circuited that process. jared kushner worked very hard within the white house to try to push this forward. and i think it's significant that this was--

the events are also the first glimpse at biden's florida operations, which have yet to be tested in a big way. staffers and volunteers are calling, texting and emailing potential supporters urging them to tune into the two events, and aides said the campaign is also spending some money to advertise the event. and we should expect that biden will also be conducting local television interviews.
on the campaign trail, reeves is embracing president trump, who won the southern state by 17 points in 2016. he often name-drops similar political enemies and said if elected, he would act in the same fashion as the president. he's been ignoring his two primary competitors, waller and state representative robert foster, instead focusing on hood and establishment democrats.
some biden backers cited his time as vice president as reason enough to support him. anna jackson-morris, 66, summed up her support as ride or die biden because president obama trusted him, therefore i trust him.
you're going to see how he's taking care of people who, you know, he just meets them, you know, through newspaper stories he read about and has that sense of community, a sense of philanthropy, manafort said. so you're going to get a broader perspective of the man.
senator john barrasso: well, there are a lot of things you need to do with border security. one is a physical barrier but also the technology, the manpower, the enforcement, all of those things, and our current laws are in some ways an incentive for people to come to this country illegally and they go through great risk and possibly great harm.
about three-quarters of gop voters described themselves today as born-again or evangelical christians. of that group, trump won slightly more of the vote, 30 percent, than cruz, who got 29 percent. trump also did better than any of the other candidates with those voters who aren't evangelical or born-again.

(cbs news) franksville, wis. - in directing what appeared to be a new level of vitriol toward mitt romney, rick santorum on sunday described his rival as the worst republican in the country to put up against barack obama. santorum later, however, bristled at the notion that he was referring to anything other than romney's position on health care.
the numerous changes instituted by the law would be difficult to unwind, and the political consensus necessary for accomplishing it difficult to achieve. and despite near-universal agreement among republicans on the need to undo the law and replace it with something better, the gop has never united behind, much less passed, a legislative proposal to do so.
mike bloomberg: when i lived in this house my father made $6,000 the best year of his life. my parents took a mortgage out on the house, i think it was $11,000, if i remember, to help my sister and i go through school. i worked as hard as anybody. not better. i wasn't any better or worse, i was luckier, i think than other people.

he will be an extraordinary president, is how house speaker nancy pelosi began her endorsement video of joe biden on monday, cbs news campaign reporter bo erickson reports. the speaker, who remained neutral during the democratic primary, riddled off biden's accomplishments as vice president, crediting him with helping to pass obamacare and steering the rollout of the recovery act after the 2008 economic depression. on the trail, biden spoke often about president obama sending him to capitol hill to help bring together the priorities of the executive branch and congress, a possible sign that biden, when looking for a running mate, may want his own bridge between the biden white house and the speaker's office. on monday, biden's public schedule was bare but he's planning to attend another virtual private fundraiser monday evening. his campaign also released a lengthy statement on monday retooling previous criticisms of the trump administration's covid-19 response, labeling problems related to testing the original sin of the effort.
the candidates also had stark differences on issues.
after longtime new jersey senator frank lautenberg died in the summer of 2013, booker ran to fill his seat and defeated a little-known republican mayor in a special election. in 2014, he won reelection to serve a full term in the senate. during his years in the senate, he has sought to promote bipartisanship through conciliatory rhetoric. booker announced he was running for president on feb. 1, 2019, the first day of black history month. issues he has made criminal justice reform and the decriminalization of marijuana integral issues of his agenda in the senate. pointing to the disproportionate incarceration of minorities for marijuana-related offenses, he crafted the marijuana justice act in the summer of 2017. the bill would remove marijuana from the 1970 controlled substances act, withhold federal funding for states which continue to criminalize the substance, require courts to expunge convictions for marijuana use or possession and establish a federal fund to help low-income communities affected by the so-called war on drugs. the junior senator from new jersey is one of the chief architects of the first step act, a landmark bill that president trump signed into law in december after rare overwhelming bipartisan support in congress. the legislation increases investment in programs to curb recidivism among federal prisoners and modifies several sentencing laws, including mandatory minimum sentences for nonviolent drug offenders. although he hopes to tout it as a signature achievement of his career in congress, booker acknowledged that the bill is just one stepping stone to overhaul the criminal justice system.

cbs news campaign reporter zak hudak reports warren also introduced a bill with rep. rosa delauro to extend the federal deadline to file labor and employment claims until after the secretary of health and human services lifts the covid-19 public health emergency declaration.
on the other hand, at least one independent survey from the management consulting firm mckinsey, suggests that most obamacare enrollees previously had insurance. in a survey conducted in february, just 27 percent of respondents who have selected a health plan for 2014 said they were previously uninsured (that could include people who have selected a plan outside of the obamacare marketplace, mckinsey noted). in its earlier surveys, only 11 percent of respondents were previously uninsured.
stephen miller: as the president-- as the president has made very clear, the new democrat house, affords us the opportunity as a country to craft real bipartisan solutions on all the issues i just mentioned and many more.
lesley stahl: well, i guess the issue for them is marriage equality. do you support marriage equality?
and barack and i were raised with so many of the same values: that you work hard for what you want in life; that your word is your bond and you do what you say you're going to do; that you treat people with dignity and respect, even if you don't know them, and even if you don't agree with them.
we've heard this for decades in washington, d.c. i remember being a very young law student and hearing this about robert bork and hearing this about clarence thomas and hearing this about virtually every justice that's been nominated by a republican, he said. you cannot guarantee results with judges. what you can guarantee is that they are going to approach the task of judging as a judge. they're not going to substitute their own policy views for the will of the people. they're going to try to play it straight and read the law as passed by congress and as found in the constitution, not based upon what they think it ought to be, but what it is.
we need a nominee who can help democrats up and down the ticket, biden argued. but if senator sanders is the nominee for the party, every democrat in america…will have to carry the label senator sanders has chose for himself…he calls himself a democratic socialist.
why would somebody change a doctor when they are in good shape or they have been healthy for so long? i think that is being lost in the conversation, she said.
cooper: mr. trump, you have two minutes.
she was the first senator to call on sen. al franken to resign in 2017 after he was accused of sexual harassment by several women. a few big democratic donors, including billionaire george soros, have said that they will not support gillibrand because of her position on franken. she has also distanced herself from the clintons. in november 2017, she said that president bill clinton should have resigned after his affair with white house intern monica lewinsky became public. what trump says president trump tweeted at gillibrand in december 2017 after she called on the president to resign due to sexual misconduct allegations against him. lightweight senator kirsten gillibrand, a total flunky for chuck schumer and someone who would come to my office begging for campaign contributions not so long ago (and would do anything for them), is now in the ring fighting against trump. very disloyal to bill & crooked-used! mr. trump tweeted. critics interpreted the words begging and used in the tweet as having a sexual connotation. you cannot silence me or the millions of women who have gotten off the sidelines to speak out about the unfitness and shame you have brought to the oval office, gillibrand wrote on twitter in response.
failure to repeal and replace obamacare as he repeatedly vowed to do was one of former president donald trump's most bitter disappointments. his administration continued trying to find ways to limit the program or unravel it entirely. a supreme court decision on trump's final legal challenge to the affordable care act is expected this year.
and, you know, there's always a reason for everything. if they don't do that, it's a very difficult situation for our country, because you look at orlando and you look at san bernardino and you look at the world trade center. go outside. look at paris. look at that horrible — these are radical islamic terrorists.
to hear them tell it, lamb basically ran as a conservative. and his opponent, rick saccone, was just a lousy candidate. plus, it will be hard for democrats to replicate lamb's success, if only because the progressive grassroots typically rejects moderates of his stripe.
cooper: have you ever done those things?
nancy pelosi: well, then go do it. go do it.
11:36 a.m. et sen. al franken of minnesota pressed price further on his questionable stock buys, including some tobacco company stocks he held years ago.
margaret brennan: have you asked your democratic colleagues
in his exit memo from the agency, castro said that hud had stabilized the housing market and preserved affordable housing through public-private partnerships. under the obama administration, he wrote, hud invested $18 billion in communities recovering from natural disasters and initiated a $1 billion competition for resilient housing and infrastructure projects. views on lgbt issues and abortion rights he supports lgbt rights and was the first san antonio mayor to serve as the grand marshal of the city's pride parade in 2009 and joined mayors across the country in signing the mayors for the freedom to marry petition for same-sex marriage equality in 2012. castro is also a supporter of the rights of women to have an abortion. he spoke at the annual luncheon for planned parenthood south texas in may. controversy in 2016, the office of the special counsel, an independent federal investigative body, found that castro had violated the hatch act by commenting on the 2016 presidential campaign during an interview about local issues. castro apologized and ordered his team improve training on the hatch act in his department. what trump says castro has not yet been a target for president trump. unlike some of the other potential presidential candidates, mr. trump has never personally disparaged castro on twitter. issues in his video announcing his exploratory committee in december, castro said he is focused on affordable college, care for seniors, universal health care and welcoming immigrants.
president trump applauded the decision on twitter friday night, writing that he had predicted all along that the affordable care act is unconstitutional. now congress must pass a strong law that provides great healthcare and protects pre-existing conditions. mitch and nancy, get it done! mr. trump wrote.
but hargan also seemed to quibble, saying the work of an audit is to review compliance with procedures, not make legal conclusions. as a matter of law, none of the travel at issue was unauthorized.
jamelle bouie: so you-- you can't take them, i think it will be a big limiting factor on the field going forward because there is only so much grassroots support available total for everyone to take in.
senator chris van hollen: look, you know, the-- the president is energizing a lot of democratic voters to get out because he's been so polarizing and so divisive. i would say in a lot of our red states, what we have are senators who are standing up first and foremost for the people of their states and people even in red states want someone who will hold the president accountable.
margaret brennan: mister mayor, thank you for your time this morning.
gorsuch has spent much of his time since his nomination meeting the senators who will be voting on his confirmation -- he's met 72. twenty senators sit on the judiciary committee, and will be questioning him.
he also said he was in touch with donald trump, the presumptive gop nominee, on thursday night about the issue, which patrick said will both help elect trump and drive children out of public schools.
the president's top contenders had been amy coney barrett, brett kavanaugh and raymond kethledge -- each has distinct records which mr. trump can refer to in weighing his decision. barrett has the least experience on the bench and has emphasized social issues; kavanaugh has extensive experience working in d.c. courts and its political scene; and kethledge has built his conservative judicial credentials in federal court in michigan, removed from washington's politics.

correction: this transcript has been updated to accurately reflect one of william barr's responses regarding whether michael flynn lied to investigators. barr in two instances referred to a close question, not a closed question.
paula reid (cbs news correspondent/@paulareidcbs): well, you really hit it-- hit-- hit it. you said, well, did he need to be told not to lie? and that's the common theme that we see emerging. throughout all of these investigations of the president, his attorneys and their associates having trouble with the truth--being caught lying, having to plead guilty to lying, that has been a consistent theme. and i think you asked the perfect question was did the white house need to tell him not to lie? he could have done that of his own volition.
keeping the senate in session for part of august — even on this week's modest wednesday-thursday schedule — disrupts campaign plans for democratic senators in the most competitive re-election battles in trump-won states. it could also help protect the few endangered senate republicans.
lesley stahl: you know, first ladies usually have a cause. and you've already said you're interested in speaking out against bullying on social media.
as to whether their numbers are accurate, i'm not an accountant from china, the president added.
throughout the pandemic, the usds has been aiding the white house coronavirus task force in providing crucial statistics to top officials setting policy.

i'm winning with the smart people, trump said earlier this month. i'm winning with the not-so-smart people too. we're winning everything!
according to polls out of the empire state, trump has a hefty lead in the gop primary, while kasich slightly edges out cruz for second place. for instance, a recent fox news poll shows trump leading with 54 percent while kasich wins 22 percent and cruz earns 15 percent. new york voters will cast their ballots on april 19.
the warning came with the stark acknowledgement that he failed to deliver on one of the core tenets of his 2008 presidential campaign: to be a leader who can finally move beyond the divisive politics of washington.
trump renews attacks on obamacare president trump is starting a new effort to get rid of obamacare. in a closed-door lunch with republican senators, the president called for lower health care costs, according to lawmakers who participated. in a legal filing earlier this week, the trump justice department announced support for a full repeal of obamacare. but the white house has offered no details on a new health care law. paula reid reports.
paul ryan: -under way until the senate democrats chose to shutdown the government.

to state the obvious, most low- and middle-income families can't afford to buy health insurance without a huge subsidy from their employer.
john dickerson: we'll have more from tonight's 60 minutes interview. we'll ask a key senator on the senate foreign relations committee, florida republican marco rubio, what's next for the u.s. relationship with saudi arabia? he'll also give us an update on florida's recovery from hurricane michael. then in a week of back to back to back presidential rallies, we'll check in on november's midterm elections with chairman of the democratic senatorial campaign committee, chris van hollen. and we'll take a look at who's ahead in the battle for control of the house with our cbs news battleground tracker. plus, we'll talk to nebraska republican senator ben sasse about his new book.
the texas 7th has been controlled by the gop since a young george h.w. bush won his first race there in 1966. at 62, john culberson, the 18-year incumbent who serves on the powerful house appropriations committee, has never faced a challenge this difficult: a 43-year-old well-financed houston attorney named lizzie fletcher.
added sen. lamar alexander, r-tenn., there's no way congress is going to repeal protections for people with pre-existing conditions who want to buy health insurance. the justice department argument in the texas case is as far-fetched as any i've ever heard.
children's health insurance, funding for our troops, keeping the government going. they shut it down over an unrelated immigration issue with a deadline weeks away. and what's- what's so baffling about this was we were negotiating in good faith on daca all the same.
with the 2020 election just 11 days away, cbs news social media producer li cohen has compiled a comprehensive look at where the presidential candidates stand on some of the major issues facing the nation. their stances and plans were compiled based on information available on mr. trump's and biden's respective campaign sites, as well as official documents and prior cbs news reporting. click here to learn where the candidates stand.
senator ben sasse: it's one of my callings. i am also a dad and a neighbor and a husker football addict, so.
jason kelly: that's exactly the idea.
suburban women in states like ohio and wisconsin could again prove pivotal in this election, especially white women without college degrees. so, neither president trump nor former vice president joe biden are taking them for granted. both campaigns have launched an all-out assault of political advertising.
john dickerson: here's what they say. and you have two republicans in the senate who voted against this funding measure for roughly similar reasons which is the president's been a moving target. mitch mcconnell, the leader of the republicans in the senate, said, we're spinning our wheels until we know where the president is. so the democrats felt like, or this is their case anyway, they felt like, he's a moving target. let's use this moment of leverage, as-- as republicans did with obamacare in 2013.
even the most tax-savvy owners may find that do-it-yourself doesn't work when it comes to fulfilling the law's requirements. many don't know about the intricacies of the new health care regulations associated with the law that affect employers, said lydia glatz, an accountant with the firm mbaf in fort lauderdale, florida.
mccain's senate speech: we're getting nothing done my friends. we're getting nothing done because we keep trying to find a way to win without help from across the aisle.
his political career began in 2001. he won the mayor's office three times as a republican, then once as an independent. his strategy was the one he is using right now: he massively outspent his opponents in self-funded campaigns. in 12 years, bloomberg helped rebuild ground zero, helped the city survive the great recession. he banned smoking in restaurants, improved schools and balanced the budget. but there was controversy. bloomberg expanded a police tactic called stop and frisk. more than 80% of those stopped were minorities. less than 1% were carrying guns.
texas democrats aim to flip the state blue across the ballot, especially the state house in 2020. they are currently within nine seats of the majority and are looking to bring that down to eight in january's special election for house district 28.
in nevada, senator dean heller will likely be in the political fight of his life against democratic candidate jacky rosen this fall. he is the only incumbent republican senator running in a state that hillary clinton won in 2016. heller's relationship with mr. trump has been rocky to say the least. in 2016, he was a vocal opponent of then-candidate trump.
donald trump is different. i said starting back in june that he was not fit to be president and commander-in-chief. and many republicans and independents have said the same thing. what we all saw and heard on friday was donald talking about women, what he thinks about women, what he does to women. and he has said that the video doesn't represent who he is.
most people understand that too much monopoly power is a problem, that financial markets need some degree of regulation to prevent fraud and to insulate against financial crashes. and it's widely agreed that companies need to be prevented from creating pollution that can impose costs on society. similarly, the need to regulate natural monopolies such as the utilities that deliver water and electricity is broadly accepted.

look at what she did in libya with gadhafi. gadhafi's out. it's a mess. and, by the way, isis has a good chunk of their oil. i'm sure you probably have heard that. it was a disaster. because the fact is, almost everything she's done in foreign policy has been a mistake and it's been a disaster.
while jason kelly is optimistic about the future supply of vaccine, dr. travis gayles on the frontline in montgomery county, maryland is less upbeat. he told us those most likely to get covid-19, the county's black, brown and poor residents, are least likely to get inoculated. and he says that inequity can't be explained away solely by community hesitance to the vaccine.

pete shelley jake barlow/cbs news one of the u.k.'s most influential songwriters, pete shelley (april 17, 1955-december 6, 2018) was co-founder of the punk rock band buzzcocks, best known for songs dripping with irony and humor and played with manic speed, including ever fallen in love (with someone you shouldn't've) and what do i get? the band debuted in manchester in 1976, opening for the sex pistols. when howard devoto left in 1977, shelley took over as lead singer. the group would break up in 1981, thanks in part to exhaustion (they'd put out three albums in a year-and-a-half), but shelley and steve diggle, two of the group's original members, reunited eight years later, and released the albums trade test transmissions and the way, and the 2006 single wish i never loved you. play excerpt: ever fallen in love (with someone you shouldn't've) play excerpt: what do i get? shelley also produced solo records, including sky yen, the electronic homosapien, xl1, and heaven and the sea. play excerpt: homosapien in 2010 shelley told the a.v. club that the secret for rock bands to stick together in their 50s, or older, compared to younger musicians was, you don't panic. i suppose it's like being a stock-market investor. when you start off, the market goes up and then they're happy; when the market goes down, then they panic. so it's a bit like that with … a band. when you start out and you have initial success you think, 'oh, this is great.
mr. trump will focus on opportunities lifting up all americans, and review his accomplishments in the first year, the official told reporters. specifically, trump's state of the union address will focus on five major policy areas:
stephen miller, white house senior adviser
the city saw a declining population due to the loss of factory jobs, but it has increased since buttigieg took office. he has focused on improving higher education and health care in the city. in the video announcing his exploratory committee, buttigieg emphasizes the need for a fresh start in american politics. he also discusses the issues important to him as a member of the millennial generation, saying: we're the generation that lived through school shootings, that served in the wars after 9/11, and we're the generation that stands to be the first to make less than our parents. unless we do something different. controversy buttigieg has very little controversy around him, other than his age and sexual orientation, which some consider to be automatic strikes against him. in his first term as mayor, he dealt with a scandal at the local police department, which led him to demote the first african american chief of police of south bend. what trump says president trump has not tweeted about or insulted buttigieg as of now.
now, she talks tough, she talks really tough against putin and against assad. she talks in favor of the rebels. she doesn't even know who the rebels are. you know, every time we take rebels, whether it's in iraq or anywhere else, we're arming people. and you know what happens? they end up being worse than the people.
& tell all yr secrets bout yrself to yr face. for colored girls who have considered suicide/when the rainbow is enuf, which debuted in 1976, was only the second play by an african-american woman to open on broadway (after a raisin in the sun). written by ntozake shange (october 18, 1948-october 27, 2018), for colored girls is a musical choreopoem performed by african-american women, each identified only by the color that she wears. the play describes the traumas of racism, sexism, violence and rape. the show (in which shange also appeared) won her an obie award, and when it transferred to broadway was nominated for a tony for best play, [it won for best featured actress, trazana beverley.] an extremely influential work, it was made into a 2010 film featuring thandie newton, tessa thomspon, whoopi goldberg, kerry washington and janet jackson. shange won her second obie in 1981 for an adaptation of brecht's mother courage and her children, and she penned several other plays, essays, poetry collections, novels and children's books. in 2017, as she recovered from health problems, including two strokes, shange told the website shondaland that while she could not dance anymore, which she found inhibiting, she nonetheless could still cut loose: i found that i can dance with my upper body, so i do that a lot. i have all my taxi drivers turn on the latin stations, so i can dance in the backseat.
speaker nancy pelosi: that's right. he has.
biden: i've been saying this for over three years. the president denies they're involved. they've been involved. i was deeply involved in the intelligence apparatus and how it functioned before we left the vice presidency. it was clear they were involved. the president continues to deny their involvement. it's overwhelming. and the fact is that everybody knows. except when the president stands before the whole world, looks at vladimir putin, says, why would he want to interfere in our elections? well, 17 intelligence agencies told me- told him he did. so this is all- this is bizarre. this is bizarre. this is continuing. and what's happened? why in god's name haven't we hardened the electoral process- provided billions, hundreds of millions of dollars to states to be able to harden their voter rolls, make sure they can't be attacked by cyber security as a consequence of cyber attacks. why haven't we provided the capacity for them to be able to have the money to have paper ballots in addition to that? i mean, this is- this is outrageous and it's going on. look, i joined with the leaders of europe when the european elections took place back before i got involved. i'd be- before i- before i decided to run. and we set up an organization that in fact said every european leader running in either party, in any party, would take a pledge--
while mr. trump said in a tweet monday that he would like to keep the convention in north carolina — and has zero interest in moving the convention to doral, florida, the home of mar-a-lago, in particular — florida governor ron desantis said during a press conference tuesday that he welcomes the idea of hosting the convention in the sunshine state. florida would love to have the rnc. heck, i'm a republican, it'd be good for us to have the dnc in terms of the economic impact when you talk about major events like that, said desantis during a press conference in miami earlier. desantis went on to name miami, orlando, tampa and jacksonville as some of the cities with the capacity to host the gathering. i have not spoken with the president specifically on that but i have, we've let the folks at the white house know that we want to work with them…so he knows that and i know the key people in his administration and in his campaign know that.
the health care law offers subsidized private insurance to people who don't have access to job-based coverage, provided that they are citizens or legal immigrants, and fall within a certain income range. the gao report raised numerous questions about the government's system for verifying eligibility for those benefits.
raddatz: no, we can — no, mr. trump, we're going to go on. this is about the audience.
for the second time, mr. trump has taken his legal brawl with manhattan district attorney cyrus vance over a subpoena to his longtime accountant for years of his business records, including his tax returns, to the supreme court.
republicans in congress have tried repeatedly to overturn the affordable care act, most recently attempting and failing in february to override president obama's veto of legislation which would have gutted much of the law.
we have been working on coronavirus relief. unfortunately, the speaker has not been able to agree to anything remotely reasonable, senate majority leader mitch mcconnell said in an interview with fox news on monday.
the president has been talking about health care a plan for more than a year and said in july he would be signing one within two weeks. so far, the plan has not materialized. on wednesday, mr. trump's chief of staff mark meadows said the plan is indeed ready, but it's unclear exactly when it will roll out. according to meadows, it's more of an executive action with a legislative component.
scott pelley: --in your administration, and who's gonna get a tax cut
clinton's campaign did not deny sending the photos and responded by calling the issue nothing more than an obvious and transparent attempt to distract from the serious issues confronting our country. however, clinton told msnbc at the time that so far as i know it didn't come from her campaign.

sen. sanders: and- and, margaret we have established the strongest protocols to prevent this from happening of any campaign in history.
trump: well, i consider her statement about my children to be a very nice compliment. i don't know if it was meant to be a compliment, but it is a great — i'm very proud of my children. and they've done a wonderful job, and they've been wonderful, wonderful kids. so i consider that a compliment.
it would be a mistake for any democrats to make their final pitch to voters exclusively about trump. even in this hyper-national landscape, democrats can't forget that local elections require a local frame – and voters need to believe a candidate understands their needs and has a vision for making their lives better. voters are still worried about how they're going to pay the bills, what kind of education their children will have, and whether they can afford to visit the doctor.
the democrats who won tuesday night take office in january.
additionally, boehner told reporters thursday, i am highly skeptical that they can do this administratively.
the house democrat campaign arm began their second rollout of television ads specifically geared towards the asian american and pacific islander community. the committee announced in august they had made a buy on vietface tv, a vietnamese cable network based in los angeles. the ads began running in california's 48th district in orange county, in english and vietnamese.
an executive in a pe-held entity like cke usually must give the owning firm first right of refusal to purchase the person's stake, said timothy gregg, a partner with bradley arant boult cummings, a birmingham, alabama-based law firm, who advises privately and publicly held companies. but perhaps roark does not have enough cash on hand to buy all of puzder's stake. then puzder could approach outside investors. but roark must approve them – it surely doesn't want a swashbuckler like activist investor carl icahn charging through the door.
mayor francis suarez: i don't yet. i haven't gotten any indication from the-- the state health department that we have any of those strains. it's very possible that we do. what we do know and what we've been told is that the vaccines that we're administering for both moderna and pfizer are effective against the u.k. strain, which, of course, we all know is significantly more contagious than-- than, you know, the sort of previous version of-- of covid-19. so, we're continuing to vaccinate both in the city of miami at marlins park at about seven thousand a week.
7:30 p.m. et. the rnc releases the official program for the 2016 republican national convention, which is being billed as the make america great again convention. each day will have a different theme -- monday is make america safe again, tuesday will be make america work again, republicans will aim to make america first again on wednesday, and on thursday, the final night of the convention, trump's theme will be make america one again.
stephen miller: i believe that's the likeliest outcome because obamacare has always been unconstitutional and the mandate--
president donald trump: it was a big ruling. it's a great ruling for our country.
democrats want moderate and swing voters to know that, if they do happen to win control of the house of representatives, nobody is talking about impeaching president trump….except everybody.
stephen miller: you also have to think about the twenty-eight million americans who still don't have health insurance because obamacare didn't work. fortunately, because of the dramatic action this administration has taken, we've increased choice, we've increased competition. and, for the first time in a long time, premiums on the exchanges are going down, not up.
how will red-state senate democrats navigate the trump era?
donnelly's outspoken criticism of the president's trade policy has been a focus of his senate re-election bid. in an interview with fox news last week, braun said that tariffs are tricky, but defended the president's actions, justifying them as a remedy for the trade imbalance.
despite his involvement in the starr investigation, kavanaugh has written that congress should pass a law protecting a sitting president from being subjected to civil suit. in that same paper, kavanaugh argued that the indictment and trial of a sitting president…would cripple the federal government, rendering it unable to function with credibility in either the international or domestic arena and that even the lesser burdens of a criminal investigation…are time consuming and distracting.
as washington prepares for mr. trump's first state of the union speech tuesday, the president marks a first year in office characterized by attacks not just on democrats, but slights of lawmakers in his own party. over the last year, mr. trump has attacked not just schumer, house minority leader nancy pelosi and democrats in general on twitter, but also republicans like senate majority leader mitch mcconnell, r-kentucky, sen. jeff flake, r-arizona, and sen. bob corker, r-tennessee.
our families will thrive. our people will prosper. and our nation will forever be safe and strong and proud and mighty and free.
ryan, a budget geek with a passion for details who announced wednesday that he would retire next year, proved adroit in drawing up budget plans that balanced on paper but didn't get beyond the hypothetical. under his leadership, republicans never tried to implement the deep cuts his budget called for, particularly his vision of turning medicare into a voucher-like program for future retirees. instead, the house passed steep tax cuts while increasing spending, setting the government on a path to rising deficits.
other iowans came to the fair with their favorite presidential hopeful in mind. former vice president joe biden led the class with 23 democrats saying they would like to see him take on president donald trump next year.
there's evidence that the obamacare marketplaces -- designed to help people on the individual market gain access to a range of private plans -- are working. a recent gallup survey found that the uninsured rate has fallen 1.2 points since last year, meaning that about 2.5 million more adult americans have insurance now that the marketplaces are open. some of those newly-insured may be covered by the expanded version of medicaid (also as a result of obamacare) if not the new marketplace.
house speaker nancy pelosi, who previously slammed the administration's efforts to repeal the aca as an all-out war against the health care of americans, said on tuesday that the president's blueprint for health care is like [richard] nixon's secret plan for the vietnam war.
margaret brennan: and don't expect a wholesale plan until after 2020?
charleston, s.c. -- vermont senator bernie sanders is releasing a sweeping proposal to create a new single-payer health care system in the united states, just hours ahead of the final democratic presidential debate and before the lead off iowa caucuses.
margaret brennan: what does do well mean for you?
if the courts rule in favor of the argument, all protections under the aca, including the most popular protection for people with preexisting conditions, would no longer exist. back in june, the trump administration decided not to defend the aca against this lawsuit, and it agreed in part that protections for people with preexisting conditions should be overturned.

in 2014, michael grimm resigned from his 11th congressional new york district seat after pleading guilty to tax fraud. now, after serving seven months in prison, he is calling it a witch hunt and says he wants his job back. incumbent republican rep. dan donovan has been representing this southern brooklyn and staten island district ever since, and now the two are trying to out-trump each other, hoping to align themselves with trump's policies and agenda to win over conservative voters. although trump tweeted his endorsement of donovan in may, the nyt notes that it is mr. grimm who reminds voters of mr. trump — in terms of his brash, anti-establishment, take-no-prisoners style.

trump would again spare social security retirement benefits and medicare as he promised during the 2016 campaign. and while his plan would reprise last year's attempt to scuttle the obamacare health law and sharply cut back the medicaid program for the elderly, poor and disabled, trump's allies on capitol hill have signaled there's no interest in tackling hot-button health issues during an election year.

jonah goldberg: yeah. there's also just a label problem, you know. i think it was quinnipiac had a poll recently that showed that support among democrats for single-payer health care is going down, but support for medicare for all is going up. they think the medicare for all is like not socialism, you know, it sounds like a more moderate, you know, kind of approach. and if you look at the gallup polling on socialism over the last ten years, you find that basically support for socialism is basically a referendum on the state of capitalism.

senator ben sasse: yeah, that's just not true right. so, so much of what we fight about in washington is right versus left and a lot more of our policy should be past versus future. there aren't going to be lifelong jobs anymore and we shouldn't be lying to the american people about it. we should be thinking about what does it look like to help people get back to work, back to meaningful employment, back to shared labor with their neighbors when they are thirty-five and forty and forty-five. we can't say, i, politician, am going to protect your jobs forever. because it's not true.
i congratulate donald trump on winning the nomination last night. conventions are times of excitement. but given the events of the last few weeks, i hope you'll allow me a moment to talk to you about what's really at stake, said cruz, who was one of the last republicans to drop out of the gop primary race.
those remarks followed the justice department's filing last week of a brief supporting the complete invalidation of the aca. the move was a departure from its previous stance that the individual mandate, requiring most americans to carry health insurance, should be stricken down, but the rest of the law, including the protections for pre-existing conditions, should remain in place.
the chances of former sheriff joe arpaio, who was convicted of contempt and then pardoned by mr. trump last year, getting elected to the u.s. senate are exceptionally low. but he's running in the gop primary to replace retiring republican sen. jeff flake anyway. the winner of that primary is almost certain to face democratic rep. kristen sinema in the general election, and her party is bullish on flipping this sun belt seat in what was until recently deep red territory.
margaret brennan: so you- are you--
kerri evelyn harris, movement director for the group, tells cbs news campaign reporter lacrai mitchell that the team strategically chose south carolina to focus on voters of color in large part because it's one of the states that will choose the democratic nominee. when asked, harris added that although former vice president joe biden has remained popular in the state throughout this primary cycle—and is not a proponent of medicare for all—she thinks this message will still resonate with south carolina voters.
president donald trump: but the media is fake. and frankly, if i didn't have social media, i'd have no way of getting out my voice.
people first are trying to apply for unemployment, and many of them [are] getting stuck there, he added. health care is the secondary thing, and if they get stuck in unemployment, people may never do the health care thing.
collectively, congress is always fearful of taking on tough issues, and there's no budget issue tougher than medicare and social security, said former sen. john sununu, r-n.h., who co-sponsored ryan's 2005 social security bill. it's been true for three decades or more.
what astonished me, then and now, cruz told the times, was heidi within 60 seconds said, 'absolutely,' with no hesitation.
republicans have a 51-to-49 majority in the senate, meaning democrats have to flip a net total of two seats to win back the chamber. but the republicans are only defending eight senate seats, and only two of them currently look competitive. democrats, meanwhile, are defending 25 seats, including a number in states mr. trump won in 2016.
margaret brennan: now, vaccine tourism is also drawing people to miami. i know you've tried to stop some of this and your governor has said to prioritize residents, but there was a mexican tv star posting on social media last week that he flew into miami, got a shot, and then flew back to mexico. rules are still being broken here. how are you going to discourage that from happening?

john dickerson: okay. so, what just to remind people you're not saying that it is chiseled in stone that democrats will take-- will take the house. you're saying right now as trends go forward it looks like the democrats have a shot, give me-- run me through those two scenarios and how they play out.

v.s. naipaul ap photo/john mcconnico novelist and essayist v.s. naipaul (august 17, 1932-august 11, 2018), the first writer of indian origin to win the booker prize, traveled as a self-described barefoot colonial from his rural childhood in trinidad to an oxford education in england, and would be hailed as one of the greatest writers of the 20th century. naipaul's books (including the enigma of arrival, finding the centre and the enigma of arrival) explored colonialism and decolonization, exile and the struggles of the everyman in the developing world. he was critical of colonialism (he would repeatedly reject his birthplace as little more than a plantation), but saw himself as a realist, cured of illusions. his outlook was characterized by the famous opening words of a bend in the river: the world is what it is. after working as a writer for the bbc, he earned plaudits for a string of novels, and traveled extensively to pen journalistic essays and books on culture, politics and religion. he was awarded the nobel prize for literature in 2001 for having united perceptive narrative and incorruptible scrutiny in works that compel us to see the presence of suppressed histories. if you come from the new world, as i in large measure do, you see all the absurd fantasies people have taken there and the troubles they have wrought as a result, naipaul told the associated press in 2000. we were not given a proper history of the new world itself. this was not out of wickedness.
president trump says he now understands the complexity of health care, after his party has repeatedly failed to repeal and replace the affordable care act (aca). now, mr. trump claims, the republican party is going to be the party of great health care.

tedros ghebreyesus (director-general of the world health organization): we will not end the pandemic anywhere until we end it everywhere.
we seem to be migrating to, on the one camp, sort of nostalgia - let's just get rid, if you will, of the incumbent president and we can go back to doing what we used to do, he said. or, you know, it's our way, our big idea, or no way. and neither of those, it seems to me, seizes the moment to pull the nation together.

margaret brennan: all right. anthony salvanto, thank you very much.
the president is still trying to keep another big promise -- repealing obamacare. he's tried new policies, courting democrats and threatening republicans. but no combination of presidential flexibility has produced the desired result.
emanuel also had suggestions for what patients should ask their doctors: the first one is, do they do open access scheduling? which means, they start the day with half of their appointment slots empty for people who walk in or happen to get sick or happen to find that they have the time and they need that checkup done. open access scheduling is very important; it's so the doctor doesn't say, 'i'll see you in six weeks,' or double-book you, and everyone is waiting and being annoyed.

margaret brennan: so, you-- why couldn't you move them to the front of 1b ahead of other essential workers with the supply you have now?

joe biden: what i meant was there is a thousand places we can go to deal with injustice. i can think of ten countries where women and or children and/or people are being-- are being persecuted or being hurt. but the idea of us going to be able to use our armed forces to solve every single internal problem that exists throughout the world is not within our capacity. the question is is america's vital self-interest at stake or the vital self-interest of one of our allies at stake? and the fact that they have a system in afghanistan, as they do in parts of pakistan, as they do in parts of other countries, that we're going to send troops to-- because there is not a-- a-- human rights are not being valued to the same degree that we are, that's a different story about sending combat troops. we should call it out. we should go to the united nations. we should be saying this is what's happening. we should try to shame and get the world to put pressure on, an economic pressure, on people who engage-- countries who engage in that but not send troops. that's what i meant. it is not sufficient. that was my point. and the idea was and i think richard had said something like, well, women are being abused there. i said they are being abused in a lot of places around the world.

many americans are still feeling the squeeze of an economy too weak to raise income levels. we're feeling a crushing national debt, a health care plan that has made insurance less affordable and doctors less available, and chaotic unrest in many of our cities, she said. even worse, we are facing the most dangerous terrorist threat our nation has seen since september 11th, and this president appears either unwilling or unable to deal with it.

well, as many people point out, you know, it's not unusual. in the course of a bona fide investigation, when you're doing a criminal investigation or a counterintelligence investigation, that has a basis it's not unusual to have an interview with someone and expecting that they might lie. but here's what's different here is that there was no underlying investigation that was legitimate. and the whole exercise was just about creating the lie.

there's an easy case to make for the argument that trump makes it harder for democrats to cross the aisle and support him. attacking dicky durbin and cryin' chuck schumer is hardly a smart strategy for getting the two highest-ranking senate democrats to cooperate. however, as the voteview website notes, donald trump will be the third consecutive president who is widely disliked by members of the opposite party.
senator bernie sanders: and-- and, margaret, we have established the strongest protocols to prevent this from happening of any campaign in history.

is mccaskill too liberal for missouri?
sen. klobuchar: as part of comprehensive immigration reform, we must move forward on making sure that people have health care. california just did that with medicaid, and i am supportive of that but i think on the national basis, as we go forward, get immediate health care for people, yes. but as part of making this actually happen, you need comprehensive immigration reform. and one thing that was missing from the nbc debate, actually, that i hope we can discuss, is that we have a humanitarian crisis at the border right now. but we also did not talk about the other immigrants that are here. the people who are here on temporary legal status, we've got hundreds of thousands of people that are legally here that are at risk or are being deported that work in our nursing homes and our hospitals. we have got dreamers, two million of them, that came to this country through no fault of their own and are a major part of our economy. so, we need to have an economic discussion about this, as well as a border discussion--
earlier in the day, the president also responded to comments made by house speaker nancy pelosi after he said he was taking the drug. i don't respond to her. i think she's a waste of time, mr. trump told reporters. he later called the california lawmaker a sick woman who has a lot of mental problems. pelosi said monday night mr. trump should not be taking hydroxychloroquine due to his age and weight. as far as the president is concerned, he's our president and i would rather he not be taking something that has not been approved by the scientists, especially in his age group and in his, shall we say, weight group, morbidly obese, they say, pelosi said during an interview with cnn on monday night. so i think it's not a good idea.
one of staub's employees, corey adams, is also with us tonight. corey is an all-american worker. he supported himself through high school, lost his job during the 2008 recession, and was later hired by staub, where he trained to become a welder. like many hardworking americans, corey plans to invest his tax‑cut raise into his new home and his two daughters' education. corey, please stand. and he's a great welder. i was told that by the man that owns that company that's doing so well. so congratulations, corey.
we proved that we could accomplish something this big, he said. i can't thank the president enough. president trump and vice president pence have been directly engaged, adding that pence called him twice on thursday to check in about individual members.

braver asked haley, should the president shut it down?
mccain said that when she was working on the eulogy before her father's death, she did not know jared kushner and ivanka trump would be attending the funeral. a funeral is obviously a sacred time, and i thought that my family had made it clear, or at least i had, that the trumps were unwelcome around me, she said.
while the ballots directed voters to fill in the bubbles with a black pen, the supplemental instructions said they could also use blue. soltysiak said this will not be an issue because scanners read both colors of ink accurately, and if there was ever an issue with the type of pen used by a voter, the scanner would recognize the issue and the ballot would instead be counted by hand at tabulation. the blunder comes as pennsylvania election boards cope with issuing well over 10 times the number of mail-in and absentee ballots they've sent in past years. late last year, the state legislature passed a bill to allow no-excuse mail-in voting across the state. as the spread of covid-19 shut down the state and the legislature moved the primary back a month, pennsylvanians applied in droves to vote by mail. they can apply to vote by mail until may 26, a week before the election.
eric trump: so we'll-- we'll-- we'll be in new york and we'll take care of the business. i think we're going to have a lot of fun doing it. and we're going to make him very proud.
as the 2020 campaign season heads into the summer, the biden campaign will likely seize on the opportunity to put former president obama on the stump after he formally endorsed his former vice president in april. a former president throwing his support behind his past vice president is nothing new — president andrew jackson's vice president, martin van buren, in 1836 received his predecessor's endorsement. but as mr. obama goes to bat for biden, the idea that a former president plans to actively campaign for his former vice president is not always a given. and in some cases, candidates have even shied away from a predecessor's help.

margaret brennan: so on that cdc plan, i know this report this week got a lot of attention really urging schools to reopen and-- and saying that transmission can be stopped if masks are worn and there's social distancing. but the same report said there should still be restrictions in the community and it cited indoor dining. chicago has already opened its bars and restaurants. how do you feel about that?
her faith came under discussion during last year's nomination hearing process when sen. dianne feinstein, d-california, said you have a long history of believing that your religious beliefs should prevail, and, the dogma lives loudly within you.

margaret brennan: you said there, north korea would denuc- denuclearize or at least need to reduce their arsenal. would you accept them as a nuclear power?
so don't tell me about words. i am absolutely — i apologize for those words. but it is things that people say. but what president clinton did, he was impeached, he lost his license to practice law. he had to pay an $850,000 fine to one of the women. paula jones, who's also here tonight.
mcgahn: and she just got nominated for the supreme court.

he said his father will give americans a tax code that will free the u.s. economy and end loopholes for the wealthy, deliver an obamacare repeal and replacement and an immigration law that protects americans and gives them jobs.
jamelle bouie: i think the first step democrats have to do is do what senator sanders said when he was told or was asked to comment publicly about this to disavow the interference to say that if he's elected president he will reject anything like this and try to stop any kind of election interference into the country. and then as far as the entire democratic party goes, i-- i think there needs to be sort of-- two things going on, first, yes, an awareness that online and other forums there may be russian hackers trolls trying to stirrup things, but it's probably not wise to immediately leaned on that as their explanation, for the specific reason that it does undermine people's faith and what's happening. on-- on the question of online division, maybe that does require all candidates, right, to say anyone in our camp doing these things needs to cut it out, which is what the candidates have been saying. but i would recommend it specifically for this problem of maintaining faith in the process to not immediately jump to (indistinct) russian bots, it's russian hackers because that i think does so mistrust and a little bit of fear.
gillum, who is seeking to become the state's first black governor, brought up desantis' comments the day after the primary -- when he said that florida voters shouldn't monkey this up by supporting gillum. and gillum added that desantis had been endorsed by president donald trump.
larose previously indicated his support to extend the vote by mail primary to june 2 in a letter on march 21 sent to ohio's general assembly, but ohio's state legislature voted to extend the primary date to april 28. voting rights groups said that ohio's board of elections was not fully prepared for the transition to a vote-by-mail primary due to the lack of time it was given. voting rights groups said the timeline did not provide voters enough time to learn about the vote-by-mail process and did not give adequate time for ohio's board of elections to print more envelopes, ballots and applications. the boards of elections and the secretary of state have been scrambling to make this work, said catherine turcer, the executive director of common cause ohio, a nonpartisan advocacy group on protecting voting rights. clearly more time would have made this work better for voters and certainly for the people administering our elections.

john dickerson: and is he going to stay in one place?
senator john barrasso: i would certainly hope not. i'm working to the fact of keeping the government open. i think that's what the american people expect of the people that they elect; keep the government open. and if there's any sort of a shutdown, it would certainly only be a partial shutdown. remember, margaret, we, through the appropriations process, already have approved seventy-five percent of the funding for the government for the next year. but i still think it's better to not have any sort of, even a partial shutdown whether it's over christmas or anytime. i don't think people benefit by that.
we have to repeal it and replace it with something absolutely much less expensive and something that works, where your plan can actually be tailored. we have to get rid of the lines around the state, artificial lines, where we stop insurance companies from coming in and competing, because they want — and president obama and whoever was working on it — they want to leave those lines, because that gives the insurance companies essentially monopolies. we want competition.
the three sets of hurdles confronting puzder present him with different challenges:
you know, it's amazing. i'm watching hillary go over facts. and she's going after fact after fact, and she's lying again, because she said she — you know, what she did with the e-mail was fine. you think it was fine to delete 33,000 e-mails? i don't think so.
margaret brennan: which is what senator scott was also saying, even though the president says he's-- he and senator barrasso and others are going to have to come up with a solution.
what separates republicans from democrats is our belief in better, he said. we believe in better schools. a better healthcare system. a better economy which rewards hard work no matter where or when you punch the clock. and most of all, we believe in a better chance at the american dream for everyone. the republican party will not stop until it becomes a reality. and that's why we need to stop hillary clinton.

future first lady melania trump cbs news
if handel loses, the chatter about a negative trump effect will likely rise to a fever pitch. republican hand-wringing about how trump's controversies and negative ratings will affect them in future elections will be in full force. why? again, it's mainly because this is a republican district that has been held by republicans for decades -- even though trump barely squeaked by clinton with a mere 1.5 percent margin in november.

senate majority leader mitch mcconnell says if the government remains open on feb. 8, lawmakers will have a fair and open process as they handle immigration legislation on the senate floor.
donald trump: everything, everything down there-- there are no people-- there are all people that work -- that's the problem with the system, the system. right now, we're going to clean it up. we're having restrictions on foreign money coming in, we're going to put on term limits, which a lot of people aren't happy about, but we're putting on term limits. we're doing a lot of things to clean up the system. but everybody that works for government, they then leave government and they become a lobbyist, essentially. i mean, the whole place is one big lobbyist.
conservatives tend to have more faith in the ability of markets to self-correct when problems exist, and less faith in government's ability to step in and fix market failures without creating even more problems. honest differences on this point are likely, but there are certainly cases where most people would agree that some sort of action is needed to overcome significant market failures.
lanhee chen: your-- your point. i'm sorry.
however, when ideological or political goals (such as lower taxes for the wealthy or reduced regulation so that businesses can exploit market imperfections) lead to attacks on those who call for government to make markets work better -- often in the guise of getting government out of the way of the market system -- it undermines government's ability to promote the competitive market system the opponents claim to support.

wisconsin governor tony evers announced loosened restrictions on nonessential businesses in the state to allow for curbside drop-off of goods and animals. cbs news campaign reporter adam brewster says that would allow businesses such as dog groomers and small engine repair shops to reopen. those businesses need to ensure staffing can be limited to one person in a room or confined space at a time and services need to be paid for ahead of time online or over the phone. the order also allows people to rent recreational outdoor equipment such as boats, kayaks and canoes. the same staffing and payment restrictions are in place and rented equipment must be cleaned after each use. automatic and self-service car washes are also able to open. the new order takes effect on wednesday and builds upon an order last week that allowed nonessential businesses to offer curbside pick-up. this order means that every business across our state can do things like deliveries, mailings, curbside pick-up and drop-off, and it's an important step in making sure that while folks are staying safer at home, they can also continue to support small businesses across our state, evers said in a statement.

clinton: well, it's not only my opinion. it's the opinion of many others, national security experts, republicans, former republican members of congress. but it's in part because those of us who have had the great privilege of seeing this job up close and know how difficult it is, and it's not just because i watched my husband take a $300 billion deficit and turn it into a $200 billion surplus, and 23 million new jobs were created, and incomes went up for everybody. everybody. african-american incomes went up 33 percent.

lesley stahl: do any of you want to say anything about this fear that's out there?
this election is a broader referendum on republicans, who hold both houses of congress, the white house, and the overwhelming majority of governor's mansions nationwide. republicans campaigned in 2016 on repealing obamacare, but their efforts failed because they couldn't answer the question, then what? a jittery public worried about losing health care coverage ultimately doomed the repeal effort in the senate. yet senate majority leader mitch mcconnell is still thinking about trying again to repeal the affordable care act and cutting back on medicare and medicaid to help pay for the ballooning deficit caused by the trump tax cuts.

senator marco rubio: well, on the first point i think everyone's waiting to find out exactly what happened and, frankly, this is the kind of case where we may never know exactly what happened. it was a denial. but that said there is news reports out there that there is some sort of audio-video evidence of what occurred. if that were to emerge or any other facts were to emerge or, frankly, if questions here aren't answered. there's no video of him leaving that facility. there's going to be a big problem. i can just tell you that in congress right now there is no pro-saudi element that's going to stick with our relationship with saudi arabia as it's currently structured if, in fact, they lured this man into this consulate, killed him and then, you know, cut up his body and send a team to go into that country to kill him in the first place. that's just an unacceptable thing. we should never accept that from anyone in the world. it undermines our credibility and our moral authority around the planet to go after regimes like putin's or maduro in venezuela or others. as far as the options that are concerned, people talk a lot about the arms sales. our relationship with saudi arabia extends well beyond arms sales as well. and i would just say it's unfortunate because saudi arabia is an important part of our middle eastern strategy.
mr. trump's speech singled out foreign governments that extort unreasonably low prices from u.s. drugmakers using price controls and said u.s. trade representatives would prioritize the issue in trade deals. he accused the rest of the world of freeloading off u.s. drug companies, linking soaring prescription drug prices in the u.s. to lower prices abroad. when foreign governments extort unreasonably low prices from u.s. companies, the u.s. has to subsidize them, he said.
president donald trump: okay. are you ready--
in doing what i'm doing now, a lot of it is heart, a lot of it is compassion, a lot of it is far beyond money -- such as immigration, such as the things we're talking about. from a purely economic standpoint -- if i was doing this purely from an economic standpoint, i would sit down and tell you in one second what i'd be doing, okay? it's so simple.

margaret brennan: we spoke to the national security adviser to the president, who is denying that the white house was informed of the preference for trump. but- but you and i both know that in 2016, that was the intelligence community's clear--
trump: i was against — i was against the war in iraq. has not been debunked. and you voted for it. and you shouldn't have. well, i just want to say...
4:30 p.m. et with house speaker paul ryan and new jersey gov. chris christie slated to speak tonight, cbs news' jennifer de pinto digs through recent polling numbers to look at voters' views on each of them:
lesley stahl: you'd run and hide?
pennsylvania's voters had to sign up to vote by mail by tuesday in the state's june 2 primary. vote-by-mail was the first item displayed on the state republican party's website, where an image of mr. trump looms behind the link to the ballot request form. the headline reads, vote by mail. safe from home. the vote-by-mail page itself touts the mail-in option for all registered voters and includes a message explaining why it's safe. and even while the trump campaign has accused democrats of trying to steal the election, it has promoted the absentee voting option ahead of the keystone state's primary.
the 15-second ad, called family, is running on youtube. it is part of the campaign's six-figure advertising campaign on television and digital platforms in iowa.
and that is wyoming republican senator john barrasso, who's also a doctor, we should note. he was a key negotiator in the efforts to come up with a republican measure that would replace obamacare. i do want to get to that, but picking up on where stephen just left off, he says shutdown may still happen if necessary to get this money for the border wall. it's five billion.
cooper: so have you (inaudible) personal federal income tax?
and he reminded them of the president's call for a boycott of ohio-based goodyear tires. don't buy goodyear tires, the president tweeted earlier this year after he heard that the company banned apparel with political messages, including his campaign's make america great again hats.
tonight, i am calling on the congress to produce a bill that generates at least $1.5 trillion for the new infrastructure investment we need, he said. every federal dollar should be leveraged by partnering with state and local governments and, where appropriate, tapping into private sector investment -- to permanently fix the infrastructure deficit. any bill must also streamline the permitting and approval process -- getting it down to no more than two years, and perhaps even one.
i learned in 2012 running with mitt romney if you wait until after the convention to all of a sudden get your act together and then produce an agenda in say august or september, it's too late, the wisconsin republican said in an interview on cbs this morning.
since his election in 2012, bryant has opposed to the affordable care act and has sued the federal government twice over it. as lieutenant governor, reeves has shared this stance and dismissed it as an obamacare expansion.
trump: because you have nothing to say.
over and over, obama and hillary apologized for america and allowed jihadists to spread like wildfire. we need someone who can repair the damage he has done, take the fight to the enemy and put america first. that man is donald trump. i am proud to be a member of his national security team.
i've been in touch with his wife, jane, and just sent my well wishes for a quick recovery. i know that they're focused on taking care of him and making sure he's okay. and they know that i and so many of us are here for him, she told cbs news campaign reporter nicole sganga. she recalled the 2016 campaign trail today and her relationship with sanders to reporters.
jamelle bouie: i think where-- where the danger comes in is if-- if president trump is setting-- is setting himself up with sort of un-- unrestrained capitalism, that is actually unpopular, as well, right?
mcgahn: i disagree that it's being rushed. i think it actually- if you look at historical precedent, is following regular order. one goes back into history, one goes close to--
ohio flags will fly at half-staff for duration of republican convention
as part of our defense, we must modernize and rebuild our nuclear arsenal, hopefully never having to use it, but making it so strong and so powerful that it will deter any acts of aggression by any other nation or anyone else.

the four pillars of the plan:
sen. kamala harris unveiled a plan tuesday to lower prescription drug prices if she's elected president.
donald trump: i know, i did my final speech in michigan at 1:00 in the morning and we had 31,000 people, many people outside of the arena. and i felt-- when i left, i said, how are we gonna lose? we set it up a day before. and we had all of these people. and it was literally at 1:00 in the morning and i said, this doesn't look like second place. so we were really happy, i mean, it was-- these are great people.
john dickerson: how is it not about politics if you have been very critical of this president saying he is driving some of these divisions. if these divisions-- wouldn't it be very powerful if somebody in a public role like the president or senators, behaved and modeled the behavior you are talking about in this book that you should see at the church or at the little league ball field.
even so, any package passed during the so-called lame duck session — before the newly elected members of the senate and the house take their seats in january, along with mr. biden — is likely to be far smaller than the more than $2 trillion sought by democrats, according to wall street analysts.
i don't have a vote on that issue, like i said, i'm trying to drain the swamp here, hood said.
margaret brennan: you heard some disagreement among republicans on how to do that. there's also disagreement within the democratic party on how to handle healthcare. former attorney general eric holder says it's time now to move to some version of medicare for all and end this nonsense. that was his reaction to friday's ruling. do you agree with him?
over 225,000 americans have died from the virus, and millions have lost their jobs due to the economic fallout caused by the pandemic.
anna palmer: this is basically the internal fight that the democrats have been having in the last cycle about challengers in primary races, and you have members like aoc, who want to take the party to the left and they want to have challengers that the party establishment are not okay with. and so this is actually a tool that mitch mcconnell used on the senate side and republicans, a couple of cycles to go to take back control. it's a way for the establishment to say, no, no, no, if you're going to run for some of these more left-leaning candidates that are not in line with who we think can win these races ultimately, then you as a consultant aren't going to get the work of the party.
lesley stahl: are you gonna take the salary, the president's salary?
when it comes to the ability of working americans to retire, positions and policies that both parties' presidential nominees advocate could have a significant impact, considering that both candidates differ remarkably in key areas concerning retirement.
10:30 p.m. finally, we are joined by one more witness to the ominous nature of this regime. his name is mr. ji seong-ho, the president said. in 1996, seong-ho was a starving boy in north korea. one day, he tried to steal coal from a railroad car to barter for a few scraps of food. in the process, he passed out on the train tracks, exhausted from hunger. he woke up as a train ran over his limbs. he then endured multiple amputations without anything to dull the pain. his brother and sister gave what little food they had to help him recover and ate dirt themselves -- permanently stunting their own growth. later, he was tortured by north korean authorities after returning from a brief visit to china.
of medicare expansion, clinton said she would also commit to allowing individuals below the medicare age to opt in to the program -- a proposal she first cosponsored legislation on in 2001 as a senator -- by providing the option to those 55 and older.

chris christie: for the 45-year-old construction worker out there, who is having a hard time making things meet, he's lost $4,000 in the last seven years in his income because of this administration.
jamelle bouie: and so if-- if-- if what you're doing is-- is saying, i'm for unrestrained capitalism and the people who wanted generous welfare state for socialism, then you might end up losing that branding game if-- if you insist that if's the-- the generous recognizable policies that are the bad thing.
geoff emerick courtesy paulmccartney.com recording engineer geoff emerick (december 5, 1945-october 2, 2018) worked with innumerable artists during his career, from judy garland to cheap trick, supertramp, elvis costello and jeff beck. but his greatest success came through his monumental work with the beatles on such landmark albums as revolver and sgt. pepper's lonely hearts club band. a london native fascinated by music and technology from an early age, emerick was an invaluable part of the beatles' legacy as they became increasingly ambitious and experimental in the studio (including the embrace of effects like backward tape loops and double tracking). he was on hand as an assistant during the beatles' early emi sessions in 1962, and was promoted in the mid-1960s. producer george martin recalled in a 1990s documentary that emerick was unconventional: he used to do really weird things [with microphones] that were slightly illegitimate, with our support and approval. his innovations on sgt. pepper included enhancing the sound of ringo starr's drums on a day in the life by loosening the skins and wrapping a microphone in a tea cloth and placing it in a glass container. mccartney also recorded bass lines after the rest of a given track was done – an unusual practice at the time. emerick became frustrated during the recording of the white album and briefly quit, but returned for abbey road, and worked with paul mccartney on his solo band on the run album.

margaret brennan: --is-- is trimming away at your support?
robert o'brien (national security adviser): well, i have not seen the finding. i think what he is referring to and what folks are talking about is a briefing that took place last week at the house intelligence committee that was leaked to the press. and i-- i have not seen that report. i get this second hand, but from republican congressmen that were in the committee, there was no intelligence behind it. i haven't seen any intelligence to support the reports that were leaked out of the house.
margaret brennan: if it's described as a nordic country and not venezuela.
in a white house address, mr. trump called appointing justices to the supreme court the most important decision an american president can make, suggesting he might name as many as four justices if he wins a second term in office. for this reason, candidates for president owe the american people a specific list of individuals they consider for the united states supreme court, mr. trump remarked.

under the new rules, a short-term policy can be issued for a limit of 364 days and insurers are allowed to extend those policies up to 36 months, or a total of three years. three years is not exactly short term, according to many health care advocates. over a period of time that long, chances are higher a healthy person who signed up for a minimal plan may encounter health issues that could potentially be excluded from coverage.

the ad is a sequel to a similar 30-second spot manchin aired during his first run for the late robert c. byrd's senate seat in 2010. eight years ago, manchin was a popular moderate governor looking to put significant political distance between himself, barack obama and congressional democrats in order to win. obama and democrats were struggling to shore up support in states like west virginia in the midst of debate over passing the affordable care act. obama was particularly unpopular in west virginia because of his administration's push for cap-and-trade legislation and regulations on coal-burning power plants in the state. over the course of the 30-second ad, manchin was able to tout his endorsement from the nra – a rarity for a democratic senate candidate – highlight his concerns with the cap-and-trade bill, and draw national attention to his attempts to stand apart from democrats.

ownership by a pe outfit is full of complexities when it comes to cashing out an executive. puzder has an undisclosed amount of stock in cke, yet he can't simply unload shares via a broker because there is no public market for them. he needs the consent of roark principals to divest, for one thing. and buyout firms are hemmed in by many legal strictures. with roark, little is known about the nature of puzder's cke assets.

finally, no matter how many insurers participate in the exchanges, consumers can expect to see premium increases in 2017. several insurers have set the stage for major price hikes in the wake of losses. one reason, explained corlette, is that many insurers priced their plans too low when the exchanges started in 2014. for the first couple of years, insurers were blind in figuring out their pricing strategy because there was no data. it really was a guessing game.

kelsey snell: i would say that depending upon who you talk to, the-- the guess is about fifty-fifty or maybe a little bit less than fifty-fifty that a shutdown will happen. there really is still the possibility that they could pass something short term, not a big spending bill that gets them through the end of the year on that remaining twenty-five percent of the government. but something sort, maybe until the middle of january or the beginning of february just to give them some breathing room and to keep negotiating. that seems the likeliest scenario right now because it's the easiest thing to write and the easiest thing to pass.

: what's great about this funding is every effort every city gets its money, regardless of how small they are, and smaller communities have a harder time with covid because it's not like they have a place that they can really cushion. the smaller the community, the less rainy day fund you have. — mayor nan whaley of dayton, ohio on the bill being framed as a bailout versus a disaster relief bill: well, here, the pandemic is a natural disaster, just like a flood. well, the thing that's different is the flood is over in a day or two with this pandemic is continued on now for almost a year, and it's still going, and so this isn't a bailout. it's a normal and usual thing after other natural disasters. — mayor jeff williams of arlington, texas.
of price's house vote last week easing the passage of legislation in the future that could completely nix obamacare, murray said people in her home state have tears in their eyes at the possibility of losing their heath care coverage.
john mccain: yes. they thought it was serious enough that they had to act immediately.
cooper: secretary clinton, does mr. trump have the discipline to be a good leader?
joe biden: i've been saying this for over three years. the president denies they are involved. they've been involved. i was deeply involved in the intelligence apparatus and how it functioned before we left the vice presidency. it was clear they were involved. the president continues to deny their involvement. it's overwhelming. and the fact is that everybody knows except-- but when the president stands before the whole world, looks at vladimir putin, says, why would he want to interfere in our elections? well, seventeen intelligence agencies told me-- told them he did. so this is all-- this is bizarre. this is bizarre. this is continuing. and what's happened? why in god's name haven't we hardened the electoral process--provided billions-- hundreds of millions of dollars to the states to be able to harden their voter rolls, make sure they can't be attacked by cyber security as a consequence of cyber attacks. why haven't we provided the capacity for them to be able to have the money to have paper ballots in addition to that? i mean this is-- this is outrageous and it's going on. look, i joined with the leaders of europe when the european elections took place back before i got involved. i'd be-- before i-- before i decided to run. and we set up an organization that, in fact, said every european leader running in-- in either party, in any party, would take a pledge--
donnelly countered, just doing something isn't necessarily a good thing. you have to do something that is good. i want to work with the president on this.
cooper: the question is, is that the discipline of a good leader?
chuck schumer: we disagree. we disagree.
here's who's featured in this week's episode:
but he insists that's not the same as mandating people have coverage.
senator amy klobuchar: we have suggested so many things. comprehensive immigration reform that passed the senate would have brought down the debt by one hundred fifty eight billion and there was significant funding in there for border security. we just did it with the dreamer's--
cooper: thank you, mr. trump. the question from patrice was about are you both modeling positive and appropriate behavior for today's youth? we received a lot of questions online, mr. trump, about the tape that was released on friday, as you can imagine. you called what you said locker room banter. you described kissing women without consent, grabbing their genitals. that is sexual assault. you bragged that you have sexually assaulted women. do you understand that?
additionally, a cbs news/new york times poll released last week revealed that republicans may take more blame for the shutdown: 44 percent of americans would blame republicans in congress more for a shutdown, 35 percent would blame mr. obama and congressional democrats more.
i am proud to be a republican, he continued. but most of all i am proud to be an american.
no. they were aware, because of the schedule, that the department would be saying something in court. and i said that we'd make up our mind what to do and file, you know, sometime before monday. file our responses to what was going on in court. but other than that, no.
take me back to my own home.
mcgahn: i think if you look at his record, he does. he had the economy going wonderfully, he made a number of promises on the campaign trail that he kept.
they didn't warn him, the way we usually would be required by the department. they bypassed the justice department. they bypassed the protocols at the white house and so forth. these were things that persuaded me that there was not a legitimate counterintelligence investigation going on.
margaret brennan: --they are not actually his supporters. do you buy that?
trump may have grounds to brag, the post found, but his claim cannot be easily verified. there is no reliable metric on which to judge his claim -- or to compare him to previous presidents.
president trump called a study from the food and drug administration about hydroxychloroquine and its effectiveness in treating the coronavirus phony during a cabinet meeting tuesday afternoon. i'll stay on it for a little while longer. i'm just very curious myself. but it seems to be very safe, said the president. cbs news campaign reporter nicole sganga says mr. trump, 73, revealed to reporters during a white house event on monday that he has been taking the antimalarial drug he frequently touts as treatment for covid-19. according to the fda, hydroxychloroquine is linked to serious and even fatal heart risks in some patients. the largest study on the drug to date showed it did not improve the condition of coronavirus patients and was tied to a greater number of deaths. the agency has warned against its widespread use. white house physician dr. sean conley confirmed in a memorandum he and mr. trump had several discussions about hydroxychloroquine and decided the potential benefit from treatment outweighed the relative risks.
puzder finds himself on a democratic target list that has included mr. trump's choices as education department secretary, businesswoman betsy devos, and as environmental protection agency administrator, oklahoma attorney general scott pruitt. democrats portray these nominees as enemies of their intended agencies. on a largely partisan vote, devos narrowly won senate confirmation tuesday.
lesley stahl: but i can't believe, after what happened in the rose garden here, after the announcement, with all the people getting sick--
question: thank you. affordable care act, known as obamacare, it is not affordable. premiums have gone up. deductibles have gone up. copays have gone up. prescriptions have gone up. and the coverage has gone down. what will you do to bring the cost down and make coverage better?
his superheroes had super powers, but also flaws, arguing amongst themselves and dealing with hang-ups – all key ingredients that went into his most famous character of all: spider-man. his characters could also offer social commentary, refusing to shy away from the issues of the day, like war, race relations and drug abuse. lee's genius for vivid characters and stories left a mark on the popular imagination of generations of comic book fans, which translated to theatergoers when marvel movies (in which he habitually appeared in cameos, with a nod and a wink) became box office powerhouses. in a 2006 associated press interview lee said of his comic book stories, i think everybody loves things that are bigger than life. ... i think of them as fairy tales for grown-ups.

charles krauthammer ap conservative political columnist charles krauthammer (march 13, 1950-june 21, 2018) faced many battles throughout his life. a diving accident while in medical school at harvard left him paralyzed. but he still managed to graduate on time and at the top of his class. he later gave up psychiatry and his studies of bipolar disorder, and followed his love of politics to washington. his allegiance switched from democrats to republicans in the 1980s, when he became a pulitzer prize-winning commentator for the washington post. an unorthodox conservative, krauthammer was a leading advocate for the iraq war who approved of using torture to interrogate terrorism detainees, but he was also a passionate animal rights advocate. he also didn't shy away from challenging fellow conservatives. i think denial is what you do for yourself as a way to get through life; i'm not sure it's the way a party ought to get through politics, he said on cbs this morning in 2013. and he was not adverse to expressing his criticism of president trump, w
it is a state-based system kind of similar to medicaid if you will, and i do think there are very legitimate questions that can be raised.
it was an easy decision, yes. i think easy because once i saw all the facts and some of the tactics used by the fbi in this instance and also the legal problems with the case, it was an easy decision. you know, one thing people will see when they look at the documents is how director comey purposely went around the justice department and ignored deputy attorney general yates.

some aspects of the obamacare law are still very popular with americans, however: 87 percent, for example, say they would like to maintain provisions preventing people with pre-existing conditions from being turned down for coverage, and 61 percent would not support a bill that eliminates obamacare's medicaid expansion.
in 2009, klobuchar voted in favor of the affordable care act, commonly known as obamacare. she is pro-choice and supports lgbt rights. she is also an outspoken advocate of gun control measures and has an f rating from the national rifle association (nra).
sen. klobuchar: --and that's why i want to move forward, as president, with comprehensive immigration reform.
most important, democrats must convince the so-called obama coalition to go to the polls. former president obama's call to action, don't boo, vote has never applied more. remind young people their voice matters and arm them with the information to make smart choices. remind the communities of color that often sit out off-year elections that they should be using their power to affect the outcome of these elections.
when you spend some time with haley, you notice how often she brings president trump into the conversation. she is unfailingly loyal to him, constantly stressing his accomplishments.
we repealed the core of the disastrous obamacare. the individual mandate is now gone. thank heaven.
but otherwise, for a lot of people, they can go back to doing many of the things that they used to. and the sooner we get there, the better. after dr. anthony fauci's warning on reopening the country, tiffany said while he provides a perspective that's important, he prefers to have a variety of opinions on the issue. when i go about my decision making, i don't entrust, i do not put all of my eggs in one basket with one person, and we shouldn't do that here either. i think dr. birx brings important information to the table, as well as other people, he said.
to the brady pac, the panic purchasing at gun shops highlights the issue of improper use and storage of weapons in the home. they're introducing this element to their home and because they're new gun owners and because perhaps they aren't able to go to the range for practice or get more familiar with the weapon, it's being mishandled and it could be used to harm those in their homes, he said.
don't boo, he told the crowd – just vote. booing doesn't help anyone. voting helps.
did you advise the white house that you had made this decision?
lanhee chen: i mean, i-- i think it's quite divisive in the sense that he's speaking to his base that's who he's communicating to. he's communicating to his supporters. and we've seen this movie before, by the way, in terms of how candidates communicate with the people who support them. his message is to his supporters to say, look, you know, you've been ignored, you've been marginalized, no longer i will be your voice. i alone can do this. we've heard this rhetoric before. so i think it is incredibly divisive for senator sanders to engage in that. and-- and the democratic establishment needs to wake up on this. if they're going to stop bernie sanders, if they're going to figure out some way to make sure he isn't the nominee, that needs to start today. not after south carolina, not after super tuesday, it needs to start today. and, by the way, mike bloomberg could easily engage in this activity. he could turn all of his advertising against bernie sanders tomorrow if he wanted to. and that's the only way there's a difference made in this race, i think.
joe biden: no, i know. i gave you my-- i gave the answer. do i bear responsibility? zero responsibility.
desantis replied, businesses will leave the state, people will lose jobs and we'll stop people from investing in florida. it will be a historic mistake.
during a 2013 speech at an event organized by the federalist society -- a conservative legal group -- gorsuch said, if i believed that judges and lawyers regularly acted as shills and hacks, i'd hang up the robe. i'd turn in my license.
and that when they heard about the phone call, which is – the fbi had the transcripts too – there's no question as to what was discussed. the fbi knew exactly what was discussed. and general flynn, being the former director of the dia, said to them, you know, you listen, you listen to everything. you know, you know what was said.
bennet has about 10 paid full time staffers in iowa and spent nine days in iowa holding 19 campaign events in september.
john dickerson: the president came in saying, washington's broken. i'm going to fix it.
joe biden announced working campaign panels comprised of mostly prominent biden and senator bernie sanders supporters, cbs news campaign reporter bo erickson reports. the six panels will focus on climate change, criminal justice reform, economy, education, health care, and immigration, and have been in the works since sanders endorsement weeks ago.
in a new emotional appeal to iowa caucus voters, former vice president joe biden is putting the fight for access to adequate health care at the top of his to do list, telling supporters that safeguarding the obama-era affordable care act is personal to me.
biden told reporters later they absolutely can win minnesota this november, but added, we are not taking any vote for granted.
leader said, the fact is that american suburbs are now extraordinarily diverse – over 30 percent women, people of color, live in american suburbs.
jamelle bouie: --but hasn't taken any sort of step which kind of encourages migrants, right, that-- there-- there isn't as bad at the border as trump says it is, so maybe i could take my chance.
senator bernie sanders: we have just put together a multigenerational, multiracial coalition, which is going to not only win in nevada, it's going to sweep this country.
but the international community is skeptical. the investigation has been long delayed. china has been accused of repeatedly blocking access. beijing has pressed an anywhere but china origin story. the biden administration says chinese officials are spreading misinformation.
smaller steps might be in keeping with roberts' preference for avoiding major divides where possible, and attracting votes from both conservatives and liberals. the 63-year-old chief justice may be in no hurry to move quickly, as he could be on the bench another 15 to 20 years.
lesley stahl: --stalled a little bit.
nancy pelosi is the most powerful woman in american political history. she's been speaker of the house not once, but twice. and president george w. bush's nickname for her was 3 because of her place in line for the presidency.
margaret brennan: so when you were at the white house, this was your project. and looking at pew research--
i think that is something that robert mueller was responsible for looking at under his charter, which is the potential of russian influence. but i think it was ignored and there was mounting indications that this could very well have been happening and no one really stopped to look at it.
interviews were conducted in english and spanish using live interviewers. the data have been weighted to reflect u.s. census figures on demographic variables.
but on wednesday, he explained why he launched missile strikes against the syrian regime of bashar al-assad.
sen. klobuchar: i would first acknowledge to the american people very clearly the problem here. the surveillance, the intellectual property violations are basically stealing our blueprints, what they have done when it comes to subsidizing industries and manipulating their currency. the second thing that i would do is to work with our allies and to push them, and i wouldn't have just walk away from every negotiating table, months goes by. i think you have to keep at it methodically. and mostly, i wouldn't have used the approach they've used. yes, targeted tariffs, but they have used basically a meat cleaver or maybe we should call it a tweet cleaver when it comes to how they're dealing with these other countries.
president donald trump: --that would bring low-income housing into suburbia that is destroying-- that would destroy suburbia. and i said that in a joking way. the way you have it, it's like, oh, like i'm begging. i w-- i'm kidding. play it, and i'm kidding. that is such a misleading question, lesley.
stephen miller: --that has been perpetuated for too many decades.
jonah goldberg: yeah. it's great she wasn't left on a tarmac, for example. yeah, full disclosure, my wife works for-- for nikki haley and so i-- i'm conflicted and biased about this. but i-- i think you can make a persuasive case that she's arguably-- first of all, she's probably the most popular politician in america right now when you think about it. if you look at her poll ratings in-- in-- among democrats and independents, also among pro trump conservatives and anti-trump conservatives, she's kind of a unifying figure. and i think her timing in all of this was, you know, either lucky or brilliant. to no other person who has worked for the trump administration has seen their reputation enhanced in the process. and she is getting out while the getting is good, by doing it this way, it won't look like she's abandoning a sinking ship, if the midterms go south on the republicans. and i-- looking forward to find out what happens with her next.
he's late to the 2016 race – but not to politics new day for america while kasich could be the last republican to enter the presidential race (former virginia gov. jim gilmore has said he'll join, too), he's by no means a latecomer to the political world. in 1970, while a freshman in college, kasich asked the president of ohio state university to deliver a handwritten letter to former president nixon during a meeting in washington. the letter was later found by the dayton daily news. i would immediately pass up a rose bowl trip to see you. my parents would permit me to fly down and see you anytime and i know my grades wouldn't suffer, kasich wrote. i know how busy you are and this is probably a ridiculous request but to me it would be a dream come true. mr. nixon wrote back that he would welcome a visit at the white house, and kasich took him up on the offer three weeks later. they met for about 20 minutes. from there, his political career took off. here are some things kasich has been doing since that 1970 letter: 1974: graduated from ohio state university
vice president mike pence: lesley, we gotta get our kids back in school. and i would say to that mother, or any mother, that we're gonna continue to work our hearts out to make sure that those schools have the testing, have the ppe, have the supplies they need to get our kids back where they belong, safe and sound, in the classroom.
saudi arabia, they make a billion dollars a day, he later added. i love the saudis. many are in this building. whenever they have problems, we send over the ships...what are we doing? they got nothing but money. if the right person asks them, they'd pay a fortune. they wouldn't be there, except for us.
she said there wasn't the same level of tribal warfare in politics when she was first elected.
and i will tell you, hillary clinton is raising your taxes, folks. you can look at me. she's raising your taxes really high. and what that's going to do is a disaster for the country. but she is raising your taxes and i'm lowering your taxes. that in itself is a big difference. we are going to be thriving again. we have no growth in this country. there's no growth. if china has a gdp of 7 percent, it's like a national catastrophe. we're down at 1 percent. and that's, like, no growth. and we're going lower, in my opinion. and a lot of it has to do with the fact that our taxes are so high, just about the highest in the world. and i'm bringing them down to one of the lower in the world. and i think it's so important — one of the most important things we can do. but she is raising everybody's taxes massively.
the clinton proposals represent a further shift towards the policies of her democratic primary rival, vermont sen. bernie sanders, who has yet to declare his support for clinton's presidential candidacy -- though he has said he would still vote for the former secretary of state come november.
i believe it's inappropriate, murray said.
margaret talev: oh, no. he-- oh, he's ready. although he's still scheduled to leave for mar-a-lago at the end of the week, on friday. but he's ready. but there are many people inside the white house as well as on the hill, mitch mcconnell, the senate republicans who are like, you know, maybe-- and so there have been ongoing conversations between the white house ledge team and-- and those republican leadership teams in the house for now and-- and in the senate about how to stave it off under what conditions. but that-- that ultimate conversation that the president wants to have about immigration reform, daca and wall funding, the place where some kind of a compromise could be possible, is probably not really possible until next year, if at all.
bernie sanders bernie sanders on 2020: we're going to win 04:49 a senator and former congressman from vermont, sanders, a democratic socialist, came to prominence nationally when he ran for the democratic presidential nomination in 2016. although he ultimately lost to hillary clinton, sanders developed a devoted following among younger democrats despite being an independent. at 78, sanders is one of the oldest contenders for the democratic nomination. a native of brooklyn, he was mayor of burlington, vermont in the 1980s.
we'll be right back with more from our interview with former vice president joe biden.
biden: no i don't. look, are you telling me that we should go into china because- go to war with china because what they're doing to the uyghurs, a million uyghurs, in the- out in the west in concentration camps? is that what you're saying to me?
bloomberg is divorced with two daughters and two grandchildren. he still owns his boyhood home in medford, massachusetts.
other names on the list: president of the ultimate fighting championship (ufc) dana white, executive director of the nra's political arm chris cox, professional golfer natalie gulbis, trump winery's general manager kerry woolard, and soap opera actress kimberlin brown.
and why is the base talking impeachment? in part because of the way their elected democrats have been talking about president trump.
lesley stahl: there are more unemployment claims-- i mean, the economy has kind of--
that would do it! rowland replied.
more broadly, there are also calls for biden to outline how he plans to navigate his policy proposals through both a senate that is unlikely to have a filibuster-proof democratic majority and a conservative court that could challenge legislation.
cbs news campaign reporter alex tin reports steyer was the only candidate to speak in person at the event, which struggled to book appearances after the democratic national committee scheduled a debate in iowa for the day prior. others appeared remotely, with some sending surrogates in addition to pre-recording interviews or appearing via a livestream.
bloomberg is pressing his case after a late start and poor showing in his first debate last month. this past wednesday, after a better, second debate, he slept three hours before heading to his times square headquarters to phone voters. he's opened more than 200 offices with 2,400 staff.
president donald trump: i feel masks possibly work. but certainly you want to stay away a certain distance, socially distance, et cetera. but i would say a mask works. and i have nothing against masks. and i tell people to wear masks. i have no problem--
lesley stahl: you have complained, i'm quoting you, president trump h-- is engaged in an unconstitutional assault on the constitution.
if we set those goals and we go together to try to achieve them, there's nothing in my opinion that america can't do. so that's why i hope that we will come together in this campaign. obviously, i'm hoping to earn your vote, i'm hoping to be elected in november, and i can promise you, i will work with every american.
tuesday night's speech will be mr. obama's seventh state of the union address and 10th speech to a joint session of congress.
lesley stahl: so are you saying she should send the kids back? should the kids wear masks?
i want us to be able, when we walk out this door, to say we couldn't think of anything else that we didn't try to do, the president said in this white house video posted monday on twitter:
speaker nancy pelosi: well, affordable care act is better than medicare, there's no question about that. the affordable care act benefits are better. medicare doesn't have a catastrophic plan. so if you want medicare for all you're gonna have to change medicare and let's take a look at that.
the budget does bend the trajectory down, it does move us back towards balance. it does get us away from trillion-dollar deficits, mulvaney said on fox news sunday.
it is the second ad for biden in iowa as part of a high six-figure ad buy according to the biden campaign. the campaign intends to roll out complimentary digital ads in the state each showcasing key parts of biden's plan to protect and build on the health care law. according to media intelligence firm advertising analytics, the biden campaign has booked about $339,000 in ad time on broadcast and cable in iowa over the next two weeks.
john dickerson: but let me go back to this. you said the ad is not productive. here's the-- here's the concern people have. this is a fight over this moment, okay? but it's opening up this larger, pretty ugly debate. that ad suggests basically, the democrats are for the dangerous people. we're for the good americans. when it gets into that kind of a debate, it gets very elemental, and you start doing-- saying things and creating wounds that can't be healed.
bill whitaker: you can handle more?
kaul, in a statement, said wisconsin should not have been involved in the lawsuit and i am glad to be able to announce that we no longer are.
she is a disgrace for any, the lies she told those mothers about their children that got killed over there in benghazi, he said on the jeff kuhner show in boston tuesday. she dropped the ball on over 400 emails requesting back up security. something's wrong there. hillary clinton should be put in the firing line and shot for treason.
lesley stahl: well, medicare for all-- it's not only being pushed by some members of your caucus, but also some of the presidential candidates. and it is allowing the president to say you're all socialists.
the comments have sparked responses from republican leaders in georgia and florida who welcome the idea of the convention being hosted in their state and respective cities. republican governor brian kemp joined the conversation on twitter tuesday afternoon saying his state would be honored to safely host the convention. both florida and georgia were two of the first states to begin re-opening amid the pandemic. in recent weeks, both the president and vice president have praised desantis and the state in its re-opening efforts.
one of the things that has animated and characterized the president's approach is the way he has engaged american business to do their part and step up, pence responded.
margaret brennan: --they're already trying to enact the cuts.
those ideas avoid a direct confrontation with the powerful pharmaceutical lobby, but they may also underwhelm americans seeking relief from escalating prescription costs.
barrett's successful confirmation to the court would tip the court to the right, solidifying a 6-3 conservative majority among the justices. other leading democrats also focused on barrett's record on health care on sunday, offering a preview of how the party plans to approach the high-profile confirmation hearings.
meanwhile, cbs news political unit associate producer sarah ewall-wice reports that the senate majority pac, which works to elect democrats, is running its first television ad in montana for the 2020 election cycle this weekend. this comes after the state's democratic governor, steve bullock, decided to challenge gop senator steve daines, putting the race closer in play. the ad titled maybe accuses daines of supporting not only corporate tax cuts, but also cuts to medicare. it's a six-figure buy that will start running statewide on saturday. according to kantar/cmag tracking, daines has already spent more than $600,000 on ads in the race, including both tv and digital. bullock has spent $114,000, but all of his ads so far have been digital.
president joe biden: we now have a national strategy to beat covid-19. it's based on science not politics. it's based on truth, not denial.
sen. johnny isakson, a georgia republican, was one of the few republicans to denounce mr. trump in a radio interview wednesday afternoon.
but if gridlock reaches the levels it did in 2011, causing government shutdowns or another crisis over the debt ceiling, the opposite would likely happen. during the 2011 episode, when the u.s. treasury came close to a technical default on its debt, the s&p 500 dropped by nearly 20 percent. a repeat of this scenario is not only possible but could actually become likely in an extreme gridlock environment, according to ubs.
fact check: true, as far as cbs news can tell -- though not every facet of trump's plan is spelled out.
trump today also kept up his call for mr. obama to release his birth certificate (even though the president has already provided his certificate of live birth, and there is ample evidence to show the president was born in the u.s.).
i don't care what people say - as long as they get the facts straight. in 2005 a retired fbi agent uncovered new evidence and witnesses supporting dummar's claim of finding hughes and driving him to the sands, and about the delivery of the envelope containing the will. but in 2008 a u.s. appeals court affirmed a nevada state court jury's decision 30 years earlier that found the will was a fake. you've got to keep on living, dummar told the salt lake tribune in 2005 about his set-backs. but as the aspiring songwriter wrote in all-american dreamer: some say i'll never make it.
mcghan: most- well, frankfurter went through 12 days start to finish. you can say, well, that's ancient history. what about modern times? john paul stevens who has become a hero of the left, went through 16 days, start to finish. sandra day o'connor went through in 33 days, start to finish and ruth bader ginsburg went from 42 days, start to finish. so there is time to do it. it is not outside of the norm.
meanwhile, anthem (antm), the second-largest u.s. health insurer, announced first-quarter earnings wednesday, which, like the others, beat analyst expectations, even though net income fell, in this case, 18.7 percent. in its post-release conference call, anthem said it's sticking with the 14 state health exchanges it's now in and expects to make a small profit from them this year. we believe we are well-positioned for continued growth in exchange [enrollment] as this market stabilizes, anthem ceo joseph swedish said.
delegates chanted on the floor, lock her up, lock her up!
last week, the senate voted on a tailored $500 billion coronavirus relief measure put forth by republicans, but the bill was blocked by senate democrats, who said it did not do enough. the gop, meanwhile, accused democrats of refusing to compromise.
rep. steven cohen, d-tenn., characterized wednesday's meeting as a pretty frank and forthright discussion of the political fallout of the 'if you like your health care, you can keep it' statement.'
it's unclear exactly how many immigrants mr. trump's proposed immigration framework would affect, so his claim is impossible to rate with certainty.
the same rep. hoyer who dismisses impeachment talk as unproductive has accused the president of treason. sen. schumer says trump's presidency is so riddled with corruption that his supreme court pick shouldn't be allowed on the court. elected democrats regularly call the president a crook, a racist, a sexual predator and a psychopath.
here tonight is preston sharp, a 12-year-old boy from redding, california, who noticed that veterans' graves were not marked with flags on veterans day. he decided all by himself to change that, and started a movement that has now placed 40,000 flags at the graves of our great heroes. preston, a job well done.
see, i understand the tax code better than anybody that's ever run for president. hillary clinton — and it's extremely complex — hillary clinton has friends that want all of these provisions, including they want the carried interest provision, which is very important to wall street people. but they really want the carried interest provision, which i believe hillary's leaving. very interesting why she's leaving carried interest.
margaret brennan: chicago public schools are set to open tomorrow for the first time since march, but school officials and the teachers' union have been at odds over terms of the teachers returning to the classroom. chicago public schools ceo doctor janice jackson joins us. good morning to you.
joe biden: i'm not watching this at all. i go out-- i'm running for the same exact reason when i started: to restore some dignity to the office, to make sure that african-americans and minorities get treated well, and this time when we rebuild the middle class get brought along, and to unify the country and the party. nothing's changed why i'm running. i'm going to continue to do that.

lanny davis: never. but he announced ahead of time, wouldn't take it even if it was handed to him. and let's remember that michael cohen has corroborating evidence for everything that he has said. mister mueller certainly does on the issue of the purpose of the money paid to stormy daniels the same man who called michael cohen a rat denied on air force one to the american people that he knew anything about stormy daniels and mister giuliani, who this morning was on television accusing michael cohen of lying, the very next day waived attorney client privilege and said no his client did pay stormy daniels. so, michael cohen is now taking ownership in his statement to the court of his personal responsibility for his behavior when he worked for donald trump. now that he saw donald trump as president, he underwent a genuine transformation because he feared for his country and his family--

gun rights and open carry advocates in michigan have sued secretary of state jocelyn benson over her directive last week banning openly carrying firearms at polling places, according to cbs news campaign reporter adam brewster.last friday, benson issued an order that said, the open carry of a firearm is prohibited in a polling place, in any hallway used by voters to enter or exit, or within 100 feet of any entrance to a building in which a polling place is located. the directive said concealed carry is not allowed at any building that already prohibits the practice. the lawsuit filed by michigan open carry, michigan gun owners and michigan coalition for responsible gun owners claims that benson's directive makes an unsupported correlation between mere possession of a firearm and voter intimidation; and, is conjured without any legal basis or authorization under michigan law. some local law enforcement officials in michigan have indicated they don't plan to enforce the order. earlier this week benson defended the order, telling reporters, this is not a ban on firearms. this is an effort to protect our voters from intimidation, threats and harassment on election day itself. benson said her understanding is michigan state police will help enforce the directive where local law enforcement is choosing not to.

the black lives matter movement also still had a 49% favorable rating, compared to a 37% unfavorable view, the same numbers as august. there was a slight increase in approval over president trump's handling of protests (36%) compared to early august (32%). a majority of voters (54%) still disapproved of his handling.

exclusions due to preexisting conditions were very unpopular before obamacare, and eliminating them was one of its goals.
the military was depleted, mr. trump said in his february news conference in the white house rose garden. and if we don't have a strong military — that hopefully we won't have to use because it's strong — if we don't have a strong military, you don't have to worry about debt; you have bigger problems. so i have to straighten out the military. that's why i did the $700- and $716 billion. but growth will straighten it out.
handel has raised a total of $4.56 million as of may 31, but she has had way more help from outside groups.
paul ryan: it's a good question because we're so babbled. if we were saying, for instance, we are never going to do a daca solution. we're going to kick these kids out, then i might understand democrats getting frustrated. but what-- what's baffling about this, john, is we were in negotiations on how to solve this problem, and then they blew that up and stopped these negotiations. so our-- we have kevin mccarthy representing house republicans who was negotiating with dick durbin and other leaders. that's what's baffling about this--
support for a nationwide ban on assault weapons has dropped over the past five years, from 63 percent in january 2011 to 44 percent today. for the first time since 1994, more americans oppose (50 percent) a nationwide ban on assault weapons than favor one (44 percent).
at his funeral, which the president did not attend, meghan mccain did not mention mr. trump by name but said, we gather here to mourn the passing of american greatness, the real thing, not the cheap rhetoric from men who will never come near the sacrifice he gave so willingly.

margaret brennan: as congressional democrats learned they'll have to wait until mid-april to see attorney general william barr's redacted version of the report's findings.
margaret brennan: the coverage of pre-existing conditions was protected under the affordable care act, so if this ruling is upheld that goes away. are you as- as a republican leader looking to craft an entirely new law from whole cloth or are you looking at amending the affordable care act?
donald trump: sure i can. i can be easily, that's easier. honestly to do that, it's easier.

i don't think there was any accuracy in that, he said. this isn't a tough vote. this is a vote we promised america. this is living up to our promise to repeal and replace obamacare which is failing minute by minute and day by day.
sen. scott: well, of course. i mean--
the federal health care exchanges are so far falling short of signing up young (and presumably healthier) workers, which may portend trouble ahead for plans sold through the affordable care act. when the law was created, actuaries estimated that 40 percent of the obamacare plans would need to be sold to people between 18 to 34 years old in order to offset higher costs tied to older (and presumably sicker) workers.
president donald trump: i haven't gone after her.
margaret brennan: all right. doctor jackson, none of this is easy. thank you for your time this morning.
the politics of racial hatred and religious bigotry practiced by the klan and others have no place in this country, and are destructive of the values for which america has always stood… i firmly believe there is no room for partisanship on this question. democrats and republicans alike must be resolute in disassociating ourselves from any group or individual whose political philosophy consists only of racial or religious intolerance, whose arguments are supported only by intimidation or threats of violence.
to accelerate the process, the biden administration, like the trump administration, invoked the defense production act and forced suppliers to make vaccine manufacturers their top priority. pfizer ceo albert bourla says his company was able to increase its production by 20%.
jamelle bouie: it's-- health care is an issue where president trump i think gets especially vulnerable, not just because the administration doesn't have any particular plans. but you look at this 2016 coalition there was more blue collar than any republican coalition had been before. and it depends on maintaining certain margins with blue collar whites--
i think the losers are nancy pelosi and chuck schumer because now they own obamacare, mr. trump said. they own it. hundred percent own it. and this is not a republican healthcare, this is not anything but a democrat healthcare and they have obamacare for a little while longer until it ceases to exist, which it will at some point in the near future.
the justice department on thursday moved to dismiss charges against michael flynn, president trump's first national security adviser. flynn pleaded guilty in december 2017 to lying to the fbi about his contacts with the former russian ambassador to the u.s. — but in january, flynn asked the court to allow him to withdraw his guilty plea, citing the government's bad faith, vindictiveness and breach of the plea agreement.
senator marco rubio: my view is that's what-- my view is that-- that's what a lot of scientists say. i think there are others that dispute what percentage of that is humans and not. i'm a policymaker. there's no way that i can ever debate with a scientist or people who spend their whole life on that.

the gap between ryan's reach and his grasp was especially stark this week. the congressional budget office said monday that the tax bill and last month's $1.3 trillion spending bill would add more than $2.6 trillion to the national debt over the coming decade — and the looming return of the first trillion-dollar deficits since president barack obama's first term.
as the republicans scramble to repeal and replace the affordable care act (aca), they're bumping into two unavoidable elephants in the room: basic actuarial and underwriting principles, and the high cost of medical care. simply repealing obamacare is relatively easy, but replacing it will be much more difficult because any new solution will need to grapple with these elephants head-on.

generally speaking, historically, the infection rates roughly, from what i've seen, are comparable inside the institution (sic) as they are in society at large. and we've been able to prevent our prisons from becoming petri dishes where they sweep through with the same lethality that they have in, you know, nursing homes and so forth. it takes a lotta work, and the bureau of prisons has been working hard on that.

the republican party will become the party of healthcare! — donald j. trump (@realdonaldtrump) march 26, 2019
john dickerson: the president, you talk about blame for the democrats and all that. but they're- they're not the only players in this. in 2013, the president, donald trump as a civilian said, it always happens to be the top. i mean, the problems start from the top and have to get solved at the top. the top he was talking about was the presidency. so why is this president who came in as a negotiator who said he was going to fix washington, why is he not contributory to this problem that we have a government- government shutdown--
the docket of the supreme court this year is packed with core liberal issues: abortion access, federal protection for lgbt workers and gun rights. but given the court's 5-4 conservative majority, liberals are nervous about how those cases will be decided — and how future issues will be resolved if the balance shifts further after 2021. at the same time, they're also viewing this as a prime opportunity to press joe biden to make his case for the white house by running on the judiciary.
as chair of the senate judiciary committee, joe biden was proud to oversee and support the confirmation of justices ginsburg and breyer and lead the fight against many reagan judicial nominees with horrible records on civil rights and civil liberties, like judge [robert] bork. as vice president, he advised president obama on the selection of justices sonia sotomayor and elena kagan, and played a major role in winning their confirmation; kagan previously served on biden's staff, national press secretary tj ducklo said in a statement, as president, biden would appoint judges who share his values and would protect the constitution, and has promised to make history by appointing the first african-american woman to the supreme court of the united states.

robert o'brien: no, no. what i-- look i-- what i have heard from the fbi, you know-- well, what i've heard is that russia would like bernie sanders to-- to win the democrat nomination. they'd probably like him to be president, understandably, because he wants to-- to spend money on social programs and probably would have to take it out of the military, so that would make sense. and-- and, look, the russians have always tried to interfere with elections because they want to divide americans. they want to undermine our democracy. but the idea that they want to-- they want to influence the election and somehow cause the president to win, i just don't see it. but, look, i think there are a number of countries: china, russia, north korea, iran, that would like to influence our elections to-- to get the candidate that they feel would be best for their country.
the court also ruled that voters can return ballots by hand to drop boxes set up by counties. the pennsylvania state department allowed the drop boxes in the primary, but the trump campaign asked a federal court to ban them. after the state democratic party filed a parallel lawsuit asking the commonwealth court to explicitly allow them, the federal court judge stayed the trump campaign's case to let state courts make a ruling on the issue. the state supreme court used its king's bench authority to overtake the case and ruled in favor of democrats. additionally, the court denied a request from the trump campaign to allow out-of-county poll watchers. but it sided with the trump campaign on so-called naked ballots, ruling that ballots missing a secrecy envelope should not be counted. it also ruled that third parties cannot return ballots for voters, a decision mr. trump praised in a tweet. read more about the green party decision and its implications here and the court's other rulings here.

paul ryan: yes, i talk to him all the time about it. it's what i just said. he wants-- in addition to a daca solution, he wants to secure the border including the border wall. here's the problem. if we have an illegal immigration problem and we say we're going to give legal status to this group of people, as sympathetic as they are, and i don't want to see these kids deported, and then you don't fix the problem, you're going to have more people saying, ah, come to the country illegally. sooner or later, i'll get an amnesty. that's a bad incentive structure. so what you want to do is fix the root cause of the problem.

sen. klobuchar: i just want to get it investigated and figure out exactly what happened. but what i do believe is that if we just keep playing games with people's lives - that's what they're doing - they're playing games with people's lives. they're playing games with a shut down which last time cost twenty billion - the ted cruz shut down - for our economy. they are playing games with members of congress, they take the leaders of congress into the white house and create a media circus instead of just sitting down and negotiating. do i think that we can avoid a shutdown? of course, i do. because there's people on both sides of the aisle that want to find common ground. i think that's possible. but the way that they're acting is not furthering the attempt to make sure that our government is steady at a time when the stock market is careening and we've got a judge throwing out the healthcare bill.
instead, braun is a businessman outsider who likes president trump, is an effective campaigner, and has a history of voting in democratic primaries in his blue-ish corner of indiana. in other words, he's just about the perfect candidate to take on an incumbent democrat like sen. joe donnelly in a state trump carried by 19 points.

scott gottlieb: i think miami is at the highest risk right now, miami and southern california. if you look at where b117 is right now in the country, about half the cases that we're turning over in southern california and in florida and the cities are the hot spots, san diego, miami. so i think that the possibility is that we're not going to see a national epidemic with b117, at least in the spring and the summertime. it's a risk to the fall. but what we're likely to see is regionalized epidemics with this new variant. and the two places in the country right now that are the biggest hotspots are southern cali-- california and southern florida, miami. so those cities need to be very mindful of the spread of these variants. now we know it works. prior immunity and the vaccines do appear to be as effective against this new variant. so as we immunize more of the population and if people continue to wear masks and be vigilant in these parts of the country, we can keep this at bay. it's not too late, but it's a real risk to those regions of the country right now.

yet there is also a sense among the republican faithful that trump, despite his low approval ratings, will somehow bail republicans out in november. over at the daily caller, for example, my friend chris bedford has written a variation on this argument, saying it's preposterous that democrats can replicate lamb's success nationally.
but she wants to go to single payer, which means the government basically rules everything. hillary clinton has been after this for years. obamacare was the first step. obamacare is a total disaster. and not only are your rates going up by numbers that nobody's ever believed, but your deductibles are going up, so that unless you get hit by a truck, you're never going to be able to use it.
fact check: trump is correct that clinton used a computer program called bleachbit to delete thousands of her emails. but the program can be downloaded online for free and it does not use chemicals. a footnote on an fbi investigation document noted that bleachbit is open source software that allows users to 'shred' files, clear internet history, delete system and temporary files and wipe free space on a hard drive.

as the senate goes back and forth ahead of a vote on whether to move forward with a coronavirus stimulus package, senator amy klobuchar of minnesota announced monday that her husband has coronavirus. in a statement posted on medium, the former 2020 contender briefly described how her husband's health has deteriorated—citing that a persistent fever and coughing up blood led to him being tested and later admitted into a virginia hospital for several reasons, including very low oxygen levels. cbs news campaign reporter lacrai mitchell reports that virginia's governor declared a state of emergency earlier this month and announced monday that public schools in the state will remain closed for the rest of the academic year. this comes as the virginia department of health has reported 254 cases, 38 hospitalizations and 6 deaths related to covid-19 in the state. klobuchar said her husband remains in the hospital and has pneumonia but said she hasn't been in the same place as her husband for two weeks so she won't be getting tested. …since john and i have been in different places for the last two weeks and i am outside the 14-day period for getting sick, my doctor has advised me to not get a test, said klobuchar in the statement. …there are test shortages for people who need them everywhere and i don't qualify to get one under any standard.

think about it: you can't buy life insurance if you wait until you get a diagnosis of a terminal illness. you can't buy flood insurance when the forecast calls for a hurricane. and you can't buy health insurance only when you get sick or suffer an accident and think you'll need to make a claim.
and if you did cast a vote against the insider politics and general incompetence of washington's political class, doesn't yet another government shutdown—particularly one as seemingly unnecessary as this one—prove your point?

during his appearance with mrs. guaido, the president cited rising costs of premiums, saying people are going broke trying to pay for their health care costs. he maintained, however, that his administration had made it better by administering obamacare very well but still slammed the policy as horrible no good, it's something that we can't live with in this country.
there's also a political twist. since most of the health care aid is keyed to the pandemic and expires by the end of 2022, that will let democrats set up election-year votes to make new benefits permanent, or build them out even more.
admittedly, the right track/wrong direction numbers have never been particularly optimistic, in recent years. according to the realclearpolitics average of polls, only once during the last eight years did the number of americans who believe the country is headed in the right direction match the number of americans who believe the country is off track: for a brief shining moment in june 2009, roughly 46 percent of americans fell into each camp.

this is about retail politics, iowa is about retail politics. south carolina is about retail politics, said congressman tim ryan of how he'll compensate for not making the cut.
the white house prefers to keep the law's march 31 deadline for enrollment because it knows, based on its analysis of enrollment patterns after massachusetts enacted its healthcare law, that most customers will enroll near the end of the sign-up process. as one official said, consumers need deadlines and moving the federal law's deadlines will only lengthen the sign-up process.

it's unfair and it's ridiculous and it's not going to happen any longer, he added, indicating that u.s. trade representative robert lighthizer would be calling on america's trading partners to insist they pay more for prescription drugs.
one faction of one party in one house of congress in one branch of government shut down major parts of the government all because they didn't like one law, mr. obama said. this republican shut down did not have to happen, but i want every american to understand why it did happen. republicans in the house of representatives refused to fund the government unless we defunded or dismantled the affordable care act. they've shut down the government over an ideological crusade to deny affordable health insurance to millions of americans. in other words, they demanded ransom just for doing their job.
for instance, hhs isn't keeping track of how many obamacare enrollees were previously uninsured. it's an open question, given that millions americans last year were dropped from insurance plans that are no longer obamacare-compliant -- in other words, many obamacare enrollees could simply be finding new plans to replace their old ones.

the nevada state democratic party on tuesday announced senator amy klobuchar of minnesota will keynote their convention on june 13, the last of the early-state parties — following democrats in iowa, new hampshire, and south carolina — to wrap up its delegate nominating process after the coronavirus pandemic postponed the event. klobuchar garnered support from a mere 4.2% from nevada caucus-goers in february, a fraction of then-rival senator bernie sanders' sweeping victory in the state that earned him nearly two dozen of nevada's delegates, according to cbs news campaign reporter alex tin. while some sanders supporters have fought for influence over the convention and the state party's platform, neither sanders nor his most prominent endorsers are scheduled to speak at the virtual event. nevada will be a critical state to win in 2020 if we want to elect joe biden to the white house and keep our democratic majority in the house of representatives, klobuchar said in a statement released by the party.

during barrett's confirmation process, democrats argued a vote to confirm her was effectively a vote to kill obamacare and strip protections from millions of people with pre-existing conditions. but barrett declined to give any indication of how she would rule in the case and went to great lengths to separate her past writings on the 2012 supreme court decision upholding the law from the current dispute before the high court.

his campaign exceeded expectations and won a number of major contests against eventual democratic nominee hillary clinton. since the 2016 campaign, some of sanders' more radical ideas have been embraced by many in the mainstream of the democratic party, such as his medicare-for-all proposal. issues sanders describes himself as a democratic socialist, and his defining issue is economic inequality. sanders spent much of his presidential campaign railing against millionaires and billionaires who continue to profit as the inequality gap increases. sanders is a longtime supporter of a universal health care system, and introduced the medicare-for-all bill with 15 other senators in 2017. he also supports raising the minimum wage and making public colleges and universities tuition-free. sanders is a longtime opponent of trade deals, claiming that they hurt they american worker. he opposed nafta and the trans pacific partnership, trade deals which president trump renegotiated or withdrew from. sanders opposed the u.s. war in iraq, and remains a critic of american military interventionism. controversy more than two dozen of sanders' 2016 campaign staffers wrote a letter to the senator at the end of december seeking a meeting to discuss problems of sexual harassment during the campaign. a new york times story in early january reported several incidences of sexual misconduct by staffers during the campaign, for which sanders apologized. politico also reported in early january that his former iowa campaign manager, robert becker, had been named in a $30,000 federal discrimination settlement with two former employees.

a bill that passed the state house last week would give counties three days to do so, but wolf's spokesperson said he would veto it in current form because it would ban drop boxes. on a press call held by votesafe pennsylvania, ridge said he doesn't have a preference on drop boxes but that early pre-canvassing should be supported by both sides. i just don't see this as being a partisan issue, he said. we've got republicans and democrats at the local level who are asking the governor and the legislature, republicans and democrats, to ease these restrictions and let them give them adequate time to do their job.

margaret brennan: well, bernie-- excuse me, sorry, joe biden, dan, is making the argument for the good of the party that someone like him, he prefer him, should be the candidate not just for the oval office but because of all the down ballot races, essentially warning that democrats are going to lose all leverage or influence or a majority certainly in-- in the house if they don't go with a more establishment candidate.

anthony salvanto: yeah. the republicans have become more enthusiastic over the last couple of weeks. that's important for them, right? they want to get that base turnout and we think that helps move that. but, at the same time, the vote intention of both parties is up and it is even. it is even between democrats and republicans saying that they are showing up.
other short-term plans may limit coverage even more. some may not cover hospitalization, for example, or if they do, they may only pay $100 per day for 10 days, far less than an actual hospitalization would likely cost. or, buried in the policy may be exemptions for other coverage, such as any injury sustained while the policy holder is intoxicated or injuries sustained while playing organized sports, according to health advocacy group families usa. deductibles and other out-of-pocket costs can also be higher in short-term plans than policies found on the individual market.
that was a pretty strong statement, braver asked. why'd you feel like you wanted to say that?
it's amazing to me that judge barrett has publicly criticized the decision by chief justice roberts that upheld the constitutionality of the aca and that president trump is making it clear a vote for judge barrett to be on the supreme court is a vote to repeal the aca and take away health care protection from a majority of americans during a pandemic, senator chris coons of delaware, a democrat who serves on the judiciary committee, said on face the nation.

for too long, career politicians like joe donnelly have failed to put america first and fix bad trade deals, and hoosiers have faced the consequences, mike braun said in a statement provided to cbs news. in life and in business there's the short-run and the long-run, and while senator donnelly wants our trade negotiations to 'end now,' i applaud president trump's action to rectify the longstanding inequities in our trade relationships that have hurt hoosier workers, and feel my experience in business would be a great asset to the administration in the senate.

margaret brennan: --which is that our election process actually works. and undermining faith in the integrity of the election is a massive risk. i think, everyone can agree on that. what we have heard in the past few days, i think, is frankly confusing. and national security adviser robert o'brien said not just that he had not seen the underlying intelligence that russia was intervening with a preference for trump, but also that he had never received a briefing to that effect. he also told us-- told us in our interview that the fbi did tell him that russia was interviewing-- intervening to help sanders. this morning trump says he was never told that. what should americans at home understand from this? because bottom line isn't the national security adviser's job to say, our elections will be protected no matter who is interfering and no matter whom they are interfering on behalf of?

retirement savings suffer from a problem economists call moral hazard -- people who don't save enough, or anything, for retirement because they know a compassionate society will provide enough to serve their basic needs. the solution to this problem is to induce them to save some of their paychecks each month so that, even if that savings doesn't fully cover their retirement expenses, at least they'll contribute something.

many on the right have also made a big deal about lamb's abortion stance, noting his insistence that, as a catholic, he was personally opposed to the practice. but he also said he would vote against a 20-week abortion ban, which again places him firmly in the liberal camp.

fixing the holes in the affordable care act, also known as obamacare, was the preferred plan among the undecided democrats interviewed on how to best increase healthcare access. many endorsed a public option and were able to talk in specifics on how allowing them to buy into a medicare-like program could help both their families' well-being and wallets.
right. well u.s. attorney jensen since january has been investigating this. and he reported to me last week.

the government last shut down in october 2013 for 16 days after sen. ted cruz, r-texas, led an unsuccessful effort to defund obamacare. republicans went on to retake control of the senate in the 2014 midterm elections. it's unclear how a government shutdown would affect either party in this year's midterm elections in november.

michigan governor gretchen whitmer commented on speculation that she is being considered as democratic presumptive nominee joe biden's potential running mate, according to cbs news campaign reporter jack turman. asked on the today show if she is being vetted by the biden campaign, whitmer responded that she has had a conversation with some folks, but added that she is focused on leading michigan through the coronavirus pandemic. it was just an opening conversation and it's not something that i would call a professional, you know, formalized vetting, whitmer later added. this is the most direct answer whitmer has given to a question about being a vice presidential contender. whitmer has been asked repeatedly about vice presidential speculation in the last month but has typically only responded that her energy is dedicated to handling the current crisis. whitmer, one of the national co-chairs for biden's campaign, recently participated in a virtual roundtable hosted by the biden campaign with connecticut governor ned lamont and new jersey governor phil murphy.
cooper: secretary clinton, you have two minutes. the question was, what specific tax provisions will you change to ensure the wealthiest americans pay their fair share of taxes?

this is the full episode of the cbs evening news from the june 26, 2015 edition
it's always important when we have elections and when things are occurring in america that involve diversity, that we have diversity, said mcdaniel. it's a shame that the dnc put so much pressure on candidates to raise money, raise money, raise money, raise money, and we talk about trump being a billionaire and having no sensitivity, then why is it that we as democrats are putting so much attention and so much focus on who can raise the money?
in recent months, protesters have become a mainstay of trump rallies and how the campaign handles them has evolved. at a rally in raleigh, north carolina - when trump's speech was interrupted at least ten times, he expressed irritation with his staff for not removing them quickly enough. sometimes he is aggressive with protesters - pointing at the exit and yelling get 'em out! in burlington, vermont, trump said that one protester's coat should be confiscated. audience members can be aggressive with protesters as well, sometimes caught on video kicking and spitting on them.
on tuesday night, president donald trump's endorsed candidate corky messner won the new hampshire republican primary, reports cbs news political unit associate producer eleanor watson. messner defeated retired brigadier general don bolduc and will now compete in the general election against incumbent senator jeanne shaheen who won the democratic primary easily on tuesday. in 2016, hillary clinton won new hampshire by under one percentage point, which has made it an offensive target for republicans, including the trump campaign. president trump has held three rallies in the state since the start of 2019. however, right now, the cook political report rates the senate seat in new hampshire solidly democratic.
it was heavy. filled with executive orders, congressional initiatives, but no comprehensive health plan.
the coronavirus pandemic roiled the final weeks of the supreme court's term, causing the high court to cancel in-person arguments scheduled for march and april. some of the cases that were set to be heard in its last term were rescheduled and will be argued next month, when the justices convene the new term. but the high court heard arguments in 10 legal battles by telephone in a rare may session, including three involving subpoenas for president trump's tax returns and a pair of cases involving so-called faithless electors.
mr. trump also discussed north korea's nuclear provocations and it's treatment of both its own citizens and otto warmbier, an american student who was arrested in the country. warmbier was sentenced to 15 years of hard labor for allegedly taking a political sign from a hotel, and died shortly after he was released from captivity.

mccain admitted she is a strange person among republicans, though she still votes locally for republicans. but she said she is very curious to see if former vice president joe biden, a close friend of her father's, decides to run for president. i love him on a personal level, she said.
similarly, other senate democrats are hoping this will be a winning message for them this fall. north dakota's incumbent democratic sen. heidi heitkamp, who is also up for re-election in a state that trump won in 2016, released her own television ad on pre-existing conditions last week as well, reminding voters that as a breast cancer survivor, she also has a pre-existing condition.
while he's certainly a known commodity, it's not clear trump has the personal popularity necessary to push him to the top of the presidential race. a monmouth univeristy poll released monday, for example, found that 20 percent of voters view trump favorably, while 55 percent view him unfavorably - the worst spread of any republican contender.

joe biden: i think they should.
on the issue of work requirements, representative joe kennedy got into a heated exchange with verma. the democrat from massachusetts pointed to a study that shows work requirements — which the trump administration approved in more states after courts ruled the policy unconstitutional in several states — have led to higher numbers of uninsured without boosting employment.
and on the open-carry firearm law, williams says that the city has dealt with open-carry scenarios in the city before and handled them, but he added [w]e've ramped that up a little as far as our technique and our tactics to handle them. but in this state, everyone has the right to open carry. and we want to make sure people do that safely.
white house spokeswoman amy brundage added, these piecemeal efforts are not serious, and they are no way to run a government.

president trump said he would only choose a nominee he was confident would overturn the affordable care act, he said. that's on the supreme court's docket just one week after the election. it defies comprehension why president trump would continue in his efforts to strip away from the american people preexisting discrimination protection.

senator amy klobuchar: we need universal healthcare and there are many ways to get there. that is one of them. the other is to at least expand medicare to age fifty-five. there's a number of bills that i'm part of including allowing the expansion of medicaid which i think is something we're not talking enough about that senator schatz from hawaii is leading. and then of course allowing for an expansion of medicare. so, there's many things we can do. but right now with an administration in place that seems bound and determined to take away people's health care, we have to protect the ability of people to even have their health care exist because they are talking about throwing them off for preexisting conditions.
mike bloomberg: well, yeah, there's no argument about it. it was a mistake. i erred. it was a mistake. i've took-- i haven't walked away from my responsibility for it.
former house appropriations committee chairman hal rogers, r-kentucky, said he thinks there will be an omnibus measure by friday.
ivanka trump is the fourth of trump's five children to speak on his behalf this week, and her speech thursday night is perhaps the best evidence that trump's family members are the ones who are best at revealing a different side of the gop businessman. (barron, his youngest son and the only of his children not to speak at the convention, is only 10.) she and her husband, jared kushner, are among trump's most trusted advisers.

well, the case isn't gonna be argued until october. and the president's made clear that he strongly supports coverage of preexisting conditions. and there will be coverage of preexisting conditions. and, you know, he expects to fix and replace obamacare with a better health care system.
as for the future of the republican party, perhaps blowing it up would benefit america. but it's also interesting that the gop establishment tried very hard to prevent donald trump from becoming their nominee. if anything, the trump presidency is the result of the weakening of the gop's party structure—a structure that was designed to help elect more mainstream candidates.
question: good evening. perhaps the most important aspect of this election is the supreme court justice. what would you prioritize as the most important aspect of selecting a supreme court justice?
what you missed over the weekend

vice president mike pence: i think that's a decision every american family can make based on the circumstances in their community, the vulnerability of particular family members. now, one of the things we apprehended early on is that seniors, particularly those with serious underlying health conditions, are the most at-risk-- for a serious outcome if they contract the coronavirus. and so w-- families may make a decision that-- that certain elderly family members might take a pass but i think the difference between president trump and me and some of the public voices in this debate over the last year has been we trust the american people.

the candidates for florida governor began their second and final debate by decrying political divisiveness on a day when democratic leaders had been sent pipe bombs. but it wasn't long before they lapsed into attacks on each other. republican former u.s. rep. ron desantis and democratic tallahassee mayor andrew gillum agreed that some people are being pushed over the edge by extreme political rhetoric.
just as donald trump faces his own potential conflicts of interest, price also underwent intense scrutiny over his own stock trades and investments involving health care companies over the last four years.
the third debate comes as the new cbs news battleground tracker poll finds warren gaining ground, absorbing support previously given to other lower-tier candidates, while biden maintains his lead. the survey also shows a split within the party about what the democrats' 2020 message should be: 60% say it should be more progressive than the obama administration while 40% say it should be about returning the country to how things were before the trump presidency.

margaret brennan: i want to read a statement from the vice president who said, it's is a lengthy one, but in just part of it he says, in my many years on the campaign trail and in public life, i have offered countless handshakes, hugs, expressions of affection, support and comfort. and not once, never, did i believe i acted inappropriately. if it is suggested i did so, i will listen respectfully. but it was never my intention. that's a general denial, but ms. flores was on cnn this morning, senator, and she said that really this needs to be taken more seriously as a party, suggesting that democrats aren't taking it seriously enough. and she said she's coming forth--

president donald trump: that's no way to talk. that's no way to talk.
sen. sanders: no. no- look, yes trump has an idea on health care. his idea is to throw 32 million americans off of the health insurance they have, doing away with insurance for kids who are 26 years of age or younger who are on their parent's plans, doing away with the protections that the aca has for pre-existing conditions, margaret. that means if you have cancer, you have heart disease, you have diabetes. if trump gets his way the cost of health insurance for you will be so high that many people literally will not be able to afford it. thousands of people will literally die. that's trump's health insurance plan. my plan's just a little bit different. i think we should join the rest of the industrialized world. guarantee health care to all people as a right. end the absurdity of the united states spending twice as much per capita on health care as any other nation while our life expectancy is actually going down and our health care outcomes are worse than many other countries. and by the way, we pay by far the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs. margaret let me make a campaign promise to you and you can repeat this, play this tape over if i'm elected president. and that is, if i am elected president i'm going to cut prescription drug costs in this country by 50 percent so that we are not paying any more than other major countries are paying.

mayor francis suarez: yeah, it's awful. and i think, you know, we don't control all the vaccine that's being administered. we control about seven thousand of the twenty-two thousand that are being administered countywide. a lot of them are being administered by the hospital system and by other organizations that we don't control. we are very faithful about making sure that we're asking for identification, that people have a florida id because we think it's disrespectful. i mean, we have people in this community that are living here that are-- are, you know, dying, frankly, and, you know, they want and they deserve to have priority. if they're vulnerable, we need to get them vaccinated as quickly as possible to make sure that they can live peaceful and enjoyable lives without worry.
sen. barrasso: well the- the one part of the health care law that we took out with the tax law was the individual mandate that people had to pay a fine. the democrats didn't even offer an amendment to- to leave it in the bill because they know that, of the people that were paying this fine, millions have paid the fine. most of them earned less than fifty thousand a year. so it was very punishing, money they could have used to see a doctor for their child or their family--

ben domenech: --is something that's finally seeing the light of day at the senate level.
implement incentives, penalties or mandates for individuals to buy insurance, like the aca does. this is necessary if you want to prohibit unpopular exclusions for preexisting conditions while offering health care coverage broadly. implement a single-payer system that requires coverage for everybody, for example, by expanding medicare to cover all citizens, not just those age 65 and over.
be sure to compare all levels of coverage carefully, especially if you qualify for a subsidy. gold plans, for instance, come with higher premiums but lower deductibles and other out-of-pocket costs. for some consumers with high out-of-pocket costs, premium subsidies help make these seemingly more expensive plans more affordable overall than some of the higher-deductible silver and bronze plans.
south carolinian gop strategists say he is trying to play the delegate game in picking up enough votes in counties along the coast, where a swath of more moderate republicans reside. but he'll be competing with rubio and bush for those votes against establishment-friendly republican votes, too.

and bashing the media is also a recurring theme. while routinely calling the media dishonest, he makes it a point to claim that the cameras on the risers don't show his crowd sizes. immediately, crowds will turn around and jeer at the press. in biloxi, mississippi, earlier this month - trump took it a step further and went on a six-minute diatribe against a single cameraman, who was shooting the rally on behalf of the national networks. when the cameraman did not turn his camera to show the crowd, trump called it disgusting - and then said that he would fire his ass.

republican sen. susan collins, who voted against her party's repeal effort in 2017, said that if the administration is opposed to obamacare, the answer is for the administration to work with congress and present a plan to replace and fix the law, not to, through the courts, seek to invalidate it altogether.
the democratic-friendly afl-cio endorsed biden today for president. the mega-conglomeration of unions represents more than 12 million americans and endorsed hillary clinton in 2016. cbs news first reported that biden joined a private phone call with the union's top leadership following the endorsement where he thanked the group for their support and then briefly turned his attention to president trump. mr. biden told the union leadership that the president has blown the pandemic response. he also scoffed at mr. trump's tweets on msnbc anchor joe scarborough pushing a conspiracy theory that blames the former florida congressman for the death of a congressional aide in 2001. biden said, he's doing everything in his power now, he's accusing joe scarborough of murder…

sen. klobuchar: i don't think we should be doing business with them right now. and i agree with my colleagues not just senator rubio, but also senator warner, mark warner, who is the ranking on the intelligence committee, that this is a major security risk for america. you know, you look at everything from china to russia using cyber against us. it is the modern warfare we certainly know that from our elections in 2016. they may not use tanks or missiles but they can go after our electric grid. they can go after our security in a very different way. and so i don't know why he would just give that away right now. i would think that he would put firm, firm standards in place as part of any agreement with china. and that's not what we have. we just have another promise that they're going to buy american agriculture. okay, that's positive. but i wouldn't give it up in that short term gain for the long term where we need to protect our security and our cybersecurity.

trump: president obama — anderson, excuse me. president obama, by keeping those lines, the boundary lines around each state, it was almost gone until just very toward the end of the passage of obamacare, which, by the way, was a fraud. you know that, because jonathan gruber, the architect of obamacare, was said — he said it was a great lie, it was a big lie. president obama said you keep your doctor, you keep your plan. the whole thing was a fraud, and it doesn't work.
separately, a company working with mr. trump's re-election campaign is defending a nearly $3 million loan it received from the federal coronavirus relief fund for small businesses, responding to criticism and a lawsuit accusing it of receiving preferential treatment. according to cbs news senior reporter stephen gandel and cbs news investigative reporter graham kates, phunware was eligible for the low-interest loan through the paycheck protection program, which is aimed at businesses with 500 or fewer workers. the digital data company said in a news release monday that on march 27 it furloughed 34 full-time employees and three interns, leaving it with 54 full-time employees and one intern. phunware's $2.85 million loan was nearly 14 times the current ppp average of $206,000.

kofi annan fabrice coffrini/afp/getty images the son of an elite family from ghana, kofi annan (april 8, 1938-august 18, 2018) spent much of his career in the united nations, where his aristocratic style, cool-tempered elegance and political savvy helped guide his ascent to become its seventh secretary-general, and the first hired from within. he was also the first black african to lead the world body, from 1997 to 2006. from the outset of his tenure, annan struggled to restore the u.n.'s tarnished reputation (including notable failures by the u.n.'s peacekeeping operations, which he had previously lead). when he departed, he left behind a global organization far more aggressively engaged in peacekeeping and fighting poverty, setting the framework for its 21st-century response to mass atrocities and its emphasis on human rights and development. he was chief architect of what became known as the millennium development goals, and played a central role in creating the global fund to fight aids, tuberculosis and malaria, and the u.n.'s first counter-terrorism strategy. despite his well-honed diplomatic skills, annan was never afraid to speak candidly. that didn't always win him fans, particularly in the case of president george w. bush's administration, with whom annan's camp spent much time bickering. much of his second term was spent at odds with the united states, the u.n.'s biggest contributor, as he tried to lean on it to pay almost $2 billion in arrears, at the same time he pushed against the invasion of iraq.

i noticed when hillary clinton and her supporters are asked in interviews, tell us what you're going to do about obamacare, how would you fix the economy, how do you explain the birth and growth of isis since 2013 -- they talk about donald trump, she said. so hillary clinton wants to talk about donald trump, we want to talk directly to the american people.
extended timing. under obamacare, short-term plans could only be sold for a coverage period of 90 days. that seemed a reasonable amount of time to offer bare bones coverage for people who are in between jobs or in another short-term bind.
today it appears that the gop has an advantage, but who knows what the map will look like a decade from now? as population shifts from blue states like california and massachusetts to red states like texas and georgia, a future electoral map could unfold that benefits democrats. do they really want to blow up a system that's worked well for more than 200 years because in one election it gave us president trump?

susan glasser (the new yorker/@sbg1): well, first of all, look, this is a story i think that really has captured the attention of washington and many capitals around the world because it seems to show directly implicate not just this horrific question of this saudi dissident journalist who is in a self-imposed exile here in the united states, writing column for the washington post. he's broken with the leadership of saudi arabia. and it appears to be a very personal feud with the-- the young crown prince, mohammed bin salman. but that's also why it's a washington story. president trump and, in particular, his son-in-law jared kushner have made the relationship extremely personal with saudi arabia. they have doubled down on america's traditional alliance with the saudis. jared kushner has enforced a personal relationship with mbs, as he's known, overriding concerns have many here that, in fact, he was not so much a liberal reformer as someone consolidating power and cracking down on dissidents. so you see this case kind of bringing all those concerns together. and there's a real question, of course, of the judgment of the trump administration--

also on friday, a pennsylvania state court rejected an appeal effort from the trump campaign over philadelphia's elections officials not allowing poll watchers in satellite elections offices. the campaign had argued that offices qualify as polling places and therefore poll watchers are allowed in them. the offices allow people to register to vote, apply for a ballot, receive it, fill it out and return it in one trip. philadelphia's elections officials, the top state elections official and then a philadelphia judge each said they do not qualify as polling places. a three-judge commonwealth court panel today decided that the lower court was correct because the judge's opinion, thoroughly discusses, and correctly disposes of, the legal issues before this court, wrote judge ellen ceisler in the concurring opinion. two gop congressional candidates have a similar lawsuit on going federal court in the western district of the state.
so, once again, go to hillaryclinton.com. we have literally trump — you can fact check him in real time. last time at the first debate, we had millions of people fact checking, so i expect we'll have millions more fact checking, because, you know, it is — it's just awfully good that someone with the temperament of donald trump is not in charge of the law in our country.

it's also very short-sighted and even dangerous to be engaging in the kind of demagogic rhetoric that donald has about muslims. we need american muslims to be part of our eyes and ears on our front lines. i've worked with a lot of different muslim groups around america. i've met with a lot of them, and i've heard how important it is for them to feel that they are wanted and included and part of our country, part of our homeland security, and that's what i want to see.
john mccain died in august after battling brain cancer. in the last years of his life, he became a frequent target of mr. trump, who said in 2015 that mccain isn't a war hero. in july 2017, mccain broke with republicans to cast the deciding vote against the repeal of obamacare, a vote mr. trump frequently mocks even months after mccain's death.

senator john barrasso: --to this country. it-- it is part, to me, of national security along with our economic security, our energy security. border security is key to us as a nation.
sen. barrasso: i would certainly hope not. i'm working to the fact of keeping the government open. i think that's what the american people expect of the people that they elect, keep the government open. and if there's any sort of a shutdown it would certainly only be a partial shutdown. remember, margaret, we, through the appropriations process, already have approved 75 percent of the funding for the government for the next year. but i still think it's better to not have any sort of even a partial shutdown whether it's over christmas or anytime. i don't think people benefit by that.

senator ben sasse: sure. i-- i think that's true. i mean the president and i wrestle on a whole bunch of issues. i-- there are things we agree on, things we disagree on. but i don't think most of what americans are wrestling with is a problem that's two years old. i think we've had a halving of friendship in america in the last twenty-seven years. it's-- it's a stunning thing. you know nomadic tribes, agrarian history, industrial economics--people have always known their neighbors and known their co-workers. decreasingly we don't know those things. we've gone from three and a half friends per american twenty-seven years ago to about 1.8 friends today. president trump can't fix this. he didn't cause this. politics can't fix this. politics didn't cause this, but it's true that our political tribalism is filling that vacuum--

a new analysis from pew research center of the data on official reports of covid-19 deaths collected by johns hopkins university found that nearly a quarter of all deaths in the united states attributed to the coronavirus have been in just 12 congressional districts. cbs news campaign reporter musadiq bidar says all 12 of those congressional districts are fully or partially in new york city and are represented by democrats in congress. as of may 20, of the more than 92,000 americans who lost their lives because of the coronavirus, nearly 75,000 were in democratic congressional districts. the top 10% of congressional districts hit hardest by covid-19 deaths account for more than half of all u.s. deaths. in terms of deaths, 41 of the top 44 hardest-hit congressional districts are represented by democrats. these include the new york-area districts, as well as those in the boston, detroit and new orleans metropolitan areas. about two-thirds, 68%, of the 44 least affected districts, the bottom 10%, are represented by republicans in congress. but the death rates, while highest in districts controlled by democrats are decreasing steadily, whereas republican-controlled districts are not experiencing the same kind of decline over time. in districts that have been hit the hardest, nearly half of the population does not identify as white. 53% of residents of these districts are white. on the flip side, districts that have the lowest coronavirus death rate, seven-in-ten residents are white. read pew's study here.

so there was no mystery about the call. but they initially tried some theories of how they could open another investigation, which didn't fly. and then they found out that they had not technically closed the earlier investigation. and they kept it open for the express purpose of trying to catch, lay a perjury trap for general flynn.
trump: right now, other nations are taking our jobs and they're taking our wealth.
lanhee chen: yeah. look, i-- i think he said that at the end. i think he made the point that regardless of who is doing this or what they might be trying to do it is the job of this administration to protect the integrity of the election process and the integrity of our democratic process. but, you know, i think some of the confusion that's arising is because they are-- they are-- they are trying to turn things on-- on very specific indications of what did and did not happen. for example, the administration is saying that the president may not have been briefed on the underlying intelligence, but, surely, the president was provided with some interpretation perhaps of that data. and so what they are trying to say maybe is that he hasn't seen the underlying evidence. now that may be true.
asked if the president intentionally misled the public about the seriousness of the virus, white house press secretary kayleigh mcenany said, absolutely not. on wednesday, mcenany insisted the president has always been clear-eyed with the american people.
on wednesday, two police unions in manchester, nh that backed pappas in 2018, endorsed mowers. in a statement, mowers said he won't use our police as a political punching bag like chris pappas, continuing his criticism of pappas' vote to remove qualified immunity, by supporting the george floyd justice in policing act. lieutenant mark brave, who serves in the strafford county sheriff's office and supports pappas, pointed to past funding the congressman got for critical training efforts. he added that pappas is the only candidate in this race working to help to bridge the gap between our police departments and the communities they serve. brave himself is running as a democrat in the strafford county sherriff race, and won his primary tuesday.

donald trump: well, i've never commented on this, but the answer is no. i think i have to by law take $1, so i'll take $1 a year. but it's a -- i don't even know what it is.
manuel bojorquez: there are some indications the virus' wildfire pace has slowed just slightly. the number of new cases and hospitalizations nationwide has eased, but the daily death toll surpassed four thousand twice in the past week. today, florida ends its deadliest month of the pandemic. margaret.
just the same, the campaign for accountability, which bills itself as an ethics watchdog group, has asked a federal court to unseal puzder's divorce records.
jonah goldberg: yeah. i think-- i think the end of the mueller probe or at least this chapter of the mueller probe is actually a very-- is a benefit to a lot of democrats because it takes the issue of impeachment, turns down the temperature on that. it lets them talk about things like health care, which are actually benefits or advantages for democrats and president trump's decision to make health-- to give democrats the talking point that we're going to debate about health care seem to me like an incredible unforced error. so it's the mueller report is good news so far for the president, but i think it's also good news for a lot of the democratic candidates, and the decision to-- to pivot to health care seems to me an unalloyed good for the democrats right now.
margaret brennan: we'll be right back.
would you support drug price transparency? baldwin asked, expanding on a proposal to require drug companies to make public information that goes into pricing their products.
lanhee chen: well, you know, the president puts people around him who he's comfortable with, who he believes will be loyal to him. the president has that prerogative, by the way, you know, it's not clear to me that this is going to be the permanent appointment. i would say that there are a number of people who probably would be a better permanent appointment than-- than rick grenell. but, look, he has national security experience, it's not like he doesn't have any at all. you're right, he doesn't any intelligence community experience. so i think at this point in time, the president might be better served with someone who has that experience. but to me, this is a reflection of how the president has staffed his administration all along.
aaron navarro, eleanor watson and grace segers contributed to this article.
asked what he would do as president about black lives matter, trump said, well, i think you have to look into it very seriously because people get themselves into big jams for saying a lot less than that. i mean i have seen them marching down the street essentially calling death to the police. and i think we're going to have to look into that. especially in light of what is happening with these maniacs going and shooting our police.

but i want to emphasize that what is at stake here is the ambitions and the aggressiveness of russia. russia has decided that it's all in, in syria. and they've also decided who they want to see become president of the united states, too, and it's not me. i've stood up to russia. i've taken on putin and others, and i would do that as president.

when government steps in to try to correct these market failures -- breaking up a monopoly, regulating financial markets, forcing firms to pay the full cost of the pollution they cause, ensuring that product information is accurate and so on -- it's not an attempt to interfere with markets or to serve political interests. it's an attempt to make these markets conform as closely as possible to the conditions required for competitive markets to flourish.

margaret brennan: the president's attorney, rudy giuliani, says none of this really is illegal because it wasn't direct campaign finance money. these were private payments.
we have enough problems in this country. i believe in building safe zones. i believe in having other people pay for them, as an example, the gulf states, who are not carrying their weight, but they have nothing but money, and take care of people. but i don't want to have, with all the problems this country has and all of the problems that you see going on, hundreds of thousands of people coming in from syria when we know nothing about them. we know nothing about their values and we know nothing about their love for our country.

[hood] has to have historically less-likely-to-vote people, show up to vote. it seems his task is harder. he's got to get the bump of african american turnout, he's got to get the bump of marginally engaged blue-collar democrats in the state, or not get them to vote republican, university of mississippi political science professor john m. bruce told cbs news.
biden: not at all. look, we went out and went to the committee, went to the republican leadership and said, look, this is what we have. i didn't. but the intelligence community did. this is what we have. why don't you join us in condemning what's happening? and the republican leader of senate said, no, i want no part of it- joining in what is happening. and everything that came up subsequently to that reinforced what we were saying was going on. now, the question was, should the president have come along and said, by the way, this is happening and then it be viewed and accused of we were somehow--
since day one, the trump administration has sought to lift burdens on religious exercise for people of all faiths, the white house said in a statement. as the supreme court has previously stated, protecting the ability of people to worship and live according to the dictates of their conscience is part of 'the best of our traditions.' the court's decision today carries forward that noble tradition.
trevor potter (former fec chairman/campaign legal center president/@thetrevorpotter): well, it's been an extraordinary week. you had the president's lawyer, mister giuliani say, it's not a big deal, no one was killed. that is not the standard for the president of the united states in terms of complying with the law or all of these people around him. now if it were, we wouldn't have bank fraud prosecutions, money laundering; all sorts of other issues. what we have is a law that's central to our election system, to our democracy that requires full disclosure of campaign spending and prohibits corporate money from being given to a candidate. and--
still, comey said there may not necessarily be direct evidence, were the server to have been hacked. we do assess that hostile actors gained access to the private commercial email accounts of people with whom secretary clinton was in regular contact from her personal account. we also assess that secretary clinton's use of a personal domain was both known by a large number of people and readily apparent.

robert o'brien: the president made it very clear the last time we were closed to signing a deal with the taliban and they-- they engaged in some malign activity, they-- they had a vehicle-borne ied that killed a number of people, including one american, and the president pulled back from signing the deal. we're hopeful that-- that we can get to a-- a place where the afghans can talk with each other and negotiate some sort of resolution, a political resolution of the conflict. we've been there nineteen years. it's time for us to stop bringing our-- our sons and daughters home through dover air force base and dignified transfers. we've got to get out of-- of the war in afghanistan, but we're going to do it in a way that protects american interests. so if the taliban does not live up to their agreement on the reduction of violence plan, then we'll take a very care-- careful look at them. i think it'd be unlikely that we'd-- we'd sign a peace treaty, but we're not going to reduce troops to a level below what is necessary to protect american interests and our partners in afghanistan. i can assure you of that.

will vinton vinton entertainment animator will vinton (november 17, 1947-october 4, 2018) invented claymation, a style of stop-motion animation using putty or clay instead of models. the technique was featured in his oscar-winning 1974 short, closed mondays. his animation studio would become best-known for a series of tv commercials for the california raisin advisory board, starting in 1986, that starred the california raisins. his claymation fruit danced and sang the motown hit, i heard it through the grapevine. vinton's raisins would also appear (as cel animation) in a 1989 series, the california raisin show, which ran for 13 episodes on cbs, which later sparked a sequel. vinton also created claymation tv specials, including the emmy-winning a claymation christmas celebration (1988). in addition to other commercials (including those starring domino's pizza zoid), vinton created animation effects for the michael jackson music video speed demon, and the film return to oz. he also directed a feature-length claymation film, the adventures of tom sawyer. vinton once described the quality of bringing clay to life, one frame at a time, to cbs' 48 hours: you see the material move, you see the stuff kind of come to life the way flesh comes to life. but even an animator's hands-on touch can't guarantee popularity like that of the raisins: you can't create a phenomenon, he said. it just sort of happens.

i always was a bit of an iconoclast, as robin was in the film, cronauer told the ap in 1999. a lifelong, card-carrying republican, he said he was not anti-military or anti-establishment: i was anti-stupidity. and you certainly do run into a lot of stupidity in the military.
each week, the site will get better as we make the necessary fixes, zients said on a conference call with reporters. and by the end of november, healthcare.gov will work smoothly for the vast majority of users. healthcare.gov is fixable.
the future we want, all of us want -- opportunity and security for our families, a rising standard of living, and a sustainable, peaceful planet for our kids - all that is within our reach, mr. obama said before a joint session of congress tuesday night. but it will only happen if we work together. it will only happen if we can have rational, constructive debates. it will only happen if we fix our politics.

the president has reached a new low in this country's history of oppressing religious freedom that we have never seen before, he said. if he doesn't want to call his imposition of his values a theology, that's fine, but it is an imposition of his values over a church who has very clear theological reasons for opposing what the obama administration is forcing on them.
robert o'brien: i think if there's intelligence that we can declassify that-- that we can get out there all the better, because, again, we weren't in office in 2016 when-- when the last election meddling took place and the administration did very little about it. and-- and they-- you know everyone admits that-- that very little was done about it. we're in office now and we're doing everything we can across the interagency and-- with our state and federal and local partners to-- to ensure that-- that american ballots are secure, that-- that are our-- our ballot machines are secure, that tabulations are secure, that-- that state, secretary of state websites are secure. we want to make sure that this is a free and fair election, that americans select their next president, not some foreign country. and-- and we're going to do-- and the president's been deadly serious about that.

sen. klobuchar: i- no, i would not. what i'm saying is you need to have steps and measures and you would- could start there and then of course you have dates and you have times and you have a focus and you have a plan. but that is not what he does. he goes and gets a letter and says, i love the guy, right in the face of the warmbier's, who lost their son, otto. so i am concerned just because of the track record here. talk is good, but if all it is is talk it doesn't produce anything for national security for america and international security for our allies.
jonathan gold dan steinberg/invision/ap images jonathan gold (july 28, 1960-july 21, 2018) was a classically-trained musician who played cello in punk bands. but his real talent was as a writer, and for four decades he covered the culinary landscape of los angeles, shifting the popular focus from michelin-starred restaurants to the street food, diners, ethnic eateries and taco trucks that define the city's cuisine. his l.a. times column counter intelligence, begun in 1986, helped introduce angelenos to the lesser-known and tastier corners to be found in immigrant enclaves across the l.a. area. in 2007, he became the first (and to date only) food critic to receive the pulitzer prize for criticism. the judges noted gold's zestful writing that expressed the delight of an erudite eater. in an interview earlier this year gold said, i love going out to eat in the way a theater critic loves theater. i love going to farmers markets. i love sticking my hands in pots. and it turns out food is a pretty good prism through which to view humanity.

the battle between the trump administration and the democrat-led house judiciary committee dates back to april 2019 after the release of mueller's long-awaited report on russia interference. the report contained some redactions, including grand jury materials and testimony.

either zients or marilyn tavener, the head of the centers for medicare and medicaid services, briefs obama each day on the progress achieved in fixing the web site's myriad problems. starting this week, obama began receiving at the end of every day a detailed report charting, among other things, improvements to the web site's ability to log-on customers, keep them on the site without losing data and accurately transferring data to insurance companies. obama asked for reports to contain details on the system's ability to widen the aperture - meaning increasing the number of customers who could successfully navigate the web site's requirements to logon, compare plans and complete the enrollment process.

kirsten gillibrand sen. kirstin gillibrand announces 2020 presid... 09:35 biography kirsten gillibrand, born in 1966, is not the first woman in her family to become involved in politics. her grandmother, polly noonan, was the founder of the influential albany democratic club and was a major player in albany mayor erastus corning's political machine. gillibrand, the daughter of two attorneys, was raised in albany. she attended dartmouth university and ucla school of law. gillibrand worked at the private manhattan-based law firm davis polk in the early 1990s, although she took a brief leave in 1992 to serve as a law clerk to circuit court judge roger miner, a ronald reagan appointee. she served as special counsel to then-hud secretary andrew cuomo in the final year of the clinton administration. she was a strong supporter of hillary clinton, and worked on her 2000 senate campaign. clinton became a mentor to gillibrand, and encouraged gillibrand to run for office in 2006 rather than in 2004, believing that running two years later would give her a greater chance of winning. gillibrand defeated four-term rep. john sweeney, who represented a conservative district, in 2006. gillibrand was a moderate congresswoman and a member of the conservative democrat blue dog caucus. she supported a bill to withhold funds from sanctuary cities, and received a 100 percent rating from the national rifle association. after clinton left the senate in 2009 to become secretary of state, gov. david paterson appointed gillibrand to replace her.

margaret brennan: as we mentioned you sit on the judiciary committee. i want to ask you about some testimony before your committee this week from customs and border patrol. we mentioned the - the case here of this seven year old from guatemala - this migrant girl who died tragically after passing into u.s. territory. should the commissioner of cbp, said to you during that testimony that this had happened? it wasn't disclosed until days later.
in 2012, a tea party challenger and a residency scandal cost long-serving republican sen. dick lugar his seat, allowing democrat joe donnelly to eke out a win in this deep red midwestern state. republicans are hoping to knock donnelly off in november, however, and they certainly could, given how mr. trump won the state by 19 points in 2016.

clinton: at some point, we need to do some fact-checking here.
but the washington post noted that in her autobiography, living history, clinton wrote that she told the prosecutor in the case, i really don't feel comfortable taking on such a client, but [the prosecutor] gently reminded me that i couldn't very well refuse the judge's request. ultimately, the prosecution's case against the man fell apart for other reasons, the post notes, including investigators' mishandling of evidence.

8:35 p.m. et florida attorney general pam bondi said that donald trump will stop lawlessness in the u.s. and will reverse president obama's unconstitutional executive orders.
raddatz: mr. trump, let me repeat the question. if you were president...
president donald trump: it's been totally verified.
no, not at all. and, you know, i made clear during my confirmation hearing that i was gonna look into what happened in 2016 and '17. i made that crystal clear. i was very concerned about what happened. i was gonna get to the bottom of it. and that included the treatment of general flynn.
mccaskill has gone after hawley for his lawsuit, as the state's attorney general, against the affordable care act. hawley has countered saying he wants to repeal obamacare but maintain coverage of pre-existing conditions. voters see mccaskill (41 percent) as better than hawley (33 percent) on the issue of health care, according to cbs news polling. will this be the issue that's on the minds of voters when election day comes? trade and tariffs are also an in the state.
this is a story about my mom, but it could be about anyone's mom, slotkin says in the ad, while looking at pictures of her mother at their family farm. she had survived breast cancer when i was very young, but her pre-existing condition hung over all of us when we lived here at the farm.

lesley stahl: but you're, but you're basically saying you have to rely on them, even though you want to get rid of them?
now, with these 200 admirals and generals, they can't believe it. all i say is this. general george patton, general douglas macarthur are spinning in their grave at the stupidity of what we're doing in the middle east.
when the special counsel report was released last year, you were accused by critics of putting your thumb on the scale in the president's favor. are you doing the president's bidding in general flynn's case?
trump is under attack, they believe, because trump stands up for them. if he weren't president, many republicans believe, they would still be smeared as bigots, they would still be insulted nightly on prime-time tv and by late-night comics. the only difference would be that there wouldn't be tax cuts or a conservative majority on the supreme court.
donald trump: i don't hear it—i saw, i saw one or two instances…
she said the 33,000 e-mails had to do with her daughter's wedding, number one, and a yoga class. well, maybe we'll give three or three or four or five or something. 33,000 e-mails deleted, and now she's saying there wasn't anything wrong.

meanwhile, conservative house republicans introduced a bill on tuesday that includes elements of failed attempts to repeal obamacare in 2017. that fall, voters in several red states approved ballot measures to make more low-income people eligible for insurance through medicaid — a major provision of obamacare. with democrats in control of the house, the bill isn't expected to go anywhere.

we had problems that were in the bill that we couldn't solve before it got enacted, he said. it's been around for seven years, so some of the problems have become obvious. any corporation that would do a massive change like this would make constant adjustments. because of the paralysis in congress, we haven't been able to make the adjustments.

one of the criticisms of the legal approach to dismantling the aca has been that there's a sense that republicans have not introduced a viable plan to replace the obama-era law. garrett asked short whether such a plan exists. short said that health and human services secretary alex azar could come up with a plan in the coming months, adding, but we also believe that this court decision probably wouldn't reach the courts for another--'til probably summer of 2020.
with many questioning whether trump could be a viable candidate, trump suggested that president obama is someone who takes him seriously.
the facts: trump should re-check his numbers before conducting a trade negotiation. he could be referring to the total u.s. trade deficit with every country in the world. that totaled about $508 billion in 2014, which actually represents an improvement from the $762 billion deficit reached in 2006, according to the census bureau.
a few months ago, it almost seemed like this administration was prepared for war with north korea. were you prepared for that? asked braver.
over the last year, the world has seen what we always knew: that no people on earth are so fearless, or daring, or determined as americans. if there is a mountain, we climb it. if there is a frontier, we cross it. if there's a challenge, we tame it. if there's an opportunity, we seize it.

as the 2018 midterm elections loom, the partisan divide dominates the political landscape, and each side views the other with suspicion. most republicans believe people protesting against president trump are being irresponsible and dangerous. half of democrats say the same about attendees at president trump's rallies. in each case, these partisan views run counter to americans' overall, who see both as generally safe and responsible.
jay inslee jay inslee announces 2020 presidential bid 00:36 the governor of washington served two stints in congress, a single term in the 1990s and then six born and raised in seattle, inslee received a bachelor's degree in economics from the university of washington in 1973 and a j.d. from willamette university college of law in oregon three years later. after working in private law for more than a decade, he successfully ran for a seat in the washington house of representatives, where he served for four years until his successful bid for congress in 1992. inslee represented the state's 4th congressional district for one term until his reelection bid was thwarted during the so-called republican revolution of 1994. during the following years, he unsuccessfully ran for governor and served as a regional department of health and human services (hhs) director under president clinton. inslee ran for congress again in 1998 and defeated a republican incumbent in washington's 1st congressional district, which he went on to represent for nearly 12 years. during his congressional tenure, the washington lawmaker was a vocal critic of the war in iraq and an early proponent of federal initiatives to reduce greenhouse gases and the american economy's reliance on fossil fuels. inslee left congress in 2012 to launch his ultimately successful bid to be governor in washington, defeating the state's republican attorney general in the general election.

while there were plenty of accomplishments for the president to list, he rarely received a unanimously positive response from the congressional audience before him. both democrats and republicans wholeheartedly applauded the president's assertion that the u.s. military remains the finest fighting force in the history of the world. both parties were pleased with the president's announcement that vice president joe biden will lead a new national effort to find the cure for cancer. otherwise, the chamber remained divided.
the two have also been at each other's throats on several other issues, too, ranging from the administration's work on lowering drug prices to who gets credit for any perceived victories involving health care, according to multiple white house sources.
governor ned lamont: what they also pointed out, margaret, is that people of color, black and brown, sixty, sixty-five, seventy-five, are much more likely to get infected, much more likely to suffer complications than a white person ten years their elder. so, we are making a big effort to make sure we don't just get the worried well at our big drive-through vaccination centers, but also get our mobile vans, go to the churches, go to those housing complexes where we can get people vaccinated who have to get vaccinated.

cedric richmond: look, we're not going to negotiate on tv, but what i will say about the minimum wage is the minimum wage has been expanded or increased during times of crisis before. it's been increased under republican presidents and democratic presidents. and it's a great way to lift people out of poverty. and if you think of all the frontline workers that are out there risking their lives every day, who probably have not been vaccinated, yet. so, you're talking about grocery store clerks and everyone else.

(she received tony nominations for the last two.) her tv credits included the u.s. steel hour, ''playhouse 90 and car 54, where are you? film appearances include woody allen's bananas, hair and ricki and the flash. rae originated the character of mrs. garrett in 1978 in the nbc comedy diff'rent strokes, then took her to the spinoff show that premiered the following year. it would run for nine seasons, though rae (who earned an emmy nomination for the role) left the show after seven. at a 2014 reunion of the facts of life cast in los angeles, rae told cbs news, i don't think any of us realized how much impact at the time it had on people. but we're getting the message now!
as for the environmental protection agency's (epa) budget, the package would cut about $80 million from the $8 billion it received in fiscal 2016, which is a 1 percent reduction, a gop aide said. democrats are touting that as protecting 99 percent of the epa budget..

newly declassified footnotes in the horowitz report suggest that the steele dossier was likely the product of russian disinformation. and there were multiple warnings to the fbi at that time, yet they continued to use that. how do you explain that?
a new cbs news battleground tracker poll released sunday found that for voters in battleground house districts, health care is the issue they may be the least willing to compromise on. three in four say a candidate must agree with them on health care to get their vote. health care may be more of a make-or-break issue for democrats. eighty-four percent of democrats say a candidate must agree with them on health care to earn their support, compared to 70 percent of republicans.

on this face the nation broadcast moderated by margaret brennan:
democracy in peril is the headline at the liberal webmag salon.
john dickerson: right. and, susan, speaking of the politics, the president came right out and said this is about jobs potentially. he says a hundred and ten billion in orders from the saudi arabia which is-- that's orders to come not already booked, but and that-- that's really what he said, i wouldn't want to do anything that would endanger that.
lesley stahl: but you're okay with some tough questions?
joe biden's limp claim that he doesn't know anything about the railroading of gen. michael flynn just got even more unbelievable, trump campaign manager brad parscale wrote in a statement. biden is listed among the obama administration officials who requested the unmasking of flynn. we already knew biden was briefed on the flynn case before president trump took office and now we know that he wanted flynn unmasked. americans have a right to know the depth of biden's involvement in the setup of gen. flynn to further the russia collusion hoax.
his opinions were must-reads for his clear, colorful writing -- like his dissent calling the decision upholding a part of obamacare jiggery pokery and pure applesauce.
it's been a bitter fight over the battle to confirm brett kavanaugh to the supreme court. hawley would support him, while mccaskill did not.

more than a dozen democratic house incumbents and several senate candidates in competitive races have yet to endorse joe biden, nearly a month after the former vice president became his party's presumptive presidential nominee, report cbs news political unit broadcast associate aaron navarro, cbs news campaign reporter alex tin and cbs news associate producer eleanor watson. the holdouts underscore challenges facing biden as he prepares to lead a party fighting to defend a house majority and win back the senate.
margaret brennan: we turn now to florida republican senator rick scott who joins us from naples this morning. senator, welcome to face the nation. you got your work cut out for you. president trump said you are one of the senators in charge of coming up with a republican alternative to obamacare. when are we going to see your proposal?
the things that i know that he's focused on are making sure that we protect preexisting conditions, that we lower the cost that we make it more affordable, and top and foremost is that we have to allow patients to have a say in the care that they receive. it is a complete and total contrast to what you're seeing the democrats put forward right now, sanders added at the white house on tuesday.
this is an unprecedented line item in our budget, to put $9 million dollars aside to make sure that voters know exactly when and how to vote. we certainly don't want to get to the middle of november and say that voter confusion was our achilles heel, dccc chairwoman cheri bustos said. the group has also invested $10 million in ballot access litigation in 14 states.
margaret brennan: it's time now for some political analysis from our panel. susan page is the washington bureau chief of usa today, lanhee chen is a republican policy adviser and fellow at the hoover institution, dan balz is chief correspondent at the washington post, and jamelle bouie is the cbs news political analyst and a columnist with the new york times. good to have you all here. lanhee, i want to start on the fundamental basis of what is central to our democracy--
despite the gallons of media ink and hours of airtime spent pushing the dems don't do impeachment narrative, this is less a political strategy and more of a forlorn hope. pelosi and schumer can try to tamp down the #impeachnow rhetoric, but actual democratic voters are talking about little else.
the trump campaign fundraised $26 million around thursday night's debate, marking president trump's single largest day of online fundraising this election cycle. that gop uptick could not come fast enough. team biden entered october with nearly three times as much cash on hand as the president's re-election bid, leaving trump campaign officials to make difficult choices on ad buy placements in battleground states. trump campaign manager bill stepien told reporters friday, he is hopeful field operations in places like minnesota, ohio and florida will offset the biden campaign's nationwide ad blitz. joe biden's been running a lot of tv ads. he's got nothing on the ground, stepien said. the campaign manager also noted, we track the absentee and early vote numbers in every state. we know exactly where we stand pertaining to ballots out and ballots in. cbs news campaign reporter nicole sganga says mr. trump heads to florida friday for back-to-back rallies. as polls show the president hemorrhaging support among seniors in the sunshine state, mr. trump made his pitch to the country's largest retirement community - the villages. cbs news campaign reporter lacrai mitchell reports that the president's visit friday marks his 14th to the state this year and his 4th visit to the sunshine state within the past four weeks. this is also the trump campaign's second stop to the villages within two weeks.
on abc, trump said of his support for universal health care, it's a long time ago. it's 11 or 12 years ago. and frankly, a lot of people agreed with it. a lot of conservative republicans agreed with it, at that time. we have a different country today. we can't afford things that we could have afforded or that we thought we could afford many years ago.
in the ad, manchin uses a shotgun to blow a hole in a copy of a lawsuit that his opponent, west virginia attorney general patrick morrisey, is backing that challenges the legality of the health-care law. manchin warns in the ad that the lawsuit would take away health care from people with pre-existing conditions. pausing to reload his weapon, manchin says, he is just dead wrong, and that ain't going to happen.
margaret brennan: our latest battleground tracker polling shows your lead with south carolina black voters is thinning out. in november, you were at fifty-four percent support. it's now thirty-five percent. that's a nineteen-point difference.
yes, i'm very embarrassed by it. i hate it. but it's locker room talk, and it's one of those things. i will knock the hell out of isis. we're going to defeat isis. isis happened a number of years ago in a vacuum that was left because of bad judgment. and i will tell you, i will take care of isis.
9:19 p.m. with us tonight is one of the toughest people ever to serve in this house -- a guy who took a bullet, almost died, and was back to work three and a half months later: the legend from louisiana, congressman steve scalise, mr. trump said. in the aftermath of that terrible shooting, we came together, not as republicans or democrats, but as representatives of the people. but it is not enough to come together only in times of tragedy. tonight, i call upon all of us to set aside our differences, to seek out common ground, and to summon the unity we need to deliver for the people we were elected to serve.
the tail end of the speech, which lasted over an hour, was devoted to military issues, with mr. trump calling for an end to spending caps for the military and the modernization of the u.s. nuclear arsenal. he also promised the final defeat of isis.
in the interim, washington provided various short-term chip funding, and the government set up a redistribution mechanism for surplus funds in some states to be used in other states running low on money for the program. even with these efforts, the georgetown university health policy institute projected that 24 states would run out of chip funding by march.
the most vulnerable incumbent democrats in the senate have all endorsed biden, though several candidates challenging incumbent republicans in battleground states have yet to officially endorse. more than a dozen house democrat frontline members also have yet to endorse, which other democratic campaign operatives and members tell cbs is a matter of timing, business with the pandemic or keeping their campaign hyper-local.
donald trump's pick to lead the department of health and human services (hhs), georgia rep. tom price, fielded tough questions wednesday from the senate's health, education, labor, and pensions committee.
trump statement: bill clinton was abusive to women, hillary clinton attacked those same women and attacked them viciously. four of them are here tonight: one of the women, who is a wonderful woman at 12 years old was raped at 12, her client she represented got him off and she's seen laughing on two separate occasions laughing at the girl who was raped, kathy shelton.
donald trump: i don't tell you that. i don't tell you that.
all the democratic candidates who ran for president in 2020
the trump administration rolled back penalties under obamacare for anyone who is uninsured, and the trump administration has declined to open exchanges under a special enrollment period for americans amid the crisis. americans who are recently unemployed can apply for insurance under the affordable care act, but the status quo will likely leave many in a gap without insurance.
we'll talk with sen. bernie sanders (@sensanders), i-vt. the democratic presidential candidate is back in burlington after a campaign swing through california last weekend.
they got the state to fix translation errors in a spanish language signup site. they're advocating for a mass vaccination site in montgomery county. and they continue to help people like 76-year-old retired nurse nancy hart. we caught up with her this past week when she got her second shot. now she has a shot at getting back to normal life.
in a letter to mnuchin, who has been leading negotiations for the white house, pelosi placed the blame for the ongoing stalemate squarely on the trump administration, arguing democrats still have not received word on compromise language for a strategic testing, tracing and treatment plan, vaccines, and obamacare coverage for americans who are out of work.
feltes beat new hampshire executive councilor andru volinsky, who was the first gubernatorial candidate to be endorsed by vermont senator bernie sanders. volinsky held a press conference to congratulate feltes on wednesday, as well as to thank his campaign supporters. we need to help dan get elected in the fall. i will pitch in, you should pitch in. we need to stop sununu, volinsky said.
mayor francis suarez: --our-- our fire department, which is the one that administers it, is on heightened alert for it and-- and certainly will investigate any cases that we believe arise from any of the vaccinations that we've given.
this is one particular episode, but we view it as part of a number of related acts. and we're looking at the whole pattern of conduct.
postal service workers not a priority for covid-19 shots
but the department of justice's decision to support nixing obamacare, which prohibits people with pre-existing conditions from being denied health insurance, makes it difficult for republicans to make that case.
the party constantly lied about obamacare, they constantly claimed they cared about the national debt, and meanwhile the national debt continued to go up while republicans were in power, he said. and it made republicans even more cynical, the republican voters more cynical so that when trump arrived, they were desperate for someone to wreck the system.
the fate of former president obama's signature health care law, and its coverage and insurance protections for millions of americans, was again being argued before a panel of judges — this time a federal appeals court in new orleans.
joe biden: not at all. look, we went out and went to the committee, went to the republican leadership and said, look, this is what we have. i didn't. but the intelligence community did. this is what we have. why don't you join us in condemning what's happening? and the republican leader of senate said, no, i want no part of it--joining in what is happening. and everything that came up subsequently to that reinforced what we were saying was going on. now, the question was, should the president have come along and said, by the way, this is happening and then it be viewed and accused of we were somehow--
we are all fighting, we are all putting as much energy as possible to getting these progressive reforms passed just to watch the supreme court strike them all down, indivisible's hatcher-mays added. it's not worth the grassroots energy if we know that's going to be the outcome.

cedric richmond: look, the other people want to argue process. we want to argue purpose in moving this country forward. and president biden is very clear and he said it in his inaugural, we face deep challenges and we're going to meet the moment and we're not going to leave anybody behind. that's the whole purpose of building back better. we're not going to leave --
the u.s. in return was able to compel iran to take several steps that will slow its ability to produce a nuclear weapon: they must destroy stockpiles of enriched uranium, slow plutonium production, dismantle a plutonium reactor, and give international nuclear inspectors access to its facilities, among other things.
still, a democratic congress would be hard-pressed to undo the major market-impactful legislation that has already been passed, ubs analysts note in a recent report. many key regulations have been undone, and mr. trump retains the power to veto any congressional legislation.
five days after the surgery, lab results confirmed he had glioblastoma, the brain cancer that took his life.
republican lawmakers in pennsylvania and north carolina have each asked the justices to move up the deadlines for mail-in ballots in the two battleground states, yet the supreme court has not yet acted on the requests.

that war also saw the first substantial combat use of the air force f-117 stealth fighter, which made it possible for the u.s. to lower risk to pilots flying against enemy air defenses while delivering precision weapons.
in wisconsin, incumbent democratic senator tammy baldwin is running for re-election. she will run in the general election against state senator leah vukmir or veteran and first time candidate kevin nicholson. baldwin is one of 10 democratic u.s. senators trying to defend their seats in states that trump won in 2016. in connecticut and vermont, incumbent democratic senator chris murphy and incumbent independent senator bernie sanders are expected to easily win re-election in the fall.
gorsuch sided with hobby lobby in the obamacare contraception case and wrote a book about assisted suicide that indicated his pro-life views. before joining the bench, gorsuch took few if any controversial positions as a d.c. lawyer in private practice or during his brief stint in the civil division of the justice department under former president george w. bush.
midterm elections tend to be bruising for the party in control of the white house. think of the republican revolution in 1994, when republicans gained 54 seats in the house and eight seats in the senate – just two years after president clinton was elected. or remember the shellacking president obama's democrats got in the tea party wave 2010, when republicans picked up 63 seats in the house and six seats in the senate. there are exceptions to this rule, such as when the gop gained seats in 2002, but that was due mostly to the aftermath of 9/11 and president bush's sky-high approval ratings before the iraq war was launched.
holly shulman, a spokesman for the democratic national committee, welcomed trump to the race in a statement on tuesday.
however, if handel wins, the deep divisions within the democratic party about which direction the party should go will surely be amplified. an ossoff loss would hit democrats hard, after his candidacy was fueled by so much cash and democratic voter enthusiasm. and it would continue the party's winless streak in the 2017 special elections. the continuing battle between progressives and establishment democrats would likely intensify. even if ossoff wins, that battle within the party will continue to rage, though it may be briefly tamped down as democrats celebrate his victory.
scott pelley: it's a different world, but the question is, is it a different man?
blue earth county, which includes mankato, voted for president obama twice and then flipped for mr. trump in 2016, reports cbs news campaign reporter jack turman. two years after trump carried the county by nearly four points, the county overwhelmingly supported democratic senators amy klobuchar and tina smith. the county includes a younger population who attend minnesota state university, mankato, a rural population outside of mankato and a refugee population. mark halverson, the chair of the blue earth county democratic farmer labor (dfl) party, said he expects biden to win the county, adding that trump's character has turned off people in the county. a lot of people thought he was maybe going to be a breath of fresh air, but you know he's been just the opposite, he added. he's kind of bogged everything down in personality conflicts and temper tantrums. blue earth county is also in minnesota's first congressional district, where democrats are hoping to unseat republican incumbent congressman jim hagedorn. hagedorn flipped this district in 2018, defeating 2018 democratic congressional candidate dan feehan. it is a rematch of 2018, with feehan is challenging hagedorn again in 2020.
i am sorry about her mother's passing, hudson said in the statement. families have to deal with unfortunate situations. but unfortunately elissa slotkin is lying about mike bishop's record. mike bishop voted for a replacement plan for the affordable care act that kept existing preconditions. he was also an original cosponsor to the pre-existing conditions protection act (hr1211) that reaffirmed the guaranteed health care access to those with preexisting conditions.
if that means in the primary on the debate stage, they need to call each other out and explain the smaller details of their plans, i think that's a fair thing to do in the primary, former democratic congressional campaign committee executive director dan sena, who advises sen. michael bennet's campaign, told cbs news:
president donald trump's second weekend in office saw huge nationwide protests over his order that all travelers from iran, iraq, libya, somalia, sudan, syria and yemen be denied entry to the u.s. for 90 days. what started out saturday as a spontaneous demonstration at john f. kennedy international airport in new york quickly spread to airports from coast to coast.
anthem awaits government approval to acquire rival insurer cigna. that company has also expressed confidence in the aca, saying it plans to expand its exchange business in 2017. (cigna will announce earnings may 6.)
but i think it's clear to anyone who heard it that it represents exactly who he is. because we've seen this throughout the campaign. we have seen him insult women. we've seen him rate women on their appearance, ranking them from one to ten. we've seen him embarrass women on tv and on twitter. we saw him after the first debate spend nearly a week denigrating a former miss universe in the harshest, most personal terms.

the cost estimate comes days before the senate is expected to vote on the measure -- just before lawmakers leave washington for their week-long july 4 recess. and even with the clock ticking, leadership has not yet secured enough votes to pass it.
mr. biden's expected order was first reported by the washington post.
i'm interesting because my favorite candidate is not who i am gonna vote for, ellen pirro, 70, said as she sat knitting with her local wool spinning guild. at the moment it seems to be biden and if that's the case i will definitely vote for him because i want trump beaten more than a particular candidate.
donald trump: we've spent $6 trillion in the middle east, $6 trillion, we could have rebuilt our country twice. and you look at our roads and our bridges and our tunnels and all of the-- and our airports are, like, obsolete. and i think it was just a repudiation of what's been taking place over a longer period of time than that.

white house explains extreme vetting executive order
this comes after the house and senate passed a short-term spending bill late last week, extending funding for one week to buy time to strike the deal on the larger package. if congress is able to pass the omnibus this week, the next spending showdown is expected this fall, as they'll need to pass a new package by oct. 1. lawmakers will likely have to strike a budget deal to lift spending caps put in place by a 2011 law and then find a way to address raising the debt ceiling.
john dickerson: all right. anthony salvanto, thank you so much for breaking it all down for us. we'll be seeing a lot of you in the next twenty days, indeed.
after verma said it's premature to draw conclusions about work requirements, kennedy noted that roughly 18,000 people lost health coverage in both arkansas and new hampshire, two of the states where the policy was enacted. how many more people have to lose their health care before you can make a determination? asked kennedy.
only on one occasion did roberts join with the liberal justices in a 5-4 decision, a ruling that said police generally must have warrants to get telecommunications companies' records showing where people have used their cellphones.
obamacare is something that we are to build, it was a starting point and expanding access is not enough. access doesn't allow you to actually pay your bills, said harris. it doesn't allow you to actually afford to go to the doctor, it just says there's a doctor available. we have to make sure that people actually receive health care and that's the next step and that's what medicare for all will do.
the text of the directive says that a school must not treat a transgender student differently from the way it treats other students of the same gender identity.

claude lanzmann ap photo, mark terrill/criterion collection in his monumental, 9½-hour documentary shoah (1985), french filmmaker claude lanzmann (nov. 27, 1925- july 5, 2018) told the story of the holocaust without resorting to archival photos, newsreels, actors or music – only images of the barren east european landscape where nazi death camps were erected and where trains deposited detainees to the gas chambers, and the words of survivors (both the victims and the perpetrators of war crimes) laying bare their memories of a chilling inhumanity. the documentary, told through the unflinching testimonies of jewish captives, german executioners, and polish bystanders, was universally praised (roger ebert called it one of the noblest films ever made). for lanzmann, who had been a member of the french resistance, the topic of his long-in-production film (whose name translates as destruction) was death itself: death rather than survival, he wrote in his autobiography. for 12 years i tried to stare relentlessly into the black sun of the shoah.

president george h.w. bush george bush presidential library and museum in his inaugural address in 1989 he said, we live in a peaceful, prosperous time, but we can make it better. for a new breeze is blowing, and a world refreshed by freedom seems reborn. it was partially a prescient statement: president george h.w. bush (june 12, 1924-november 30, 2018) would soon watch as the berlin wall crumbled and the soviet union dissolved, ending a decades-long cold war. but he also spearheaded an international military strike against saddam hussein after the iraqi dictator invaded neighboring kuwait. born in 1924, the second-oldest son of investment banker and future connecticut senator prescott bush, he served as the navy's youngest pilot during world war ii, and was shot down in the pacific over the island of chichi jima. after marrying barbara pierce, he became an oil man in texas before entering politics. a congressman, rnc chairman, united nations ambassador, envoy to china and cia director, bush would become vice president under ronald reagan before succeeding him in office. [he would also become only the second u.s. president to see his own son become a president himself.] following the gulf war, in 1991, president bush's approval rating was nearly 90%. and yet, the following year he lost his re-election bid to bill clinton, owing to his having broken his 1988 campaign mantra: read my lips: no new taxes.

galt macdermot martha swope, new york public library/billy rose theatre division; cbs news; rca records canadian-born composer galt macdermot (december 18, 1928-december 17, 2018), who had studied african music in cape town and won a grammy, was enlisted by gerome ragni and james rado to write the music for their irreverent stage show replete with drug use, profanity, and a racially diverse cast, called hair. in those days, there was a broadway style of singing that we didn't want to use, macdermot told sunday morning in 2009. so jim and gerry used to go out and look for people who weren't trained, but just had natural talent. macdermot would win a grammy for his score, which included aquarius, good morning starshine, easy to be hard and the title song – memorable blends of rock and funk. the '60s, when we were doing it, was a wonderful time for american music, macdermot said. that's when rock and roll reached its peak, really. so i was influenced by everything i heard. and everything i heard, i liked. play excerpt: hair macdermot's other credits would include the stage shows two gentlemen of verona, dude, and the human comedy, and the films cotton comes to harlem and mistress.

even with his record fundraising, harrison's campaign warned it needed to raise $10 million in the 12 days before the election to beat graham. in a memo wednesday, his campaign manager zack carroll wrote our campaign woke up the republican giant. carroll pointed out majority leader mitch mcconnell's super pac raised $92 million in september and is already spending to try and stop harrison. too many pundits don't understand what we are up against and have said the senate campaigns like ours don't need to keep fundraising, it read. but the fact is that unless our fundraising surges in the final 12 days, we will not be able to match mitch mcconnell jeopardizing our path to victory. on tuesday, republican super pac the senate leadership fund reported it had more than $113 million cash on hand heading into october, even as republican candidates were being outraised by democratic challengers. it still had nearly $70 million to burn as of october 14. democrats' senate majority pac had less than $20 million october 14 and had raised more than $100 million less than what the senate leadership fund brought in across 2020. other senate democrats are also now at a cash disadvantage in the final stretch despite outraising gop incumbents by millions.
in rose garden remarks at the white house friday, mr. trump called his plan to bring soaring drug prices back down to earth the most sweeping action in history to lower the price of prescription drugs for the american people. but it does not include his campaign pledge to use the massive buying power of the government's medicare program to directly negotiate lower prices for seniors. that idea has long been supported by democrats but is a non-starter for drugmakers and most republicans in congress. democratic rep. lloyd doggett of texas dismissed mr. trump's plan as a sugar-coated nothing pill.
if you're going to a convention, you either support or don't go at all, trump said.

former pennsylvania governor tom ridge, a republican, today called for pennsylvania counties to be allowed to pre-canvass mail ballots ahead of election day. this follows a june primary where a surge in mail-in voting led to counties counting ballots over a week after election day, and the leading candidate in 10 down ballot races changing after election night.
ed wong: i think that the trade war with china is the main sort of question that looms over all of this. and they have that sort of ninety-day grace period in which the president said he wouldn't raise tariffs. and they're-- in theory, they're supposed to negotiate during that period. but i've heard that within the white house, people like peter navarro are still very much entrenched in their view and that they-- they're hoping to ride out the ninety days and keep the tariffs on. so, i think that will lead to more unsteady movement in the markets and also i think the shutdown that we talked about earlier will also shake up the markets, and i think that the republicans have to be thinking about that.

it is of course about getting a cure and treatment, that's a lot in this plan, about getting us there by 2025 and investing, but it's also about the caregivers, said klobuchar.
in 2016, many republicans decided that, if they're going to get called bigots and haters anyway, why not back a politician who would at least fight back on their behalf. if every argument is going to be reduced to identity politics — you can't possibly oppose obamacare based on math, you must hate it because of obama's race, you republican bigots — then these voters have found a politician with whom they can truly identify.

the president's announcement of his intent to nominate barrett to the supreme court officially kicked off what is likely to be a swift and highly contentious confirmation process, as mr. trump has urged the senate to confirm barrett before the november presidential election. among democrats' issues with barrett are her views on roe v. wade, the 1973 supreme court decision that established a woman's right to an abortion, and the affordable care act, which is being challenged in a case that will be heard by the justices on november 10.
trump: justice scalia, great judge, died recently. and we have a vacancy. i am looking to appoint judges very much in the mold of justice scalia. i'm looking for judges — and i've actually picked 20 of them so that people would see, highly respected, highly thought of, and actually very beautifully reviewed by just about everybody.
speaker nancy pelosi: but when you get to have numbers and you wanna be-- run for leader, then that's a different story. then they're, like, why are they all gathering in the well? they all have the same color on today. what are they up to?
the report is an aspirational document like the rest of ryan's better way agenda, a six-topic blueprint that the speaker has been rolling out this month at carefully choreographed events that have been getting largely overshadowed by the latest donald trump campaign controversy. ryan was to present his health care proposals alongside several house committee chairmen wednesday afternoon at the american enterprise institute, and a tax plan was coming friday.
until recently, chip was an extremely popular bipartisan program that covers children whose families earn too much to qualify for medicare, but not enough to afford private insurance for their children. congress failed to reauthorize funding for the program, which was launched in 1997, after it officially expired on sept. 30 last year. a key problem: disagreements last year in the house about how to pay for the program. republicans wanted cuts in obamacare and medicare, while democrats were opposed.
at issue in the case is the individual mandate, which requires people to have health insurance. the penalty for not having insurance was dropped to $0 in the most recent tax legislation, potentially undercutting the supreme court's decision in 2012 that the affordable care act was constitutional because of congress' ability to tax.
we must not be afraid to define our enemy. it is islamic extremist terrorism. i did not say all of islamic. i did not say most of islam. i said islamic extremist terrorism, he said. you know who you are. we're coming to get you!

joe biden: look, this administration is incapable of learning in elections. they like this. come on. let's be fair here. they've known this for a long time, for three years. every intelligence agency has told them they continue to be engaged in this activity. every intelligence agency told me they were engaged before. there is not any question anymore. there's never been a question for the last three years. and what's he doing? zero. what is the republican leadership in the united states senate and congress doing? zero.
earlier in his career, ryan was an advocate for partially privatizing social security by allowing younger retirees to steer a portion of their payroll taxes into retirement accounts. that idea cratered in 2005 despite a determined push by president george w. bush.
i disagree that there was any hesitancy or pause last time, mcgahn said when pressed on why barrett was passed over for the supreme court in 2018. she was a relatively new federal judge. she was placed on a short list. the public found out about the short list because it was publicly announced, so the process has really been transparent. recall the president, even as a candidate, put out not one, but two lists of judges who could be on the supreme court. he's updated it a few times since. so i think that at the time, brett kavanaugh was the right person at the right time. and i think judge amy barrett is the right person at the right time now.
but we begin with president-elect trump, whom we interviewed friday in his penthouse home in the trump tower.

biden: the white house is shedding light. the president is angry because the intelligence community, in fact, informed bernie sanders and i guess others and members of the intelligence committee that, in fact, the russians want to see trump reelected. and they like bernie.
president trump won this district, which is considered solidly republican, by a slim 1.5 percent in 2016. in contrast, mitt romney won it by 23 points.

hardiman has an appealing life story -- the first person in his family to go to college, he attended the university of notre dame as an undergraduate and then later financed his law degree at the georgetown university by driving a taxi. if confirmed, hardiman would be the only justice on the court who did not attend harvard or yale law school.

paul ryan: my point is this is ridiculous.
biden told them the trump administration lawsuit seems to me to be close to cruel and then agreed with one of the attendees that it is also unconscionable. in 18 minutes of remarks afterward, biden whittled into president trump for his twin legacies of failure to protect from covid-19 while fighting his crusade to do away with the aca. the former vice president said the president was acting like a child in terms of his covid-19 response, focusing more on how testing rates make him look rather than focusing on help to those impacted by the virus. biden reiterated his support to try to implement a public option in addition to obamacare coverage if elected, which would offer medicare-like plans to those wanting better coverage outside of employee-based healthcare.
the republican/trump, in contrast, sees a college degree as more of a privilege conferred through stricter accountability that will involve private banks in lending, which is unlikely to lower the total cost of a degree.

there is no sign that the liberals who've spent decades demeaning the character of their political opponents are prepared to stop. it should come as no surprise that their request that the targets of their attacks unilaterally disarm is met with derision and seen as self-serving, disingenuous, and, alas, futile.

he often called for improvements to the affordable care act, president obama's signature domestic policy achievement. during and after his senate campaign, o'rourke made immigration a central issue. he has routinely denounced the white house for its hardline immigration agenda, including the discontinued zero tolerance policy that led to the separation of thousands of migrant families near the u.s.-mexico border. he also strongly supports legislation to put young undocumented immigrants, known as dreamers, on a pathway to u.s. citizenship. during a fiery speech in el paso last month where he drew sharp contrasts with president trump's stringent policies and tough rhetoric on immigration, o'rourke condemned mr. turmp's long-promised wall along the southwestern border. we know that walls do not save lives. walls end lives, he said in a border rally that competed with one of mr. trump's nearby rallies. in the last 10 years, more than 4,000 children women and men have died trying to come to this country to work jobs that no one will take, to be with a family member, to flee horrific violence, brutality and death. controversy in addition to the scrutiny o'rourke will likely face for launching a presidential campaign a few months after losing a senate race, the texas democrat can expect to be questioned by political rivals about his tenure in congress and personal life. although he had a generally liberal voting record in congress, o'rourke's progressive bona fides may come under scrutiny from the left.

at least two left-leaning super pacs are wading into an already bitter gop primary in new mexico's second congressional district, as republicans decide on a nominee to challenge vulnerable freshman democratic congresswoman xochitl torres-small. patriot majority pac, a group organized by democratic political strategist craig varoga, has spent nearly $200,000 on ads in the race per kantar/cmag data. the political arm of emily's list has reportedly sent mailers to voters in the district. though the groups reported their expenditures to the fec as opposing gop candidates yvette herrell and claire chase, the ads paint herrell as more loyal to president trump than chase — a charge chase's campaign has denied, calling on republicans to condemn these pelosi allies for meddling in favor of a deeply flawed general election candidate. in a statement to cbs news campaign reporter alex tin, herrell said, liberal super pacs have no business getting involved in this primary and they should stop immediately.

donald trump: i think it's horrible if that's happening. i think it's built up by the press because, frankly, they'll take every single little incident that they can find in this country, which could've been there before. if i weren't even around doing this, and they'll make into an event because that's the way the press is.

cbs news campaign reporter lacrai mitchell reports that congresswoman val demings of florida joined the state's democratic party during a virtual press conference on tuesday to call out the trump administration's handling of the coronavirus pandemic. the press conference came one day ahead of pence's upcoming visit to orlando, where he's scheduled to pass out personal protective equipment to nursing homes — a move that the fldp chair terrie rizzo called too little, too late. demings called the move another smoke and mirrors moment where the administration wants to distract voters. the president and the vice president want you to take your eyes off the real conditions on the ground: pay no attention to the number of people who have died, pay no attention to the number of people who are sick, ignore the fact that this country's numbers continue to increase, demings said during the virtual gathering. we have had the worst response in the world compared to other industrialized countries. demings added that while the president isn't responsible for covid-19, we would be in a much different place today if his administration had heeded to earlier warnings from public health experts and scientists. earlier this month, presumptive nominee biden said demings was one of a group of women being considered as one of his vice presidential picks. and the former democratic house manager in the impeachment trial of mr. trump has said herself that she would be honored to serve as vp.

when unitedhealth (unh), the nation's largest health insurer, announced earlier this month that it would exit the affordable care act exchange business in all but three states, the obvious question was, who's next? after all, if the nation's biggest health carrier can't make the obamacare exchanges profitable, who can? unitedhealth announced it expects to lose $650 million on its aca business in 2016, although its first-quarter earnings beat analyst expectations, thanks to the company's highly profitable consulting and technology businesses.

biden: which we know nothing about. look, i opposed the surge in the first place. number one, i didn't think we should have even the troops we sent there. now, it's all been made public now that we should have the troops in the first place that we sent there. and i didn't think we should have had the number of troops, which is considerably less than the present- this- this president added. i think we should only have troops there to make sure that it's impossible for the taliban and excuse me- for isis or al-qaeda to reestablish a foothold there, to be able to go from afghanistan to the united states to attack the united states. that requires a much smaller footprint. but as i understand it, we're not drawing down to a level that was even as low as it was when we left afghanistan.

americans in general—and the blue-collar voters in rust belt states who voted obama in 2008 and trump in 2016 in particular--have a credible case that their confidence in the system and its two parties was misplaced. they voted for change in 2008. the one major change, obamacare, was unpopular (its polls were underwater the entire obama presidency) and poorly implemented. voters voted for change again in 2010 and again in 2014, but generally got more of the same.

the white house has said his proposal to provide a pathway to citizenship to immigrants brought to the u.s. illegally as children by their parents amounts to 1.8 million. if that figure is correct -- and it's virtually impossible to say if it is -- then mr. trump's claim is true.
you know, when we have a world where you have isis chopping off heads, where you have — and, frankly, drowning people in steel cages, where you have wars and horrible, horrible sights all over, where you have so many bad things happening, this is like medieval times. we haven't seen anything like this, the carnage all over the world.
on friday afternoon, joe biden delivered an economic address responding to the newest unemployment stats via the progressive news platform nowthis. he started by wearing a face mask, seemingly a symbolic gesture as he was inside his delaware home, cbs news campaign reporter bo erickson reports. at the top of the speech, biden proceeded to take off the mask off and criticized president trump's handling of both the public health and economic response to the pandemic. biden said the economy is all made worse because it didn't have to be this way. donald trump utterly failed to prepare us for this pandemic and delayed taking the necessary steps to safeguard us from the near worse-case economic scenario we are now living. biden also inserted some barbs toward mr. trump, saying that after the pandemic, the economy will need to work for everyone and ensure everyone gets a fair shot, not just the mar-a-lago crowd. biden also said trump-onomics means no strings and no oversight during the pandemic financial assistance. the presumptive democratic nominee said he would be releasing in a few weeks a full plan to revive the economy, and on friday, he repeated stump speech objectives about the middle class being the backbone of america.
margaret brennan: so that was a yes? that your health care plan would cover--
senator bernie sanders: well, i think that's a decision for the vice president to make. i'm not sure that one incident alone disqualifies anybody but her point is absolutely right. this is an issue not just the democrats or republicans the entire country has got to take seriously. it is not acceptable that when a woman goes to work or is in any kind of environment that she feels anything less than comfortable and safe. and this is an issue the entire country has got to work on.
anthony salvanto: but right, life sometimes gets in the way-- in the way.
margaret brennan: --starting from scratch with a new law?

i want to have a tax on people who are making a million dollars. it's called the buffett rule. yes, warren buffett is the one who's gone out and said somebody like him should not be paying a lower tax rate than his secretary. i want to have a surcharge on incomes above $5 million.
in 2016, she defeated rep. loretta sanchez, also a democrat, in a landslide and became the first woman of color to represent california in the senate. during her two years on capitol hill, harris has solidified herself as a leading critic of the trump administration, known for her fierce questioning as a member of the judiciary and homeland security and governmental affairs committees. harris announced her presidential candidacy on martin luther king jr. day, jan. 21, 2019. key issues in her short tenure in the senate, harris has compiled a liberal voting record and has overwhelmingly voted against president trump's nominees for cabinet-level and other administration positions. along with her tough, prosecutorial cross examinations during committee sessions, harris has advocated for criminal justice and immigration reform and has contrasted her platform with mr. trump's agenda. although she opposed the legalization of recreational marijuana during her law enforcement career in california, harris announced her support for the marijuana justice act crafted by sen. cory booker, d-new jersey. the bill would remove marijuana from the 1970 controlled substances act, withhold federal funding for states which continue to criminalize the substance, require courts to expunge convictions for marijuana use or possession and establish a federal fund to help low-income communities affected by the so-called war on drugs. in october, harris unveiled new tax legislation aimed at the middle class to give families up to $6,000 a year in refundable tax credits, which she will likely highlight on the 2020 campaign trail.
that leaves the president with few options. he could compromise with them — one of democratic leader nancy pelosi's aides said mr. trump expressed to her that he liked her message of bipartisanship in her victory speech tuesday. republican sen. lindsey graham said he thinks legislation on prison reform and infrastructure has a good chance of passing. mr. trump himself mentioned infrastructure and drug pricing in a press conference that was quite laudatory of pelosi, a stark contrast from his caustic words on the campaign trail.
margaret brennan: but mister biden's push to end the pandemic will likely be disrupted by mutating strains of the virus now spreading in the u.s. another roadblock: he's having a tough time selling his nearly two-trillion-dollar package of economic aid to congress. even to some members of his own party.
morrisey, who has been endorsed by president trump, signed onto the lawsuit in february. the lawsuit consists of 19 other gop attorneys general, including mccaskill's challenger, missouri attorney general josh hawley. morrisey's campaign has largely been focused on pressuring manchin to support supreme court justice nominee brett kavanaugh. but in response to today's ad, morrisey's campaign released a statement criticizing manchin's national rifle association (nra) rating and accusing manchin of siding with washington liberals on health care.
instead, last year's bill managed to cut tax rates by adding $1.4 trillion to the deficit and through gimmicks like making many of the tax cuts expire in just a few years.
margaret brennan: i want to quickly ask you about a sexual harassment bill that you have been a- a key voice on. but to answer the criticism from the white house, don't democrats need to show some flexibility to avoid the shutdown?
the outlook for additional stimulus spending after president-elect biden is inaugurated on january 20 will depend on whether republicans retain control of the senate. if democrats don't succeed in the january 5 runoffs for two georgia senate seats, the republicans will maintain control, making it less likely that a president biden could pass and sign a major stimulus effort.
margaret brennan: when he says the ugly stuff, may be because of the russians. sounds like you're saying no.
president donald trump: that's right. we have turned--
small business coverage. this siphoning effect may hit small business owners and employees particularly hard, said john arensmeyer, ceo of the small business majority, a liberal advocacy organization. the trump administration estimated that as many as 1.6 million people will purchase short-term plans by 2022. arensmeyer predicted nearly all of these people will be younger and healthier. small businesses have come to rely on the exchanges, he explained. when you create an unbalanced risk pool that can destabilize the exchanges, and so small business owners and employees will have to pay more for comprehensive plans or be tempted to buy cheaper plans with inadequate coverage, arensmeyer said.
a recent analysis by moody's analytics estimates that trump's economic policies might spark a recession, while clinton's policies might boost gdp and lower unemployment. moody's, which has been monitoring and analyzing credit risk for over a century, can hardly be considered part of the liberal media that supposedly opposes trump.
but it's on the question of materiality that we feel really that a crime cannot be established here because there was not, in our view, a legitimate investigation going on. they did not have a basis for a counterintelligence investigation against flynn at that stage, based on a perfectly legitimate and appropriate call he made as a member of the transition. so.
at this late stage, it's no longer about persuading people on the fence. campaigns should be focused on getting the converted to their polling places. for democrats, the message is simple: we are better than this.
yes, there's anger that his appointments aren't being held to a 60-vote standard, but that wasn't trump's doing—that was democratic senator harry reid. as majority leader in 2013, he took one of those democracy's in peril! actions and invoked the so-called nuclear option of using a simple majority to change senate rules on presidential appointments. while it's true that he didn't extend the rule at the time to supreme court picks, it's also true that obama never had such a pick under the reid rule until after the gop had taken control of the senate.
in an economist/yougov survey also released on wednesday, 42 percent of registered voters said they approve of the job mr. trump is doing as president, while 53 percent said they disapprove.
there are children suffering in this catastrophic war, largely, i believe, because of russian aggression. and we need to do our part. we by no means are carrying anywhere near the load that europe and others are. but we will have vetting that is as tough as it needs to be from our professionals, our intelligence experts and others.
while mr. obama and haley were seemingly in agreement that the nation should reject divisive rhetoric, the president on tuesday night took aim at the entire gop -- not just its controversial front runner.
president donald trump, who has repeatedly complained about the fed moving to hike rates, renewed the attack monday. he said in a tweet: it is incredible that with a very strong dollar and virtually no inflation, the outside world blowing up around us, paris is burning and china way down, the fed is even considering yet another interest rate hike. take the victory!
we are going to start winning for our country, trump told supporters at his campaign headquarters in spartanburg. i was watching upstairs and it was really amazing to be watching what i was watching. some of the pundits said 'well, if trump and the other candidates dropped out - if you add them together, they'll equal trump.' they don't understand -- as they drop out, i'm gonna get a lot of those votes also.
margaret brennan: ed, i want to ask you, we saw a rare very open crack between the entirety really of the republican party and democrats on capitol hill breaking from the president's defense of mohammed bin salman, the crown prince of saudi arabia, and having this symbolic resolution, but still a statement saying, they believe the cia even if the president doesn't, in terms of culpability for the killing of this journalist, jamal khashoggi. is this just symbolic? does this indicate some sort of shift at all with the party?
while the justice department said it would allow congressional leaders and selects staff to see unredacted versions of the report, it would not disclose the grand jury documents, as rules governing those proceedings dictate that matters occurring before a grand jury must remain secret.
john dickerson: i- i want to see if i can get your reaction to something that the trump campaign has run. it's an ad they're running right now in the middle of these negotiations, where everybody is thinking the other side has bad faith. let's watch a little bit of it. i want to get your reaction about how this affects things.
indeed, gorsuch has publicly criticized the widely held notion that judges often demonstrate political partisanship in their judicial decisions.
is congress a mess? of course it is. it's congress. that's not trump's fault. and americans will be free to put a new group of people in charge of that mess this november, right on schedule.
the commonwealth survey and other research consistently shows that people don't try to sign up for insurance because they believe they can't find an affordable plan, collins explained. but for now at least, the health insurance exchanges are still in place and in most states are relatively stable, she added. while the mandate may have been eliminated, premium subsidies are still available to eligible consumers.
the individual penalty of $695 is still in effect for the uninsured in 2018. the mandate dies in 2019. -- maggie dore
he points to vice president mike pence's approval of a similar expansion when he was governor of indiana.
in one sense, the supreme court's immediate future could look a lot like the term that just ended. roberts seemed firmly in control of a court that overwhelmingly went conservative in divided cases, including upholding president trump's travel ban, striking a blow at public-sector labor unions, limiting workers' rights to band together to complain about pay and affirming ohio's aggressive efforts to purge its voting rolls.
senator rick scott: look, i-- i want to listen to everybody's ideas. i have sat down with the pharmaceutical companies, the pbms, the insurance companies, the hospital industry, the pharmacies to ask them their ideas. i-- i think the best way of doing this is discuss everybody's ideas and see what we can do.
margaret brennan: and the governor has not responded, i assume, to your requests?
the administration will pursue a raft of old and new measures intended to improve competition and transparency in the notoriously complex drug pricing system. but most of the measures could take months or years to implement, and none would stop drugmakers from setting sky-high initial prices. mr. trump said his administration will begin work immediately, although there is no timeline for implementing his proposals.

jay inslee jay inslee announces 2020 presidential bid 00:36 biography born and raised in seattle, inslee received a bachelor's degree in economics from the university of washington in 1973 and a j.d. from willamette university college of law in oregon three years later. after working in private law for more than a decade, he successfully ran for a seat in the washington house of representatives, where he served for four years until his successful bid for congress in 1992. inslee represented the state's 4th congressional district for one term until his reelection bid was thwarted during the so-called republican revolution of 1994. during the following years, he unsuccessfully ran for governor and served as a regional department of health and human services (hhs) director under president clinton. inslee ran for congress again in 1998 and defeated a republican incumbent in washington's 1st congressional district, which he went on to represent for nearly 12 years. during his congressional tenure, the washington lawmaker was a vocal critic of the war in iraq and an early proponent of federal initiatives to reduce greenhouse gases and the american economy's reliance on fossil fuels. inslee left congress in 2012 to launch his ultimately successful bid to be governor in washington, defeating the state's republican attorney general in the general election. after winning reelection in november 2016 -- the same time mr. trump unexpectedly won the presidency -- inslee declared that washington was, is and will always be a beacon for progressive values.

senior officials also expressed confidence that if zients and others can fix the web site by the end of november the white house will be able to quell calls from some senate democrats to extend the enrollment period for obtaining insurance. sen. jeanne shaheen, d-n.h., is currently leading those efforts.
in a politically significant change, the bill would provide health insurance tax credits to people with solid middle-class incomes who don't now qualify for help with their premiums. that's a demographic that includes many self-employed people and business owners who were hit with higher premiums as a result of the aca, but cut out of the benefits. their complaints fueled republican opposition to the health law. these are the people trump was responding to, said laszewski.
if max boot wants the gop destroyed, in one sense he's already gotten his wish. the republican party and its establishment were blown up by donald trump and his populist candidacy that overran the party itself. (much as bernie sanders would have done to the democrats without intervention from the democratic national committee.)
the math is not favorable to the democrats. they have very vulnerable incumbents in other states, to be able to flip this seat would be a big deal for them in trying to take over the senate. there are going to be tremendous resources spent here. -- jon ralston, editor of the nevada independent

also on thursday vice president mike pence rolled onto the stage during his visit to ohio's lordstown motors plant riding in the passenger seat of a pickup truck. during his remarks, cbs news campaign reporter musadiq bidar reports pence touted the administration's economic success before the coronavirus pandemic. citing low unemployment numbers among black and hispanic communities, the vice president declared the american dream came roaring back under president trump. our economy was on a roll, pence said while also reassuring the crowd that the recovery is on and lordstown motors will be a part of the great american comeback.
janice jackson: right now we're anticipating seventy-seven thousand students, which is roughly a third of the students here in cps that are eligible for in-person instruction. that's twice the size of the second largest school district here in illinois. and so reopening chicago public schools is extremely important. we should also note that private and parochial schools in the city have been open since august, and we learned a lot from their implementation plans and look to guidance from public health officials, as well as the cdc to make sure we had a solid plan for reopening.
while mr. obama said he apologizes for the poor obamacare rollout, he said, i make no apologies for us taking this on, because somebody sooner or later had to do it... we've got to move forward on this. it took 100 years for us to even get to the point where we could start talking about and implementing a law to make sure everybody's got health insurance. and my pledge to the american people is, is that we're going to solve the problems that are there, we're going to get it right, and the affordable care act is going to work for the american people.

while the clinton proposals won't cover room and board or addresses poor graduation rates, they provide tangible relief for middle- and lower-income families. it's far from perfect, but it in effect restores public college subsidies that have been dramatically eroded in recent years.
senator rick scott: i grew up in a very poor family. i watched my mom cry that she couldn't get health care for my brother.
many health care advocates are applauding the news, but others worry that even this seemingly large increase in funding isn't nearly enough. according to some estimates, opioid abuse costs the country as much as $80 billion a year. what's more, proposed cutbacks in medicaid funding would potentially adversely affect opioid treatment for low-income people.
senator rick scott: --and running all of health care has never worked. it's not going to work. we're going-- we're going to ruin the entire system. let's focus on the problem we have. the problem is not access the problem is the cost of health care and the unbelievable inflation we've seen. let's start with drug prices.

with little more than four months to go until the midterm elections, president trump is hitting the road this week, traveling to south carolina, north dakota, and wisconsin. sunday's event in nevada offered a solid preview of what's to come. on saturday, mr. trump headlined a campaign rally, where he praised incumbent sen. dean heller, r-nevada, while dubbing his opponent jacky rosen wacky jacky. he also continued to focus on immigration, despite a week of turbulence and criticism of his administration's policy of separating children from their families at the border; and he boasted that he has gutted obamacare.
joe biden: you said it, my firewall.
trump campaign surrogate congressman dr. brad wenstrup told cbs news campaign reporter nicole sganga wednesday that he supports the cdc guidelines on mask-wearing. i think the advice that has been given throughout, from the cdc has been, has been wise, wenstrup said. the congressman said he feels the country should be focused on physical distancing and six to eight feet of separation when we did not have masks. the president's re-election bid does not typically enforce social distancing at campaign rallies but offers optional masks to attendees upon entrance to events.

warren was re-elected in 2018, and announced an exploratory committee for a presidential run dec. 31. warren and her second husband, bruce mann, have been married for 38 years and have three grandchildren. they live in cambridge, massachusetts with their golden retriever, bailey, who came to her first press conference as a presidential contender. key issues warren has built a national brand as an economic populist and an anti-wall street crusader. the 69-year-old senator serves on the senate committee on banking, housing, and urban affairs committee and the health, education, labor, and pensions committee in the senate, and has also taken on her own party on issues she cares about. in one instance, she helped to derail then-president obama's nomination of investment banker antonio weiss to a top position at the treasury department in 2015. fixing a rigged economy figures to be central issue of her presidential campaign. i've spent my career getting to the bottom of why america's promise works for some families, but others who work just as hard slip through the cracks into disaster, warren said in a video announcing her presidential exploratory committee. what i found is terrifying. these aren't cracks that families are falling into. they're traps. america's middle class is under attack. how do we get here? billionaires and big corporations decided they wanted more of the pie and they enlisted politicians to cut them a fatter slice.
the study found that lower-income people, older adults, and people living in high-cost areas would get lower subsidies. i'm worried that this is going to result in folks losing coverage, said john meigs, president of the american academy of family physicians.

senator rick scott: well i know-- i know-- i know in the end the white house is going to have to have their plan and i know it's going to be difficult with nancy pelosi. but what i'm going to focus on is how do you drive down costs? the democrats constantly focus on access. the problem is the cost of health care is too high in this country. that's why i put a bill out this week that requires transparency at the pharmacy, at the-- with the insurance companies and says we're not going to allow pharmaceutical companies to charge us more than what they charge in europe.
navarro says bloomberg sees a chance for democrats to flip the state if we nominate somebody who makes winning here a top priority.

lanhee chen: good point. good point there. because-- because-- because then that will give the american people some comfort about what's actually going on. i do think there is confusion right now. there is no question that there is confusion right now.
but roberts has also helped deliver rulings this term deemed to be victories for conservatives. he was in the 7-2 majority of a decision upholding the trump administration's broad exemptions to employers who raise religious and moral objections to obamacare's contraceptive mandate, as well as in a 7-2 ruling that found federal employment laws don't apply to teachers at religious schools whose duties include religious education.
senator chris van hollen: well, i heard from more than fifty of my constituents. women who had experienced sexual assault, sexual trauma years ago and had never told their own parents at the time. in many cases had not told-- told members of their families today. and it was a powerful reminder of the progress we need to make in this country when it comes to sexual assault. so, when you have the president of the united states at big rallies belittling doctor ford, he is belittling all those survivors of sexual assault. and i don't think people like what they see.
joe biden: yes, a very small presence to be able to determine whether or not, i mean, a small footprint--
clinton: thank you. well, you're right. this is one of the most important issues in this election. i want to appoint supreme court justices who understand the way the world really works, who have real-life experience, who have not just been in a big law firm and maybe clerked for a judge and then gotten on the bench, but, you know, maybe they tried some more cases, they actually understand what people are up against.
we lost the trust of the american people when some republicans gave into the temptations of corruption, mccain said when accepting his party's nomination at that year's convention. he said his party had lost its way and was part of the country's problem. we came to power to change washington and washington changed us, he told face the nation in september 2008.

janice jackson: yeah, so in chicago and in illinois, we are prioritizing teachers. they are included in 1b, which is currently underway. i think the issue is definitely around vaccine supply. the more vaccines we're able to get, we'll be able to vaccinate people sooner. we have started vaccinating individuals in our school system, which is important to note. we started with our health care workers and those individuals who work closely with students where they may be at more risk for exposure. but, again, in order to accelerate vaccination of our teachers, we, quite frankly, need more supply.

so, instead of saying no to open up a new enrollment period, he [president] should be saying no to his case before the supreme court, which is very, very harmful in normal times and in these extraordinary times, very destructive, pelosi said.
margaret brennan: do you have a benchmark infection rate where you'd shut down?
sixteen years later, the gop's tax cut failed to receive a single democratic vote in the house or senate.
margaret brennan: clearly, the white house is going to have to weigh in, and the white house acting chief of staff mick mulvaney was on other television programs this morning saying he can promise no one will be left without health care if obamacare is struck down. but as you've just said there is no plan yet. so how can you promise that-- like a state like yours where it has the most people reliant on obamacare of any state--how can you promise them they won't be left hanging?
tens of thousands of voters in montgomery county, pennsylvania, likely received faulty supplemental instructions for filling out their mail-in ballots, according to the official in charge of elections in the county. although the instructions printed on the ballots themselves were correct, the ones printed on a separate sheet of paper incorrectly directed voters to fill in bubbles to the left, rather than the right, of the names of candidates for whom they wish to vote. as a result, a voter following the supplemental instructions and not the correct ones would fill in bubbles for presidential or state attorney general and auditor general candidates when trying to cast their votes for delegates. lee soltysiak, the chief operating officer and clerk for montgomery county, told cbs news campaign reporter zak hudak in a statement that the county became aware of the mistake may 14 and corrected the supplemental instructions sent with all ballots since then. soltysiak said he did not think voters would make mistakes on their ballots because of the incorrect directions. since the instructions are correct on the ballot itself, and many candidates do not have an oval to their left on the ballot, we do not believe this will have an impact on how people will mark their ballots or our ability to accurately count their vote, he said. the supplemental instructions also contradicted the ones on the ballots themselves with regard to what color ink voters should use to fill in the bubbles.
health care ... people want to make sure they can take their kids to the doctor, said ted pappageorge, president of the culinary workers union local 226.
donald trump: what we are going to do is get the people that are criminal and have criminal records, gang members, drug dealers, we have a lot of these people, probably two million, it could be even three million, we are getting them out of our country or we are going to incarcerate. but we're getting them out of our country, they're here illegally. after the border is secured and after everything gets normalized, we're going to make a determination on the people that you're talking about who are terrific people, they're terrific people but we are gonna make a determination at that-- but before we make that determination-- lesley, it's very important, we want to secure our border.

pressure is mounting on congress to pass an emergency package to fund the fight against the zika virus before this summer's mosquitoes really start to bite. several funding packages have been proposed, but not even a health emergency can easily bridge the bitter partisan divide in the u.s. legislature.

trump: and my whole concept was to make america great again. when i watch the deals being made, when i watch what's happening with some horrible things like obamacare, where your health insurance and health care is going up by numbers that are astronomical, 68 percent, 59 percent, 71 percent, when i look at the iran deal and how bad a deal it is for us, it's a one-sided transaction where we're giving back $150 billion to a terrorist state, really, the number one terror state, we've made them a strong country from really a very weak country just three years ago.

i don't really have a label that i can put on myself, kethledge said at the time. what i would say is that obviously first and foremost i'd follow supreme court precedent. the other thing i would say is that again, i would make sure that the values that i would be enforcing if i were a judge are not just my values. i'm not striking something down simply because i don't like it. that is a counter-majoritarian aspect of our system of government. i would start with the text.
biden: i told you, i'm not going to play this game with you. i don't know. it's not about who i stop. it's why i'm running, why i'm telling the people that i should be the next president and why i'm the best guy to beat trump. all those other polls you all cite also show i'm the most person- i'm the- the person most likely to be trump. i'm the person that, in fact, in- in those polls in addition to that, i'm the only one, in terms of the russians and all these stuff you've all been reporting. the russians don't want me to be the nominee. they spent a lot of money on bots on facebook and they've been taken down saying biden is a bad guy. they don't want biden running. they're not- no one's helping me to try to get the nomination. they have good reason.

john dickerson: --the confirmation process. and then you said they were-- their statements were reminders of-- of how our society has let down survivors of sexual assault for decades. have you heard from or what have you heard from constituents in the wake of the confirmation?
anthony salvanto: well, enthusiasm is one of those factors. it's mixed in to what you just described. people who really mean to vote but maybe something gets in the way. maybe enthusiasm helps you get over that hurdle. but, really, i want to say that enthusiasm is not the same thing as voting which you want to look at is that intent to vote. look, you can only push that lever so hard. you can push it enthusiastically or you can just kind of give it a click, it's still one vote. but what you want to look at is whether that enthusiasm then drives people across that finish line, actually gets them there.
no, you know, i don't have a view on that. i don't know about how close they were physically or what the medical advice is the president gets. but we're tested pretty regularly when we're over at the white house to visit.
on the other hand, trump doesn't object to pence's support for the iraq war, although he slams hillary clinton for her vote for the war.
mcconnell told reporters on tuesday most of the things we'll be doing will be on a bipartisan basis, but he did not elaborate on where president trump still stood on pending immigration policies.
donald trump: it's a great form of communication. now, do i say i'll give it up entirely and throw out, that's a tremendous form-- i pick up-- i'm picking up now, i think i picked up yesterday 100,000 people. i'm not saying i love it, but it does get the word out. when you give me a bad story or when you give me an inaccurate story or when somebody other than you and another network, or whatever, 'cause of course, cbs would never do a thing like that right? i have a method of fighting back. that's very tough--
anthony salvanto: well, one factor you want to watch is the president. and, you know, we are on pace now for the president to be a factor in people's voting, really, would be historic levels. so, typically, a majority, maybe a slight majority of people who voted midterms say that the president is a factor in their vote either for or against. but this year we've got many more voters saying that they feel like the president is a factor. either for or against, in fact, it's relatively split. but there's no question that he is on the ballot so to speak or at least in the minds of voters when they are going to the polls this year.
they could have made the shutdown in 2013 much less impactful, but they chose to make it worse, he said.
biden: i don't know. i'll let you make that judgment.

i'm looking for something that president trump supports, and he's not yet indicated what measure he's willing to sign, he said. as soon as we figure out what he is for, then i would be convinced that we are not just spinning our wheels to this issue on the floor, but actually dealing with a bill that has a chance to become law and therefore solve the problem.

notable political figures have reacted to the death of george floyd, a black man who was killed monday afternoon by a minneapolis police officer who pressed his knee on floyd's neck, reports cbs news political unit broadcast associate aaron navarro. my stomach hurts. my neck hurts. everything hurts. … (i need) water or something. please. please. i can't breathe, officer. … i cannot breathe. i cannot breathe, floyd is heard saying in the video, a scene that echoes the police killing of eric garner in 2012 and is reminiscent of memories from the police shooting death of philando castile in 2016, which took place in nearby falcon heights, minnesota. police say that floyd was not armed, and was involved in a forgery in progress. congresswoman ilhan omar, who represents minneapolis, tweeted, we can't excuse summary executions in america. we just can't! minnesota governor tim walz said, the lack of humanity in this disturbing video is sickening. we will get answers and seek justice. minneapolis police chief medaria arradondo tuesday said at a press conference that the fbi will lead the investigation into the incident due to the possible civil rights violation. arradondo and minneapolis mayor jacob frey also announced that the four officers involved have been terminated following floyd's death. in a statement, minnesota's senator amy klobuchar said floyd's death was yet another horrifying and gutwrenching instance of an african american man dying and called for a complete and thorough investigation.
a lot of presidents' budgets are ignored. but i would expect this one to be completely irrelevant and totally ignored, said jason furman, a top economic adviser to president barack obama. in fact, congress passed a law week that basically undid the budget before it was even submitted.

heller has never been particularly popular and may have endangered himself further by casting a vote in favor of the gop's unpopular obamacare replacement legislation. and even if he outmaneuvers tarkanian in the primary, he'll be up against a strong democratic challenger in rep. jacky rosen.
in the past several months, the trump administration has paved the way for two alternative types of insurance that won't be subject to the same standards as aca-regulated policies. the administration loosened restrictions on both short-term health plans and so-called association health plans, both of which are usually cheaper than exchange plans. but they often provide much less coverage of essential health benefits such as maternity care or treatment for preexisting conditions.
in a 2017 essay published by notre dame law school, where she served as a law professor, barrett wrote roberts pushed the affordable care act beyond its plausible meaning to save the statute. the decision, she continued, might be explained by the fact that chief justice roberts has not proven himself to be a textualist in matters of statutory interpretation, unlike justice antonin scalia, a staunch textualist and originalist.
when asked what could be done to correct problems with obamacare, emanuel three very simple things were needed:
lesley stahl: you know, you surprised everyone by winning the primaries, beating 17 other republicans or 16, whatever-- people are really surprised that you won this election. are people going to be surprised about how you conduct yourself as president?
margaret brennan: we're back with more of our interview with former vice president joe biden.
margaret brennan: well, actually, that was my point.
jeb's spending all this time being negative. does he worry at all about his legacy? everything is trashing people. i mean, even trump -- i read that today -- trump's like, you know, all this guy does is attack, kasich said to reporters.

she likes to minimizes the conflicts within her caucus. between the moderates and the progressives.
trump said his father has single-handedly employed tens and tens and tens of thousands of people around the country.
many congressmen who support a clean spending bill (called a continuing resolution) think that if a clean bill were put up for a vote, more than 100 republicans would vote yes, cbs news' nancy cordes reports from capitol hill. but unless more of them go public with that position, boehner won't be compelled to undertake a change in strategy.
governor ned lamont: well, first of all, we have about ninety-five percent of our kids have the opportunity to go to school, to go to the classroom either full time or hybrid. almost all of them are full time. our teachers have been extraordinary heroes showing up, being at school, giving these kids an opportunity. i can't afford a lost year. so, yes, teachers are going to be in an early group when it comes to people getting vaccinated. and right now, they are a priority group in terms of testing. we're doing testing at the schools or nearby --
in alaska, the republican gubernatorial primary is very competitive. it's a crowded field, with seven candidates in the race. the frontrunners are former state sen. mike dunleavy and former lt. gov. mead treadwell. according to polls, dunleavy is leading. mark begich, the former democratic senator and former anchorage mayor, is also challenging incumbent gov. bill walker, who is running as an independent.
trump has gone on record as advising americans to avoid stocks when investing their 401(k) accounts. having a presidential candidate make a public statement advising against participating in our nation's primary investing and capital financing system is unprecedented in political history, and it may not bode well for stock markets if he's elected.
but clinton defended what her daughter had said in a separate face the nation interview where she said that sanders' position was confusing because he hadn't actually put out a health care plan yet.
washington — president donald trump is proposing a $4 trillion-plus budget for next year that projects a $1 trillion or so federal deficit and — unlike the plan he released last year — never comes close to promising a balanced federal ledger even after 10 years. and that's before last week's $300 billion budget pact is added this year and next, showering both the pentagon and domestic agencies with big increases.
rep. ann mclane kuster: she's the first person in my life that has (laugh) scared the heck out of me. (laugh) i'm honestly-- but i have so much respect for her. and it's this combination of courage and grace.

just hours before her 69th birthday, hillary clinton got a political gift tuesday evening -- an endorsement from british singer adele to a packed florida arena.
with the economy already operating close to its full potential, and concerns mounting over further pro-cyclical fiscal measures, it's less important for congress to be able to easily pass major legislation, including additional tax cuts that could further widen the deficit, ubs wrote. in that scenario, split-party control could be good for the markets, since it reduces the chance of any major legislation becoming law and unintentionally harming the economy.
donald trump: i think what ivanka trying to say, who cares? who cares? this is big league stuff. this is-- this is our country. our country is going bad. we're going to save our country. i don't care about hotel occupancy. it's peanuts compared to what we're doing. health care, making people better. it's unfair what's happened to the people of our country and we're going to change it. as simple as that.
margaret brennan: and that means a shutdown?
the view co-host meghan mccain said thursday that she hoped her pointed words during her father's funeral directed at president trump made attendees jared kushner and ivanka trump uncomfortable. on the late show with stephen colbert, mccain said, i really want it made very clear that the trumps had beef with me then and in the words of cardi b, they're going to have beef with me forever, and i'm not going to forget.
i believe this not only is going to usher in school choice in america, but it can well usher in donald trump into the white house because [hillary clinton] supported this policy, he said. kids are going to be bullied. not the transgender kids, but maybe the straight kids. this is a disaster.
in detroit, i halted government mandates that crippled america's great, beautiful autoworkers so that we can get motor city revving its engines again. and that's what's happening. many car companies are now building and expanding plants in the united states -- something we haven't seen for decades. chrysler is moving a major plant from mexico to michigan. toyota and mazda are opening up a plant in alabama -- a big one. and we haven't seen this in a long time. it's all coming back.
otto's parents, fred and cindy warmbier, are with us tonight -- along with otto's brother and sister, austin and greta, the president said. you are powerful witnesses to a menace that threatens our world, and your strength inspires us all. tonight, we pledge to honor otto's memory with american resolve.
margaret brennan: i-- i'm sure people will like things cheaper. they always do. in terms of what they'll actually be able to get though, can you say that the republican alternative will do things like guarantee access to maternity care or care for newborn children? mental health? some of the things that are guaranteed in obamacare.
it's been an eventful 10 days in office for president donald trump -- and the pace isn't expected to slow this week.
margaret brennan: sure, you know amy coney barrett. you vetted her. you put her on the list of judges in the first place that was considered by president trump, but he passed her over last time and went with brett kavanaugh. what gave you pause then? and are you certain she will be confirmed this time?
people who are terminally ill should not have to go from country to country to seek a cure. i want to give them a chance right here at home. it's time for congress to give these wonderful, incredible americans the right to try.

ricky jay charles sykes/invision/ap introduced to magic by his grandfather, ricky jay (june 26, 1946-november 24, 2018), a true master of the craft, became both a student and guru of prestidigitation and memory tricks. performing magic on tv as early as age 7, he would eventually open for rock bands in new york, and became a familiar presence on late night tv, when jaws would drop and minds would reel from his performances. his deftness with cards would earn him the honor, in the eyes of the new yorker magazine, of the most gifted sleight-of-hand artist alive. praised for his closeup magic that flouts reality, jay told expansive, entertaining stories while dealing cards, plucking the one card out of 52 that you just knew couldn't have possibly been plucked. how'd he do it? magic! he collected and researched the history and lore of magicians and illusionists, and was author of such books as cards as weapons, learned pigs & fireproof women and celebrations of curious characters. his expertise at illusions was also enlisted for the production of movies like the escape artist, the prestige and forrest gump. he also acted in films and tv shows, including boogie nights, the spanish prisoner, house of games, deadwood (as card sharp eddie sawyer), and the james bond film tomorrow never dies, as a terrorist. magic, jay told the new yorker, gives me more pleasure and more pain than anything else i've ever dealt with.

ed o'keefe (cbs news political correspondent/@edokeefe): he needs to win south carolina, bottom line. he will spend the whole week in the palmetto state trying to make the argument that he is best positioned to defeat president trump that he can build the multiracial, multigenerational coalition to do it. but the numbers here in nevada prove he is going to struggle with that. he had an interesting line last night that we're going to hear, a lot more of aides tell me. he said, i'm not a socialist, i'm not a plutocrat, i am a democrat. trying to make the argument that he best represents what the party wants to do in defeating president trump.
declaring himself more trump than trump, blankenship ran ads attacking cocaine mitch mcconnell and accusing the top republican in the u.s. senate of corruption involving his wife, secretary of labor elaine chao, and her family—a storyline the resulted in headlines like west virginia pol uses the word 'negro' to defend racist ad about 'china people.'
president donald trump: and we won't do anything-- will and is. we won't do anything and no plan unless we have preexisting conditions covered.
warren was re-elected in 2018, and announced an exploratory committee for a presidential run dec. 31. warren and her second husband, bruce mann, have been married for 38 years and have three grandchildren. they live in cambridge, massachusetts with their golden retriever, bailey, who came to her first press conference as a presidential contender. key issues warren has built a national brand as an economic populist and an anti-wall street crusader. the 69-year-old senator serves on the senate committee on banking, housing, and urban affairs committee and the health, education, labor, and pensions committee in the senate, and has also taken on her own party on issues she cares about. in one instance, she helped to derail then-president obama's nomination of investment banker antonio weiss to a top position at the treasury department in 2015. fixing a rigged economy figures to be central issue of her presidential campaign. i've spent my career getting to the bottom of why america's promise works for some families, but others who work just as hard slip through the cracks into disaster, warren said in a video announcing her presidential exploratory committee. what i found is terrifying. these aren't cracks that families are falling into. they're traps. america's middle class is under attack. how do we get here? billionaires and big corporations decided they wanted more of the pie and they enlisted politicians to cut them a fatter slice.
margaret brennan: --when all of this interference was first detected.
president donald trump: --competitor. they're a foe in many ways, but they're an adversary. i think what happened was disgraceful, should never have happened. should-- they should never have allowed this plague to get out of china and go throughout the world. 188 countries. should never have happened.
democrats immediately slammed ryan's speech and said his plans sound reminiscent of the budget blueprints he developed when he served as chairman of the house budget committee.
margaret brennan: but that likely wouldn't even happen until march at the earliest. tell me about the plans right now, what you can do now. should the federal government make it a priority to vaccinate teachers or instruct governors to push them towards the head of the line as essential workers?
there are states where republicans are actively purging voter rolls right now, obama told the crowd. this kind of politics is not conservative, he said. it's radical.
at odds with national republicans, gop mayors welcome covid relief
the outcome in the latest chapter in the longstanding battle over mr. trump's border wall awards mr. trump with $1.4 billion for new barriers — equal to last year's appropriation — while preserving mr. trump's ability to use his budget powers to tap other accounts for several times that amount. that's a blow for liberal opponents of the wall but an acceptable trade-off for pragmatic-minded democrats who wanted to gain $27 billion in increases for domestic programs and avert the threat of simply funding the government on autopilot.
speaker of the house nancy pelosi with correspondent lesley stahl
boehner spokesman brendan buck shot back, how does the white house justify signing the troop funding bill, but vetoing similar measures for veterans, national parks, and district of columbia? the president can't continue to complain about the impact of the government shutdown on veterans, visitors at national parks, and dc while vetoing bills to help them. the white house position is unsustainably hypocritical.

the ohio governor will be the last republican... 01:01 john kasich enters a crowded field of republican candidates tuesday, as he becomes the 16th person to declare he is running for president. it will be an uphill climb for the ohio governor, who's in the three percent range in national polls. but he does bring three distinct advantages to the race: he'll be the most popular sitting governor running, with a 60-percent approval rating in his state, a june quinnipiac poll says, a presidential operation with more than $11 million in the bank, and a long resume that includes nearly 20 years in congress, the statehouse in ohio and time in the private sector. kasich's shot at moving up in the polls may come if one of his opponents starts sinking. he's a business-friendly governor that will appeal to the same crowd as former florida gov. jeb bush and new jersey gov. chris christie. plus, he has christie's brash style that appeals to some voters, but with a better state economic record to back up his leadership. republican voters do like the style that chris christie made famous back in 2012, the style of where you just don't take criticism sitting down, ohio state university political science professor paul beck told cbs news. kasich may be able to differentiate himself from bush within that same niche as being more like chris christie and less like jeb bush. click through to learn five things to know about john kasich.
anthony salvanto: it inserted a lot of anger. we see anger up on both sides. we see republicans saying they are increasingly angry about the prospect of the democrats winning. democrats saying they are increasingly angry about the prospect of the republicans winning. now anger does also correlate with intention to turn out and we feel more passionate about something, more likely to go and do it. so that's one determinant of turnout for certain. did it change anybody's mind, though? no. it does not appear like it changed anybody's mind. it appeared to just cement what people already thought going in.
ed o'keefe: right. which, you know, has been relitigated ever since, and-- and there are a lot of people in the party, certainly a lot of women who were involved in party politics these days who say it should have been handled differently and there's a lot of people wondering, is he going to apologize the way his entire senate legacy over the course of this campaign, because a lot of what he did and said back in the day doesn't sync with what the democratic party is. his behavior, his policies, his-- his, you know, hours of senate floor speeches, his votes on different bills. he's going to have to spend the entire campaign, particularly the entire primary at least, relitigating all that. and you wonder really does he really want to stomach that? but this-- this situation with flores, what's-- what's telling-- she was asked this morning elsewhere about this and whether politics were involved. she was the supporter of bernie sanders. she was at a beto o'rourke rally this weekend, and she said flat out, yes, it does, because we're in the midst of a reckoning in our party and trying to determine who our nominee should be. there have been examples of this his entire career, and it's never been seriously discussed that he hasn't been held to account for it.
the department of labor announced thursday that 1.4 million americans applied for unemployment insurance benefits last week, cbs news campaign reporter lacrai mitchell reports. oklahoma, texas, new jersey, new york and louisiana saw the largest increases in unemployment applications when compared to the rest of the country. in may, cbs news reported that nearly 3.2 million americans had applied for unemployment insurance benefits. weeks later forecasters were confounded when the unemployment rate fell to 13.3% and the labor department announced that employers had added 2.5 million jobs in may, after months of americans taking economic hits due to the coronavirus pandemic. still, unemployment figures are just one measure of the economic toll that americans have endured throughout the pandemic. and as mitchell reported earlier this week in cbs news covid chronicles, small business owners in battleground states like florida are still recovering from the negative economic impacts of covid-19.

republicans in the michigan legislature filed a request on friday asking the michigan supreme court to immediately hear their case challenging governor gretchen whitmer's use of emergency powers during the covid-19 pandemic, report cbs news campaign reporters adam brewster and jack turman. the request for emergency-bypass review would bring the case right to the state's highest court and skip a hearing at the appeals level after a court of claims judge on thursday ruled in favor of whitmer's extended state of emergency. if ever there were a case that warranted this court's immediate involvement, then this would be it, the legislature said in its filing. when whitmer extended michigan's state of emergency at the end of april, she said that two emergency powers laws, one from 1945 and one from 1976, gave her the authority to do that. a state of emergency gives her power to issue executive orders like her stay at home order. judge cynthia diane stephens ruled on thursday that whitmer was allowed to extend the state of emergency under the 1945 law, but overstepped her boundaries on the 1976 law because that law requires legislative approval to extend a state of emergency after 28 days. judge stephens' ruling kept the state of emergency in effect, along with the executive orders related to it.

it seems to me than assiduous focus on text, structure, and history is essential to being a good judge, gorsuch told students during a 2016 speech at case western university. mark me down, too, as a believer that this traditional account of the judicial role that justice scalia defended will endure and the predictions of its imminent demise are much exaggerated.

the facts: the u.s. conducted an intensive air war against the saddam hussein government in the 1991 war. but to call it carpet bombing misses one of the most important characteristics of that air campaign: it marked the first large-scale use of precision-guided missiles and bombs in the history of warfare.

that's a very common device. if you want to give somebody some money but you don't want to promise it to them on a continuing basis, you frame it as a bonus, summers said. look, the corporate tax cuts are going to be forever. if the firms really believe this had to do with corporate tax cuts, why aren't they committing to bonuses forever? -- maggie dore and katiana krawchenko

jamal simmons: he's certainly trying. his campaign leadership is much more diverse than it had been in the past, like he's going places where there are people who are different. the question becomes how can he get particularly middle-aged african-american women to sign up for the bernie bus? so many of the people who supported him were people who were younger in the last election, and i think, you know, a middle-aged african-american audience is still a little bit more conservative than kind of a northeastern socialist might think.
they've called him a traitor, they've declared his presidency illegitimate, they've convinced their base he's all but a russian asset—but pelosi and company want swing voters to believe that if they win the house, they'll just shrug it all off and start working with president trump on an infrastructure bill? not even progressives are buying that.

tommy mcdonald ap photo nfl hall of famer tommy mcdonald (july 26, 1934-september 24, 2018) was a two-time all-american from oklahoma who played 12 nfl seasons for five teams and was a six-time pro bowl selection. amid rumblings that the 5-foot-7, 175-pound mcdonald was too small to play in the nfl, the eagles drafted him in the third round in 1957. the small, speedy and sure-handed receiver teamed with quarterback norm van brocklin to help the philadelphia eagles win the nfl championship three years later. when he retired in 1968, he ranked second in league history in touchdown catches, fourth in yards receiving, and sixth in receptions. but mcdonald had to wait 30 years before becoming the smallest player inducted into the pro football hall of fame. oh, baby! mcdonald shouted in canton, ohio on aug. 1, 1998. his induction speech was equal parts hysterics and histrionics, as mcdonald told jokes and tossed his 25-pound bronze bust in the air. he even pulled out a radio and danced to disco music, all on the steps of the hallowed hall. do i look excited, like i just won the lottery or the jackpot? yes! i'm in the hall of fame!

joe biden: well, i-- i assume that's part of the reason why those numbers are down. but i don't know.
i continue to believe mr. trump will not be president, mr. obama said at a press conference during a summit with southeast asian leaders in california. and the reason is that i have a lot of faith in the american people. being president is a serious job. it's not hosting a talk show, or a reality show.
we need to move toward a system that provides more choice so that the cost comes down, mcsally told us. the obama experiment has failed.

margaret brennan: but, as you know, i mean that fight is happening right now in cities like chicago. we'll be talking to their superintendent later on in the program. and michael bloomberg, former presidential rival to-- to president biden, argued in an op-ed this week that the president could be doing more. he could use his bully pul-- pulpit, excuse me, to give political cover to fellow democrats. he could tell the unions, yes, i understand how we need to prioritize teachers here and actually take measures to do it. why isn't the president doing more to help out some of these fellow democrats?

senator john barrasso: and i want to work with additional democrats, but what we're seeing right now from the democrats side--and you see whether it was bernie sanders or so many of the democrat candidates for president in 2020, they're talking about a different step away from obamacare as well. they agree that obamacare hasn't worked and they're talking about a program of a complete government takeover of healthcare, with increased taxes and fewer choices and longer lines. and that to me doesn't help people in the-- in the long run. i talked to people yesterday i was in wyoming at a wreath ceremony, at our-- at our cemetery-- talked to somebody on medicare. they said, we don't want medicare for all, we paid into medicare our whole life. this isn't the time to put more people onto that program. we want to make sure that that is saved and strengthened and-- and-- and held for people that are already on the program and have paid in over their lifetime.

cooper: just for the record, though, are you saying that what you said on that bus 11 years ago that you did not actually kiss women without consent or grope women without consent?
at the same time, democrats can speak to the broader phenomenon increasingly described as a kind of trump anxiety disorder. effective democracy requires faith in our institutions, experienced leadership, and a steady hand in both peace and in crisis. in the era of trump, we have none of these. americans have seen the most contentious supreme court confirmation hearings in decades, a white house and cabinet that's constantly turning over, and a president who stokes fears, snubs traditional u.s. allies while embracing strongmen, and peddles falsehoods daily. it's no surprise that they want a check on donald trump – in some surveys by as much as a 2 to 1 margin.
most of my days are spent talking to clients about what are the polls showing, which way are the winds blowing, what could the implications be. this, of course, touches on everything: trade policy, infrastructure, the fed raising interest rates, torsten slok, chief international economist at deutsche bank, told cbs moneywatch.

he added, small businesses are overwhelmingly being taxed, not at a corporate rate, but at the individual tax rate. so successful small businesses will see their taxes go up dramatically and that will kill jobs. that will be another kick in the gut to the middle class in america. we just saw a terrible jobs report, just last week, and now to add a higher tax on job creators and on small business is about the worst thing i could imagine to do.
i felt i was in a different role as his colleague, that i'm someone that has worked with him for a long time, there's a lot of trust there, and i felt it was best to handle it in that way, klobuchar told cnn at the time about why she did not call on him to resign. klobuchar has also faced scrutiny over several news reports detailing a pattern of abusive treatment towards her staff, which has reportedly hindered her efforts to recruit campaign personnel. what trump says a few hours after her announcement, president trump mocked klobuchar for discussing efforts to mitigate climate change during a midwestern snowstorm. amy klobuchar announced that she is running for president, talking proudly of fighting global warming while standing in a virtual blizzard of snow, ice and freezing temperatures. bad timing. by the end of her speech she looked like a snowman(woman)! the president tweeted.

president donald trump: they're trying to start a rumor. it's disinformation. that's the only thing they're good at, that putin wants to make sure i get elected. listen to this. so, doesn't he want to see who the democrat's going to be? wouldn't he rather have, let's say, bernie, wouldn't he rather have bernie who honeymooned in moscow?

at the heart of the legal battle, which pitted religious freedoms against access to contraception, is the affordable care act's contraceptive mandate, which requires employers to provide health insurance plans that cover birth control at no cost to employees. while previous cases have focused on entities that object to complying with the mandate because of their religious beliefs, the supreme court was tasked in this challenge with deciding whether the trump administration can extend exemptions from the requirement to a wider range of employers with religious or moral objections to contraceptive coverage.

scott gottlieb: well, i think we could definitely have it in time for the fall. we need to come up with a regulatory framework that allows the boosters to be licensed on the ability to demonstrate that they can produce antibody levels. and fda is working on that. they've talked about developing guidance that would allow companies to develop boosters to the existing vaccines that could be licensed just on the basis of proving that in three hundred or four hundred patients, they can induce antibody levels at a sufficient level that are protective against these new variants. and so i think that framework is going to be mapped out and the companies have said they're already working on those new boosters. we could have them in time for the fall across all these vaccines. there's no reason we can't do that. and the platforms that the companies use to develop these vaccines, these synthetic platforms, lend themselves to those quick adaptations.
senator john barrasso: there-- there are a number of different options. that's one, another is a longer term. i would like to get actually all the appropriations bills passed. i think we do much better governing for our country if we do the whole thing through the appropriations process. we were able to do seventy-five percent of the funding. we still have a ways to go but border security is critical--

dan balz: right. and that argument is going to be amped up this week in south carolina and ahead of super tuesday. but-- but to your point about the democratic establishment needs to get together, we saw in 2016 that there is no way that an establishment quote, unquote, within a party can do that. i mean, what it requires is sacrifice on the part of candidates who are now in the race to say, you know what, for the good of the cause i'm going to step aside. well, which among these candidates is going to do that other than people who perform so woefully in south carolina on super tuesday that they're essentially driven out of the race.

the rallies themselves are more akin to jam band concerts than political speeches - more jessica by the allman brothers than the gettysburg address by abraham lincoln. he doesn't use a teleprompter, but that's because he doesn't have a written speech. trump talks at the audience off the top of his head usually for about an hour, meandering from topic to topic in a one-sided conversation, sometimes interrupting himself, or being interrupted by the crowd or protesters.

ed o'keefe: well, his aides say that they will continue to try to keep the focus on sanders and make the argument that it would be dangerous for democrats to nominate him because he wouldn't necessarily be able to attract the kind of independent and, potentially, disgruntled republican voters that the democrats will need in order to win back the white house. but he is going to continue to face questions about his business practices and his decision to release at least three employees from their nondisclosure agreements. elizabeth warren, especially, continues to hammer away at him and it appears to be working at least from a financial sense. she's been able to raise a lot of money since that debate, when she attacked him, and there's evidence from the results in nevada that her debate performance there may have helped her. remember, in the next few days, most of these candidates will be campaigning not just in south carolina but in the fourteen other states, voting on super tuesday--texas, north carolina, north dakota, arkansas, colorado. they won't all be in south carolina this week because they know there are huge prizes to be won on march 3rd, just three days after south carolina.

john dickerson: but what the congressman and others are saying is-- is that if you believe the science about human contribution that there are mitigation efforts you can take with greenhouse gases and that that's where there needs to be a little more focus from republicans is on admitting that that climate change is caused by human activity and taking actions with-- whether it's coal plants or emissions from cars or methane gas to actually get-- get it where the problem is occurring.

in a digital livestream on monday, biden touted his role in passing the affordable care act. in the middle of one of the largest public health emergencies in generations, the white house and republican attorney generals are actively pursuing a lawsuit to invalidate the aca in court. they're working to strip millions of americans of their healthcare, and tens of millions of their protections for pre-existing conditions, he said. the democratic presidential frontrunner sent a letter to mr. trump on monday, requesting the trump administration withdraw the lawsuit, reports cbs news campaign reporter bo erickson. the litigation you are supporting — texas v. u.s. — jeopardizes every single one of those protections and threatens the peace of mind and access to care for hundreds of millions of americans, reads the letter reads. there is no underlying constitutional flaw with the affordable care act. in fact, the supreme court twice upheld the constitutionality of the law.

he never apologized to the reporter that he mimicked and mocked on national television and our children were watching. and he never apologized for the racist lie that president obama was not born in the united states of america. he owes the president an apology, he owes our country an apology, and he needs to take responsibility for his actions and his words.

janice jackson: yeah, i think we've learned a lot about reopening from the past spring. definitely prioritizing the reopening of schools has to be at the top of the list and our mayor has done that. we have reopened bars and restaurants at limited capacity here in the city. but one thing that was really important in that report is that it showed that community spread does not necessarily impact spread within a particular school and that implementing mitiga-- mitigation strategies with fidelity actually is more successful, you know, lead to more success with reopening. and so we're focused on that. we have a solid plan in place that goes above and beyond a guidance that we've heard from city as well as cdc officials. and we believe that we can safely reopen. and we've been open for three weeks or we have been open for three weeks with a great degree of success. so, the time is now for students to return to the classroom.

elizabeth warren elizabeth warren takes formal step toward 202... 02:18 biography warren was born in 1949 and raised in oklahoma, where her father worked as a janitor and her mother took a minimum wage job at sears. she has described growing up in a paycheck-to-paycheck family that lived on the ragged edge of the middle class. warren first married at age 19 and became an elementary school teacher after graduating from the university of houston. she began law school at rutgers university when her daughter was two years old, and she gave birth to a son soon after earning her degree. warren served as a law professor for three decades, and spent 20 of those years at harvard law school. massachusetts rep. joe kennedy iii and arkansas sen. tom cotton were among her students there. after the 2008 financial collapse, warren was tapped to lead the congressional oversight panel for the troubled asset relief program, known as tarp. she served as the architect of the consumer financial protection bureau under the 2010 financial reform law known as dodd-frank. in those roles, she became a prominent figure on the national stage and a hero among progressive populists. but her views on the economy garnered plenty of critics within the republican party and among wall street bankers. such opposition derailed obama administration plans to nominate her to officially run the cfpb. instead, she ran for the u.s. senate in 2012 and defeated incumbent massachusetts republican sen. scott brown--her first run at public office.

it was another busy day for pennsylvania courts making elections rulings, reports cbs news campaign reporter zak hudak. the pennsylvania supreme court ruled unanimously on friday that mail ballots and applications can't be challenged or rejected for signatures mismatches. the court's two conservative justices joined its five liberal ones in ruling that subjective signatures analysis can't be the reason any ballot is rejected in the key battleground state. county boards of elections are prohibited from rejecting absentee or mail-in ballots based on signature comparison conducted by county election officials or employees, or as the result of third-party challenges based on signature analysis and comparisons, justice debra todd wrote in the opinion. pennsylvania's elections chief had issued guidance in september in line with that interpretation of the law, and the trump campaign asked a federal district court judge to deem it unconstitutional. that court dismissed the lawsuit earlier this month, and pennsylvania secretary of state kathy boockvar asked the state's top court to use it's king's bench power to affirm the legality of her directive on ballot rejections. this is the first year that pennsylvania, a state worth 20 electoral votes, is allowing no-excuse mail-in voting. nearly a third of the state's 9 million registered voters have applied for a mail-in or absentee ballot, and two thirds of those voters are democrats.

democrats' takeover of the house ended two years of full gop control in washington, during which — theoretically speaking — president trump had full rein to implement his conservative agenda. but as mr. trump learned the hard way with republicans' failure to fully repeal obamacare, and his inability to secure anywhere near sufficient funding for a border wall, even full republican control of both chambers of congress and the white house isn't always enough.

isiah robertson ap photo when he was 14, isiah robertson (august 17, 1949-december 6, 2018) survived a freak accident aboard a fishing boat off louisiana, when a fuel can exploded, killing two coaches from his high school. robertson swam two miles to shore. life became very precious to me, he said of the experience to the baton rogue advocate in 2017. i've been trying to give back all my life to thank god for sparing me and giving me an opportunity to have this unbelievable life and the great people i've met. an outstanding southern university defenseman, and a first-round draft choice of the los angeles rams in 1971, robertson was one of the fastest nfl linebackers of his era. the defensive rookie of the year, robertson would be elected to the pro bowl six times, and finished his career with two seasons in buffalo with the bills. but he hit a wall with a crack cocaine addition after retiring from the game, at one point nearly dying from a beating by drug dealers who stuck a shotgun in his mouth and pulled the trigger; the gun jammed. remembering his ordeal in the fishing boat, robertson overcame his addition, and founded the house of isaiah, a faith-based drug and alcohol treatment center in mabank, texas. more than 5,000 men have passed through his program, what robertson called his greatest achievement.

on the impact of the american rescue plan for smaller cities : what's great about this funding is every effort every city gets its money, regardless of how small they are, and smaller communities have a harder time with covid because it's not like they have a place that they can really cushion. the smaller the community, the less rainy day fund you have. — mayor nan whaley of dayton, ohio

people can continue their employer coverage under a federal law known as cobra, but they have to pay 102% of the premium — too much for most who are out of work. if there's another coronavirus bill from congress, it might include subsidies for cobra coverage.
the retreat by big insurers likely means consumers will have fewer choices for 2017 coverage. that lack of competition puts a major wrench in the way the health care exchanges are supposed to work. theoretically, competing carriers on each exchange offer consumers plenty of choices while keeping premiums affordable. in many urban and densely populated markets, that's pretty much what's happening.

cory booker cory booker launches 2020 campaign 02:57 biography cory booker was born in washington in 1964 and raised in the affluent suburbs of northern new jersey. he received a bachelor's degree in political science and a master's degree in sociology from stanford university, where he also played tight end for the football team. after graduation, booker was awarded a rhodes scholarship to study at the university of oxford, earning a master's degree in modern history. he returned to the u.s. for a law degree at yale. after working as a public-interest attorney and housing advocate in newark, booker decided to run for the city's municipal council in 1998. he managed to topple a long-time incumbent and, at age 29, become the youngest-ever member of the council, where he gained notoriety for fasting outside a housing project to denounce the intensifying crime and drug use in some of newark's neighborhoods. after launching an unsuccessful bid in 2002 against incumbent mayor sharpe james, booker ran again in 2006 and defeated deputy mayor ronald rice. during his seven-year tenure as mayor, booker was praised for attracting large companies to newark and revamping the city's downtown. but he was also criticized by local residents and officials for appearing out-of-touch and focusing on his national image. the only way you can see the mayor is if you turn on 'meet the press,' newark's current mayor, ras baraka, said when he was a councilman during booker's mayoral administration.

if we had the political environment where we could pass something like that, that would be good because i see health care as a right and not a privilege, she said.
but here's what i don't want people to forget when we're talking about reining in the costs, which has to be the highest priority of the next president, when the affordable care act passed, it wasn't just that 20 million got insurance who didn't have it before. but that in and of itself was a good thing. i meet these people all the time, and they tell me what a difference having that insurance meant to them and their families.

paul allen microsoft as teenagers in seattle, paul allen (january 21, 1953-october 15, 2018) and bill gates were passionate about the workings of computers and coding. their idea to take computers out of university and research labs and put them in people's hands was sparked in 1974, in boston (gates was then attending harvard, allen was a college dropout), when they came across a notice for a new small computer sold to hobbyists, the altair. in eight weeks allen and gates wrote code that could run on the altair and pitched it to the company. it was the birth of microsoft, a giant in personal and business computing. after creating the code ms-basic, microsoft developed and refined the operating system for ibm computers, which became the core of ibm pcs and clones. by 1991, microsoft's operating systems (and such programs as word and excel) were used by 93 percent of the world's personal computers. allen was microsoft's executive vice president of research and new product development until 1983, when he resigned after being diagnosed with cancer – and he pursued a wide range of interests with the passion of a cancer survivor. to be 30 years old and have that kind of shock – to face your mortality – really makes you feel like you should do some of the things that you haven't done yet, allen said in a 2000 book, inside out: microsoft in our own words.

on saturday, rep. chris collins, indicted for insider trading, announced that he would suspend his re-election campaign in his reliably republican 27th district in western new york. house minority leader nancy pelosi issued this statement saturday calling collins' announcement insufficient: speaker ryan must call on congressman collins to resign. no person is above the law, not the president nor his first supporter in congress. this insufficient and overdue announcement does little to drain the toxic cesspool of self-enrichment, special interest deals and corruption that has proliferated in washington under gop control.

in a series of moves, the trump campaign has promoted senior political advisor bill stepien to deputy campaign manager and regional political director stephanie alexander to chief of staff. campaign manager brad parscale said in a statement the new assignments would take effect immediately. bill stepien and stephanie alexander bring decades of experience in political campaigns and also relentless dedication to president trump and all that he aims to accomplish for the american people, parscale said. as we enter the most important stretch of the campaign, it is important to have seasoned and steady people on our leadership team, each with their own strengths, and each with an unwavering focus on victory. bill and stephanie are already respected by everyone on team trump and i look forward to their assistance as we lead the team toward president trump's re-election in november. cbs news campaign reporter nicole sganga says axios reported stepien has worked alongside senior adviser to the president jared kushner crafting a new, distilled gop platform ahead of the 2020 republican national convention. prior to his campaign role as senior political adviser, stepien served as the white house political director, where he managed mr. rump's day-to-day political operations. stepien operated as campaign manager for each of new jersey governor chris christie's statewide elections, working as the governor's deputy chief of staff between 2009 - 2013. alexander organized the midwestern states as regional political director for trump victory, the joint operation between the campaign and the republican national committee.
mr. trump pledged to revive the coal industry and reverse the trend in coal jobs and plants under his predecessor.
house minority whip steny hoyer, d-md., added, this is not a negotiation -- we're taking their number, and we would hope that they could also take their number so we can keep the government open.
lesley stahl: you said that they were professionals—and you said it was unfair.
president trump did not attend mulvaney's meeting with the two. white house officials maintain that verma continues to have the support of the president, but mr. trump has made it clear that he wants the bickering between azar and verma to stop. mr. trump doesn't care if they like each other, but they have a job to do, one official said. their jobs are not in jeopardy, the source said.

senator chris van hollen (d-maryland/@chrisvanhollen): yeah.
for mr. trump, that means democrats will have every opportunity to obtain the president's tax returns, which he has refused to hand over since before the election. democrats are also poised to launch or continue probes into the president's businesses and potential conflicts of interest. mr. trump never fully divested from his businesses upon assuming office, and democrats are unsatisfied with the lack of information on how the president and his family might be profiting from transactions the public can't see. litigation is already pending claiming foreign payments to mr. trump's businesses violate the emoluments clause of the u.s. constitution.
in december of 1999, trump sat down with then-cbs news correspondent dan rather for an interview that would air in january on 60 minutes ii and discussed his then-girlfriend.
marty balin ap folk musician marty balin (january 30, 1942-september 27, 2018), pictured far left, both founded the san francisco rock band jefferson airplane and co-owned the matrix, the bay area club where the group performed as house band and which served as a stage for such local artists as the grateful dead and janis joplin. their san francisco sound was a psychedelic blend of blues, folk, rock and jazz. balin's yearning tenor could be heard on the songs today, it's no secret, and volunteers. excerpt: volunteers by jefferson airplane i remember it was really pretty and beautiful for a year or two, balin told relix magazine in 1993. and then time magazine came out and they were interviewing me. i told the guy, 'it's great that you're publicizing this beautiful-feeling scene out here,' and he looked me right in the eye and said, 'fastest way to kill it.' the airplane would break up, in part owing to balin's acknowledged jealousy of grace slick, who'd joined the group in the fall of 1966, soon before their second album, surrealistic pillow. (slick displaced balin as lead singer on the airplane's best-known songs, somebody to love and white rabbit.) excerpt: somebody to love by jefferson airplane in the mid-1970s, members regrouped as jefferson starship, and balin sang lead on such hits as miracles (which he co-wrote), with your love and count on me.
yes, there is question, cruz said.
margaret brennan: well back of sanders is former vice president joe biden who'd hoped to score strong support in the state where a third of democratic caucus voters are minorities.
in a response, hyde said romano should resign from the @ctgop asap. never did anything but rig elections including his own and was a staunch advocate against @realdonaldtrump and still is. romano had previously criticized hyde for his crude, now-deleted tweets about senator kamala harris.
tyler argued that after the first round, delegates who had come to the convention bound to vote for romney would drop him for an alternate candidate.
biden regularly reminds his audience that the aca's passage has allowed 20 million more americans access to healthcare coverage, a fact supported by healthcare researcher kaiser family foundation and quips about when he told obama on hot mic the aca was a big f**king deal — language for which he now performs the sign of the cross during his stump speech, to his audience's delight.
otto warmbier was a hardworking student at the university of virginia -- and a great student he was. on his way to study abroad in asia, otto joined a tour to north korea. at its conclusion, this wonderful young man was arrested and charged with crimes against the state. after a shameful trial, the dictatorship sentenced otto to 15 years of hard labor, before returning him to america last june, horribly injured and on the verge of death. he passed away just days after his return.
senator rick scott: --premiums went up, co-payments went up--
the shipments have not been direct. rather, under a deal with the iraqi government, all u.s. weapons sent to help in the fight are delivered to iraqi officials, and they divide the weapons between iraqi and kurdish forces.
donald trump: no, i think i'm a sober person. i think the press tries to make you into something a little bit different. in my case, a little bit of a wild man. i'm not. i'm actually not. i'm a very sober person. but it was respect for the office, it was respect for the president. again, i never met him before, but we had-- we had a very good chemistry going. and-- and i really found—it might not be that i agree with him, but i really found the conversation unbelievably interesting.
lawmakers grilled verma, the administrator of the centers for medicare and medicaid services, on the future of obamacare, the landmark 2010 law whose fate remains uncertain. although the executive branch typically defends federal laws in court, the trump administration earlier this year joined a lawsuit brought by republican state attorneys general that seeks to strike down the law.
but after being outraised roughly 2 to 1, graham's operating expenses covered about half of what he raised, $26.5 million and another $1.75 million was transferred to the state republican party. in their pre-general election filings, harrison raised another $22 million in just 14 days from october 1 through 14, but ended the period with just $3.5 million cash on hand. graham raised less than half of that but had $7.3 million as of october 14.
susan page (usa today/@susanpage): and-- but other policymakers may have other views on whether what price are you willing to put on the life of a u.s.-- u.s. resident who is a dissident journalist, who is lured to his-- his country's embassy and then dismembered, we believe. and with the idea that there may be recordings of this, i think escalates. it has been no surprise to anybody in washington that saudi arabia has a very questionable record when it comes to human rights. but is this a bridge too far when it comes to these contracts? and you saw the discomfort in your interview with marco rubio with the way the president had expressed this concern as of these contracts over-- would necessarily override whatever you might want to do to sanction saudi arabia, if this is-- indeed is what happened.
more than $37 million future reservations have already been placed in the senate race by other groups, per kantar/cmag data.
john dickerson: but in this is where politics gets in it, too, because you have a politician saying your job is not going away. i'm going to protect it. you're not going to have to re-learn. and-- and so that comes back-- brings me back to politics again sending the wrong messages from what you want to say.
in this case, known as california v. texas, republican-led states and the trump administration argue obamacare's individual mandate is unconstitutional, as the 2017 tax reform package eliminated the financial penalty for individuals who do not have health insurance. the red states and the justice department also say that the full health care law should be struck down because it cannot stand without the individual mandate.
the latest iowa caucus poll by monmouth university indicates similar candidate popularity as these fair interviews with biden and warren amassing the most support.
in november, she said in a tweet that president trump is saudi arabia's bitch for announcing the u.s. will stand with saudi arabia, regardless of any intelligence community assessment on saudi crown prince mohammed bin salman's involvement in the killing of washington post columnist jamal khashoggi. what trump says mr. trump has not publicly criticized gabbard. the two met briefly shortly after mr. trump was elected.
donnelly, who made campaign stops in lowell, lafayette, clinton and terre haute on monday, is one of 10 senate democrats running for re-election in a state trump won in 2016. in the 2016 presidential election, trump won indiana by 19 points. donnelly's campaign events in lafayette, which is in tippecanoe county, and clinton, which is in vermillion county, are a couple of critical locations that will determine the senate race this november. donnelly won both of these counties in 2012, and president trump carried them in 2016. in total, there are 22 counties in indiana that donnelly won in 2012 that voted for trump in 2016.
4:05 p.m. asked what he has learned in his first year as president, mr. trump said, i've really learned a lot. you know, governing -- when you're a businessperson, you don't have to worry about your heart, the heart. you really do what's best for you -- you know, for almost purely monetary reasons. you know, you make your money. you competing against people. in many cases, you don't like them, you want to beat, and all that stuff. and i build a great company -- far better than anybody at this table says. i mean, i have some of the greatest assets in the world. i've built a great company, he said.
still, republicans seem unlikely to change their position - at least not yet. members concluded their business in the early evening and headed home, sending the government into a second day of shutdown.
kelsey snell: well, i think that it's going to be equal parts political kind of circus and a lot of information getting out there to the public that people want to understand. and i think it will be up to democrats to find a way to walk the line between wanting to push the political side of things and get political wins on the board on a-- you know, on a hearing that will be widely watched and televised, and needing to establish that their investigations going forward are not some sort of the partisan witch hunt that the president talks about. it's going to be a delicate balance. and it should be very, very interesting to watch.
as the ping pong game continues, fish-parcham warned, people signing up for insurance during this year's enrollment period need to be aware that the future may look very different.
mcghan: well i certainly think that there's an imminent election and obviously everyone's talking about the election, but i think when the president makes a nomination, he's obligated to do so under the constitution. this has happened 29 times in our history where there's been an election year nomination, and it's happened before. it'll probably happen again. and even justice kennedy, who many hold up as a- as a model justice was, was confirmed and appointed in an election year in 1988 when president reagan wasn't even on the ballot. so this idea that somehow this is out of the norm simply doesn't ring true.
moderna says it will deliver its promised 300 million doses by july, two months early. the rna-based vaccines of pfizer and moderna are the first of their kind. the process to speed up the manufacture of the rna also pushes the boundaries of bioengineering.

goe is an adamant bevin supporter, in part due to the state's strong economy and shrinking unemployment rate. but like many voters in kentucky, he also likes bevin's conservative stances on guns and abortion.
senator amy klobuchar: well, what that means is because you have an administration and you just heard it that basically is standing while the house is burning down and instead of going in there and putting out the fire they're throwing lighter fluid on it in terms of tweets and rhetoric and things they're saying. the ruling was absurd. justice roberts and a conservative court has already ruled that the affordable care act is constitutional unlike what mister miller said. and in fact you can have part of it not exist and you can still have the rest of it protect americans. and that is exactly where this is headed and i can say that this is about first of all throwing people off of their insurance. no protection with preexisting conditions, kids staying on their parent's insurance until they're twenty-six-years-old. a very popular and important protection. medicaid expanded for millions of americans. that's what we're talking about here. and for them just to throw up their hands and say, well it'd be great if we just started from scratch. that's not what the american people believe. just look at the results from the last election.
vice president mike pence's press secretary katie miller tested positive for the coronavirus on friday morning, just as the vice president was getting ready to fly to des moines, iowa. air force two was delayed an hour, according to pool reports, and six other staffers were asked to deplane and get tested out of an abundance of caution. miller was not initially identified as the staffer but shortly after the news broke, mr. trump told reporters during a meeting with republican members of congress that a young woman, katie, tested positive. it is a press person, the president added. soon after, cbs news confirmed katie miller, press secretary to the vice president, and wife of white house adviser stephen miller, as the staffer in question. cbs news campaign reporter musadiq bidar says this leads to the possibility that the entire west wing of the white house has now been directly or indirectly exposed to the coronavirus. mr. trump said she hasn't come into contact with me, but added that she spent time with the vice president. earlier in the day, a senior administration official told pool reporters the person was not on the plane and not scheduled to be on the trip to des moines. according to the print pool reports, the senior administration official said the vice president and the president have not had contact with this person recently. the official added that about 10 people in pence's circle are tested regularly.
now, hillary mentioned something about contributions just so you understand. so i will have in my race more than $100 million put in — of my money, meaning i'm not taking all of this big money from all of these different corporations like she's doing. what i ask is this.
probably minus, trump said. it makes it exciting, it makes it nice. but when you have a very beautiful woman -- and she's a very beautiful woman -- it perhaps looks -- i don't know. you know some other people may say, 'gee whiz i don't want you watching television because i don't want you looking at his girlfriend or his wife' or this and you know, it could be a minus.
in fact, mr. obama said, i was not informed correctly that the website would not be working the way it was supposed to. had i been informed, i wouldn't be going out saying, 'boy, this is going to be great.' you know, i'm accused of a lot of things, but i don't think i'm stupid enough to go around saying 'this is going to be like shopping on amazon or travelocity,' a week before the website opens if i thought that it wasn't going to work.
yes, he did, she said. when you say 'believe,' he certainly is taking it very seriously and digesting it and nobody looks at something that complicated in one sitting. so this will be ongoing.
house speaker paul ryan will leave congress having achieved one of his career goals: rewriting the tax code. on his other defining aim — balancing the budget and cutting back benefit programs like social security, medicare and medicaid — ryan has utterly failed.
clinton: these are very important values to me, because this is the america that i know and love. and i can pledge to you tonight that this is the america that i will serve if i'm so fortunate enough to become your president.
that plan went haywire when the supreme court later ruled that states were not required to expand medicaid coverage but could do so voluntarily. as a result, people in nonexpansion states with incomes below the aca subsidy limits often don't qualify for medicaid. indeed, the survey found the steepest increases in uninsured rates occurred in states that did not expand medicaid.

president trump told reporters today he continues to keep his distance from the vice president after his press secretary, katie miller, tested positive for the virus last week. i haven't seen mike pence and i miss him, trump quipped, adding that the two speak on the phone often. i guess we said for a little while we'll stay apart because you don't know what happens with this crazy, horrible disease, the president added, referring to the covid-19 outbreak.
the trump campaign also released an official statement about the speech tuesday morning, saying that melania's team of writers took notes on her life's inspirations, and in some instances included fragments that reflected her own thinking.

my administration is committed to fighting the drug epidemic and helping get treatment for those in need, for those who have been so terribly hurt. the struggle will be long and it will be difficult, but as americans always do -- in the end, we will succeed. we will prevail.
anthony salvanto: actually they do. they make good on what they're telling us, most of them are telling us in the polling. now, if we put that in the model it goes as high as two hundred and thirty-five seats so they get a little bump from that. however, let's suppose they don't show up and that's a reasonable assumption because they haven't done this before. and, frankly, sometimes people do over report this turnout propensity in the polling, right? so, if they don't show up, these are folks who maybe, they voted in the presidential, but they didn't typically vote in the last midterms in 2010, in 2014. if they don't show up then the democrats don't make it, they don't get the two eighteen that they need and the republicans hold the house. so, if they don't get that and the democrats don't get quite as many of those crossover voters--those crossovers come back home a little bit to the republican party then the reps still have a chance to hold it.
from the consumption angle, coal consumption in 2018 was on track to be the lowest in 39 years, according to the eia.

knowing that the commission on presidential debates had the ability to mute the mics during each two-minute opening statements, president trump remained restrained first half of the debate, before reverting back to his more contentious, interrupting self during the latter half of the debate, when former vice president joe biden also became more feisty. the moderator, nbc news' kristen welker, delivered her questions concisely, and kept the candidates in line.
joe biden: i've never said it--
i'd rather answer that at a little bit different time. we're looking at a lot of different things, including cabinet, the president said. soon after, the president announced whitaker's appointment on twitter.

ed wong: i don't-- we haven't sensed any motivation on the part of the white house to really push forward with changes or with pressing saudi arabia or any of its policies. so, i do think that this is an authentic rebuke by congress against the president.

anthony salvanto (cbs news director of elections and surveys/@salvantocbs/where did you get this number): well, at the moment, we've got the house with the democrats getting over the two hundred and eighteen seats that they would need to take it if the election were today. right now we've got them at two hundred and twenty-six seats in our model. that number has been creeping up slowly over the course of the summer as long as we've been doing these battleground trackers, but it is still very heavily dependent on at least two things for the democrats. and i just-- i can't emphasize this enough. it's dependent on turnout among people who don't typically vote in midterms and it's dependent on a few meaningful crossover voters coming from having voted for donald trump to voting democrat now.
he reminded them of what the president had told them in 2017 in lordstown, ohio: 'don't move, don't sell your house,' biden said. but lordstown shut down on trump's watch.

that was jindal's explicit message on thursday. though he had plenty of criticism for the president--who he said liked to play the victim in chief--his message for his own party was not about the incumbent he disapproves of. in the states, he said, you see a party that is fighting for every single vote, that is fighting to help the american people join and thrive in the middle class ... a party that is not just the party of no, and those are the things that we need to do as a party if we want to earn the right to govern and we want to be a majority party. it's not happening in d.c. right now, but it is happening in our state capitals.
barrett's appointment to the high court will widen its conservative majority to 6-3. before she was appointed to the 7th circuit by mr. trump in 2017, she served as a law professor at notre dame law school for 15 years.

robert venturi george widman, ap; carol m. highsmith, buyenlarge/getty images often referred to as the father of postmodernism, architect robert venturi (june 25, 1925–september 18, 2018) shunned the title, despite having broken with the modernist school principle that less is more … insisting to the contrary that (as he put it) less is a bore! he would reject the austere designs and spare aesthetics of modernists like mies van der rohe, and produce buildings that celebrated complexity and even inconsistency in design. venturi designed buildings bursting with ornamentation and flourishes, and encouraged architects and consumers to enjoy messy vitality in architecture, whether whimsical, sarcastic, humorous or honky-tonk. his first notable building was a house he designed for his mother in philadelphia's chestnut hill neighborhood in 1961. it broke from the established architectural thinking of the time, that a modern house should contain no historical elements. architect frederick schwartz referred to the vanna venturi house (pictured) as the first postmodern anything. a while back, when it was considered very daring, we did very simple things, venturi said in 1991. we did buildings that looked ordinary, that were not trying to be revolutionary the way modern architecture was going to go. that horrified people. we did houses that looked like houses, elemental concepts of houses. we did fire stations that looked like fire stations. in 1991, venturi was awarded the prestigious pritzker prize, for expanding and redefining the limits of architecture in this century, as perhaps no other has.

scott gottlieb: i think we have the potential to turn a corner. things are clearly improving around the country. we can't take our foot off the brake too quickly in terms of the things that people are doing, like wearing masks and being more vigilant. that's really probably what's bringing down infection rates across the country right now. the new variants create a lot of risk. i think that the risk is that what you're going to see over the summertime is whereas the summer should have been very quiet, coronavirus should have really dissipated in part because of the seasonal backstop, in part because we've infected a third of the population and in part because we're immunizing more people. so coronavirus levels should have really come down this summer. you might see higher prevalence than what you would have expected. but what's going to likely happen is that the prevalence is going to be high in certain regional hotspots. so we'll have hotspots of infection and maybe epidemics in parts of florida, parts of southern california, because of b117. they'll never really get out of it, but the rest of the country will see prevalence come down. now, the risk is to the fall when, you know, these new variants are going to want to surge, b117, b1351, p1. now, with respect to the south african and the brazilian variants, they don't appear right now to be more fit, meaning that they're more transmissible. so, they may not spread as readily.
