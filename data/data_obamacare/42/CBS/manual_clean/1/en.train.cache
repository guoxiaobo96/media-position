We look at it as an expansion at a critical and busy time for the campaign, she said. When it comes to personnel and it comes to senior-level staff, more is more -- the more big minds, and broad shoulders we can get inside the door.
Mike Bloomberg is the ninth richest person in the world, worth about $60 billion. His success began in 1981. Before PC's or the internet evolved, Bloomberg created a data and communications network for Wall Street. Today, the Bloomberg Terminal is the central nervous system of world finance. But he told us, if he wins the presidency, he'll sell the company.
In addition, there were 35,000 applications with unresolved questions involving matching Social Security numbers, which represented $154 million in subsidies for insurance premiums.
Trump bets on the base for midterms;
Pelosi and Mnuchin last spoke Monday for 52 minutes, the speaker's spokesman Drew Hammill said, adding progress depends on Leader McConnell agreeing to bipartisan, comprehensive legislation to crush the virus, honor our heroes — our essential workers — and put money in the pockets of the American people.
Insurers that extend existing plans must also notify consumers of what protections these renewed plans do not include. They must also notify customers that there are more options available on the new Obamacare marketplaces that offer better coverage, and that tax credits are available for many consumers. While insurers will be able to let customers keep their existing plans for another year, they will not be able to let new customers buy these existing plans that do not meet new Obamacare standards.
Cedric Richmond, Senior Adviser to the President
Bondi is no stranger to controversy involving Mr. Trump. Last year, a Florida state prosecutor said a bribery complaint against Mr. Trump and Bondi lacked enough evidence to move forward. The complaint was filed over a $25,000 campaign contribution Bondi received from Mr. Trump through his foundation in 2013, around which time Bondi's office was being asked about alleged fraud at Trump University.
The measure would also provide $425 million for states to upgrade their election systems, and Democrats boosted the U.S. Census budget $1.4 billion above Mr. Trump's request. They won smaller increases for the Environmental Protection Agency, renewable energy programs and affordable housing.
Future first lady Melania Trump CBS News
In 2016, many Republicans decided that, if they're going to get called bigots and haters anyway, why not back a politician who would at least fight back on their behalf. If every argument is going to be reduced to identity politics — you can't possibly oppose Obamacare based on math, you must hate it because of Obama's race, you Republican bigots — then these voters have found a politician with whom they can truly identify.
SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: No. No. Look, yes, Trump has an idea on health care. His idea is to throw thirty-two million Americans off of the health insurance they have, doing away with insurance for kids who are twenty-six years of age or younger who are on their parent's plans, doing away with the protections that the ACA has for pre-existing conditions, Margaret. That means if you have cancer, you have heart disease, you have diabetes. If Trump gets his way the cost of health insurance for you will be so high that many people literally will not be able to afford it. Thousands of people will literally die. That's Trump's health insurance plan. My plan's just a little bit different. I think we should join the rest of the industrialized world. Guarantee health care to all people as a right. End the absurdity of the United States spending twice as much per capita on health care as any other nation while our life expectancy is actually going down and our health care outcomes are worse than many other countries. And by the way, we pay by far the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs. Margaret, let me make a campaign promise to you and you can repeat this, play this tape over if I'm elected President. And that is, if I am elected President I'm going to cut prescription drug costs in this country by fifty percent so that we are not paying any more than other major countries are paying.
There are more Democratic women running for office than ever before as a referendum on Trump, but will Democratic women voters necessarily turn out to vote? Will the enthusiasm translate to voters? Will conservative and independent educated, suburban women vote for Democrats over Republicans?
Less than one year has passed since I first stood at this podium, in this majestic chamber, to speak on behalf of the American people and to address their concerns, their hopes, and their dreams. That night, our new administration had already taken very swift action. A new tide of optimism was already sweeping across our land.
Donnelly, who made campaign stops in Lowell, Lafayette, Clinton and Terre Haute on Monday, is one of 10 Senate Democrats running for re-election in a state Trump won in 2016. In the 2016 presidential election, Trump won Indiana by 19 points. Donnelly's campaign events in Lafayette, which is in Tippecanoe County, and Clinton, which is in Vermillion County, are a couple of critical locations that will determine the Senate race this November. Donnelly won both of these counties in 2012, and President Trump carried them in 2016. In total, there are 22 counties in Indiana that Donnelly won in 2012 that voted for Trump in 2016.
TRUMP: And that's what I want to talk about.
Lesley Stahl: Do you know what you told me a long time ago when I asked why you keep saying fake m-- media--
When I look at all of the things that I see and all of the potential that our country has, we have such tremendous potential, whether it's in business and trade, where we're doing so badly. Last year, we had almost $800 billion trade deficit. In other words, trading with other countries. We had an $800 billion deficit. It's hard to believe. Inconceivable.
Giuliani, who ran for president in 2008, said he's sick and tired of the defamation of Trump by media and the Clinton campaign. He also slammed President Obama for not singling out Islamic extremist terrorism.
On the day before the race, voters may have received a robocall from former President Obama advocating for Hood. An Obama spokeswoman confirmed Mr. Obama recorded the call, in which he talks about Hood's pro-Medicaid expansion stance.
MARGARET BRENNAN: --when all of this interference was first detected.
MARGARET BRENNAN: How can you stop--
MARGARET BRENNAN: The coverage of pre-existing conditions was protected under the Affordable Care Act, so if this ruling is upheld that goes away. Are you as- as a Republican leader looking to craft an entirely new law from whole cloth or are you looking at amending the Affordable Care Act?
These recent leaks are part of a targeted campaign to smear the Administrator and undermine the accomplishments of CMS, a CMS spokesperson told CBS News in a statement. The Administrator's number one priority is continuing to deliver on the President's bold healthcare agenda to ensure Americans have access to high quality, affordable healthcare.
As to whether their numbers are accurate, I'm not an accountant from China, the president added.
But here's what I don't want people to forget when we're talking about reining in the costs, which has to be the highest priority of the next president, when the Affordable Care Act passed, it wasn't just that 20 million got insurance who didn't have it before. But that in and of itself was a good thing. I meet these people all the time, and they tell me what a difference having that insurance meant to them and their families.
Democrats court West Virginians with pre-existing conditions
Today's decision in Texas v. Azar is a win for all Americans and confirms what I have said all along: that the individual mandate, by far the worst element of Obamacare, is unconstitutional, the president said in a statement. This decision will not alter the current healthcare system. My administration continues to work to provide access to high-quality healthcare at a price you can afford, while strongly protecting those with pre-existing conditions. The radical healthcare changes being proposed by the far left would strip Americans of their current coverage. I will not let this happen. Providing affordable, high-quality healthcare will always be my priority. They are trying to take away your healthcare, and I am trying to give the American people the best healthcare in the world.
Congress controls the nation's purse strings. That, Slok notes, could produce quite a changed landscape in what's possible with Congress.
JAMELLE BOUIE: I think the first step Democrats have to do is do what Senator Sanders said when he was told or was asked to comment publicly about this to disavow the interference to say that if he's elected president he will reject anything like this and try to stop any kind of election interference into the country. And then as far as the entire Democratic Party goes, I-- I think there needs to be sort of-- two things going on, first, yes, an awareness that online and other forums there may be Russian hackers trolls trying to stirrup things, but it's probably not wise to immediately leaned on that as their explanation, for the specific reason that it does undermine people's faith and what's happening. On-- on the question of online division, maybe that does require all candidates, right, to say anyone in our camp doing these things needs to cut it out, which is what the candidates have been saying. But I would recommend it specifically for this problem of maintaining faith in the process to not immediately jump to (INDISTINCT) Russian bots, it's Russian hackers because that I think does so mistrust and a little bit of fear.
But rural and less populated counties will be hard hit by the big insurer exits. At least one county in Arizona is at risk of being left with no insurer, according to an analysis by the Kaiser Family Foundation. And in five or so states, there will be only one insurer on the exchange.
JONAH GOLDBERG: --but there's no evidence--
Though it's his last State of the Union Address, President Obama and his staff have been scrambling to whip up a frenzy of interest in it.
The ACA is there as a safety net for the first time in an economic downturn, said Kaiser foundation expert Larry Levitt. But many people losing their jobs have never had to think of relying on the ACA for coverage, so there is no reason they should be aware of their options.
MARGARET BRENNAN: So I want to also ask you, though, because we have what the President is calling a crisis at the border. He's threatening to shutdown portions of it this week. He has given the order to cut off aid to Central American countries. Do you think this helps? Do you think this hurts? And can Congress stop this cut off in aid?
Scott Pelley: You have already spent twice as much on this campaign as President Trump has raised. How much are you willing to spend?
I have read through whether it's the whistleblower complaint, I've read through the transcript, and just on its face value, I don't think there is anything there, per se, Ernst said. The whistleblower acknowledges this is second-, third-hand information. So The Senate Intelligence Committee, they will sort through all of that. And if there are additional witnesses that need to come forward, or they need to visit with they should do that.
MARGARET BRENNAN: We're back now with our panel. Anna, can you pick us up here? I mean, we-- we started off the program with Bernie Sanders, someone who embraces the term Democratic socialist, who is embracing government-run and government-financed health care. The President is trying to use a lot of those principles as a kind of a rallying cry for his own supporters, saying reject socialism. It's socialism or me. Does this actually resonate?
Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue to be designated survivor
The Senate majority leader said he doesn't think it's likely the Supreme Court will strike down the ACA any time soon.
I want to say just a couple of things. First, we've had Muslims in America since George Washington. And we've had many successful Muslims. We just lost a particular well-known one with Muhammad Ali.
Serving as Ohio's governor, Kasich expanded Medicaid coverage in the state under the Affordable Care Act -- to the anger of many Ohio Republicans.
CBS News campaign reporter Alex Tin reports Steyer was the only candidate to speak in person at the event, which struggled to book appearances after the Democratic National Committee scheduled a debate in Iowa for the day prior. Others appeared remotely, with some sending surrogates in addition to pre-recording interviews or appearing via a livestream.
A private equity firm called Roark Capital Group – named after Howard Roark, the protagonist in the novel The Fountainhead, by Ayn Rand, the avatar of unfettered capitalism -- bought CKE in 2013. Founded by entrepreneur Carl Karcher in 1941, the company ran into financial trouble 56 years later and turned to Puzder, then a lawyer, for help. Puzder took over as chief executive in 2000.
As of Wednesday morning, the Wisconsin Elections Commission reported that 91,057 people returned absentee ballots out of the more than 191,500 votes cast. During the April 7 election, about 71% of Wisconsinites around the state voted by mail.
JOE BIDEN: What's happening is you have Steyer spending hundreds of millions, tens of thousands of dollars, millions of dollars, out campaigning there. And so I think a lot's happening in terms of the amount of money being spent by the billionaires to try to cut into the African-American vote. I think that has a lot to do with it.
As Washington prepares for Mr. Trump's first State of the Union speech Tuesday, the president marks a first year in office characterized by attacks not just on Democrats, but slights of lawmakers in his own party. Over the last year, Mr. Trump has attacked not just Schumer, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and Democrats in general on Twitter, but also Republicans like Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Arizona, and Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tennessee.
ED O'KEEFE: Exactly. So, he's now--
While the members of the Lincoln Project say they disagree with Sanders on a host of issues, particularly his economic agenda, they all agreed that they would have supported him should he have been the candidate opposite Trump.
But his win means the governor's seat will be held by a Republican for the third straight time. It's also a welcome sign for the White House, which deployed Vice President Pence for an event on the state's Gulf Coast Monday.
SEN. BARRASSO: That said if the mandate goes away then other things go away. You know as a doctor people say to me what does this mean to me. And for right now, very little if you're a Doctor, if you're getting treatment if you have a preexisting condition if you signed up for Obamacare on this recent sign up period it doesn't change a thing.
CLINTON: We have to save as many lives as we possibly can.
SEN. SANDERS: Yeah, we will. I mean, we have it all done and it's just a question of dotting the i's and crossing the t's. Yes, we will, absolutely.
Read more here about CBS News' reporting about Reade's accusation and the Biden's campaign's response to the allegations.
President Trump here has promised to protect people with pre-existing conditions but doesn't have a plan to execute. This is something of a mirage, he told CBS News. Much of the president's record has been to weaken protections, including his effort to try to get ACA overturned. I do think the fact that the president is saying people with pre-existing conditions should be protected shows how far this debate has shifted since the Affordable Care Act has passed.
Pete Buttigieg Pete Buttigieg explores presidential bid 06:09 Biography The youngest of the presidential contenders, Pete Buttigieg is also the only openly gay candidate who has jumped into the race. Buttigieg, 37, ran for mayor of South Bend, Indiana, his hometown, when he was only 29. He is a graduate of Harvard and was a Rhodes Scholar at Oxford University. After becoming mayor in 2011, Buttigieg deployed to Afghanistan for a seven-month tour in 2013 as a member of the Navy Reserve. In 2015, shortly before the Supreme Court decision legalizing same-sex marriage, Buttigieg came out as gay in an essay in the South Bend Tribune, becoming the first openly gay municipal leader in Indiana. If nominated, Buttigieg would be the first openly gay presidential nominee. Buttigieg ran for chairman of the Democratic National Committee in 2017, running as a dark horse candidate with the backing of former DNC Chairman Howard Dean. However, Buttigieg withdrew from the race on the day of the election, acknowledging his long-shot candidacy. Buttigieg married his husband, Chasten Glezman, in June 2018. Issues Buttigieg has spent much of his time as mayor of South Bend focusing on redevelopment and construction, such as implementing a project to repair or demolish targeted properties across the city and adding pedestrian and bike-friendly amenities to city streets. Buttigieg is making the case that South Bend's economic struggles are a microcosm of the problems the country is experiencing.
President Donald Trump: Lesley, it's such a vicious thing you just said. I never said, Lock up the governor of Michigan. I would never say that.
The general election campaign proved to be as unusual as his fight for the Republican nomination.
That evening he would head to South Carolina and Texas. Bloomberg comes to politics like the electrical engineer he is, pragmatic not charismatic.
Lesley Stahl: But he walked out--
Melania Trump: You know, of course, I did many times, from the beginning of the campaign. But…
Braver asked, What do you say to people who say, 'Okay, maybe he's done some things right, but his behavior is sometimes reprehensible?' Do you ever think that?
Montgomery County elections officials filed an emergency petition on Tuesday, asking the county Common Pleas Court to extend the deadline for mail-in ballots to a week after the state's June 2 primary election. Citing reports of voters not receiving ballots, lengthy delivery times and a design flaw in the online application that led to apartment numbers being left off hundreds of ballots sent to apartment complexes, elections officials said that the delay is necessary to ensure a fair election. An election that involves members of the electorate who could be deprived of their opportunity to participate because of circumstances beyond their control, they wrote.
He says he's going to withhold funding if schools do not follow the policy. In Texas, he can keep his thirty pieces of silver, Patrick told reporters. We will not yield to blackmail from the president of the United States.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Because I know you've been critical of Senator Sanders for not being strong enough in his condemnation of some of the vitriolic sentiment online. And Senator Sanders has come out with a statement saying, and he said it on the debate stage as well, that perhaps some of this may be fueled by the Russians. In other words,--
Another subsidy is in play with employer-sponsored health care plans: Employers are allowed to deduct the cost of providing health care to employees when they file their taxes. By reducing their corporate income taxes, they're effectively enjoying a subsidy from the federal government.
This year is going to be bad for the GOP for all sorts of historic reasons. But their best-case scenario has always been candidates who get the Trump base excited without alienating more centrist voters. By that measure, Tuesday night was a big win for the GOP.
Mr. Trump also hinted at several political exit strategies, drawing huge cheers when he said, It's time for Democrat leaders in Washington to take responsibility for the disaster that they and they alone created.
Hillary Clinton is a woman, a mother and a grandmother of two. I am a woman, a mother and a grandmother of two, Pat Smith said at the convention. Donald Trump is everything Hillary Clinton is not. He is blunt, direct and strong. He speaks his mind and his heart.
As congressional Republicans unveil their new plan to overhaul the U.S. health care system, a new poll finds that Americans are sharply split over whether to eliminate Obamacare's individual mandate.
The Georgia congressman will be subject to confirmation by the full Senate, and will also face another confirmation hearing before the Senate Finance Committee on Tuesday. The finance panel will vote on whether to recommend confirmation.
According to the Campaign Legal Center website, the group represented Floridians Bonnie Raysor, Diane Sherrill and Lee Hoffman in challenging the constitutionality of the law. CLC Vice President Paul Smith called the ruling a watershed moment in election law in a statement Sunday. States can no longer deny people access to the ballot box based on unpaid court costs and fees, nor can they condition rights restoration on restitution and fines that a person cannot afford to pay.
The program only lasted three years, but Congress inserted a provision in the Health and Human Services Department's spending bills from 2015 to 2017 to limit payments under the risk corridors program. Both the Obama and Trump administrations had argued that the provision means the government has no obligation to pay.
COOPER: Thank you very much for being here. We're going to begin with a question from one of the members in our town hall. Each of you will have two minutes to respond to this question. Secretary Clinton, you won the coin toss, so you'll go first. Our first question comes from Patrice Brock. Patrice?
Like Altheia Franklin, people who lose workplace insurance generally have 60 days from when their coverage ended to apply for an ACA plan. They can go to the federal HealthCare.gov or their state's health insurance website. Most states that run their own health insurance marketplaces have provided an extended sign-up period for people who lost coverage in the pandemic. The federal marketplace, serving most of the country, has not.
I don't have a vote on that issue, like I said, I'm trying to drain the swamp here, Hood said.
Cruz's response boils down to something like, Boehner? Boehner who?
Lesley Stahl: You called them idiots. I wonder if you think--
STEPHEN MILLER: I believe that's the likeliest outcome because Obamacare has always been unconstitutional and the mandate--
On the wealth tax, he said other countries that have used it show it does not work. On Medicare for All, Bloomberg said he supports updating Obamacare. I don't think Medicare for All is a solution to the problem. The real answer is to take Obamacare and you can tweak it, you can make it somewhat better, you can restore some of the cuts that were taken away, he said Tuesday. Medicare for All would destroy our hospital system, doctors wouldn't be able to make enough money to pay off their loans…The secret is people want to keep their private plans.
The lawsuit, filed in February by Texas and other GOP-led states, is in many ways a replay of the politically divided litigation that ended with the Supreme Court upholding the health care overhaul in 2012. In this case, California is leading a group of Democrat-led states in defending the law.
Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, has raised the idea of holding a Senate vote on Trump's plan to ban all Muslims from the U.S. McConnell suggested that if Democrats forced that vote through the amendment process, Republicans could counter that with votes on proposals offered by Hillary Clinton or Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vermont.
Vice President Mike Pence called on Congress this weekend to repeal Obamacare by this summer. Senate Republican leaders say they plan to pass their version of health care reform by the end of July.
Another candidate, Brandon Martin, shared his support on Facebook and said he is happy to hear, Mrs. Kirkpatrick, is seeking professional help to combat her illness and is taking the steps necessary to recover. I wish her, and her family the best as she begins her journey to a full recovery.
Interviews were conducted in English and Spanish using live interviewers. The data have been weighted to reflect U.S. Census figures on demographic variables.
What it will take to fix Social Security
McConnell stepped onto the stage to a smattering of boos and spoke for about one minute, only to briefly re-emerge when the president asked him to assure the crowd that the health care plan was looking good. McConnell peeked from behind a curtain and offered two thumbs up.
The relationship is very good, Mr. Trump said of his relationship with Chinese President Xi Jinping.
Scott Pelley: What does the data today tell you about the voter that leads you to believe that you can win?
John Culberson's on the House Appropriations Committee. He has secured funding, and we can't change horses in the middle of the race, she said.
Exclusions due to preexisting conditions were very unpopular before Obamacare, and eliminating them was one of its goals.
But yet, we know that talks are good, but I just don't see this president- when you look at what happened in Iran when he got out of that agreement and we were 10 minutes away from war and a month away from them blowing the caps when it comes to uranium- enriching uranium. When you look what he did with the nuclear agreement with Russia, he is constantly- climate change pulling us back from working with our allies to try to solve these problems.
ANTHONY SALVANTO: Actually they do. They make good on what they're telling us, most of them are telling us in the polling. Now, if we put that in the model it goes as high as two hundred and thirty-five seats so they get a little bump from that. However, let's suppose they don't show up and that's a reasonable assumption because they haven't done this before. And, frankly, sometimes people do over report this turnout propensity in the polling, right? So, if they don't show up, these are folks who maybe, they voted in the presidential, but they didn't typically vote in the last midterms in 2010, in 2014. If they don't show up then the Democrats don't make it, they don't get the two eighteen that they need and the Republicans hold the House. So, if they don't get that and the Democrats don't get quite as many of those crossover voters--those crossovers come back home a little bit to the Republican Party then the Reps still have a chance to hold it.
Bill Whitaker: People are scared. This is life or death for many people. And I think many Americans think that things aren't moving fast enough.
Trump outlines administration's immigration plan, says officials have met extensively with both parties
CRUZ: Asked to reconcile his vocal backing for the same bill (along with his attempt to improve its chances with an amendment), and his current claim to never have supported it, said; The fact that each amendment didn't fix every problem didn't mean that I supported the rest of the bill.
MARGARET BRENNAN: But it could if the Supreme Court upholds this ruling.
Carson warned that the U.S. will go down the tubes if Americans allow religion to be taken away.
This entire tax return debate is somewhat confounding to me, in the following sense: I don't think that it creates one job, gets one more individual who does not have health insurance covered by health insurance, particularly under the disaster that has been Obamacare with these private insurers pulling out our exchanges now and reporting billions of dollars of losses, she told CNN's Dana Bash.
Gorsuch sailed through his Senate confirmation to be a federal judge in 2006 on a voice vote, and was introduced by both the Republican (then-Sen. Wayne Allard) and Democratic (then-Sen. Ken Salazar) senators from his home state of Colorado. There were no dissenting votes. For his Supreme Court nomination, he will again be given a bipartisan home-state senator introduction -- this time by Republican Sen. Cory Gardner and Democratic Sen. Michael Bennet, though Bennet hasn't disclosed whether he plans to vote for him. Katyal is also slated to introduce Gorsuch.
The president's new economic advisor, Larry Kudlow, then came out and said that Haley had had some momentary confusion in announcing new sanctions. She fired back in a public statement that said, With all due respect, I don't get confused.
Donald Trump: I said some of them. Some of them are --
Atifa Robinson said, What's at stake for this election is racial equity, health equity, and social and economical equity.
It is fitting, he said, that with the demise of the Democratic majority, so many of those who have contempt for the private sector will soon find themselves back in it.
ROBERT O'BRIEN: There's no briefing that I've received, that the President has received, that says that President Putin is doing anything to try and influence the elections in favor of President Trump. We just haven't seen that intelligence.
MARGARET BRENNAN: And a-- a record number--
California Governor Gavin Newsom signed an executive order on Friday to ensure every registered voter in the state is automatically mailed a ballot ahead of the November general election. Mail-in-ballot is important, Newsom said. But he added that the executive order is not an exclusive substitute to physical locations. Secretary of State Alex Padilla, who is pushing for a 50-state vote-by-mail plan ahead of the general election, said this order makes California the first state in the nation to respond to COVID-19 by taking this action of sending every voter a ballot in the mail in advance of the November election. Padilla said the state will not force voters to choose between protecting their health and exercising their right to vote. Padilla also said postage for those mail-in ballots will be prepaid, so voters don't have to scramble last minute for a stamp. I think that is huge, Padilla said. There is no safer, physically healthier way to exercise your right to vote than from the safety and convenience of your own home, he added. Padilla also insisted this is not a vote-by-mail only election.
Asked how soon House Republicans could unite behind a plan to replace the Affordable Care Act, McCarthy said Friday in a CBS This Morning interview, I'm not going to put a set timeline on it because I want to make sure we get it right.
His desire for excellence is contagious, she said. He's always helped me be the best version of myself. That's a great quality to have in a father.
Sixty-five percent of Americans would favor offering everyone a government-run health plan like Medicare. It is supported by almost all Democrats (84 percent) and two-thirds of independents (67 percent) but is opposed by most Republicans (56 percent). Four in ten Republicans do favor it.
He said the heroes of his youth were President John F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King, Jr., but he switched to the Republican Party because of Ronald Reagan and signed on for the Reagan revolution.
The president and Republican party's fundraising includes $76 million raised over the four days of the Republican National Convention. According to the Trump campaign, August was the largest online fundraising month for the re-election effort ever.
Vice President Mike Pence: --brought the perspective of scientists all along the way. And I have-- I have a strong relationship with Dr. Fauci and Dr. Birx but remember, the president of the United States has to consider the whole of America. The president's been balancing the broad interests of the country—and the health of the American people, and we'll continue to do that every day.
The poll also gauged what issues and messages mattered most to voters, and found that the message of Republicans trying to take away healthcare resonated the most. Earlier this week, Mr. Trump said during a briefing that they want to terminate health care under Obamacare. The Supreme Court is set to hear a case led by Republican states this fall on whether to repeal parts or all of the Affordable Care Act. The DCCC poll found that 62% of respondents in districts with Republican incumbents had raised doubts about their lawmaker's handling of COVID-19, due to the ongoing battle against the ACA.
Donald Trump: It's done. It-- you have-- these cases have gone to the Supreme Court. They've been settled. And, I'm fine with that.
11:35 a.m. ET Donald Trump finally weighs in -- via his preferred social medium, Twitter -- on the controversy surrounding copied portions of Melania Trump's Monday night convention speech.
Still, the budget has plenty of less sweeping but significant proposed changes and cuts in Medicaid that would directly affect many recipients. Those include denying benefits to people who cannot prove their immigration status, increasing some emergency room co-payments and including the value of a person's property and belongings in addition to income for Medicaid eligibility.
JAMELLE BOUIE: Right, right, right, right.
Eric Trump: --it's a moment I'll never forget, I can tell you that. I mean, the team was around and everybody's cheering. And it was just-- it was-- it was a beautiful night.
Twice in the past two days, President Trump has addressed sexual assault allegations made against his presumed 2020 Democratic rival, Joe Biden. Mr. Trump told reporters Thursday testimony from Tara Reade could be false accusations, reports CBS News campaign reporter Nicole Sganga. He added, I have been falsely charged numerous times. And there is such a thing.
Lesley Stahl: So you never say to him, Come on?
But the state is fully removed from another, less high-profile case, challenging a federal rule that interpreted a ban on sex discrimination in the health care law as including gender identity and termination of pregnancy. Those protections for transgender people and women seeking abortions were challenged by a religious hospital network and Christian health care providers who argued the rule would require them to perform and provide insurance coverage for gender transitions and abortions contrary to their religious beliefs and medical judgment.
He will be an extraordinary President, is how House Speaker Nancy Pelosi began her endorsement video of Joe Biden on Monday, CBS News campaign reporter Bo Erickson reports. The speaker, who remained neutral during the Democratic primary, riddled off Biden's accomplishments as vice president, crediting him with helping to pass Obamacare and steering the rollout of the Recovery Act after the 2008 economic depression. On the trail, Biden spoke often about President Obama sending him to Capitol Hill to help bring together the priorities of the executive branch and Congress, a possible sign that Biden, when looking for a running mate, may want his own bridge between the Biden White House and the speaker's office. On Monday, Biden's public schedule was bare but he's planning to attend another virtual private fundraiser Monday evening. His campaign also released a lengthy statement on Monday retooling previous criticisms of the Trump administration's COVID-19 response, labeling problems related to testing the original sin of the effort.
Bill Daily NBC Actor Bill Daily (August 30, 1927-September 4, 2018) was an affable second-banana to astronaut Larry Hagman on the 1960s sitcom I Dream of Jeannie. A jazz musician and improv comic who had dyslexia, Daily had been in the background of a reading for the Jeannie pilot when producer Sidney Sheldon noticed him, and created the role of Roger Healey for Daily. He later played the next-door neighbor of Bob Newhart on the comedian's 1970s series, and psychiatrist Larry Dykstra on Alf. He also directed theater, and was a frequent panelist on Match Game. In a 2003 interview for the Television Academy Foundation, Daily said reading scripts was always difficult (no one knew he was dyslexic), and that he had trouble going up for commercial or movie auditions because he wouldn't be allowed to do improvs instead, and had to find other ways to impress others with humor. I'm incredibly lazy, and if I could read, I wouldn't have used that part of my brain that I have to use … if things were easy for me, I would never have gotten anywhere, I wouldn't have done anything.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, Bernie-- excuse me, sorry, Joe Biden, Dan, is making the argument for the good of the party that someone like him, he prefer him, should be the candidate not just for the Oval Office but because of all the down ballot races, essentially warning that Democrats are going to lose all leverage or influence or a majority certainly in-- in the House if they don't go with a more establishment candidate.
For too long, career politicians like Joe Donnelly have failed to put America first and fix bad trade deals, and Hoosiers have faced the consequences, Mike Braun said in a statement provided to CBS News. In life and in business there's the short-run and the long-run, and while Senator Donnelly wants our trade negotiations to 'end now,' I applaud President Trump's action to rectify the longstanding inequities in our trade relationships that have hurt Hoosier workers, and feel my experience in business would be a great asset to the administration in the Senate.
The gap between Ryan's reach and his grasp was especially stark this week. The Congressional Budget Office said Monday that the tax bill and last month's $1.3 trillion spending bill would add more than $2.6 trillion to the national debt over the coming decade — and the looming return of the first trillion-dollar deficits since President Barack Obama's first term.
The most vulnerable incumbent Democrats in the Senate have all endorsed Biden, though several candidates challenging incumbent Republicans in battleground states have yet to officially endorse. More than a dozen House Democrat Frontline members also have yet to endorse, which other Democratic campaign operatives and members tell CBS is a matter of timing, business with the pandemic or keeping their campaign hyper-local.
Although Mr. Trump delivered a massive tax cut, two Supreme Court Justices, and dozens of federal judges, last year an unsettled electorate handed the House back to the Democrats, and the Speaker's gavel back to Nancy Pelosi. Despite her misgivings, the Ukraine scandal drove Pelosi to seek the president's removal.
TRUMP: It is — our country has the slowest growth and jobs are a disaster.
-- Former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney blasted President Obama's policies across the board today, asserting that Democrats will lose their majority because their agenda has failed to support economic growth.
MARGARET BRENNAN: --it's good to have you in studio. I want to get to one of the lawmakers who's going to actually have to do what you're telling him he has to do.
Divided government isn't helping the deficit picture as the Democratic-controlled House led the way in repealing $377 billion worth of Obamacare tax hikes, including a so-called Cadillac tax on high-cost health plans. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., was also a driving force in last summer's budget accord, which is scored at adding $1.7 trillion to the deficit over the coming decade.
Overall, there are dramatic partisan splits on just about every measure, including both the President and the direction of the country overall.
Jeff Zients: Well I think that's a fair feeling this is life and death. We need to make sure that every day we're getting more and more people vaccinated, we're increasing the supply, we're increasing the number of vaccinations, we're increasing the places where people can go. So I understand the frustration. And we're doing all we can to move as fast as we can.
They didn't warn him, the way we usually would be required by the Department. They bypassed the Justice Department. They bypassed the protocols at the White House and so forth. These were things that persuaded me that there was not a legitimate counterintelligence investigation going on.
We don't want this, Mulvaney said. We do not want a shutdown.
Mike Bloomberg: I started watching and listening to the candidates. And they had ideas that made no sense to me whatsoever. Donald Trump is gonna eat 'em for lunch.
However, the Joint Committee on Taxation says down the road, by 2027, families making $50,000 to $75,000 per year will be paying more in taxes. Meanwhile, households earning $1 million per year would see their average tax rate decline to 30.4 percent in 2019, and they'd still be better off than they are now by 2027, paying an average rate of 31.7 percent, rather than the 32.1 percent under current law. -- Kate Rydell
As Biden, 76, heads to Iowa this week to address AARP voters and talk about rural healthcare access, the three-time presidential candidate will have the opportunity to explain additional elements of his policy, including repealing existing laws which prohibit Medicare from negotiating lower prices with drug corporations, allowing Americans to buy prescription drugs from other countries, and doubling the investment in community health centers.
LANHEE CHEN: Good point. Good point there. Because-- because-- because then that will give the American people some comfort about what's actually going on. I do think there is confusion right now. There is no question that there is confusion right now.

And with the idea that there may be recordings of this, I think escalates. It has been no surprise to anybody in Washington that Saudi Arabia has a very questionable record when it comes to human rights. But is this a bridge too far when it comes to these contracts? And you saw the discomfort in your interview with Marco Rubio with the way the President had expressed this concern as of these contracts over-- would necessarily override whatever you might want to do to sanction Saudi Arabia, if this is-- indeed is what happened.
Well, the answer to your question is yes. I thought the Justice Department argument was really flimsy, said Alexander.
His department, he told us, is focused on inoculating the most vulnerable and under-served communities hit hard by COVID, but he's having to prioritize. By that he means identifying the neediest of the needy for the life-saving shot.
A major part of President Trump's 2016 platform was focused on American manufacturing and trade deals that he argues cost American jobs. Biden, though, accused the president of breaking his promises, including a pledge from Mr. Trump in Warren in 2016 that no plants would close if he was elected.

SENATOR JOHN BARRASSO: And I want to work with additional Democrats, but what we're seeing right now from the Democrats side--and you see whether it was Bernie Sanders or so many of the Democrat candidates for president in 2020, they're talking about a different step away from Obamacare as well. They agree that Obamacare hasn't worked and they're talking about a program of a complete government takeover of healthcare, with increased taxes and fewer choices and longer lines. And that to me doesn't help people in the-- in the long run. I talked to people yesterday I was in Wyoming at a wreath ceremony, at our-- at our cemetery-- talked to somebody on Medicare. They said, we don't want Medicare for all, we paid into Medicare our whole life. This isn't the time to put more people onto that program. We want to make sure that that is saved and strengthened and-- and-- and held for people that are already on the program and have paid in over their lifetime.
The party constantly lied about Obamacare, they constantly claimed they cared about the national debt, and meanwhile the national debt continued to go up while Republicans were in power, he said. And it made Republicans even more cynical, the Republican voters more cynical so that when Trump arrived, they were desperate for someone to wreck the system.
MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be right back with our political panel.
This message of the ad mirrors Biden's criticism on the trail about his Democratic rivals' desire to scrap the law and start over with a single-payer Medicare for All policy, something Biden has slammed as unrealistic.
He told the magazine he believes Democrats lost the presidency in 2016 because they failed to listen. I would say we get the government we deserve in a democracy, he said. And if we want better government we have to engage, and a lot of folks have been disengaging for a long time, and not without reason.
Another problem, Gregg said, might be restrictions that any Roark debt might carry, known as covenants. They could limit the ability of Roark to repurchase Puzder's stake, he noted. This can get very difficult.
In a White House address, Mr. Trump called appointing justices to the Supreme Court the most important decision an American president can make, suggesting he might name as many as four justices if he wins a second term in office. For this reason, candidates for president owe the American people a specific list of individuals they consider for the United States Supreme Court, Mr. Trump remarked.
Kavanaugh, in accepting the nomination, talked briefly about the role of judges. My judicial philosophy is straightforward, he said. A judge must be independent and must interpret the law, not make the law. A judge must interpret statutes as written. And a judge must interpret the Constitution as written, informed by history and tradition and precedent.

With the economy already operating close to its full potential, and concerns mounting over further pro-cyclical fiscal measures, it's less important for Congress to be able to easily pass major legislation, including additional tax cuts that could further widen the deficit, UBS wrote. In that scenario, split-party control could be good for the markets, since it reduces the chance of any major legislation becoming law and unintentionally harming the economy.
I have great respect for Mayor Pete and his service to this nation, Biden said. But I do believe it's a risk — to be just straight up with you — for this party and to nominate someone who's never held an office higher than mayor of a town of 100,000 people in Indiana.
Before the passage of the ACA, employers used to benefit from offering the expensive plans because they were not taxed on employee health care benefits, while they are taxed on the salaries they pay their employees. Labor unions, in particular, disliked the tax because they're known for their generous health care benefits, and they have argued that the 40% tax would affect their members.
The FBI later found 14,900 emails that Clinton had not handed over among the deleted files. The FBI said that Clinton's emails were deleted sometime between March 25 and 31, 2015, which was after Clinton was subpoenaed by the House of Representatives on March 4, 2015.
But a year later, simmering battles between the Trump and McConnell wings of the GOP seem to be taking a back seat to the party's drive to save the Republican majority in Congress.

Arguments in the case are scheduled to span one hour. Many judicial groups are working to make the Supreme Court a motivating issue for voters and believe the next president could have the opportunity to fill a vacancy on the court.
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: It was a big ruling. It's a great ruling for our country.

The biggest problem I have with the stupidity of our foreign policy, we have Mosul. They think a lot of the ISIS leaders are in Mosul. So we have announcements coming out of Washington and coming out of Iraq, we will be attacking Mosul in three weeks or four weeks.

Charlotte Rae NBC Charlotte Rae (April 22, 1926-August 5, 2018) played a wise and patient housemother to a brood of teenage girls (including Nancy McKeon, Mindy Cohn and Lisa Whelchel) on the long-running sitcom The Facts of Life. After studying drama at Northwestern University, Rae moved to New York and quickly found work doing satirical sketches in Greenwich Village clubs. That led to the Broadway musicals Three Wishes for Jamie, The Threepenny Opera, Li'l Abner, and Pickwick, and the Israel Horovitz play Morning, Noon and Night. (She received Tony nominations for the last two.) Her TV credits included The U.S. Steel Hour, ''Playhouse 90 and Car 54, Where Are You? Film appearances include Woody Allen's Bananas, Hair and Ricki and the Flash. Rae originated the character of Mrs. Garrett in 1978 in the NBC comedy Diff'rent Strokes, then took her to the spinoff show that premiered the following year. It would run for nine seasons, though Rae (who earned an Emmy nomination for the role) left the show after seven. At a 2014 reunion of the Facts of Life cast in Los Angeles, Rae told CBS News, I don't think any of us realized how much impact at the time it had on people. But we're getting the message now!

SEN. KLOBUCHAR: I would first acknowledge to the American people very clearly the problem here. The surveillance, the intellectual property violations are basically stealing our blueprints, what they have done when it comes to subsidizing industries and manipulating their currency. The second thing that I would do is to work with our allies and to push them, and I wouldn't have just walk away from every negotiating table, months goes by. I think you have to keep at it methodically. And mostly, I wouldn't have used the approach they've used. Yes, targeted tariffs, but they have used basically a meat cleaver or maybe we should call it a tweet cleaver when it comes to how they're dealing with these other countries.
The Department of Labor announced Thursday that 1.4 million Americans applied for unemployment insurance benefits last week, CBS News campaign reporter LaCrai Mitchell reports. Oklahoma, Texas, New Jersey, New York and Louisiana saw the largest increases in unemployment applications when compared to the rest of the country. In May, CBS News reported that nearly 3.2 million Americans had applied for unemployment insurance benefits. Weeks later forecasters were confounded when the unemployment rate fell to 13.3% and the Labor Department announced that employers had added 2.5 million jobs in May, after months of Americans taking economic hits due to the coronavirus pandemic. Still, unemployment figures are just one measure of the economic toll that Americans have endured throughout the pandemic. And as Mitchell reported earlier this week in CBS News COVID Chronicles, small business owners in battleground states like Florida are still recovering from the negative economic impacts of COVID-19.
All of this could actually help Democrats.

Nathaniel Reed CBS News Environmental advocate Nathaniel Reed (July 22, 1933-July 11, 2018) worked to publicize the dangers of DDT, founded the powerful group 1,000 Friends of Florida, and helped lead the Everglades Foundation and the Florida Conservation Coalition. In the late 1960s Reed, a Republican, worked with Florida's Republican governor, Claude Kirk, to block construction of what would have been the world's largest airport in the Big Cypress Swamp, destroying much of the Everglades. In 2016 Reed told CBS News' Jeff Glor that blocking the airport plan was vital to protecting the state: This is the beginning of the end. If this goes forward, kiss the Keys goodbye, kiss Florida Bay goodbye … kiss South Florida goodbye. Reed later became assistant secretary for Fish and Wildlife and Parks at the Department of the Interior under Presidents Nixon and Ford. In that role, Reed helped preserve more than 100 million acres of parks and wildlife refuges in Alaska, and worked with Congress to shape legislation that also included the Marine Mammal Protection Act, the Endangered Species Convention, and key amendments to the Clean Water Act.
I think the losers are Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer because now they own Obamacare, Mr. Trump said. They own it. Hundred percent own it. And this is not a Republican healthcare, this is not anything but a Democrat healthcare and they have Obamacare for a little while longer until it ceases to exist, which it will at some point in the near future.
But in a marked contrast from his rhetoric in the early days of his administration, Mr. Trump also tried to sound optimistic about the country's trajectory and enthusiastic about working with Democrats. At times, the speech even took on the feel of a pep rally for America, with Republicans briefly chanting USA! as the president spoke.
If the whole ACA really is unconstitutional then let's just get everyone health care like other developed countries do. Come to think of it, let's do that regardless, Buttigieg said.

The special sign-up opportunity is only a down payment on health insurance for Mr. Biden, who has promised to build on former President Barack Obama's health law to push the U.S. toward coverage for all. For that he'd need congressional approval, and opposition to the health law still runs deep among Republicans.
Republican Karen Handel, 55, served as Georgia's secretary of State from 2007-2010. She resigned in 2010 to run for governor, losing a runoff to Nathan Deal, who went on to win the general election. Handel also ran for U.S. Senate in 2014 and came in third in the GOP primary. Outside of public office, she worked as vice president of public policy for the Susan G. Komen for the Cure from 2011-2012, resigning after Komen reversed its controversial move to cut ties with Planned Parenthood, a move that happened under Handel's watch. She has also served as chairman of the Fulton County Board of Commissioners, and deputy chief of staff to former Gov. Sonny Perdue.
So, once again, go to HillaryClinton.com. We have literally Trump — you can fact check him in real time. Last time at the first debate, we had millions of people fact checking, so I expect we'll have millions more fact checking, because, you know, it is — it's just awfully good that someone with the temperament of Donald Trump is not in charge of the law in our country.
As a 20-something in Washington, Ryan worked for the Empower America think tank, and in Congress his fiscal ideas often performed better on paper than they did in the realpolitik world of Capitol Hill. For instance, Ryan for years had promised that tax reform would include big income and corporate rate cuts paid for by wiping away popular tax breaks.

CLINTON: Well, within hours I said that I was sorry about the way I talked about that, because my argument is not with his supporters. It's with him and with the hateful and divisive campaign that he has run, and the inciting of violence at his rallies, and the very brutal kinds of comments about not just women, but all Americans, all kinds of Americans.
BEN DOMENECH: --which is exactly why we saw what happened this week. I mean, the-- the President, we have to keep in mind that his role within this kind of shutdown potential battle is going to be different than other Republicans when Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi showed up at the White House and said the word, shutdown, as if it was this magical incantation that would make the President back off, he clearly leaned into it instead. And I think that that factors into his calculation. Now he may be alone in that calculus, one of the factors that I think we have to keep in mind here is that Mick Mulvaney, the incoming chief of staff, may have some strong opinions about the shutdown. We don't know potentially what those are and that could factor into the way the White House plays this.

But as a doctor, I will tell you, I focus on people with preexisting conditions, I've always been focused as I was working on health care legislation to make sure people could get the care they need from a doctor that they choose at lower costs. And we didn't get that in Wyoming. We had-- after Obamacare was passed, many people lost their insurance, premiums doubled. So, that wasn't-- that doesn't give people affordable insurance that's appropriate for them and their families.

When they learned he was a famous admiral's son, they tried to release him for propaganda purposes but he refused to go until the other prisoners were freed.
KELSEY SNELL: I would say that depending upon who you talk to, the-- the guess is about fifty-fifty or maybe a little bit less than fifty-fifty that a shutdown will happen. There really is still the possibility that they could pass something short term, not a big spending bill that gets them through the end of the year on that remaining twenty-five percent of the government. But something sort, maybe until the middle of January or the beginning of February just to give them some breathing room and to keep negotiating. That seems the likeliest scenario right now because it's the easiest thing to write and the easiest thing to pass.

Let me also show you, young people, core of Bernie Sanders' coalition, very well with them again. And let me also show you labor union households where he also won despite some back and forth controversy during the campaign.

In hindsight, the Democrats' big mistake (as many of them now admit) was doing exactly what they're considering today: a drastic change made to a fundamental rule in our democratic system in response to a partisan political moment. Yes, Republicans were making it tough to get Obama's court picks through in 2013. But protecting the rights of the minority party was a larger part of protecting how our democracy works.

I mean he is somebody who is willing to say what he thinks. He is the youngest person running, but, yet, he seems to be among the most mature. He is-- he is coming at this with-- with values. He is putting policy on the table. He's been very strong campaigner. I think for vice president Biden, the danger I think a lot of people see in him is that he-- this presidential experience may take away all the luster he built up over the time that he was vice president to Barack Obama, which would then remove him from being kind of a-- a statesman for the Democratic Party. He could run a campaign, he could win, it could all be fine, or it could be a big disaster.
I'm just going to be me. And she'll be her and let people make their judgements. I have great respect for her, Biden told a group of reporters during a recent campaign stop in South Carolina.

Warren on Monday called on Americans to contact their representatives and demand that an essential workers bill of rights be included in the next coronavirus relief package. Warren, who with Representative Ro Khanna released two weeks ago a set of criteria to add protections and benefits for essential workers, also asked essential workers to make a short video to share what their job has been like, according to CBS news campaign reporter Zak Hudak. Warren's website now includes a page with a script for calling your representative to ask for front line worker protections, and the site will automatically dial the representative if you put your address in. On a livestream calling for action, Warren and Khanna were joined by Representatives Ayanna Pressley and Deb Haaland, both of whom were co-chairs for Warren's presidential campaign. We've got plenty of ways to get you in the fight because the essential workers Bill of Rights is one very tangible way that we can help level the playing field just a little, said Warren.
Even though the Obama adminstration's directive doesn't impose legal requirements, schools that don't comply could lose their federal funding.
Meanwhile, the progressive organization ACRONYM is kicking off the first wave of an $11 million voter registration and mobilization effort. The campaign called People's Power Grab, aims to register and turnout 100,000 people of color across eight states including Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Texas, and Wisconsin. This week, the group is launching a $250,000 digital ad buy as part of its effort. ACRONYM's campaign comes as the organization hopes to fill the void with on-the-ground voter registration efforts taking a hit due to the coronavirus pandemic. The campaign will include ads through Election Day on platforms such as Snapchat, Instagram, Facebook, YouTube, and TikTok, as well as on streaming services and other less traditional platforms. While the People's Power Grab registration effort is nonpartisan, ACRONYM is affiliated with PACRONYM, a committee launched in an effort to take on Donald Trump.
ANDERSON COOPER: Would you meet with Kim Jong-un?
Lesley Stahl: But you're talking about 100 days. This president's been in office for two years plus.
The Supreme Court is scheduled to hear arguments in a case challenging the Affordable Care Act one week after the election, giving Republicans an incentive to quickly approve Barrett's nomination and install her on the high court.
SENATOR JOHN BARRASSO: I think government never does big things really well. I'm for more of a step-by-step and I want to start with the first step of people with preexisting conditions. My wife Bobbi is a breast cancer survivor. She's been through three operations, chemotherapy twice and I will tell you as a husband, as well as a doctor, I am committed to helping people with preexisting conditions. We can do that, there are a number of ways to do it. One is what Maine has done in terms of their high-risk people helping with them with additional subsidies. But at the same time, then it allows insurance to be much cheaper, more affordable for other people. So, I want to do-- our-- our children's health insurance plan that works across the country. It works so well because states have a bigger say in that. When I was in our state Senate in Wyoming, we knew that what we wanted to do in Wyoming may not fit what people would want in New York State. But if you give states that flexibility and freedom to do what works best with the money, I think it works much better for families and for patients.
The military was depleted, Mr. Trump said in his February news conference in the White House Rose Garden. And if we don't have a strong military — that hopefully we won't have to use because it's strong — if we don't have a strong military, you don't have to worry about debt; you have bigger problems. So I have to straighten out the military. That's why I did the $700- and $716 billion. But growth will straighten it out.
Her plan also aims to address mental health care for seniors by pushing for suicide prevention campaigns, expansion of access to treatment and increased training for medical professionals to better identify mental health issues at an earlier rate.
Bill Whitaker: So how much more are you able to make?
7:30 a.m. ET The Republican party's national convention kicks off today. Here are some helpful links to keep up with the goings-on in Cleveland:
We want every American to know the dignity of a hard day's work. We want every child to be safe in their home at night. And we want every citizen to be proud of this land that we all love so much. We can lift our citizens from welfare to work, from dependence to independence, and from poverty to prosperity.
It reads: Fall-out from the most recent primaries makes it abundantly clear that we must act now to ensure every citizen can freely and fairly vote in the upcoming general election. CBS News correspondent Nikole Killion reports the congressional push is also coupled with a public petition organized by the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, All Voting is Local and its 'And Still I Rise' campaign. The organization held a virtual discussion on voting rights Wednesday night with Knowles-Lawson and the mothers of Trayvon Martin, Eric Garner and Ahmaud Arbery.
John McCain: Yes. But, as you know, doctors are interesting.
Hey, if she had a problem — for 30 years she's been doing this, Anderson. I say it all the time. She talks about health care. Why didn't she do something about it? She talks about taxes. Why didn't she do something about it? She doesn't do anything about anything other than talk. With her, it's all talk and no action.
SENATOR RICK SCOTT: I grew up in a very poor family. I watched my mom cry that she couldn't get health care for my brother.
Per the statement, Kirkpatrick's office will still be fully operational and that her positions on votes will be submitted to Congressional Record.
Health care was the number one issue in the 2018 midterms, and the persistent messaging on the issue helped flip the House to Democratic control. Democrats targeted Republicans who voted to repeal the Affordable Care Act with no plan to replace it, and those who supported the ongoing lawsuit in Texas claimed the ACA is unconstitutional.
This story was produced by Richard Bonin. Ayesha Siddiqi, associate producer.
California's attorney general represents a coalition of mostly Democratic-led states and the District of Columbia seeking to overturn O'Connor's ruling and uphold the law. The House of Representatives has joined them. Among the arguments by the law's supporters: Those who filed suit have no case because they aren't harmed by a penalty that doesn't exist; the reduction of the tax penalty to zero could be read as a suspension of the tax, but the tax's legal structure still exists; and that, even if the individual mandate is now unconstitutional, that does not affect the rest of the law known as the Affordable Care Act.
Presidential budgets tend to reprise many of the same elements year after year. While details aren't out yet, Trump's budget is likely to curb crop insurance costs, cut student loan subsidies, reduce pension benefits for federal workers, and cut food stamps, among other proposals.
Mike Bloomberg: Well, I'm making an investment in this country. My investment is I'm going to remove President Trump from 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue or at least try as hard as I can.
Health care is on their mind every day, and I understand that, Tucker said of area voters in an interview.
Kethledge has been described as an originalist and a textualist — someone who will stick with the original believed intent of the Constitution, and for laws as written. But asked about his views of the Constitution and how he would describe himself during a Senate confirmation hearing in 2008, Kethledge said he doesn't really have a label.
In a digital livestream on Monday, Biden touted his role in passing the Affordable Care Act. In the middle of one of the largest public health emergencies in generations, the White House and Republican Attorney Generals are actively pursuing a lawsuit to invalidate the ACA in court. They're working to strip millions of Americans of their healthcare, and tens of millions of their protections for pre-existing conditions, he said. The Democratic presidential frontrunner sent a letter to Mr. Trump on Monday, requesting the Trump administration withdraw the lawsuit, reports CBS News campaign reporter Bo Erickson. The litigation you are supporting — Texas v. U.S. — jeopardizes every single one of those protections and threatens the peace of mind and access to care for hundreds of millions of Americans, reads the letter reads. There is no underlying constitutional flaw with the Affordable Care Act. In fact, the Supreme Court twice upheld the constitutionality of the law.

No — Trump has decided he'd rather destroy President Obama's legacy than protect the health care of millions upon millions of Americans, Biden said. His statement was one of many released by Democratic party officials, lawmakers and state leaders as the case moves forward.
FACT CHECK: True. In 2015, the US had a negative $762.565 billion balance of payments, according to the Census Bureau, though it's worth noting that the total deficit, which factors in both goods and services, is only negative $500.361 billion.
Kayleigh McEnany: Lesley, the president wanted me to deliver his health care plan, it's a little heavy.
I am asking both parties to come together to give us safe, fast, reliable, and modern infrastructure that our economy needs and our people deserve.
Wow, but not surprisingly, ObamaCare was just ruled UNCONSTITUTIONAL by a highly respected judge in Texas. Great news for America! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 15, 2018
Jeff Zients: I wanna start by giving credit where credit is due, which is to the scientists and the researchers and the people who participated in the clinical trials. It enabled us to have two vaccines ready in really a record-period of time and these two vaccines are very effective. So that was the good news. The bad news is there really was no plan to ramp up the supply of those vaccines. So there wasn't enough vaccine. There were not enough vaccinators, people actually take vaccine and turn it into vaccinations by putting needles into arms. And then third there just were not enough places for people to get vaccinated. There was no comprehensive plan or strategy--

MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. We do have to leave it there. Thanks to all of you for joining us this week.
MARGARET BRENNAN: That's the President at a Friday rally in Las Vegas claiming that reports of Russia interfering in his favor was Democratic disinformation. When we were in Las Vegas Saturday I spoke with the White House National Security Adviser Robert O'Brien, who was in our Washington studio. I asked him if he had assured the President that this particular U.S. intelligence finding was real. He strongly disputed it.
A former field organizer for Mike Bloomberg's campaign filed a lawsuit in federal court on Monday against the former presidential candidate. The lawsuit alleges the White House hopeful reneged on promises that staff would be guaranteed employment through November 2020. The billionaire had earned plaudits over the weekend for donating millions to the Democratic party from his now-shuttered campaign, after spending nearly one billion dollars on the bid. But Bloomberg's transfer also triggered outrage among some former staffers, many who claim they were promised jobs on a super PAC he has now abandoned plans to fund. Given the current crisis, a fund is being created to ensure that all staff receive healthcare through April, which no other campaign has done, a spokesperson for Bloomberg's campaign told CBS News campaign reporter Alex Tin in a statement. And many field staff will go on to work for the DNC in battleground states, in part because the campaign made the largest monetary transfer to the DNC from a Presidential campaign in history to support the DNC's organizing efforts.
There are gubernatorial primaries in Colorado, Maryland and Oklahoma. In Colorado, eight candidates -- four Republicans and four Democrats -- are vying to replace outgoing Democratic Gov. John Hickenlooper. In Maryland, eight candidates are vying to compete against incumbent Republican Gov. Larry Hogan.

Kennedy already has an active virtual campaign for the Senate race including bi-weekly Kennedy Evening Broadcasts, Weekly Wednesday Q&A, and live social media check-ins.
From rural farmers' markets to in-town fish fries, the talk now is of the Supreme Court nomination and how it's amplified the election.
But it's on the question of materiality that we feel really that a crime cannot be established here because there was not, in our view, a legitimate investigation going on. They did not have a basis for a counterintelligence investigation against Flynn at that stage, based on a perfectly legitimate and appropriate call he made as a member of the transition. So.
Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul has called the repeal-and-replace plan Obamacare Lite and is actively working to defeat it.

House Speaker Paul Ryan calls Haley the exact right choice...in a year when the country is crying out for a positive vision and alternative to the status quo.
The math is not favorable to the Democrats. They have very vulnerable incumbents in other states, to be able to flip this seat would be a big deal for them in trying to take over the Senate. There are going to be tremendous resources spent here. -- Jon Ralston, Editor of The Nevada Independent
Certainly the Bush family -- well we would've like to have had them, he said. But, they are part of the past...we are dealing with the future.

And more importantly, that was after getting a subpoena. That wasn't before. That was after. She got it from the United States Congress. And I'll be honest, I am so disappointed in congressmen, including Republicans, for allowing this to happen.
Much of the speech focused on Trump's conviction that the U.S. is getting bilked by other countries, allies and enemies alike.
MARGARET BRENNAN: And you're making that point because--
New cases on any of those issues could be before the court soon and, even if Roberts is not prepared to overrule major Supreme Court precedents, he could be in position to cut back on environmental protections as well as gay rights and abortion rights.
Her staff was quick to change the header image on her Twitter account to a rainbow-striped history, featuring her logo's signature letter, following the ruling.
TRUMP: It was locker room talk, as I told you. That was locker room talk. I'm not proud of it. I am a person who has great respect for people, for my family, for the people of this country. And certainly, I'm not proud of it. But that was something that happened.
While coronavirus cases are on an upward trend in multiple states, governors in the south are seeing especially high spikes. In Texas, Governor Greg Abbott paused their reopening after seeing 5,551 new cases Wednesday and 13 days of increasing hospitalizations reports CBS News political unit broadcast associate Aaron Navarro. In a release, the Republican governor also put a stop on elective surgeries.
In the history of CBS News polling, Trump's approval rating has varied the least of any president during a first year going back to Ronald Reagan, when the poll began routinely tracking job approval. The partisan splits have proved as durable as they are wide.

They work in every trade. They sacrifice to raise a family. They care for our children at home. They defend our flag abroad. And they are strong moms and brave kids. They are firefighters, and police officers, and border agents, medics, and Marines. But above all else, they are Americans. And this Capitol, this city, this nation, belongs entirely to them.
Melania Trump: I didn't do that for two years already, so you know, it will just continue. It's another level, but it will continue.
With control of the U.S. Senate at stake, Democrats need to hold on to seats in states Donald Trump won in 2016. Sen. Claire McCaskill of Missouri holds one of these seats and is one of this year's most vulnerable senate Democrats.
I have confidence we'll pass this, said Ryan at his weekly news conference. I feel our members understand the gravity of the situation.
Given his comments on unity, the president could be pulling away from Twitter momentarily to allow space for his message to ring without further distraction.
The GOP plan emerging in the House would mean less government, and many fear that will translate to less coverage and a step backward as a nation. Still, there would be new options for middle-class people who buy their own policies but don't now qualify for help under the ACA. Some popular provisions such as allowing young adults to stay on a parental plan remain untouched.
Looking ahead to Tuesday's primary and beyond to the subsequent early-voting states, Biden signaled to his rivals and the national press corps that he is committed to winning the nomination.
Julián Castro Julián Castro launches 2020 campaign 08:32 Biography Julián Castro was born one minute before his identical twin brother, Joaquin, in San Antonio, Texas, in 1974. His mother, Maria, was a Chicana political activist whom Castro has credited for motivating him and his brother to choose careers in public service. Joaquin Castro is currently a congressman. Castro attended Stanford University and Harvard Law School, along with his brother. He was elected to the San Antonio City Council in 2001 at the age of 26, making him the youngest council member in San Antonio history. He unsuccessfully ran for mayor in 2005, but won when he ran again in 2009. He was re-elected twice, in 2011 and 2013. Castro's profile rose when he was chosen to give the keynote speech at the 2012 Democratic National Convention, the first Hispanic person to do so. In 2014, President Obama named Castro Housing and Urban Development secretary. During the 2016 election, he was among those considered a possible vice presidential nominee for Hillary Clinton, although Clinton eventually chose Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine. Castro laid the groundwork for a 2020 presidential bid throughout 2018, visiting New Hampshire and publishing a memoir, An Unlikely Journey: Waking Up from My American Dream, in October. He announced the creation of an exploratory committee for a presidential run Dec. 12 and officially announced his candidacy for president Jan. 12. Castro and his wife, Erica, have two children. Castro's tenure at HUD was marked by a focus on fair housing issues.
Donald Trump: You know, I'll conduct myself-- in a very good manner, but depends on what the situation is, sometimes you have to be rougher. When I look at-- when I look at the world and you look at how various places are taking advantage of our country, and I say it, and I say it very proudly, it's going to be America first. It's not going to be what we're doing—we, we've lost-- we're losing this country. We're losing this country. That's why I won the election. And by the way, won it easily, I mean I won easily. That was big, big.
We should not have gone into Iraq, Trump said. I mean, he was the president, he took us into Iraq, when you look at the migration, when you look at all of the problems in the Middle East, it all started by going into Iraq.

Conway added that the way to speak to women and all Americans is through issues. We have to get away from the content-free campaign and on to the substance and talk to the people who are struggling.
A new CBS News Battleground Tracker poll released Sunday found that for voters in battleground House districts, health care is the issue they may be the least willing to compromise on. Three in four say a candidate must agree with them on health care to get their vote. Health care may be more of a make-or-break issue for Democrats. Eighty-four percent of Democrats say a candidate must agree with them on health care to earn their support, compared to 70 percent of Republicans.
The grassroots-funded political action committee told CBS News political unit associate producer Sarah Ewall-Wice its bottom line is to get Democrats to the polls.
MARGARET TALEV (Bloomberg News/@margarettalev): Yeah. But shutdown light happens to affect border agents and TSA agents at a time of the year when both of those issues, one for travel reasons, the other for political and policy reasons are very much on everyone's mind. There are kind of two factors that I see at play here, and one is that the President himself has been fascinated with the idea of how to use a shutdown to get a message across for months. Maybe for more than a year, let's say, basically since the beginning of the administration. So, inside the White House as well as on the Hill, a lot of Republicans are like, don't do it, it's a bad idea, and-- and he keeps-- he is so attracted to the idea. On the other hand, he wants to be having the fight with Democrats, not with his own party. It's easier to have the fight with Democrats when Democrats are in charge. So, I think if there's a patch of four weeks or something like that, that's the fight that he gets to have. And-- and maybe that's the way this will shake out.
His opinions were must-reads for his clear, colorful writing -- like his dissent calling the decision upholding a part of Obamacare jiggery pokery and pure applesauce.
Washington — When the Supreme Court kicks off its new term on Monday, it will do so against the backdrop of a high-stakes confirmation battle as the Senate considers the nomination of Judge Amy Coney Barrett to succeed the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg on the high court. But adding to the political storm set to envelop the Supreme Court is the November presidential election, the outcome of which President Trump is predicting could be determined by the justices.

Donald Trump: I'll be honest, from my standpoint zero, zero. And that's strange. I'm actually surprised to tell you that. It's-- you know, a little bit strange.
Mr. Obama also mocked GOP skepticism of climate change, stating, Sixty years ago, when the Russians beat us into space, we didn't deny Sputnik was up there. Later in his remarks, the president added, Look, if anybody still wants to dispute the science around climate change, have at it. You'll be pretty lonely,

Russian and Syrian airstrikes have been targeted at rebel-held areas of Syria, not in regions controlled by ISIS. A Syrian opposition monitoring group found that 9,364 rebels had been killed by Russian air strikes in the last year, according to the Washington Post.

The pro-Trump America First Action PAC launched a new round of TV ads in Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania Friday taking aim at Joe Biden. It's part of the group's $10 million investment in the battleground states through the end of May. In Michigan, an ad titled China Prosperity has clips of Biden praising China; in Wisconsin, an ad titled Stop China also uses video of Biden remarks to accuse the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee of trying to protect China amid the coronavirus outbreak; and in Pennsylvania, the ad titled Travel Ban uses a clip of Biden criticizing the China travel ban. It's the latest in a series of efforts to paint Biden as aligned with China over U.S. interests. At the same time, Democratic groups have made similar efforts to tie Trump with China as well for his initial praise of China's coronavirus response.

So we were really happy, I mean, it was-- these are great people.

Melvin Dummar AP Photo Melvin Dummar (August 28, 1944-December 9, 2018) maintained that in late December 1967, he found an unshaved man with long stringy hair and baggy clothes face-down and bloody on a dirt road near Lida, Nevada. The man claimed to be Howard Hughes, an aviation and business tycoon who spent years in seclusion. He told me who he was, but I didn't believe him, Dummar told the AP in 2006. I thought he was just a bum or a prospector or something. Dummar ended up driving the man nearly 190 miles to Las Vegas before giving him some pocket change and dropping him off behind the Sands Hotel. About eight years later, after Hughes died, a handwritten will, rife with misspellings, was dropped off at Dummar's gas station, addressed to the Mormon Church. The will named the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints as beneficiary of $156 million – a 1/16 share of the Hughes estate – and also bequeathed $156 million to Dummar for rescuing him in the desert. For years Dummar, whose story was depicted in the 1980 film Melvin and Howard (starring Paul Le Mat as Dummar and Jason Robards as Hughes), fought legal battles over the authenticity of the will. Jurors and judges decided against him. I've been called everything from a crook to a forger, Dummar told the AP in 2007 in Utah, where he was then running a business selling frozen meat.
Donald Trump: What we are going to do is get the people that are criminal and have criminal records, gang members, drug dealers, we have a lot of these people, probably two million, it could be even three million, we are getting them out of our country or we are going to incarcerate. But we're getting them out of our country, they're here illegally. After the border is secured and after everything gets normalized, we're going to make a determination on the people that you're talking about who are terrific people, they're terrific people but we are gonna make a determination at that-- But before we make that determination-- Lesley, it's very important, we want to secure our border.
The court also ruled that voters can return ballots by hand to drop boxes set up by counties. The Pennsylvania State Department allowed the drop boxes in the primary, but the Trump campaign asked a federal court to ban them. After the state Democratic Party filed a parallel lawsuit asking the Commonwealth Court to explicitly allow them, the federal court judge stayed the Trump campaign's case to let state courts make a ruling on the issue. The state Supreme Court used its King's Bench authority to overtake the case and ruled in favor of Democrats. Additionally, the court denied a request from the Trump campaign to allow out-of-county poll watchers. But it sided with the Trump campaign on so-called naked ballots, ruling that ballots missing a secrecy envelope should not be counted. It also ruled that third parties cannot return ballots for voters, a decision Mr. Trump praised in a tweet. Read more about the Green Party decision and its implications here and the court's other rulings here.
I do think the use of special forces, which we're using, the use of enablers and trainers in Iraq, which has had some positive effects, are very much in our interests, and so I do support what is happening, but let me just...
In an apparent concession to Bernie Sanders, presumptive Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton plans to back the creation of a public-option insurance plan under Obamacare and allow Americans at the age of 55 to enroll in Medicare.
Eric Trump: So we'll-- we'll-- we'll be in New York and we'll take care of the business. I think we're going to have a lot of fun doing it. And we're going to make him very proud.

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Joe, what the hell is wrong with you, Joe? Sleepy Joe.
Suggestions from Democratic Senate leader Chuck Schumer that Trump should pick an Obama-backed liberal jurist like Merrick Garland aren't just politically ridiculous, they're anti-democratic. Millions of Americans voted for Trump in part because they didn't want Hillary Clinton picking judges.
She said there wasn't the same level of tribal warfare in politics when she was first elected.
West Virginia has been hurt by lying liberal Joe Manchin putting the interest of Washington liberals ahead of the health care and gun rights of West Virginians, said Morrisey for Senate spokesperson Nathan Brand in the statement. Joe Manchin has a D rating from the [National Rifle Association], and voted against President Trump's efforts to repeal and replace Obamacare. Lying liberal Joe has been wrong for West Virginia.
As the only incumbent Republican senator running in a state that Hillary Clinton won in 2016, Heller would much rather focus on tax reform and the economy than immigration or repealing Obamacare -- which Republicans have so far failed to do. Heller supported the comprehensive immigration reform bill in 2013, which the president and his allies have assailed. And although he ultimately supported Mr. Trump's Obamacare repeal efforts, he did so only after much public deliberation, taking hits from the left and the right, both left unsatisfied in a state that expanded Medicaid.
JONAH GOLDBERG: Yeah. The fight will be over who gets to define the terms.
JANICE JACKSON: Well, right now, we're in the middle of negotiations that have really heated up over the past couple of weeks. Our goal is to reopen schools as planned tomorrow on February 1st for students in our K through eighth grades. It's also important to note we did bring back our early childhood students and some of our students with disability-- disabilities earlier this month and had real good success with reopening. So we are looking forward to restarting again.
MAYOR FRANCIS SUAREZ: Yeah, it's awful. And I think, you know, we don't control all the vaccine that's being administered. We control about seven thousand of the twenty-two thousand that are being administered countywide. A lot of them are being administered by the hospital system and by other organizations that we don't control. We are very faithful about making sure that we're asking for identification, that people have a Florida ID because we think it's disrespectful. I mean, we have people in this community that are living here that are-- are, you know, dying, frankly, and, you know, they want and they deserve to have priority. If they're vulnerable, we need to get them vaccinated as quickly as possible to make sure that they can live peaceful and enjoyable lives without worry.
I'm running for president because we need dreamers in Washington but we also need to get things done, Hickenlooper says in the video. I've proven again and again I can bring people together to produce the progressive change Washington has failed to deliver. As governor, Hickenlooper also signed an expansion of Medicaid in 2013. He has not expressed support for a single-payer health system. Hickenlooper has opposed a number of Trump administration policies, including plans to scale back on federal coal emission restrictions, and has been generally critical of the president's approach to business. Over the summer, he called for an investigation into the separation of thousands of children from their families at the border, and he opposed the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court. What Trump says President Trump has not tweeted about or insulted Hickenlooper so far.
Park worries that with funding for only six years, the CHIP program will go through this all over again. CHIP has always been a bipartisan program with widespread support, he said. Now that it has become a partisan tool, we wonder about the long-term prospects for the program. Next time it comes up for renewal, it may not just be a matter of, 'Let's get this done because everyone supports it.'
Romney spokesman Ryan Williams quickly issued a statement in response: Rick Santorum is becoming more desperate and angry and unhinged every day. He see conservatives coalescing around Mitt Romney and he's rattled by the backlash caused by his suggestion that keeping Barack Obama would be better than electing a Republican. He's panicking in the final stages of his campaign.
On the campaign trail, he called NATO obsolete.
There are five primaries on Tuesday, June 26: Colorado, Maryland, New York, Oklahoma, and Utah. There are also primary runoffs in Mississippi and South Carolina. There is not really a marquee primary race on Tuesday that should dramatically affect the outcome of the midterms, but many of these seats will be critical in the fight for control of the House and Senate in November's general election.
In the aftermath of that terrible shooting, we came together, not as Republicans or Democrats, but as representatives of the people. But it is not enough to come together only in times of tragedy. Tonight, I call upon all of us to set aside our differences, to seek out common ground, and to summon the unity we need to deliver for the people. This is really the key. These are the people we were elected to serve.
MARGARET BRENNAN: --starting from scratch with a new law?
Just 24 percent of Americans think the country is headed in the right direction - the lowest percentage in over two years, - while 68 percent think it is off on the wrong track. Americans were more optimistic in November, though current views closely match views two months ago.
I think over time, we'll be testing and perhaps get to that point. You know, we got, right at the beginning, I dealt with FEMA and I was able to get some of the Abbott machines. And we've been building up our testing capacity. And we're doing more and more tests.
Trump, however, is taking it all in stride.
Ernst also told reporters that the Senate Intelligence Committee will figure out how to proceed, based on any new information that emerges.
Speaking at a UAW facility in Warren, Biden talked about his plans for a 10% tax penalty on companies who offshore manufacturing jobs overseas in order to sell goods back to Americans. Biden is also proposing a 10% tax credit for companies who make investments in creating American jobs.
He is ramping up now, though. Trump's rally in Reno, Nevada last week was his first campaign stop on a Sunday. That same weekend - he gave two speeches on the same day in Iowa - a rarity. On Tuesday, he gave three speeches in Iowa - one in which he was endorsed by 2008 vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin - only adding to the circus. It was the first time as a candidate that Trump has given three speeches on the same day.
In Nevada, Senator Dean Heller will likely be in the political fight of his life against Democratic candidate Jacky Rosen this fall. He is the only incumbent Republican senator running in a state that Hillary Clinton won in 2016. Heller's relationship with Mr. Trump has been rocky to say the least. In 2016, he was a vocal opponent of then-candidate Trump.
THE FACTS: The charge that President Barack Obama has starved the Pentagon has become a refrain in the GOP primary campaign, but amounts spent on weapons modernization are about the same as they were when Republican George W. Bush was president.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Your campaign manager had said second place, there'd be a sigh of relief in South Carolina. You disagree with your campaign manager?
Kadlec, meanwhile, said a new health care proposal is not in my portfolio and he has no awareness of one as he has been busy with other issues. Redfield, too, said a plan is not in my main lane, but I'm not aware of one.
Most of the advertisement features home pictures and videos, which the campaign gathered from supporters. It shows families spending time together and newborn babies in the hospital before closing with a shot of Biden hugging former President Obama.
SENATOR JOHN BARRASSO: Thanks for having me.
Lesley Stahl: 10. He was on camera the whole time you were giving your acceptance speech. Does he get it? Does he know?
Ivanka Trump: It is hard to put into words the experience or the emotion when your father becomes president of the United States of America. We had enormous pride, joy. It's incredibly exciting. And we're very grateful for the opportunity. And we take that opportunity very seriously.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Good morning and welcome to FACE THE NATION. We begin this morning with Vermont independent senator and candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination, Bernie Sanders. He joins us from Burlington. Good morning to you, Senator. Let's--
We never for a moment, thought that that COVID would tie back to guns. But the collective movement is outraged... it's brought this attention we never imagined that we would have, with it being a virus, to the issue. And the grassroots network has been incredibly responsive, he said.
I intend to keep my word, he urged reporters. The process will give a variety of different points of views an opportunity to express themselves.
Former House Appropriations Committee Chairman Hal Rogers, R-Kentucky, said he thinks there will be an omnibus measure by Friday.
The following is a transcript of the interview with Republican Sen. Rick Scott of Florida that aired Sunday, March 31, 2019, on Face the Nation
6. Will women voters reject Trump in 2018?
And, you know, there's always a reason for everything. If they don't do that, it's a very difficult situation for our country, because you look at Orlando and you look at San Bernardino and you look at the World Trade Center. Go outside. Look at Paris. Look at that horrible — these are radical Islamic terrorists.
But of course they can, because while it's certainly true that the Democratic Party is moving left in many ways, they're running a host of only moderately liberal candidates in November. This includes vulnerable incumbent Democratic senators like Joe Manchin and on Tester, as well as numerous House candidates who, like Lamb, have military and intelligence backgrounds.
BIDEN: --what I've read and has been reported. No one has confided in me. I have no inside information.
GAO raises many red flags, committee chairman Rep. Fred Upton, R-Mich., said in a joint statement with other Republicans. Perhaps the most unsettling is that while HHS agrees there are many vulnerabilities, the agency has no urgency or plan to fix these critical errors.
There are reportedly more than 1.3 million new registered voters since the 2016 race, like Euphy Wu: My friend told me North Carolina is a swing state, so my vote counts. So, yeah, I'm gonna vote.
COOPER: We want to thank both the candidates. We want to thank the university here. This concludes the town hall meeting. Our thanks to the candidates, the commission, Washington University, and to everybody who watched.
Because dozens of Democrats might vote against the border wall, Pelosi is pairing money for the Department of Homeland Security with the almost $700 billion Pentagon budget, which is guaranteed to win GOP votes to offset Democratic defections.
JOHN DICKERSON: Tomorrow night, the CBS EVENING NEWS with Jeff Glor will be coming to you from the battleground state of Missouri.
So let's begin tonight by recognizing that the state of our Union is strong because our people are strong. And together, we are building a safe, strong, and proud America.
Legislative Republicans are asking the Michigan Supreme Court to hold oral arguments as soon as possible.
FACT CHECK: Partially true, partially false.
The candidates also had stark differences on issues.
Roy Hargrove Claude Paris/AP Many of his peers regarded him as the greatest trumpeter of his generation. Two-time Grammy-winner Roy Hargrove (October 16, 1969-November 2, 2018) provided his jazz sound across a vast range of styles, through his own bands and as a sideman. Hargrove brewed his jazz with African and Latin sounds, R&B, soul, pop, funk and hip-hop. He led the progressive, genre-melding group The RH Factor; played in sessions for Common, D'Angelo and Erykah Badu; and collaborated with jazz giants, including Herbie Hancock and Wynton Marsalis. A native of Waco, Texas, Hargrove was discovered by Marsalis while playing at a performing-arts high school in Dallas. He went on to the Berklee College of Music in Boston and then transferred to the New School in New York, where he joined in jam sessions at jazz clubs in the evening, including at the Blue Note. Hargrove released his first solo album, Diamond in the Rough, when he was only 20 years old. He won his first Grammy in 1998 with his Afro-Cuban band Crisol for its album Habana, then won another in 2002 for Directions in Music: Live at Massey Hall, featuring a band he led with Hancock and saxophonist Michael Brecker. Play excerpt: Roy Hargrove performing Ms. Garvey, Ms. Garvey Play excerpt: Roy Hargrove performing Mambo For Roy from the album Habana In 2012 Hargrove told the San Jose Mercury News, If you have the tools to play jazz, you can do anything, because you have what it takes to make spontaneous music.
It's unclear when the panel will rule in a case that appears destined for the Supreme Court, which has reviewed the law before. The ultimate outcome will affect protections for people with pre-existing conditions; Medicaid expansions covering roughly 12 million people; and subsidies that help about 10 million others afford health insurance.
No Democrats voted for the bill, and 20 Republicans voted against it. The bill largely repeals and replaces Obamacare.
As chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Joe Biden was proud to oversee and support the confirmation of Justices Ginsburg and Breyer and lead the fight against many Reagan judicial nominees with horrible records on civil rights and civil liberties, like Judge [Robert] Bork. As Vice President, he advised President Obama on the selection of Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan, and played a major role in winning their confirmation; Kagan previously served on Biden's staff, National Press Secretary TJ Ducklo said in a statement, As president, Biden would appoint judges who share his values and would protect the Constitution, and has promised to make history by appointing the first African-American woman to the Supreme Court of the United States.
In the dead of night, the Trump Administration has once again asked the Supreme Court to rip away the protections and benefits of the Affordable Care Act in the middle of the coronavirus crisis. #ProtectOurCare https://t.co/IB0oglIMDV — Nancy Pelosi (@SpeakerPelosi) June 26, 2020
MARGARET BRENNAN: So that was a yes? That your health care plan would cover--
According to a WFTS report, Jennings, who works part-time, said that after her outburst, a number of people approached her and thanked her.
Adults with lower incomes -- about $30,000 for an individual and $61,000 for a family of four -- saw a much higher increase: 25.7 percent in March 2018 compared to 20.9 percent in 2016.
Skimpier coverage. Short-term plans are not required to provide coverage for the 10 essential health benefits other insurers must cover under the Affordable Care Act. For instance, according to Kaiser Family Foundation data, only a fraction of short-term plans covered prenatal and maternity care, mental health care, drug treatment or prescription drugs.
Asked what he would do as president about Black Lives Matter, Trump said, Well, I think you have to look into it very seriously because people get themselves into big jams for saying a lot less than that. I mean I have seen them marching down the street essentially calling death to the police. and I think we're going to have to look into that. Especially in light of what is happening with these maniacs going and shooting our police.
JOE BIDEN: I think they should.
Scott Pelley: You defended stop and frisk right up to the point that you announced you were going to run for president. What have you learned?
Cruz encouraged voters to head to the polls in November, but didn't say to vote for Trump.
SEN. SANDERS: And- and, Margaret we have established the strongest protocols to prevent this from happening of any campaign in history.
Obamacare, Puzder told the Los Angeles Times last year, has led to rising health insurance rates and deductibles, while encouraging employers to lay off full-time employees to get under the 50-worker mark, where they are exempt from requiring private coverage. CKE offers health care to managers and full-time employees, with the employer paying 60 percent of the premium (the national average is 83 percent, according to Zane Benefits, a health-care research and service provider.)
Cutts leads a team of software and data specialists who track everything from infection rates to face masks.
One year later, I'm proud to report that the coalition to defeat ISIS has liberated very close to 100 percent of the territory just recently held by these killers in Iraq and Syria and in other locations, as well. But there is much more work to be done. We will continue our fight until ISIS is defeated.
Lesley Stahl: There are more unemployment claims-- I mean, the economy has kind of--
Lesley Stahl: With a big-- with extended?
On Tuesday, Mr. Trump questioned if Republicans and Democrats would be able reach a deal on DACA, but tweeted everyone will be trying.
Having someone at the top of the ticket being outspoken about those issues is really crucial, Morgan said of Biden.
The vice presidential nominee is spending the day doing speech prep and spending time with family.
Yet, even with a more positive open enrollment approaching, it bears repeating that consumers need to shop carefully on the exchanges. Here's some advice from experts including Cheryl Fish-Parcham and Claire McAndrew, both from the health care advocacy group Families USA.
John McCain: Oh, no. No. I have feelings sometimes of fear of what happens. But as soon as I get that, I say, Wait a minute. Wait a minute. You've been around a long time, old man. You've had a great life. You've had a great experience. I want-- I want-- when I leave, that the ceremony is at the Naval Academy. And we just have a couple of people that stand up and say, This guy, he served his country.
JOHN DICKERSON: And maybe he is just saying out loud what previous Presidents just wouldn't have said out loud. But there is-- there are American jobs to be thought about here, and that this is perfectly in keeping with President Trump's kind of vision of foreign policy.
Jason Kelly: The scope of the challenge of manufacturing a n-- a new type of vaccine on this time scale-- you know, it-- it's just-- you know, it's a moonshot kinda challenge.
Reeves supports less government and opposes Medicaid expansion or a gas tax to fix the state's infrastructure. Waller favors hiking the gas tax, as well as a plan put forth by Mississippi hospitals that would use federal money to expand Medicaid for lower-income residents.
Donald Trump: Also, with the children living with their parents for an extended period, we're gonna--
Cutts had been one of Google's first 100 employees before joining USDS for a three-to-six month stint, and wound up staying for four years. He now recruits fellow engineers and data scientists from the digital world's best companies.
Bondi said that Clinton would stack the Supreme Court with liberal justices who would target the Second Amendment.
We are incredibly grateful for the heroic efforts of the Capitol Police officers, the Alexandria Police, and the doctors, nurses, and paramedics who saved his life and the lives of many others; some in this room. In the aftermath -- (applause) -- yes. Yes.
On Wednesday Buttigieg tweeted, We must do away with the cruelty and division that have defined this era, and elect leaders at every level who will build a better, more inclusive future for this country and the next generation.
TRUMP: Well, one thing I'd do is get rid of carried interest. One of the greatest provisions for people like me, to be honest with you, I give up a lot when I run, because I knock out the tax code. And she could have done this years ago, by the way. She's a United States — she was a United States senator.
Everybody I know in the Senate - everybody - is in favor of maintaining coverage for pre-existing conditions, said Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky, earlier in the week. There's no difference of opinion about that whatsoever.
That divide is shown through the campaigns of Warren, whose dream big, fight hard campaign slogan argues for structural change and Biden, who has been campaigning on the Obama legacy and characterizing the election as a battle for the soul of the country.
Ironically, Quilici attributes the rising volume of illegal robocalls to the fact that consumers have gotten better at blocking and ignoring them.
Credit card debt is a relatively small piece of overall consumer obligations, Hoyt said. Right now consumers are not overly indebted. For everyone, I know what's important isn't how much they owe but what the payments are.
Winners include those covered by Obamacare or just now signing up, self-employed people who buy their own insurance and don't currently get federal help, laid-off workers struggling to retain employer coverage, and most anyone collecting unemployment. Also, potentially many more could benefit if about a dozen states accept a Medicaid deal in the legislation.
The lack of care on the brief is jaw-dropping, said Bagley, who supports the Obama health law but considers himself a free agent critic of both sides. There is no question that the Trump administration has to clarify what the scope of its injunction would be and grapple with the consequences of mowing down parts of the ACA.
MARGARET BRENNAN: But then don't you bear some responsibility for the outcome if the Taliban ends up back in control and women end up losing the rights?
CLINTON: ... on some of the issues that people care about tonight. Let's get to their questions.
Lesley Stahl: Do you think your father's changed?
We share the view of working to ensure that individuals with pre-existing conditions can have access to affordable health insurance, Azar said. The president has always shared that and we look forward to working with Congress under all circumstances towards achieving that.
JOE BIDEN: The responsibility I have is to protect America's nat-- national self-interest and not put our women and men in harm's way to try to solve every single problem in the world by use of force. That's my responsibility as President and that's what I'll do as President.
Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill represents a state that almost always goes Republican in presidential years and that Mr. Trump won easily. She's always a top Republican target whenever she's up, but has so far been able to consistently slip by her Republican challengers.
The Trump administration is siding with the states challenging Obamacare, and President Trump often attacks the health care law. He has vowed to put forth his own health care plan, but has yet to do so.
Bennet has about 10 paid full time staffers in Iowa and spent nine days in Iowa holding 19 campaign events in September.
10:09 p.m. I am asking the Congress to end the dangerous defense sequester and fully fund our great military, he said.
Steve Ditko Marvel Comics/Jim Lee via Twitter At Marvel Comics Stan Lee originally asked his artist on Fantastic Four, Jack Kirby, to take a stab at creating Spider-Man, but Lee was unsatisfied and gave the gig to Steve Ditko (November 2, 1927-c. June 29, 2018).The son of a Johnstown, Pa., steel-mill worker, the Army vet who began working in comics in the 1950s in New York created the look of Peter Parker and his alter-ego Spidey in 1962 in an issue of Amazing Fantasy. A year later, Ditko introduced the world to surgeon-turned-metaphysical superhero Doctor Strange. Ditko left Marvel in 1966, and would work at DC, before returning in 1979 and creating Machine Man, the Micronauts and Squirrel Girl. While Lee embraced his status as a creative god among comics fans, Ditko was a recluse who nonetheless won the worship of the most hardcore comic-book geeks. Scott Derrickson, director of the 2016 movie Doctor Strange, told The Hollywood Reporter that Ditko was like author J.D. Salinger: He is private and has intentionally stayed out of the spotlight. Writer Neil Gaiman praised the artist's contribution to the Marvel universe to the Washington Post: Without Steve Ditko, there would have been none of the weird stuff off to the side.
CBS News campaign reporter LaCrai Mitchell reports that Congresswoman Val Demings of Florida joined the state's Democratic Party during a virtual press conference on Tuesday to call out the Trump administration's handling of the coronavirus pandemic. The press conference came one day ahead of Pence's upcoming visit to Orlando, where he's scheduled to pass out personal protective equipment to nursing homes — a move that the FLDP Chair Terrie Rizzo called too little, too late. Demings called the move another smoke and mirrors moment where the administration wants to distract voters. The president and the vice president want you to take your eyes off the real conditions on the ground: Pay no attention to the number of people who have died, pay no attention to the number of people who are sick, ignore the fact that this country's numbers continue to increase, Demings said during the virtual gathering. We have had the worst response in the world compared to other industrialized countries. Demings added that while the president isn't responsible for COVID-19, we would be in a much different place today if his administration had heeded to earlier warnings from public health experts and scientists. Earlier this month, presumptive nominee Biden said Demings was one of a group of women being considered as one of his vice presidential picks. And the former Democratic House manager in the impeachment trial of Mr. Trump has said herself that she would be honored to serve as VP.
In 2016, the president told the Washington Post he would eliminate the then-$18-trillion-dollar national debt over eight years, after eviscerating Obama for blowing up the national debt.
The fact of the matter is that I have had no conversations with my broker about any political activity at all other than her congratulating me on my election, Price told the committee.
The things that I know that he's focused on are making sure that we protect preexisting conditions, that we lower the cost that we make it more affordable, and top and foremost is that we have to allow patients to have a say in the care that they receive. It is a complete and total contrast to what you're seeing the Democrats put forward right now, Sanders added at the White House on Tuesday.
Clinton has gone on record supporting more regulation and oversight of the banking and financial industries, and she would uphold the Dodd-Frank Act. Trump's position on repealing the Dodd-Frank act is particularly troubling, given such events as Wells Fargo (WFC) admitting to opening millions of unauthorized credit card accounts for unwitting customers. As with the ACA, Americans would be better off if Congress and the executive branch worked together to improve Dodd-Frank's protections for consumers, instead of outright repeal.

Robin Leach Leone & Leone Ltd. Bon vivant journalist Robin Leach (August 29, 1941-August 24, 2018), the son of an English vacuum cleaner sales manager, would parlay a fascination with the lifestyles of the rich and famous into a TV hit. After helping get Entertainment Tonight on the air, he tussled with producers over celebrity coverage until leaving to package his own syndicated series, Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous. For 11 seasons Leach traveled the world, hobnobbing with movie stars and royalty, riding on yachts and in private jets, and vicariously sharing the Good Life with viewers intoxicated by champagne dreams and caviar wishes. After helping get The Food Network off the ground, Leach worked in recent years as a celebrity journalist in Las Vegas, where he also invested in a TV production facility. Despite the breathless coverage he gave to the uber-rich, Leach admitted to the Hollywood Reporter in 2016 that he didn't quite live the rich-and-famous lifestyle himself: I don't live in a mega-mansion. I am not like the people I interview. I do not have a fleet of bodyguards or minders around me. I have an accountant and lawyer; I don't have a manager. I do all my business by myself, and I shop at the supermarket by myself because I enjoy it. (Driving there, he might add, in his Jaguar.)
The S&P 500 index fell 21 points, or 0.8 percent, to 2,578. After several weeks of declines, the benchmark index is trading at its lowest level of the year.
And yet many Americans on the Left are embracing these ideas on the premise that the Trump presidency is so destructive, so beyond the political pale, that only extremism can save us from it. Really? Save us from what?
In her memoir My Mother Was Nuts, Marshall wrote that she never wanted to grow up, still seeing a connection to the little girl in the Bronx who'd plead with her mom to be allowed to play outside for five more minutes: Through all the changes and the challenges of adulthood, I have never strayed too far … from that little girl with the ponytail and the overbite who wanted to keep playing for five more minutes.
I think the way that Congress has forced this outrageous spending on him is something that is not good, he said.
The Democrats who won Tuesday night take office in January.
JOHN DICKERSON: We're exactly where we were. This is why he ran. This is what everybody doesn't like. What--
Barrett, a judge on the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, will join the Supreme Court as it prepares to hear arguments in a blockbuster dispute on the future of the Affordable Care Act on November 10. Her views on the Obama-era health care law were a central area of focus for Democrats on the Judiciary Committee, who claimed she would likely vote to kill Obamacare.
COOPER: She said some of them are irredeemable.
Any bill must also streamline the permitting and approval process, getting it down to no more than two years, and perhaps even one. Together, we can reclaim our great building heritage.
One in three of the nation's undocumented families own a home, according to the ITEP report. States such as Idaho and New Mexico report undocumented ownership rates as high as 46 percent. Those statistics are based on research done by the Migration Policy Institute and data collected by the U.S. Census's American Community Survey.
MCGHAN: Most- well, Frankfurter went through 12 days start to finish. You can say, well, that's ancient history. What about modern times? John Paul Stevens who has become a hero of the left, went through 16 days, start to finish. Sandra Day O'Connor went through in 33 days, start to finish and Ruth Bader Ginsburg went from 42 days, start to finish. So there is time to do it. It is not outside of the norm.
Barrett has been critical of Chief Justice John Roberts, who joined the liberal wing of the bench in 2012 in a 5-4 decision upholding Obamacare's individual mandate.
ELIZABETH PALMER: And it's far from ended in Europe, in spite of lockdowns and curfews. This is carnival week in Venice, though you would never know it; no one came. Spain is once again struggling with a surge in infections, and Portugal currently has the worst outbreak in the world.
Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani will also speak, along with Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions, Rep. Michael McCaul of Texas, Marine veterans who fought in Benghazi, actor Scott Baio, former Texas Gov. Rick Perry, reality television star Willie Robertson, and immigration reform advocates.
Then, in December, a divided panel of judges on the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals also ruled that the individual mandate is unconstitutional. But the New Orleans-based court did not decide the question of whether the rest of Obamacare could stand without the mandate and sent the case back to the lower court to reconsider the issue.
Instead, last year's bill managed to cut tax rates by adding $1.4 trillion to the deficit and through gimmicks like making many of the tax cuts expire in just a few years.
In an interview with Face the Nation on Sunday, his first television interview since leaving the White House in late 2018, McGahn praised President Trump's selection of Barrett to replace the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg on the Supreme Court, calling it an outstanding choice. Barrett was a finalist to fill Justice Anthony Kennedy's seat on the Supreme Court after he announced his retirement in 2018, but the nomination ultimately went to Justice Brett Kavanaugh.
Justice Roberts and a conservative court has already ruled that the Affordable Care Act is constitutional, Klobuchar said, saying the Supreme Court is unlikely to uphold the judge's ruling, which was issued on Friday. There are things to do, but we should be working to improve the Affordable Care Act, not just throw it out and set it on fire.
MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll have more of our interview with the former vice president in our next half hour. And we'll be back in one minute with National Security Adviser Robert O'Brien.
The driving force behind developing precision-guided munitions, which today are even more precise than 25 years ago in the Persian Gulf war, was the goal of reducing the risk of killing civilians. It's a goal the U.S. military has embraced under Republican as well as Democratic presidents.
Others believe the impact from the tariffs will come to bear in the future.
But President Trump and the GOP-controlled Congress have already taken steps to dismantle the health care law, which was enacted in 2010.
In a series of moves, the Trump campaign has promoted senior political advisor Bill Stepien to deputy campaign manager and regional political director Stephanie Alexander to chief of staff. Campaign manager Brad Parscale said in a statement the new assignments would take effect immediately. Bill Stepien and Stephanie Alexander bring decades of experience in political campaigns and also relentless dedication to President Trump and all that he aims to accomplish for the American people, Parscale said. As we enter the most important stretch of the campaign, it is important to have seasoned and steady people on our leadership team, each with their own strengths, and each with an unwavering focus on victory. Bill and Stephanie are already respected by everyone on Team Trump and I look forward to their assistance as we lead the team toward President Trump's re-election in November. CBS News campaign reporter Nicole Sganga says Axios reported Stepien has worked alongside senior adviser to the president Jared Kushner crafting a new, distilled GOP platform ahead of the 2020 Republican National Convention. Prior to his campaign role as senior political adviser, Stepien served as the White House political director, where he managed Mr. rump's day-to-day political operations. Stepien operated as campaign manager for each of New Jersey Governor Chris Christie's statewide elections, working as the Governor's deputy chief of staff between 2009 - 2013. Alexander organized the Midwestern states as regional political director for Trump Victory, the joint operation between the campaign and the Republican National Committee.
All of the noise is generated on the ends of the spectrum. We need more noise in the middle, McCaskill said.
Mike Bloomberg: Plain and simple: You get some experts. You put 'em in a room and say, Okay, now who should we go hire to do this job? Who's the best person in the world? We'll start there. Asking what party they're a member of, how they voted the last time, it is so nonsensical. If you are sick, do you really wanna go to a doctor who was politically correct? Or somebody that knew how to treat your disease? I'll rest my case.
In the sprint to Election Day, the president has made five trips to North Carolina in four weeks. Joe Biden visited last week, and vice presidential nominee Kamala Harris will be in the Tar Heel State today.
MARGARET BRENNAN: As the Nevada caucuses were going on yesterday, we sat down with former Vice President Joe Biden. He told us that he was confident about his prospects in South Carolina and beyond.
Before the morning TV interview, Biden released a statement questioning her claim, noting that she said she had raised some of these issues with her supervisor and senior staffers, but the two people identified said unequivocally, that she never came to them and complained or raised issues.
Scott Pelley: --in your administration, and who's gonna get a tax cut
JOE BIDEN: No, I know. I gave you my-- I gave the answer. Do I bear responsibility? Zero responsibility.
BIDEN: Not that I'm aware of.
Speaker Nancy Pelosi: And we've been here three months. Hey, may I introduce you to the idea of the spout-- power of the speaker is to set the agenda. We didn't have a speaker who would bring a gun bill to the floor. We didn't have a speaker who would bring a Dreamers issue to the floor. We do now. And that's a very big difference. The power of the speaker is awesome. Awesome.
Billionaire Vincent Viola, Mr. Trump's choice as secretary of the Army, backed out last Friday, citing trouble separating himself from his businesses. He owned an air carrier and a high-frequency trading firm, among other things, and said selling the companies would wreck them. Similarly, Wall Streeter Anthony Scaramucci apparently won't get a big White House job because he had sold his company to a Chinese conglomerate.
Fixing the holes in the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, was the preferred plan among the undecided Democrats interviewed on how to best increase healthcare access. Many endorsed a public option and were able to talk in specifics on how allowing them to buy into a Medicare-like program could help both their families' well-being and wallets.
Democratic candidate Jim Hood, the state's attorney general since 2003, cruised by seven other challengers to a primary win early Tuesday night. He'll take on the GOP runoff winner in November.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator, thank you for being here. You certainly have your work cut out for you.
Cruz, a 43-year-old mother of two, has said that she's not worried about the threats Trump made to drag her further into the 2016 mud. But with her husband posing the greatest threat to the GOP front-runner, Cruz may not have much choice but to remain in the public eye.
SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR: Thanks, Margaret. Hello.
Coons said he intends to meet with Barrett either in person or by telephone due to the coronavirus pandemic and plans to press her about her past statements about Obamacare.
But it's good for us in terms of being able to provide information to the public, Kiely said.

As they worked to patch things up last fall, the Trump-McConnell alliance seemed to be in danger. McConnell headed to the White House after Labor Day with other congressional leaders, only to sit by while Trump cut a budget deal with Democrats. A month later, Trump and McConnell stood side by side in the Rose Garden to declare their strong partnership, even if reality seemed to tell a different story.
Donald Trump: I'm not a big tweeter. I mean, I don't do too many, but they hit home. And they have to get a point across.
Tough call for doctors after man swallows cell phone
TREVOR POTTER (Former FEC Chairman/Campaign Legal Center President/@thetrevorpotter): Well, it's been an extraordinary week. You had the President's lawyer, Mister Giuliani say, It's not a big deal, no one was killed. That is not the standard for the President of the United States in terms of complying with the law or all of these people around him. Now if it were, we wouldn't have bank fraud prosecutions, money laundering; all sorts of other issues. What we have is a law that's central to our election system, to our democracy that requires full disclosure of campaign spending and prohibits corporate money from being given to a candidate. And--
Provide incentives for states to expand Medicaid coverage, which will help low-income retirees obtain coverage before age 65.
The federal government should directly guarantee that folks who have a pre-existing condition get rates, premiums, deductibles at the same as everybody else, Hawley said.
Scott Pelley: How do you view this emergency?
After Clemson University, Nikki Randawa (as she was known) married Michael Haley, now a National Guard Officer. They have two children. She was an accountant, working in her family's gift and clothing business when, in 2004, she decided to run for the state legislature.
It's been an eventful 10 days in office for President Donald Trump -- and the pace isn't expected to slow this week.
New York Times reporter Jeff Zeleny discussed his exchange with Santorum on CBS This Morning on Monday. Watch the interview below:
I've watched the politicians. I've dealt with them all my life. If you can't make a good deal with a politician, then there's something wrong with you, you're certainly not very good, he said. They will never make America great again. They don't even have a chance. They're controlled fully by the lobbyists, by the donors, and by the special interests.
No doubt, we have to look hard in the mirror when our profession's reflected image in popular culture is no longer Atticus Finch, but Saul Goodman, he concluded.
Plus, we'll look at the President's growing legal problems, and have analysis on all the news just ahead on FACE THE NATION.
Lastly in special election news, there will be a debate on Monday between Republican Tom Tiffany and Democrat Tricia Zunker in Wisconsin's 7th District, formerly held by Republican Sean Duffy.
But Kessler doesn't type the L-word.

Clearing the second floor of a vital hospital, Kenton Stacy was severely wounded by an explosion. Immediately, Justin bounded into the booby-trapped and unbelievably dangerous and unsafe building, and found Kenton, but in very, very bad shape. He applied pressure to the wound and inserted a tube to reopen an airway. He then performed CPR for 20 straight minutes during the ground transport, and maintained artificial respiration through two and a half hours and through emergency surgery.
In a Senate where Democrats have the slimmest majority possible, any one Democratic senator effectively has a veto. And when it comes to taxes, we expect many of the Biden administration's proposed taxes won't pass muster with Democratic moderates, Zezas said in an analysis.
Donald Trump: And I like having that because I'm going to be inheriting that in a short period of time. I found him to be terrific. I found him to be-- very smart and very nice. Great sense of humor, as much as you can have a sense of humor talking about tough subjects, but we were talking about some pretty tough subjects.
For instance, Bates noted the Trump administration's small-business health insurance plan would allow two self-employed individuals to consider themselves both employees and employers, which would allow these insurance plans to be offered under ERISA. He called the argument pure legerdemain in his 42-page ruling.
When asked once more about his stock purchases and their possible conflicts of interest with legislation that he's sponsored in the past, Price replied that I wasn't making those decisions on what stocks to buy.
They were fake polls that were either put out by the corrupt media, much of the media in this country is corrupt...Those are fake numbers. You know when you will see that? On Election Day. On Election Day, you will see, the president told ABC News in an interview earlier this week.
Trump met Monday with candidates for top Cabinet posts, including retired Gen. David Petraeus, a new contender for secretary of state. Trump is to meet Tuesday with Tennessee Sen. Bob Corker, who is also being considered more seriously for the diplomatic post, and Mitt Romney, who has become a symbol of the internal divisions agitating the transition team.
Ryan has said their top priority is to introduce an ObamaCare replacement plan. McConnell's goal is to pass all 12 annual appropriations bills individually for the first time since 1994, and to pass another GOP budget blueprint.
However, Gelfand said the impact could spill over to small businesses.
Asked to rate the economy on a scale of 1 to 10, with higher numbers meaning more strength, the Democrats CBS News interviewed gave it a 5.4 on average.
People, you know, we should choose our leaders through the election process. And efforts to use the law enforcement process to change leaders or to disable administrations are incendiary in this country and destroy our republic.
About 10 million people continue to get private insurance through the ACA's subsidized markets, or exchanges, and another 12 million are covered by its Medicaid expansion. The GOP's drive to repeal the ACA in 2017 fell flat, and Democrats effectively blocked another try by gaining control of the House.
Sen. Kamala Harris, one of the Democrats running for president in 2020, addressed the issue on CBS This Morning Tuesday. She said one of the the the main things that keeps people up at night that they worry about is whether they're going to have access to affordable health care.
As I predicted all along, Obamacare has been struck down as an UNCONSTITUTIONAL disaster! Now Congress must pass a STRONG law that provides GREAT healthcare and protects pre-existing conditions. Mitch and Nancy, get it done! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 15, 2018
MARGARET BRENNAN: Trevor, in your op-ed, I mean, you take a kind of bleak view about what all of this means for the state of the country. You say there's really just deterioration in respect for the rule of law.
I would like the Supreme Court to understand that voting rights are still a big problem in many parts of our country, that we don't always do everything we can to make it possible for people of color and older people and young people to be able to exercise their franchise. I want a Supreme Court that will stick with Roe v. Wade and a woman's right to choose, and I want a Supreme Court that will stick with marriage equality.
Donald Trump: Worse than the Great Depression. And liberal Democrats aren't going to impeach him? If they believe what they're saying, don't they have to?
I'm looking for something that President Trump supports, and he's not yet indicated what measure he's willing to sign, he said. As soon as we figure out what he is for, then I would be convinced that we are not just spinning our wheels to this issue on the floor, but actually dealing with a bill that has a chance to become law and therefore solve the problem.
SENATOR RICK SCOTT: --deductibles went up.
ROBERT O'BRIEN: No. I, look, I think, you know, and again, I-- I don't want to get into private conversations in a-- in a presidential daily brief, but I-- I don't think Admiral Maguire was necessarily informed of what was going to happen at that hearing in the House either. And-- and again, there's nothing that he's given up-- no information Admiral Maguire gave us, Gina Haspel has given us-- Director Haspel, Ambassador Grenell the new acting DNI, that comports with what was leaked out of that House Intel Committee. So I haven't seen it. The leaders of the-- of the intelligence community that I have spoken with haven't seen anything that comports with what was leaked out. But, again, those leaks, I don't know if that's what the briefers told the House committee. I mean those were just simply leaked--
President Trump told reporters at the White House, Wednesday, he had to show calm, amid the virus' dramatic spread, report CBS News digital White House reporter Kathryn Watson and campaign reporter Nicole Sganga. But in a recorded interview with Woodward on February 7, the president recalled a recent conversation with Chinese President Xi Jinping about the virus, calling it more deadly than even your strenuous flus, and difficult to address because it goes through air. Mr. Trump told Woodward, This is deadly stuff.
MARGARET BRENNAN: I'm sorry, just to clarify did you just say that--
9:49 p.m. Donald Trump claims his rival Hillary Clinton used an expensive process to delete the emails from her private server.
In the House, he was a member of the pro-business New Democrat Coalition and received donations from the oil industry, which will likely not bode well with progressives who are pressuring the Democratic Party to support more audacious efforts, like the Green New Deal, to mitigate climate change. During his Senate campaign, O'Rourke refused to back Medicare for all, a proposal many 2020 Democrats have vouched their support for. Medicare for All emerges as first litmus test for 2020 Democratic contenders
QUESTION: Good evening. My question is, what specific tax provisions will you change to ensure the wealthiest Americans pay their fair share in taxes?
Des Moines, Iowa — As a seemingly endless parade of Democratic presidential candidates filtered through the Iowa State Fair this past weekend they were faced with many choices: Which fried foods should be eaten in front of the camera? Whose hands must be shaken? What's the best way to win over this narrow yet deeply important slice of the the party's electorate?
And I will not stop until our veterans are properly taken care of, which has been my promise to them from the very beginning of this great journey.
Trump camp on the sudden rent increase at Trump Tower
The president said that Republicans repealed Obamacare's individual mandate as part of the tax law, which prompted rousing applause from GOP lawmakers.
MARGARET BRENNAN: All right, we'll look for you on that next debate stage. Thank you very much, Senator Klobuchar.
CLINTON: ... with the Russians and other foreign powers.
On immigration, O'Rourke has been a supporter of comprehensive immigration reform and but has shifted to a more progressive stance on the issue recently. In 2014, he called President Obama's executive action creating the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program to shield young undocumented immigrants from deportation noble but hard to stomach because he believed it bypassed Congress. He also backed Ohio Rep. Tim Ryan's leadership challenge against then-Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi in 2016. O'Rourke launched a long-shot, insurgent campaign to oust Cruz in 2018. His robust Senate bid in Texas -- along with his Obama-esque oratory powers and social media dominance on the campaign trail -- catapulted him to national fame. Although he failed to unseat Cruz, O'Rourke shattered fundraising records, galvanized a broad electoral coalition in Texas -- including the state's large and growing Latino community -- and lost by less than three percentage points. No Democrat had come that close to winning a Senate race in Texas since 1988. Despite the loss, O'Rourke left many wondering if he would be running for president. Although he told 60 Minutes shortly before the election that he was completely ruling out running for president for 2020, O'Rourke admitted shortly after the election that he had become open to the idea. Issues In his six years in Congress, O'Rourke supported the legalization of marijuana, investing in clean energy like solar and wind to combat climate change, more expansive gun control legislation, LGBT rights and had a pro-choice stance on abortion rights.
Americans fill the world with art and music. They push the bounds of science and discovery. And they forever remind us of what we should never, ever forget: The people dreamed this country. The people built this country. And it's the people who are making America great again.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Good morning, and welcome to FACE THE NATION. It's quiet in the nation's capital today, but that may be because of the snow falling outside. Whatever the case, we know it won't last. Washington is preparing for another impeachment trial. This time former President Trump has been charged with incitement of insurrection, based on his role in the January 6th attack on the Capitol. The former President has remained out of sight in Florida since leaving office, but last night we learned that he has parted ways with his top attorneys hired to represent him in next week's trial in the Senate. We've got a lot to get to today. And we begin with CBS News national correspondent Manny Bojorquez in Miami.
Opponents of the Affordable Care Act have been busy. In the midst of several headline-making events on other issues, the Trump administration has instigated two major efforts to effectively do what Congress could not do earlier this year -- repeal Obamacare.
MARGARET BRENNAN: --because we're going to run out of time--
Government shutdowns are just the sort of more of the same why the hell not moments that a politician like Donald Trump needs to stay in the game.

Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden doesn't plan to release a list of potential Supreme Court nominees but has vowed to appoint a Black woman to the high court should a vacancy occur during his presidency.
Donald Trump's refusal to disclose his tax returns is fueling speculation about what they may reveal, from how rich he really is to potentially embarrassing details about his business dealings. We look at five things the filing could shed light on if the presumptive Republican nominee relents and divulges his returns.
Speaker Nancy Pelosi: I think he does. Yeah. But I respect the office he holds and, uh, he's not-- worth the trouble of saying you're so horrible we can't work together. No, we need to work together.
ED O'KEEFE: --if you want to participate in the debates. You got to hit sixty-five thousand donors in twenty 20 states or get one percent in at least three polls. Lot of candidates see the sixty-five thousand in twenty states as an easier hurdle early on and it incentivizes grassroots organizing and support and gives you credit with voters saying, look, I went out and found my tens of thousands of people. You have helped me get to this stage versus several candidates who have had to spend this past week, especially behind closed doors.
Ryan agonized over endorsing Trump for weeks, finally doing so this month because he said Trump would be more likely to agree with the GOP agenda than Democrat Hillary Clinton. But at least publicly Trump has yet to sign onto Ryan's agenda.
Scott Pelley: It's a different world, but the question is, is it a different man?
However, Clinton continued, it is not going to apply to people who are in need of subsidies in order to afford that.
SENATOR RICK SCOTT: Well I know-- I know-- I know in the end the White House is going to have to have their plan and I know it's going to be difficult with Nancy Pelosi. But what I'm going to focus on is how do you drive down costs? The Democrats constantly focus on access. The problem is the cost of health care is too high in this country. That's why I put a bill out this week that requires transparency at the pharmacy, at the-- with the insurance companies and says we're not going to allow pharmaceutical companies to charge us more than what they charge in Europe.

The Nevada State Democratic Party on Tuesday announced Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota will keynote their convention on June 13, the last of the early-state parties — following Democrats in Iowa, New Hampshire, and South Carolina — to wrap up its delegate nominating process after the coronavirus pandemic postponed the event. Klobuchar garnered support from a mere 4.2% from Nevada caucus-goers in February, a fraction of then-rival Senator Bernie Sanders' sweeping victory in the state that earned him nearly two dozen of Nevada's delegates, according to CBS News campaign reporter Alex Tin. While some Sanders supporters have fought for influence over the convention and the state party's platform, neither Sanders nor his most prominent endorsers are scheduled to speak at the virtual event. Nevada will be a critical state to win in 2020 if we want to elect Joe Biden to the White House and keep our Democratic majority in the House of Representatives, Klobuchar said in a statement released by the party.
Since the election, we have created 2.4 million new jobs, including -- (applause) -- including 200,000 new jobs in manufacturing alone. Tremendous numbers. After years and years of wage stagnation, we are finally seeing rising wages.

Controversy While Swalwell has not been embroiled in any major scandal or controversy during his tenure in Congress, the California Democrat will surely face criticism from Mr. Trump and Republicans on the campaign trail, especially if he secures the party's nomination, because of his staunch defense of the Mueller probe. What Trump says The president has yet to tweet about Swalwell, but his 2020 campaign has strongly criticized the congressman since the release of the Justice Department's summary of the Mueller report. In a memorandum, Tim Murtaugh, the director of communications of the president's campaign, urged television news outlets to challenge Swalwell and other prominent Democrats who said there was evidence of collusion between the Trump campaign and Moscow.

CBS News campaign reporter Musadiq Bidar says the ad is part of a seven-figure TV, digital, and radio buy the Bennet campaign campaign pushed starting last month. Earlier this week, the campaign announced it had raised over $2 million in the third quarter and has $1.8 million cash on hand. Bennet's campaign says 98% of the contributions it has received have been $100 or less.
That sense of community is fracturing across our nation right now, worn down by the petty and vicious nature of our politics. We are tired of the shutdowns and the showdowns, of the gridlock and the grandstanding, she said. Today, on this snow day, on this island, we say, 'Enough is enough.'
We've used our unprecedented grassroots support to build the biggest field program we've ever had to defend our House and Senate majorities, RNC Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel said in a statement to CBS News.

Now, less than two months out from the general election, these Florida businesses have been able to stay afloat, but they say the impact of the coronavirus pandemic won't be the deciding factor for how they vote in the general election. The EIDL, the paycheck protection, I think those were awesome gestures and were necessary, were healthy and were good...[but] I'm not like feeling like I have an owed responsibility to vote a certain way because of those things, said Glenn Jones. ...we shouldn't be bought by gestures. We still have to look at policies that allow a quality of life that we believe should be had in the American dream.
A vote to confirm Barrett, they argue, is effectively a vote to kill Obamacare and strip protections from people with pre-existing conditions. Democrats cite a 2017 essay from Barrett as evidence she would vote to strike down the health care law, as she wrote then that Roberts pushed the Affordable Care Act beyond its plausible meaning to save the statute.
And I asked CJ, What's the secret? He said, We're just tougher than they are. And I like that answer. Now let's get Congress to send you -- and all of the people in this great chamber have to do it; we have no choice.

After the primary was postponed in March, Ohio's mail-in primary ends Tuesday, providing a preview of what could come in November's general election if the coronavirus pandemic continues at a high rate. CBS News campaign reporter Jack Turman reports that Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose sent a letter on Thursday to Ohio's congressional delegation indicating that some Ohioans may not get their ballot in time due to post office delays. In the letter, LaRose stated that they are hearing reports that first class mail delivery, which is 1-3 days, is taking up to 7-9 days. As you can imagine, these delays mean it is very possible that many Ohioans who have requested a ballot may not receive it in time, LaRose wrote. On Friday, LaRose announced the postal office set up hand-to-hand delivery on Saturday for election mail as it went through processing. Post offices will track election mail to the Ohio Board of Elections starting Monday through May 8. As of Monday, there have been 1,975,806 vote-by-mail ballots requested and 1,458,936 ballots cast.

In Tuesday's order, Ranjan said that if the state Supreme Court doesn't make a decision, soon, it could be too late to un-ring the bell. But he said that concern is premature because the Supreme Court ordered that all supplemental briefing on the case to be filed by yesterday and appears to be on track. He left open the possibility of lifting the stay on the case if the Supreme Court hasn't made a decision by October 5.
Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi is a possible contender to permanently replace Attorney General Jeff Sessions, sources familiar with the matter tell CBS News. President Trump forced Sessions out as the nation's chief law enforcement officer on Wednesday, one day after Democrats captured the House in the midterm elections.
Trump would again spare Social Security retirement benefits and Medicare as he promised during the 2016 campaign. And while his plan would reprise last year's attempt to scuttle the Obamacare health law and sharply cut back the Medicaid program for the elderly, poor and disabled, Trump's allies on Capitol Hill have signaled there's no interest in tackling hot-button health issues during an election year.
Separately, LaRose's office announced Tuesday evening that Ohio's county boards of elections have received 1,398,347 absentee ballot applications as of September 11.
MARGARET BRENNAN: When are you going to re-introduce--
When asked about their feelings toward the Democrats, one word in particular kept coming up: socialism.
Last year, embracing nonpartisan estimates for the Affordable Care Act, Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius set a benchmark for the new insurance marketplaces: Success looks like at least 7 million people having signed up by the end of March 2014, she said to NBC.
Lesley Stahl: You called her crooked Hillary, said you wanted to get in jail, your people in your audiences kept saying, Lock em' up.
As the ping pong game continues, Fish-Parcham warned, people signing up for insurance during this year's enrollment period need to be aware that the future may look very different.
MARGARET BRENNAN: What do you make of the Democratic problems here within the party--the party within the Dem-- problems within the Democratic Party? Had a hard time getting that one out. With AOC. She sent this tweet last night that some Republicans might welcome but some Democrats felt a little bit of a discomfort with. She said The DCC's new rule to blacklist and boycott anyone who does business with primary challengers is extremely divisive and harmful to the party. You had some other progressives kind of joining her in this. What should people at home understand about what's happening within the party?
This was day 84 of the Trump presidency: As you know President XI, he's a terrific person, Mr. Trump said.
TRUMP: I can't think of any. I can't think of any. And I'm pretty good at it.
I don't think I have, no.
The fundraising email states it's clear that Whitmer and her family believe that there's one set of rules for them and another for the rest of us.
In a letter replying to Pelosi later on Thursday, Mnuchin accused the speaker of pulling a political stunt by releasing her letter to the press at the same time as she sent it to him. Mnuchin also said that the White House had provided reasonable compromises on state and local funding, schools, extended unemployment benefits, liability protections, and OSHA.
Here are five things to watch in this race:
Donald Trump: I hated-- well, you know, I'm not going to change my mind just because I won. But I would rather see it where you went with simple votes. You know, you get 100 million votes and somebody else gets 90 million votes and you win. There's a reason for doing this because it brings all the states into play. Electoral College and there's something very good about that. But this is a different system. But I respect it. I do respect the system.
When asked by a reporter if he were worried that impeachment would stain his legacy, Mr. Trump replied, Not at all. It's a hoax.
What separates Republicans from Democrats is our belief in better, he said. We believe in better schools. A better healthcare system. A better economy which rewards hard work no matter where or when you punch the clock. And most of all, we believe in a better chance at the American Dream for everyone. The Republican Party will not stop until it becomes a reality. And that's why we need to stop Hillary Clinton.
Spectacle defines life on the trail with Trump, and to the surprise of many, it seems to be working for him: The impersonators, the helicopter, the men wearing sombreros. People line up by the thousands and wait for hours to see him in venues typically reserved for concerts or sporting events.
Joe Biden's campaign on Thursday aimed to push a middle-class centered economic message ahead of the candidate's drive-in town hall in Scranton, Pennsylvania, on CNN. Asked about Biden's insistence last week that he would raise corporate taxes on day one of his presidency, campaign policy director Stef Feldman explained, I think what the vice president was being clear about the fact that he has no patience for people who say that we do not have the capacity to make sure that the super wealthy and corporations pay their fair share. CBS News campaign reporter Bo Erickson notes conservatives have questioned Biden's willingness to raise taxes at all if elected, as the economy tries to rebound from the brunt of the pandemic. In addition to raising the corporate tax rate back to 28%, Biden hopes to increase individual taxes for Americans making more than $400,000. If enacted, Biden's proposed tax increases would be the fifth largest tax increase since the 1940s, according to a nonpartisan Tax Foundation analysis. And late on Thursday, Biden along with wife Jill, wished a happy new year to Jewish Americans celebrating Rosh Hashanah. During the virtual event, Biden quipped, The rabbis and I have been learning the same skills recently: how to sermonize over Zoom.
Congressman Tom Price will be a great Secretary of Health and Human Services.He is the right leader to help Congress replace Obamacare. — Newt Gingrich (@newtgingrich) November 29, 2016
Pete Shelley Jake Barlow/CBS News One of the U.K.'s most influential songwriters, Pete Shelley (April 17, 1955-December 6, 2018) was co-founder of the punk rock band Buzzcocks, best known for songs dripping with irony and humor and played with manic speed, including Ever Fallen in Love (With Someone You Shouldn't've) and What Do I Get? The band debuted in Manchester in 1976, opening for the Sex Pistols. When Howard Devoto left in 1977, Shelley took over as lead singer. The group would break up in 1981, thanks in part to exhaustion (they'd put out three albums in a year-and-a-half), but Shelley and Steve Diggle, two of the group's original members, reunited eight years later, and released the albums Trade Test Transmissions and The Way, and the 2006 single Wish I Never Loved You. Play Excerpt: Ever Fallen in Love (With Someone You Shouldn't've) Play Excerpt: What Do I Get? Shelley also produced solo records, including Sky Yen, the electronic Homosapien, XL1, and Heaven and the Sea. Play Excerpt: Homosapien In 2010 Shelley told The A.V. Club that the secret for rock bands to stick together in their 50s, or older, compared to younger musicians was, You don't panic. I suppose it's like being a stock-market investor. When you start off, the market goes up and then they're happy; when the market goes down, then they panic. So it's a bit like that with … a band. When you start out and you have initial success you think, 'Oh, this is great.
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: They're trying to start a rumor. It's disinformation. That's the only thing they're good at, that Putin wants to make sure I get elected. Listen to this. So, doesn't he want to see who the Democrat's going to be? Wouldn't he rather have, let's say, Bernie, wouldn't he rather have Bernie who honeymooned in Moscow?
RADDATZ: It might be to help get civilians out.
CLINTON: Well, here we go again. I've been in favor of getting rid of carried interest for years, starting when I was a senator from New York. But that's not the point here.
Lesley Stahl: So you were with Paul Ryan, you met with the Republican leadership, what was the-- one thing that you all agreed you want to get done right away?
While the pandemic has transformed and curbed the fundraising scene dramatically, the Brady PAC, a sister organization of the Brady gun control advocacy group, has actually seen an increase in fundraising and interest. Brian Lemek, executive director of Brady PAC, told CBS News political unit broadcast associate Aaron Navarro Brady PAC has raised $1 million so far in the year, and based off the activity in the past two months, has doubled its election cycle fundraising goal to $5 million.
Failure to repeal and replace Obamacare as he repeatedly vowed to do was one of former President Donald Trump's most bitter disappointments. His administration continued trying to find ways to limit the program or unravel it entirely. A Supreme Court decision on Trump's final legal challenge to the Affordable Care Act is expected this year.
TRUMP: By the way, just so you understand, when she said 3 o'clock in the morning, take a look at Benghazi. She said who is going to answer the call at 3 o'clock in the morning? Guess what? She didn't answer it, because when Ambassador Stevens...
In an interview on CNN, Conway was asked to follow up on her comments to the TV network in April in which she said she'd like to see Trump's tax returns become transparent.
He added that nobody should be forced to choose between protecting their health and exercising their constitutional right to vote and vowed that Democrats will fight to ensure that voters can safely make their voice heard.
JOHN DICKERSON: And we are back with Senator Ben Sasse. So, let's focus a little bit on the solutions. People know that-- that we are at this pitched moment. So what do we do to fix it?
MCGAHN: One is his judicial selection, which he's done. He's set a record number of judges on there- on the circuit courts and this really matters. And look, there's been since the '16 election, he has made this a critical issue.
Delegates began chanting build that wall, build that wall during his speech, referring to the wall he has promised to make Mexico pay for along the U.S.'s southern border.
To launch our national rebuilding, I will be asking the Congress to approve legislation that produces a $1 trillion investment in the infrastructure of the United States – financed through both public and private capital – creating millions of new jobs, Mr. Trump said Tuesday night.
University of Michigan law professor Nicholas Bagley said the administration does not appear to have thought through all the consequences of moving against one provision of a health law that has many complicated interlocking parts.
SENATOR BEN SASSE: One of the things is we are going to have to develop habits for the technological age that get back to an awareness of-- embodied flesh and blood neighbors actually matter a lot. There's a whole bunch of tech addictions we all have to our smartphones. We know it's a problem when it's our kids. I have fourteen- and seventeen-year-old daughters. But it turns out we the adults are also addicted to technology that helps us flee the place where we're actually called to live and love our neighbor.
Speaker Nancy Pelosi: I was born into a family that was devoutly Catholic, deeply patriotic and staunchly Democratic.
WASHINGTON -- The Trump administration's latest move against Obamacare could jeopardize legal protections on pre-existing medical conditions for millions of people with employer coverage, particularly workers in small businesses, say law and insurance experts.
The NPR/PBS/Marist poll surveyed 995 registered voters between June 21 and June 25, and it has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 percent. The Economist/YouGov poll surveyed 1,295 registered voters between June 25 and June 27, and it has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.2 percent. The Gallup poll surveyed 1,500 adults nationwide between June 24 and June 26, and it has a margin of error of plus or minus three percent. The Reuters/Ipsos poll surveyed 1,587 adults nationwide as part of a five-day rolling average, and it has a margin of error of plus or minus 2.6 percent. And the CBS News poll surveyed 1,117 Americans between June 15 and June 18, and it has a margin of error of plus or minus four percent.
Mr. Trump insisted that he never said repeal and replace within 64 days on the campaign trail.
BIDEN: But we didn't have the--
MARGARET BRENNAN: I'm going to take that as a yes for you, from you that you're voting for him again. All right, Don McGann, thank you this morning for your insight. We'll be right back.
Republicans so far are keeping up their demand to revisit the Obamacare debate in the government spending debate, even though polls show most disagree with the strategy -- and even as several hundred thousand federal employees are going without a paycheck and some critical government services like food assistance are threatened.
PAULA REID: Rudy Giuliani and others, they've consistently said for months that it's wrapping up. I think just a couple of moments ago, he said, Oh, it's just down to parking tickets. Well, that's just not true. And we know that's not true for a few reasons. First of all, we still have the outstanding issues surrounding the prosecution of Paul Manafort. He won't even be sentenced until February in one case, and then March in another. We also know that the grand jury continues to hear from witnesses. Now we know they've called witnesses regarding Roger Stone. We know they are in talks with Jerome Corsi about a possible plea deal that appears to fall through. I mean, to resolve all of these things, this is going to take months. So, anyone that suggests that this is all wrapping up, that is just not true.
MARGARET BRENNAN: We're going to talk about what all of this means for the President. Thank you.
It's estimated that $12 million has been spent by outside groups on behalf of Handel with $6.2 million spent on ads by the GOP super PAC Congressional Leadership Fund being the largest share of that. Ossoff has been the beneficiary of $6.7 million from outside groups with the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee's $5 million outlay making up the biggest chunk of that total.
Earlier in his career, Ryan was an advocate for partially privatizing Social Security by allowing younger retirees to steer a portion of their payroll taxes into retirement accounts. That idea cratered in 2005 despite a determined push by President George W. Bush.
I think the only way it's going to change is if the American public is made aware of exactly what services their government does provide, Dougan said. A lot of us take those services for granted, and we don't even think about who delivers my mail, how do my roads get fixed, or how can I be sure that the meat I buy in the supermarket is safe to eat?
STEPHEN MILLER: As the President-- as the President has made very clear, the new Democrat House, affords us the opportunity as a country to craft real bipartisan solutions on all the issues I just mentioned and many more.
The bill ensures taxpayer dollars aren't used to fund an ineffective border wall, excludes poison pill riders, and increases investments in programs that the middle-class relies on, like medical research, education, and infrastructure, he said.
Donald Trump: Well, I would say there was more than one thing, there were three things, it was healthcare, there was immigration and there was a major tax bill lowering taxes in this country. We're going to substantially simplify and lower the taxes--
Speaker Nancy Pelosi: Oh, they do that, yeah.
We take this step because we know that in solving the many many problems and our great challenges, faith is more powerful than government and nothing is more powerful than god, said Mr. Trump.
When Eric Trump said over the weekend that the shutdown was good for us, he was right, though not in the partisan sense he intended. They're not good for Republicans, but they are good for drain the swamp outsiders like Eric's dad.
And with only 16 days until the election, most voters are so entrenched that no ad, news event or even scandal is likely to change their minds.
If the Democrats do take back the House, will Nancy Pelosi retake her position as House speaker? Ben McAdams, the twice-elected mayor of Salt Lake County, is hoping to unseat Republican incumbent Rep. Mia Love in Utah's competitive 4th District. Love has tried to tie McAdams to Nancy Pelosi, but McAdams has said that he would not support Pelosi for speaker if elected.
I feel comfortable saying that I speak for almost, if not all, Republican senators when I say that this is the last thing they want to discuss, said one senior Republican leadership aide. Whoever planted this idea in the president's head should be drawn and quartered.
Battle for future of Democratic party pits progressives against establishment in key Tuesday primaries;
Calling Republican Don Blankenship a problematic candidate is like saying the 8-26 Baltimore Orioles are struggling a bit at the plate. In the era of Lock Her Up! politics, Blankenship has already done his time in prison. Literally. He spent a year in the federal pen in the wake of an explosion that killed 29 people in a mine owned by his company.
Whether voters will want to listen to what Patrick is offering remains to be seen.
But as CNN notes, after Mr. Trump made a not-so-subtle threat that he might oppose Heller's re-election efforts if he bucked him on health care, Heller softened his criticism of the president and voted to repeal Obamacare and to reform the tax code. Mr. Trump ultimately endorsed Heller and helped convince Danny Tarkanian, his primary Republican challenger, to run for the House instead. Although his worst primary fears were averted, Heller's support for Mr. Trump's policies may hurt him in the general election.
As the Senate votes to put forward another bill to repeal the Affordable Care Act, support for the law - also known as Obamacare - has dropped since June. Then, for the first time since it was passed, more Americans approved than disapproved of the law. Now 40 percent approve and 52 percent disapprove of the ACA, similar numbers to what has been recorded for most of the past twelve months.
My friends, this is madness. President Obama is a man who does everything backwards - he wants to close Guantanamo Bay and open up our borders, he exports jobs and imports terrorists. Enough is enough. There is a better vision for our future: A return to freedom, he said.
But since then, the makeup of the Supreme Court has changed, with the appointments of Justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh shifting the court rightward.
Vice President Mike Pence: I think that's a decision every American family can make based on the circumstances in their community, the vulnerability of particular family members. Now, one of the things we apprehended early on is that seniors, particularly those with serious underlying health conditions, are the most at-risk-- for a serious outcome if they contract the coronavirus. And so w-- families may make a decision that-- that certain elderly family members might take a pass but I think the difference between President Trump and me and some of the public voices in this debate over the last year has been we trust the American people.
ANTHONY SALVANTO: So, underneath that shrinking lead for Joe Biden you just described there's two big things. One is while he's still on top with African-American voters who will make up most of the Democrats in this primary, that lead is so much smaller now, and he's got to share a lot of that support now with Bernie Sanders and with Tom Steyer. Also, when you look at who black voters think understands their concerns. Well, that's still Joe Biden, but it's also increasingly Bernie Sanders they say and also Tom Steyer. The other part of this is frankly not winning. This is the mechanics of momentum that all the pundits talk about. Voters in South Carolina say they think it's less likely that Joe Biden will ultimately win the Democratic nomination so that makes them start to look at other candidates and think, okay, what is it that those other voters in those other states know that we should maybe reassess?
So this decision to dismiss by the Justice Department, this all came together really within the last week, based on new evidence?
The U.S. currently has the most reported cases in the world, although experts question China's reporting on its own cases. On Wednesday, Mr. Trump and national security adviser Robert O'Brien said they aren't in a position to know whether China is reporting accurate numbers of coronavirus cases and deaths.
Trump suggested the country is in deep trouble, and that politicians in both parties simply aren't equipped to come to the rescue.
McCain said her father had designed the funeral to be a bridging and a healing for Americans, and she pointed out that both candidates who beat him for president spoke.
Otto's wonderful parents, Fred and Cindy Warmbier, are here with us tonight, along with Otto's brother and sister, Austin and Greta. Please. Incredible people. You are powerful witnesses to a menace that threatens our world, and your strength truly inspires us all. Thank you very much. Thank you.
Sessions left the Justice Department for the last time Wednesday evening, flanked by a crowd of well-wishers. His former chief of staff, Matt Whitaker, is now the acting attorney general. The president announced Sessions' ouster shortly after a fiery press conference with reporters in the East Room of the White House. At the time, the president said he didn't want to discuss Sessions' future.
I do not believe it would be no cost to the state. That's a fairytale belief, he said in a July televised debate.
That puts his tax cut squarely behind President Barack Obama's 2010 tax cut, which was 1.31 percent of GDP. Ronald Reagan's 1981 tax cut was the biggest at 2.89 percent of GDP. -- Kate Rydell
But Kasich did temper expectations for his performance in the state.
Ted Cruz used to be my attorney a long time ago. A good guy. I don't always agree with him, but he's a good guy, Boehner said in January of that year, when discussing the wildly unpopular 2013 government shutdown, which Cruz helped to orchestrate. (Retirement has made Boehner more blunt: Lucifer is a long way from a good guy.)
Last week, Buttigieg criticized Biden as a D.C. insider, an attack Biden attempted to rebut on Wednesday. The former vice president ticked off a list of accomplishments from his decades in the federal government, including his working passing both Obamacare and the stimulus package as vice president.
We recognize that as an officer of the Executive Branch, the Attorney General serves at the pleasure of the president. It is also within the president's authority to direct or steer the Department's litigation positions for civil cases. However, as the litigator for the United States and its administrative agencies, the Department has an obligation to ensure these positions are supported by sound legal or factual arguments, the chairmen wrote.
Army Staff Sergeant Justin Peck is here tonight. Near Raqqa, last November, Justin and his comrade, Chief Petty Officer Kenton Stacy, were on a mission to clear buildings that ISIS had rigged with explosive so that civilians could return to that city hopefully soon, and hopefully safely.
The agency administering the health law -- the Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services -- has assumed a passive approach to identifying and preventing fraud, the GAO report said. In a formal written response, the administration agreed with eight GAO recommendations while maintaining that it applies best practices to fraud control.
Gary Kurtz Courtesy of the Kurtz/Joiner Archive His early Hollywood resume as an assistant director, production manager and editor allowed him to cross paths with such cultish figures as Jack Nicholson, Dennis Hopper and Warren Oates, even if the films (Voyage to the Prehistoric Planet) were considerably less stellar. But after serving as a Marine in Vietnam, Gary Kurtz (July 27, 1940-September 23, 2018) paired up with director George Lucas on American Graffiti, which Kurtz produced (with Francis Ford Coppola), earning him a Best Picture Oscar nomination. According to a family statement, Kurtz's religious studies would inspire a universal religion for Lucas' fantasy film, Star Wars. Kurtz produced that blockbuster and its sequel, The Empire Strikes Back, before branching off to tackle the Jim Henson fantasy The Dark Crystal and Return to Oz. Later credits included Slipstream (starring Mark Hamill), The Steal, 5-25-77, and the TV series Friends and Heroes. In 2014 Kurtz explained the origin of the Force to the website Mashable: When you're out in the real world, religion is identified by handles. You're either a Christian or a Muslim or a Jew or a Buddhist or Hindu. As soon as you say one of those words, you know what's behind that, even if you haven't studied any of those religions. … We wanted something like that with a religion that nobody's ever heard of. … [George and I] did have long discussions about various religious philosophies, and how people related to them, and how we could simplify it.
TRUMP: Right now, other nations are taking our jobs and they're taking our wealth.
PAUL RYAN: Look, as Republicans we have some experience with futile gestures like government shutdown. You want to see some quotes? Let me give you one. Open the government. When you open the government, we'll open negotiations. That was Dick Durbin in 2013.
SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: Well, I heard from more than fifty of my constituents. Women who had experienced sexual assault, sexual trauma years ago and had never told their own parents at the time. In many cases had not told-- told members of their families today. And it was a powerful reminder of the progress we need to make in this country when it comes to sexual assault. So, when you have the President of the United States at big rallies belittling Doctor Ford, he is belittling all those survivors of sexual assault. And I don't think people like what they see.
McCaskill's opponent, Josh Hawley, said she hasn't voted with the president on anything that matters. Hawley, the state's attorney general, is a 38-year-old Yale Law School graduate who once clerked for Chief Justice John Roberts. He's a conservative who has hooked himself to the president and, he hopes, to the voters who put him in the White House.
Schmidt claims that, for years, Fox News and right-wing conservatives continued to use Palin to push the idea that science was irrelevant and credible news was fake. The effect, he said, was to energize other politicians like her.
Employer groups and labor unions are going all out to kill the idea, fearing that taxation will only increase in the future.
Often times, that data is derived from or ever prepared by the U.S. Digital Service, USDS Administrator Matt Cutts told CBS News' Major Garrett. We've got folks slotted in at all kinds of places from the VA to CMS, the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services.
Two days into a government shutdown that's overwhelmingly unpopular, Congress appears no closer to ending the stalemate.
Jindal isn't the only one selling the governors. When the Republican Party commissioned its famous autopsy shortly after the 2012 presidential election loss, the bias toward the governors was clear. At the federal level, much of what Republicans are doing is not working beyond the core constituencies that make up the Party. On the state level, however, it is a different story. ... Republican governors are America's reformers in chief. ... It is time for Republicans on the federal level to learn from successful Republicans on the state level. It is time to smartly change course, modernize the Party, and learn once again how to appeal to more people, including those who share some but not all of our conservative principles.
10:30 p.m. Finally, we are joined by one more witness to the ominous nature of this regime. His name is Mr. Ji Seong-ho, the president said. In 1996, Seong-ho was a starving boy in North Korea. One day, he tried to steal coal from a railroad car to barter for a few scraps of food. In the process, he passed out on the train tracks, exhausted from hunger. He woke up as a train ran over his limbs. He then endured multiple amputations without anything to dull the pain. His brother and sister gave what little food they had to help him recover and ate dirt themselves -- permanently stunting their own growth. Later, he was tortured by North Korean authorities after returning from a brief visit to China.

Called the Lincoln Project, the group was founded by eight men and women who had previously worked with Republicans such as Rudy Giuliani, John McCain, and President George W. Bush. Although it has endorsed the Democratic presidential hopeful, former Vice President Joe Biden, the group has said they do not represent any particular candidate, campaign, or party.
According to polls out of the Empire State, Trump has a hefty lead in the GOP primary, while Kasich slightly edges out Cruz for second place. For instance, a recent Fox News poll shows Trump leading with 54 percent while Kasich wins 22 percent and Cruz earns 15 percent. New York voters will cast their ballots on April 19.
Joe Sestak told CBS News political unit broadcast associate Aaron Navarro that he'll be spending his post-Thanksgiving Friday putting up Christmas decorations. No better day, he said.
You should be ashamed to show your face around here, she yelled.
The election, which has become the most expensive House race in history, is being touted as a must-win for both parties, but it's not necessarily predictive of what's to come in the 2018 midterms.
The ACA helps Americans of all ages who don't have access to health insurance through their employers. The ACA clearly has flaws, but having lawmakers work together to fix them is a better outcome for this group of Americans than outright repeal.
The Cleveland police department later tweeted out, however, that no shots were aimed at the transport vehicle:
And Barack and I were raised with so many of the same values: that you work hard for what you want in life; that your word is your bond and you do what you say you're going to do; that you treat people with dignity and respect, even if you don't know them, and even if you don't agree with them.
After Mr. Trump's remarks in North Carolina, he headed to Jacksonville, Florida, where he held a campaign rally.
But we're bringing the tax rate down from 35 percent to 15 percent. We're cutting taxes for the middle class. And I will tell you, we are cutting them big league for the middle class.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Prepare yourself for 2019. Ben, we have an interesting thing that may be happening in the next few days in Washington with criminal justice reform being promised floor time. This is Jared Kushner's project that he feels personally invested in. There's been some disagreement within the Republican Party but whether it should even see the light of day.
For some perspective, the EIA said there were 1,458 coal mines in 2008, meaning more than half of the coal mines operating barely a decade ago no longer are.
Turkish troops, U.S.-backed rebels go after key ISIS-held town
That didn't work out too well, Trump told Fox News in an interview on New Year's Eve. We'll see how she does. I wish her well, I hope she does well. I'd love to run against her. Warren frequently taunted Mr. Trump during the 2016 campaign, and often takes to the president's favorite outlet, Twitter, to criticize him and his policies directly. Asked by Fox News whether Warren would be able to win, the president said, Well, that I don't know. You would have to ask her psychiatrist.
Pence is headed to campaign in Arizona next week, continuing his Faith in America tour on the heels of a visit from President Trump that packed a Phoenix mega-church — and drew some protests — on Tuesday. White House National Security Adviser Robert O'Brien had floated news of Pence's visit Wednesday, during remarks to Arizona business leaders. CBS News campaign reporter Alex Tin reports the campaign event is planned in Tucson, at the heart of Arizona's Democrat-heavy Pima County where Trump lost by more than 13 points in 2016, despite winning statewide by more than three points. Though the president has visited the state multiple times and bought more than $1 million in Arizona ad time, new polling released today continues to show President Trump lagging behind Joe Biden in the battleground state.
Trump's announcement comes just a few days after a marathon meeting by the Republicans' rules committee in Cleveland, where the Never Trump movement staged their last stand against the party's presumptive nominee.
Five things to know about John Kasich
President Donald Trump: When we see what happens with Obamacare.
Scott Pelley: And I'm curious, how would you fill the top jobs in government?
It took decades to erect this very complex, interwoven system, Azar said in a briefing following the speech. I don't want to overpromise that somehow by Monday there's going to be a radical change, but there's a deep commitment to structural change.
For decades, the Republican Party lived by a creed, a model of decorum espoused by Ronald Reagan's so-called eleventh commandment: Thou shalt not speak ill of another Republican.
While most of the media attention will focus on control of Congress, equally important is control of 36 governors' mansions and 87 of the nation's 99 state legislative houses that are up for election.
Gorsuch was also in the same Harvard class as former President Obama. Though Mr. Obama hasn't weighed in on Gorsuch, Norm Eisen, Mr. Obama's ethics czar, praised the choice, as did former Obama acting solicitor general Neal Katyal.
James Billington AP Photo During his 28 years as Librarian of Congress, James Billington (June 1, 1929-November 20, 2018), who grew up in a house filled with used books, would bring the world's largest library into the digital age. An expert on Russian history when he was appointed by President Reagan, he is credited with creating a massive new Library of Congress online, at loc.gov, making research and legislative databases more easily accessible, and improving the Library's preservation efforts. Among them: The American Memory National Digital Library program, which features digital copies of more than 24 million books, documents, photographs and other cultural and historical assets. He oversaw the institution of the National Film Registry and the National Recording Registry, and built the National Audio-Visual Conservation Center in Culpeper, Va., which stores six million films, TV broadcasts and audio recordings. And in 2010 he added to the Library's archive the entire collection of tweets, in the billions, sent via Twitter since the company was founded in 2006, and which it continued to archive until the end of 2017. Always a research collection, the library's traditional analog collections were doubled during Billington's tenure, from 85.5 million items in 1987 to more than 160 million items. Among his notable acquisitions: the only copy of the 1507 Waldseemüller world map (America's birth certificate) for permanent display, and hundreds of collections from notable Americans, including Thurgood Marshall, Irving Berlin and Jackie Robinson. He also co-founded (with Laura Bush) the National Book Festival in Washington.
When he and Democratic Sen. Chuck Schumer were working to find a compromise on immigration, I remarked it was the first time they had appeared on the Face the Nation set together. What I didn't say was that it was McCain who had convinced Schumer to cancel travel plans and stay in Washington to show solidarity.

SENATOR MARCO RUBIO: What I can debate is public policy. I can-- I can accept this and that is that we're going to have a debate about human contribution because scientists are saying that and, you know, a few are saying not-- something different. But if we're going to have that debate about whether certain laws should be passed in order to alleviate what some scientists or a lot of scientists are saying is the cause of this, that has to be balanced with the public interest and other topics like the economy and the like.
Other notable names to speak include: Eric Trump, Florida Gov. Rick Scott, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, Florida's Attorney General Pam Bondi, Vice President of the Eric Trump Foundation Lynne Patton, and conservative radio host Laura Ingraham.
John McCain: No, I think you gotta-- you know, you just have to understand that it's not that you're leaving. It's that you-- that you stayed. I celebrate what a guy who stood fifth from the bottom of his class at the Naval Academy has been able to do. I am so grateful. I-- every night when I go to sleep, I am just filled with gratitude.

Like many groups and campaigns, Lemek said at the onset of the pandemic, the group was preparing to batten down the hatches in anticipation of a downturn in fundraising.
Parts of Texas are recovering this morning after a violent storm packing hail stones the size of baseballs tore up homes, cars and businesses. Even as they clean up the threat of more storms is still looming, and the destructive system is sweeping into a new region today.
Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer signed an executive order on Friday that will allow some low-risk industries, such as construction and real-estate activities, to get back to work on May 7. But as she faces pressure to reopen more parts of the state and a possible legal challenge from the GOP-controlled legislature over her use of executive powers, Whitmer says she'll continue making decisions based on advice from public health experts.
10:35 a.m. ET Tom Price gives his opening statement at his confirmation hearing.
JOHN DICKERSON: What did we, if anything, learn about what the hearings of Justice Kavanaugh did to affect either women, men, enthusiasm, there were a lot of claims made, what did-- what does the data show?
I think Arizonans don't care whether the person who's serving in office has an R or a D behind their name. What they do care about is who's going to get stuff done and who's serving their interests, Sinema said.
The future of Obamacare, the health care law implemented by President Barack Obama, has emerged as the key focus of Democrats as they work to shape Barrett's nomination and elevate the stakes for the public in hopes of pressuring the GOP not to move forward with the confirmation process.
Here are five things to know about her:
On the issue of work requirements, Representative Joe Kennedy got into a heated exchange with Verma. The Democrat from Massachusetts pointed to a study that shows work requirements — which the Trump administration approved in more states after courts ruled the policy unconstitutional in several states — have led to higher numbers of uninsured without boosting employment.
R-Miami Dr. Janice K. Jackson, Chicago Public Schools CEO
The vast majority of those people are eligible for coverage under the Affordable Care Act, including 12.7 million through Medicaid and 8.4 million in the ACA marketplaces. Another 5.7 million are not eligible and would have to pay the full cost of their coverage, and more will likely remain uninsured.
PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: We now have a national strategy to beat COVID-19. It's based on science not politics. It's based on truth, not denial.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Are Americans going to see a shutdown over Christmas?
President Donald Trump: I'd like not to, but, you know, perhaps everybody has to take a little responsibility for it. But when people put out phony witch hunts, you know, when they spy on your campaign, you have to fight back. And if you don't fight back, you're not sitting here very long. You go back home.
Meanwhile, in Wisconsin's 7th special election Republican state senator Tom Tiffany beat Democrat Tricia Zunker by 14 points for Sean Duffy's old seat. CBS News campaign reporter Adam Brewster says just under half of votes (47.5%) were cast by mail in the election.
A typical family of four making $75,000 will see their tax bill reduced by $2,000, slashing their tax bill in half.
She told the donors that Americans still needed to follow through on ensuring equal treatment for the LGBT community.
As part of our defense, we must modernize and rebuild our nuclear arsenal, hopefully never having to use it, but making it so strong and so powerful that it will deter any acts of aggression by any other nation or anyone else.
If Democrats gain control of the House, or even the Senate, gridlock will almost certainly ensue. That threatens President Donald Trump's deregulatory agenda, a proposed second round of tax cuts, infrastructure spending, or potential cuts to Social Security and Medicare entitlements.
President Trump's legacy? A re-election answer looms in the first year of our new decade.
MARGARET BRENNAN: But that's a cost of--
While he did not refrain from criticizing President Trump's trade policy, he also said he's willing to work with the president to improve it. Donnelly vowed to fight for Indiana soybean farmers, who he said have seen a 20-percent drop in their price per bushel, bringing the price below the cost of their production. The damage has been caused by this trade policy and our farmers are hurting, he added.
The majority of those who died today were children, a tearful President Obama said. Beautiful little kids between the ages of five and ten years old.
Lydia Doza Whitehouse.gov Lydia Doza, 24, a native American in Alaska, has benefitted from the Obama administration's Generation Indigenous Initiative for Native American youth. She's pursuing a degree in software engineering at Oregon Tech. Doza is an example of the president's emphasis on educating young Americans in the science and technology.
As Joe Biden settles into the role of the presumptive nominee for the Democratic Party, CBS News campaign reporters Tim Perry and LaCrai Mitchell report that some are calling on the former vice president to choose a woman of color as his running mate, while others are specifically hoping a black woman will fill the position. Conversations with more than a dozen black women in Congress and black women political leaders and activists in battleground states revealed this sentiment: it's past time for women of color and particularly black women to be seriously considered for top positions like the role of vice president.
After a long and spirited primary, Rubio said, It's time to come together. It's time to win in November.
The following is a transcript of the interview with White House senior adviser Stephen Miller that aired Sunday, Dec. 16, 2018, on Face the Nation.
That has created a boom in health insurance scams, experts say. Health care-related cons didn't even register among the top 10 scams as recently as February, but they now account for nearly one-quarter of all illegal computer-generated calls, according to YouMail, a free robocall blocking service for cell phones.
Lesley Stahl: Okay, I'll ask you another health question, okay? Told you. Okay. You promised that there was gonna be a new health package, a health care plan.
Like in Pennsylvania, the North Carolina dispute also involves an extension of the deadline for mail-in ballots, but Republicans in the Tar Heel State and the Trump campaign have filed an emergency application to the Supreme Court.
McGahn praised Mr. Trump for his focus on the federal judiciary, which will likely have a lasting impact.
Kaiser's study also estimated that nearly 8 in 10 of the newly uninsured would be likely to qualify for some sort of coverage under former President Obama's health law, either a private plan like Franklin found, or Medicaid.
President Donald Trump: It's been-- just go down and get the papers. They spied on my campaign, they got caught.
On ABC's This Week on Sunday, Conway was also asked if Trump should be more transparent with his taxes.
At his funeral, which the president did not attend, Meghan McCain did not mention Mr. Trump by name but said, We gather here to mourn the passing of American greatness, the real thing, not the cheap rhetoric from men who will never come near the sacrifice he gave so willingly.
TRUMP: No, I didn't say that at all. I don't think you understood what was — this was locker room talk. I'm not proud of it. I apologize to my family. I apologize to the American people. Certainly I'm not proud of it. But this is locker room talk.
Their thesaurus was well-worn in 2015.
MARGARET BRENNAN: --that the administration fell short?
SENATOR RICK SCOTT: It's going to ruin Medicare.
The report comes as House Democrats under Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., are moving to shore up the ACA, including trying to undo some of Trump's insurance changes. Although such a rollback seems unlikely to succeed under divided government, there has been bipartisan support for measures that would help reduce premiums and guarantee coverage for pre-existing conditions. Restoring the ad budget for HealthCare.gov slashed by Mr. Trump is also a possibility.
Christie is viewed more negatively than positively among registered voters nationwide, although Republicans are more apt to have a favorable view of him. Eighteen percent of voters view Christie favorably, while 38 percent have unfavorable opinion of him. Four in 10 voters are undecided or don't know enough about him.
RADDATZ: Thank you, Secretary Clinton. Thank you. You're out of time. Mr. Trump?
Eric Trump: I think as a family, we've changed, to tell you the truth. I mean, how big this platform is, is incredible. And I have to say, one of the most rewarding things of my life, and I can speak on behalf of really all of us, it's fighting by our father's side every single day as you've gone through a grueling, grueling process like this.
MARGARET BRENNAN: But in hindsight, you know where this story ends up.
Lesley Stahl: Does he listen to you?
ANTHONY SALVANTO: Right. Well, the gender gap is up. And that means there's an increasing difference between how women are voting, in this case, more heavily for the Democrats and how men are voting in this case more heavily for the Republicans. So we looked at why this is. And one of the reasons is that women are among this group that have-- are heavily cross-pressured this year. They say that they think the economy is doing well. Normally, that would advantage the party in power: the Republicans. They voted in these districts. They voted for Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton and about even measures.
1:20 a.m. ET Melania Trump's speech to the Republican convention included a passage that was very similar to one in Michelle Obama's 2008 speech to the Democratic convention.
Association plans have been around for a long time, but under the ACA they were restricted. The new rules loosen some of these restrictions and expand the reach of these plans. At the same time, these plans are exempt from many of the protections under the ACA, including coverage of the 10 essential health benefits such as maternity and mental health services, hospitalization and prescription drugs.
The apparent snag is Puzder's difficulty selling his holdings in privately owned CKE Restaurants, the parent corporation of Hardee's and Carl's Jr. Until he worked out a plan to do that and filed a financial disclosure, his nomination couldn't go forward. But after he filed his paperwork, apparently laying out such a plan, the new hearing was slated for Feb. 16.
What you missed over the weekend
I want her to say among other things, we have a crisis in higher education -- public universities and colleges should be tuition free. Raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour, Sanders told CBS This Morning in late June. I believe that health care should be a right of all people. I would love her to say that and I would love her to move aggressively to make that happen.
According to CBS News' Steve Chaggaris and Katiana Krawchenko, the group attempting to force a roll call vote submitted signatures from nine states (seven are required). But three states withdrew their support, which left the coalition, many of whom are anti-Trump supporters, delegates falling one state short. As a result, the rules were adopted by a voice vote. Some Delegates Unbound delegates walked out of the convention hall in protest.
While the president has long complained of Democrats' obstruction, despite Republicans controlling Congress, the last two years of working the system will be a breeze compared to what the next two likely will be.
Eric Trump: You start to see the states falling. You start seeing Florida come in and he was declared the winner. And then you saw Ohio, you saw North Carolina. You saw Pennsylvania. You saw Wisconsin. I mean, you saw all these great states – they're all falling. And I think it was when we got Pennsylvania that we knew. And it was amazing. We were high fiving and we were all hugging as a family. And I actually think our father was the calmest of all of us even though he was really obviously the center of attention. So--
FACT CHECK: True. Trump is right: he was likely referring to President Obama's statement in August 2012, that we have been very clear to the Assad regime, but also to other players on the ground, that a red line for us is we start seeing a whole bunch of chemical weapons moving around or being utilized.
RADDATZ: Thank you, Secretary Clinton. Mr. Trump, in December, you said this. Donald J. Trump is calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country's representatives can figure out what the hell is going on. We have no choice. We have no choice. Your running mate said this week that the Muslim ban is no longer your position. Is that correct? And if it is, was it a mistake to have a religious test?
Lesley Stahl: Can you characterize your supporters?
It's no secret New York is a left-leaning state, one where Donald Trump and John Kasich should have a significant stronghold, Trusted Leadership's executive director Chip Roy said in a statement. Yet Ted Cruz's message of small government, ending Obamacare and protecting our country from terrorists ring true with Americans across the country.
The administration's budget is being released next month but is likely to be largely ignored, especially as election-year politics take over.
MARGARET BRENNAN: So that- that sounds like--
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, of California, and the ranking Democrat on the House Appropriations Committee, Niti Lowey, of New York, also praised the bill, as did Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Thad Cochran (R, Mississippi) and House Appropriations Committee Chairman Rodney Frelinghuysen (R, N.J.).
9:35 p.m. The president spoke about a 12-year-old Preston Sharp, a guest sitting next to Melania Trump in the House gallery who noticed that veterans' graves were not marked by American flags on Veterans Day and started a movement to place flags at their graves.
The two candidates' basic philosophies are in basic conflict. The Democratic/Clinton camp sees higher education as more of a public good, like interstate highways and electrical infrastructure.
Well, I think they are bigger because I hope that it sends the message that there is one standard of justice in this country. And that's the way it will be. It doesn't matter what political party you're in, or, you know, whether you're rich or poor. We will follow the same standard for everybody. Was there a crime committed, do we believe a crime was committed? And do we have the evidence to prove it beyond a reasonable doubt? And we don't think either of those standards were applicable here.
Start with the premise that mere concern about the issue is a form of hysteria. The idea that a nation controlling its own borders might be a completely reasonable, non-partisan position isn't even entertained.
Obama urges Americans to stay focused on Louisiana
Republicans, he said, handed out $1.5 trillion in tax cuts for folks who are already sitting pretty. They don't even try to pay for it, Obama said.
Thailand may send drunk drivers to work in hospital morgues
SEN. SCOTT: Well, first off, Margaret, my focus is on in how do you drive down the cost of health care? That- that's what's causing people health care- health care issues. You talked- you know, I've been talking to a lot of people in my state about the- like insulin costs, how- why in the world would they go up the way they have? Now, the other thing--
Marc Bayard, the director of the Institute for Policy Studies' Black Worker Initiative, told CBS News that in some ways this data was unsurprising and ties into the much larger racial inequities and economic injustice that African-Americans have faced for a long time. If we think about the black-owned businesses that we've grown up with, they're smaller, they're individual entrepreneurs, they weren't well capitalized before, said Bayard. …without the working capital, without the ability to access the federal loan programs…it's pretty cataclysmic, the impact of some of the inability to get capital for these small businesses in this pandemic.
Ossoff is a staunch opponent of the GOP efforts to repeal and replace Obamacare. He has run ads with a centrist fiscal message of cutting wasteful spending. Because the district is traditionally Republican and conservative, an anti-Trump message has not been much of a priority for Ossoff during his campaign.
Since we passed tax cuts, roughly 3 million workers have already gotten tax cut bonuses -- many of them thousands and thousands of dollars per worker. And it's getting more every month, every week. Apple has just announced it plans to invest a total of $350 billion in America, and hire another 20,000 workers. And just a little while ago, ExxonMobil announced a $50 billion investment in the United States, just a little while ago.
Some trials over the past year touched this chamber very personally. With us tonight is one of the toughest people ever to serve in this House -- a guy who took a bullet, almost died, and was back to work three and a half months later: the legend from Louisiana, Congressman Steve Scalise. I think they like you, Steve.
Former McCain advisor Steve Schmidt says yes.
Finally some good news about health insurance. Consumers shopping for coverage during the 2019 health care exchange open-enrollment period, which runs Nov. 1 to Dec. 15, may get a break in premium costs.
Among Republican labor secretaries, Puzder, who wouldn't be interviewed for this story, would be only the second hailing from the business world. The first was Raymond Donovan, a New Jersey construction executive who unions also reviled. He helped President Ronald Reagan break the air traffic controllers union after they went on strike in 1981. Other GOP Labor Department chiefs were from unions, government, philanthropy or academia.
Before we just move onto to a couple of off-topic questions, the last thing most Americans remember about General Flynn is that he resigned, was fired. And that he admitted lying to the FBI. Does the fact remain that he lied?
For instance, a standard silver plan under the ACA now averages $481 a month for a 40-year-old nonsmoker. A short-term plan might cost as little as $160 a month, according to some estimates.
We spoke to a group of Democratic congresswomen, veterans and freshmen, to ask how she wields her power.
ROBERT O'BRIEN (National Security Adviser): Well, I have not seen the finding. I think what he is referring to and what folks are talking about is a briefing that took place last week at the House Intelligence Committee that was leaked to the press. And I-- I have not seen that report. I get this second hand, but from Republican congressmen that were in the committee, there was no intelligence behind it. I haven't seen any intelligence to support the reports that were leaked out of the House.
Mr. Trump also discussed North Korea's nuclear provocations and it's treatment of both its own citizens and Otto Warmbier, an American student who was arrested in the country. Warmbier was sentenced to 15 years of hard labor for allegedly taking a political sign from a hotel, and died shortly after he was released from captivity.
Manchin's ad is the most visible example to date of how Democratic senators running for reelection in states that supported President Trump are campaigning in defense of the Affordable Care Act. Armed with polling data that shows broad national support for maintaining the law's protections of people with preexisting conditions, candidates like Manchin and Sens. Joe Donnelly, D-Indiana; Heidi Heitkamp, D-North Dakota; Robert Casey, D-Pennsylvania and Claire McCaskill, D-Missouri, are campaigning on a pledge to shore up the law – and against Republicans who tried unsuccessfully to repeal it last year. On the campaign trail, McCaskill often begins her events by asking crowds to raise their hands if they have a preexisting condition. Casey does something similar. And Heitkamp often mentions that as a breast cancer survivor, she can personally relate to her constituents with preexisting conditions.
Republicans, in a lame-duck legislative session called after the election but before Kaul and Evers took office, passed a law requiring the GOP-controlled Legislature to sign off before withdrawing from any lawsuit.
RADDATZ: I'm going to go to Secretary Clinton. Secretary Clinton, you want Assad to go. You advocated arming rebels, but it looks like that may be too late for Aleppo. You talk about diplomatic efforts. Those have failed. Cease-fires have failed. Would you introduce the threat of U.S. military force beyond a no-fly zone against the Assad regime to back up diplomacy?
We estimate about $500 billion of tax increases are possible, obviously a smaller number than another potential COVID stimulus round, and also smaller than the $1 trillion-plus spending now in play for each of health care and infrastructure, Zezas added.
But the Pentagon's leadership is in a state of flux. On Tuesday, Mr. Trump tweeted that Shanahan has withdrawn his name from consideration for defense secretary. Instead, Army Secretary Mark Esper will serve as acting defense secretary.
And the final thing I would say, this is the 10th or 12th time that he's denied being for the war in Iraq. We have it on tape. The entire press corps has looked at it. It's been debunked, but it never stops him from saying whatever he wants to say.
The Trump administration rolled back penalties under Obamacare for anyone who is uninsured, and the Trump administration has declined to open exchanges under a special enrollment period for Americans amid the crisis. Americans who are recently unemployed can apply for insurance under the Affordable Care Act, but the status quo will likely leave many in a gap without insurance.
Now consumers are left to guess which insurers will stay in the exchanges -- and how much they'll charge.
Decisions in the cases before the justices this term are expected by the end of June 2021.
It worked. Manchin easily won in 2010 and secured reelection in 2012 to a full term. Just weeks after winning reelection, Manchin plunged into the gun control debate after a gunman killed teachers and schoolchildren at a Connecticut elementary school. Citing his 2010 election ad as evidence of his appreciation for hunting and gun culture, Manchin said the nation needed to respond to the mass shooting by changing gun laws. He cast himself as a credible broker with Republicans, but his bid to enact changes failed, and the NRA dropped its support of the senator in the ensuing years.

In the early 1990s, 63 percent had a negative view of immigrants.
Donald Trump: No, I think I'm a sober person. I think the press tries to make you into something a little bit different. In my case, a little bit of a wild man. I'm not. I'm actually not. I'm a very sober person. But it was respect for the office, it was respect for the president. Again, I never met him before, but we had-- we had a very good chemistry going. And-- and I really found—it might not be that I agree with him, but I really found the conversation unbelievably interesting.
JOE BIDEN: I think we should only have troops there to make sure that it's impossible for the Taliban and, excuse me-- for ISIS or al Qaeda to reestablish a foothold there, to be able to go from Afghanistan to the United States to attack the United States. That requires a much smaller footprint. But, as I understand it, we're not drawing down to a level that was even as low as it was when we left Afghanistan.
The proposal represents one of the most comprehensive efforts to date. Details also include various ideas aimed at shoring up the Medicare health insurance program for seniors, including gradually increasing the retirement age and ultimately giving beneficiaries a choice of private plans to choose from in competition with the existing fee-for-service model.
He never apologized to the reporter that he mimicked and mocked on national television and our children were watching. And he never apologized for the racist lie that President Obama was not born in the United States of America. He owes the president an apology, he owes our country an apology, and he needs to take responsibility for his actions and his words.
MCGAHN: I think if you look at his record, he does. He had the economy going wonderfully, he made a number of promises on the campaign trail that he kept.
Melania Trump: I think it's very important because a lot of children and teenagers are getting hurt. And we need to teach them how to talk to each other, how to treat each other and to, to be able to connect with each other on the right way.
JOE BIDEN (Former Vice President/@JoeBiden/Democratic Presidential Candidate/@JoeBiden): It's also been about--
Donald Trump: No, we're going to do it simultaneously. It'll be just fine. We're not going to have, like, a two-day period and we're not going to have a two-year period where there's nothing. It will be repealed and replaced. And we'll know. And it'll be great health care for much less money. So it'll be better health care, much better, for less money. Not a bad combination.
The motif of winning plays a huge role in Trump's rhetoric.
Today, he has a new leg. But, Seong-ho, I understand you still keep those old crutches as a reminder of how far you've come. Your great sacrifice is an inspiration to us all. Please. Thank you. Seong-ho's story is a testament to the yearning of every human soul to live in freedom.
John McCain: I think he's handling it in a fashion that is unfortunately not predictable. The one thing your friends and your enemies want is a predictable path. Lesley, he changes his, his statements almost on a daily basis. I don't know what he's gonna do tomorrow (LAUGH). So—or say tomorrow.
1:44 p.m. In a message shared by The White House this afternoon, it listed several issues the president will talk about in his speech: tax cuts and the economy, infrastructure, immigration, trade and national security. It said, for example, that Mr. Trump will outline a $1 trillion infrastructure plan and explain his framework on immigration reform.
MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be right back with more politics and more of our interview with former Vice President Joe Biden, plus our panel. So, stay with us.
In an interview with CBS affiliate WCSC Monday afternoon, Kamala Harris said of former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg's decision to run that she trusts voters to make decisions based on a candidate's record.
Walz, who currently represents Minnesota's first district, is vacating his seat to run for governor. He defeated his Republican challenger by less than 1 percent in 2016. He was first elected in 2006, when he defeated a six term Republican incumbent to win the seat. Mr. Trump won his district in 2016 with 53.3 percent to Clinton's 38.4 percent, but in 2012 and 2008 the district went to Obama, who won with 49.6 percent to Romney's 48.2 percent, and 50.8 percent to McCain's 46.7 percent.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Got it and, quickly, do you support the President's call to cut off aid to Central American countries who are sending migrants into the United States?
If Bernie Sanders had become the Democratic presidential nominee, would the Lincoln Project be doing what it is today?
Donald Trump: It-- it's irrelevant because it was already settled. It's law. It was settled in the Supreme Court. I mean it's done.
And that when they heard about the phone call, which is – the FBI had the transcripts too – there's no question as to what was discussed. The FBI knew exactly what was discussed. And General Flynn, being the former director of the DIA, said to them, you know, You listen, you listen to everything. You know, you know what was said.

A day before early voting starts in the state, several Minnesota counties have seen an increase in absentee ballot applications, reports CBS News campaign reporter Jack Turman. Phil Chapman, the elections supervisor for Saint Louis County, which is home to Duluth, Minnesota, said that part of the initial preparations for the start of early voting included getting the absentee ballot applications in their system. Chapman noted that in 2016, approximately 16,000 Minnesotans voted by mail in the county, and as of Wednesday, the county has received 29,000 absentee ballot applications. The increase in absentee applications compared to 2016 is also prevalent in some Minneapolis suburbs. Paul Linnell, an elections manager for Anoka County, said for the 2016 general, the county had accepted 37,967 absentee ballots, including mail and in-person. As of Wednesday, Anoka County surpassed that total as it has processed 51,440 applications. Linnell also said that the county is in a good position when it comes to recruiting and training poll workers for Election Day. We are getting lengthy list of backups to work the polls on Election Day, he added. In 2016, Dakota County had roughly 30,000 absentee ballots returned, but has seen nearly 70,000 absentee ballot applications for the general election as of Thursday, according to county elections director Andy Lokken.
Carol Gayman of Manchester said that her New Hampshire family and friends appeared more anxious than in previous years. Democrats like her are desperate to beat President Trump in November, and feel that the pressure is on to pick the right nominee. I think we're all very, very nervous. And hopeful at the same time that our country can move forward and get back to where we were morally. Everyone is just so worried that we'll make the wrong decision, Gayman said. It's sad for Iowa. But now the onus is on New Hampshire, she said, smiling. Which is a good thing.
JOE BIDEN: Yeah. And so we'll see. I mean it's a little premature to make the judgment whether or not this is a good deal or not a good deal.
CBS's 24/7 digital dreaming news network, CBSN, will deliver extensive coverage throughout the day on all digital platforms and CBS This Morning Saturday Co-Host Alex Wagner will report live from Capitol Hill ahead of a special edition of CBSN's nightly politics show Red and Blue hosted by CBSN anchor and CBS News Correspondent Elaine Quijano at 8:00 PM, ET. CBSN will stream the Network's coverage beginning at 9:00 PM, ET, with the CBS News team continuing their coverage on CBSN following the President's speech and Democratic Response.

There is no Bernie Sanders of free market health care in the Republican Party...there's no Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, said Michael Cannon, director of health policy studies at the libertarian Cato Institute.
Liberals have pushed the #RussiaGate narrative with the phrase hacked the election, knowing that, to many rank-and-file Democrats, those words mean more than just posting Facebook ads. The suggestion behind a hacked election is that Russia actually changed the vote count and stole the White House from Hillary Clinton.
JOHN DICKERSON: But what of Senator Rubio's point and the administration's point which is once you come in with all these regulations, you choke off the economic recovery that-- that the America is in the middle of now?
In 2010 she beat the odds again by winning the Governor's race. But it was a dirty campaign, with both racism and sexual innuendo that would surface again this year.
President Donald Trump has hailed the small-business plans as a big success, but their impact is difficult to measure.
Yes, I plead guilty to using those words, Kessler said, laughing.
Star power meets political power in a new letter to Congress spearheaded by Beyonce's mother, Tina Knowles-Lawson. Her daughters, Beyonce Knowles Carter and Solange, are among the A-list signatories which include Jada Pinkett Smith, Whoopi Goldberg, Halle Berry, Kerry Washington and other African-American entertainers. It is co-penned by Mothers of the Movement, a coalition of Black mothers who have lost their children to police brutality and gun violence. I'm not a politician. I am not an activist, in that public sense, but I just felt like I had to do this, Knowles-Lawson told CBS This Morning co-anchor Gayle King.
While the Justice Department said it would allow congressional leaders and selects staff to see unredacted versions of the report, it would not disclose the grand jury documents, as rules governing those proceedings dictate that matters occurring before a grand jury must remain secret.
Workers most likely to be affected include union members, certain government employees, and people who work for thriving tech companies that provide generous benefits.
The case is likely to be heard in April. The Supreme Court will review an appeals court ruling that blocked the Trump administration rules because it did not follow proper procedures.

PAUL RYAN: Yes. Well, I'm not having fun in a government shutdown. I like to get back to work and make sure that we don't defund CHIP and-- and stop funding our troops.
ANTHONY SALVANTO: It inserted a lot of anger. We see anger up on both sides. We see Republicans saying they are increasingly angry about the prospect of the Democrats winning. Democrats saying they are increasingly angry about the prospect of the Republicans winning. Now anger does also correlate with intention to turn out and we feel more passionate about something, more likely to go and do it. So that's one determinant of turnout for certain. Did it change anybody's mind, though? No. It does not appear like it changed anybody's mind. It appeared to just cement what people already thought going in.
Yes, it's still early. However, other than a somewhat superstitious belief that elections have become essentially unpredictable in the Trump era, there's really little reason to think the GOP will hold onto the House come November. Democrats, being Democrats, can probably find a way to screw it up. But right now, it would appear that they're doing everything they need to do to return Pelosi to the speakership.
Another potential hurdle for Kavanaugh may be his opinions on how criminal proceedings should apply with regard to a sitting president.
Clinton says she supported more aggressive action in Syria
Republicans could have mounted a highly effective counter attack on health care in 2018. Democrats have fumbled the ball and Republicans are just looking at it lying on the 50 yard line.
The following is a transcript of the interview with Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota that aired Sunday, June 30, 2019, on Face the Nation.
Frankly, I don't think they can come up with a plan as good as the ACA given what they want to do, said Nadler. The chairman added that he was hopeful AG Barr and members of the Trump administration would reply to Democrats' requests in a professional manner.
Most significant are the proposals to allow government reimbursements for opioid addiction medications, including for the first time methadone and efforts to cut back on prescribing opioids.
Trump responded to the attack on ABC's Good Morning America, dismissing the criticisms from Club for Growth.
TRUMP: I think you have to knock out ISIS. Right now, Syria is fighting ISIS. We have people that want to fight both at the same time. But Syria is no longer Syria. Syria is Russia and it's Iran, who she made strong and Kerry and Obama made into a very powerful nation and a very rich nation, very, very quickly, very, very quickly.
When Hillary Clinton called him her favorite Republican as she was preparing to run for president, I asked McCain the obvious question: Is she your favorite Democrat?
We believe in a country where we take the threat of terrorism seriously. We name it for what it is: Radical Islamic Terrorism.

There's been a total of 25 people in the race so hey jump on in, the water's warm, joked Harris. [I] have faith in the American voter to make decisions not based on how much money somebody has but based on their track record of doing work in service of others and in service of their community.
With many questioning whether Trump could be a viable candidate, Trump suggested that President Obama is someone who takes him seriously.

But McGahn said Democrats' assumptions that Barrett would vote to overturn Roe and strike down Obamacare are not fair assumptions one way or the other.
Brandi Paullo's house was also wrecked. She says Culberson was there for her.
Conway served as Trump's third campaign manager and largely succeeded in navigating the minefield of rivalries that ensnared other officials. Trump is said to have offered her a choice of White House jobs -- either press secretary or communications director. But people with knowledge of Conway's plans say she is more interested in serving as an outside political adviser, akin to the role President Barack Obama's campaign manager David Plouffe played following the 2008 election.
If the law is overturned, nearly 20 million people could lose their health insurance. Children would no longer be covered until age 26, and it could affect people with preexisting conditions.
CLINTON: Well, I think Donald was about to say he's going to solve it by repealing it and getting rid of the Affordable Care Act. And I'm going to fix it, because I agree with you. Premiums have gotten too high. Copays, deductibles, prescription drug costs, and I've laid out a series of actions that we can take to try to get those costs down.
According to IssueOne, a pro-campaign finance reform group that looked at filings with the Federal Election Commission, $59.6 million has been invested in the race so far by all candidates and political groups, including money that was spent during the primary process of the election.
Rep. Karen Bass: --how to deal with her.
During the primaries, Biden often campaigned on being the candidate to help down-ballot races. It's not just whether or not the person you pick as the nominee can win. It's whether or not that person you pick as the nominee can bring along a Democratic Senate, Biden said in January.
As South Carolina Governor, Haley gained national prominence after she pushed through a bill to remove the Confederate flag from the State Capitol grounds in the wake of a racially-motivated shooting that killed nine people in a black church.

After longtime New Jersey Senator Frank Lautenberg died in the summer of 2013, Booker ran to fill his seat and defeated a little-known Republican mayor in a special election. In 2014, he won reelection to serve a full term in the Senate. During his years in the Senate, he has sought to promote bipartisanship through conciliatory rhetoric. Booker announced he was running for president on Feb. 1, 2019, the first day of Black History Month. Issues He has made criminal justice reform and the decriminalization of marijuana integral issues of his agenda in the Senate. Pointing to the disproportionate incarceration of minorities for marijuana-related offenses, he crafted the Marijuana Justice Act in the summer of 2017. The bill would remove marijuana from the 1970 Controlled Substances Act, withhold federal funding for states which continue to criminalize the substance, require courts to expunge convictions for marijuana use or possession and establish a federal fund to help low-income communities affected by the so-called war on drugs. The junior senator from New Jersey is one of the chief architects of the First Step Act, a landmark bill that President Trump signed into law in December after rare overwhelming bipartisan support in Congress. The legislation increases investment in programs to curb recidivism among federal prisoners and modifies several sentencing laws, including mandatory minimum sentences for nonviolent drug offenders. Although he hopes to tout it as a signature achievement of his career in Congress, Booker acknowledged that the bill is just one stepping stone to overhaul the criminal justice system.
During a press conference after announcing her exploratory committee, Warren pushed for more accountability in the economy and pledged to go after drug companies. The problem is Washington works great for those with influence. Warren also came out against political action committees to fund campaigns. Democrats are the party of the people -- we join together and we fund our campaigns, she told reporters. We make our campaigns work through the people. Controversy Warren's claims of Native American ancestry, which her opponents say she used unfairly to get ahead, have been the source of controversy since her first run for the Senate. In an attempt to silence critics --namely, President Trump -- ahead of a presidential bid, Warren released the results of a DNA test in 2018 that showed a tiny portion of Native American heritage, along with a campaign-like video about her family history. The move backfired, inviting criticism from tribal leaders and Native American groups. And it raised questions about how effectively Warren will be able to compete with President Trump. What Trump says The heritage controversy put Warren high on Mr. Trump's hit list. He frequently refers to her as Pocahontas, and while campaigning over the summer, he pledged to give $1 million to charity if she would take a DNA test. He later denied making the pledge once she released the results of the test but has continued to criticize Warren over the backlash to her DNA video. She did very badly in proving that she was of Indian heritage.
Donald Trump: He did, he called the next day.
According to data from the media tracking firm Advertising Analytics, Biden's campaign has spent $686,573 on television advertisements in the Hawkeye State.

More than 80 percent of Americans enrolled in an Obamacare plan are receiving government subsidies to help pay for their coverage. Meanwhile, the Affordable Care Act explicitly prohibits undocumented immigrants from using the Obamacare marketplaces at all.
COOPER: Secretary Clinton, thank you. Mr. Trump, you have two minutes.
They've called him a traitor, they've declared his presidency illegitimate, they've convinced their base he's all but a Russian asset—but Pelosi and Company want swing voters to believe that if they win the House, they'll just shrug it all off and start working with President Trump on an infrastructure bill? Not even progressives are buying that.
The legislation, known as an omnibus spending package, totals more than $1 trillion and is expected to fund the government through the rest of fiscal 2017, which ends September 30. Lawmakers are expected to vote on the comprehensive measure this week before funding runs out Friday night.
This is about delivering much more affordable healthcare in contrast to a collapsing Obamacare, said Rep. Kevin Brady, R-Texas, chairman of the powerful tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee. He added that it creates momentum for tax reform and takes $1 trillion of tax hikes out of the economy that he said have been hurting patients and small businesses.
The senators, along with Representative David Cicilline, made the request Wednesday in a letter to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell.
PAUL RYAN: Look, if we're doing fine I have no plans of going anywhere any time soon. But that's something that my wife and I always decide in-- in late spring of the election year.
We're both successful businessmen -- although I flew commercial here, so I'm guessing he didn't. We both have had hit television shows, and we both have intelligent wives who are much better-looking than we are, Robertson said.
KELSEY SNELL: Well, I think that it's going to be equal parts political kind of circus and a lot of information getting out there to the public that people want to understand. And I think it will be up to Democrats to find a way to walk the line between wanting to push the political side of things and get political wins on the board on a-- you know, on a hearing that will be widely watched and televised, and needing to establish that their investigations going forward are not some sort of the partisan witch hunt that the President talks about. It's going to be a delicate balance. And it should be very, very interesting to watch.
But after being outraised roughly 2 to 1, Graham's operating expenses covered about half of what he raised, $26.5 million and another $1.75 million was transferred to the state Republican party. In their pre-general election filings, Harrison raised another $22 million in just 14 days from October 1 through 14, but ended the period with just $3.5 million cash on hand. Graham raised less than half of that but had $7.3 million as of October 14.
The campaign also promised that as president, Clinton would double funding for primary care services at medical clinics that primarily serve low-income communities.
A federal judge in Texas on Friday ruled the entire Affordable Care Act is unconstitutional due to a recent change in federal tax law. The move, coming on the eve of the deadline to sign up for coverage for 2019, leaves 20 million Americans' health coverage in limbo.
All right. Anthony, let's start with the top big inside. What's going to happen to the House?
Warren also released her second wave of endorsements for up and down-ballot Democrats since leaving the presidential race. Notably, she backed MJ Hegar, an Air Force veteran who will appear in a runoff election in mid-June to be Democrats' challenger for Senator John Cornyn. As a dedicated combat veteran and working mom who has lived through many of the challenges facing Texans, MJ Hegar is a proven fighter, Warren said in a statement. She will ensure every Texan has affordable health care, economic opportunity and a government that works for the people – not corporate special interests or billionaires. In addition to a slew of incumbents, Warren endorsed Georgette Gomez, a progressive backed by Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez who is running against former Hillary Clinton adviser Sara Jacobs to replace Rep. Susan Davis in California when she retires.
White House press secretary Jen Psaki signaled Tuesday that Biden is also looking at limiting or reversing Trump administration actions that allowed states to impose work requirements for able-bodied, low-income adults as a condition of getting Medicaid. Such rules are seen as a way to cull the program rolls.
Lesley Stahl: But it doesn't look like that. It looks as if it-- you're-- it's fractured.
SEN. BARRASSO: Well, get- there are people working on this to get to a conclusion so the government will remain open which is what I believe the American people would prefer.
House Democrats on Thursday threatened to oppose a spending bill if House Republicans decided to hold a floor vote on their revised health care bill to repeal and replace Obamacare, but GOP leaders decided late Thursday to instead delay the vote. Republicans spent the day lobbying undecided lawmakers and those who are against the new version.
Lesley Stahl: I never did a Joe Biden interview-
So, you talk about friend? Go back and take a look at those commercials, a race where you lost fair and square, unlike the Bernie Sanders race, where you won, but not fair and square, in my opinion. And all you have to do is take a look at WikiLeaks and just see what they say about Bernie Sanders and see what Deborah Wasserman Schultz had in mind, because Bernie Sanders, between super-delegates and Deborah Wasserman Schultz, he never had a chance. And I was so surprised to see him sign on with the devil.
He added that uniformed military will remain on normal duty status but to the Defense Department's civilian force, he said, I know the days ahead could mean more uncertainty, including possible furloughs.
We think if the college has real skin in the game, it will change its model, Clovis stated. I requested a more detailed education position platform from the Trump campaign, but did not receive a reply.
We will build gleaming new roads, bridges, highways, railways, and waterways all across our land. And we will do it with American heart, and American hands, and American grit.
Of George W. Bush, who Trump also blasted on Saturday's GOP debate stage, he added that all of the problems in the Middle East had their origins with his presidency.
He reminded them of what the president had told them in 2017 in Lordstown, Ohio: 'Don't move, don't sell your house,' Biden said. But Lordstown shut down on Trump's watch.
In the wake of the pipe bomb scare and the Pittsburgh shooting, pundits and anti-Trump politicians have been demanding that Republicans and conservatives abandon their hateful rhetoric, as the cliché' goes. Why aren't Trump supporters aren't turning on the president, they demand to know. What's keeping rank-and-file Republicans from abandoning Trump over his clearly objectionable statements and divisive outbursts?
This is a tough one to gauge in some respects because the definition of rebuilding the military could mean many things.
RADDATZ: Tell me what your strategy is.
The government wasted at least $341,000 on travel by ousted Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price, including booking charter flights without considering cheaper scheduled airlines, an agency watchdog said Friday.

Lesley Stahl: One of the reasons is that they don't feel you're being upfront about the pandemic. Are you deliberately downplaying it?
Alan Diaz Alan Diaz, Wilfredo Lee/AP Associated Press photojournalist Alan Diaz (May 15, 1947-July 3, 2018) was born in New York to Cuban parents, and spent his adolescence in Cuba, where he studied photography with Alberto Korda. Diaz was freelancing for AP in November 1999 when a boater found a Cuban boy floating in an inner tube in the waters off Fort Lauderdale. Diaz spent the next few months chatting with Elian Gonzalez's relatives and neighbors, earning their trust by respecting an order from the boy's uncle to not speak to the child. Because of those relationships, he was the only photographer to capture the moment when U.S. immigration agents ended a bitter international custody battle with a pre-dawn raid the day before Easter in 2000. Diaz's Pulitzer Prize-winning photo shows an armed U.S. immigration agent reaching out toward the terrified six-year-old, seconds before the boy was pulled out of his uncle's Little Havana home so he could be returned to his father in Cuba. After the picture hit the wires and network news, Diaz saw how both Cuban leader Fidel Castro and Cuban-American community leaders used it to argue that the other side was brutal and heartless. I have no opinion on it. I shot the moment. That's all, Diaz said last year. Good or bad, that's what happened that morning. During his career Diaz, who was known to roar, Hello, Miami!
MARGARET BRENNAN: But Mister Biden's push to end the pandemic will likely be disrupted by mutating strains of the virus now spreading in the U.S. Another roadblock: He's having a tough time selling his nearly two-trillion-dollar package of economic aid to Congress. Even to some members of his own party.
MILLER: Well obviously there's no change immediately in Obamacare. There hasn't been a nationwide injunction. Obamacare was ruled to be unconstitutional. We've always known that Obamacare was unconstitutional. The more important question is whether Democrats are going to work with Republicans once Obamacare is ultimately struck down, which we believe it will be, to come up with a replacement plan that protects preexisting conditions. Helps the 28 million Americans who because of Obamacare still don't have access to health insurance and keeps prices low through robust competition.
In those closed door meetings, GOP leaders are arguing that any other approach would result in millions of people losing the ability to afford insurance and Republicans getting the blame.
Lesley Stahl: Do you worry that he's not fit for the office?
This time around, Bevin has had to deal with sky-high disapproval ratings. He was the most unpopular governor in the nation for the most of the summer, according to Morning Consult, and had alienating spats with teachers over their pension fund.
MAYOR FRANCIS SUAREZ: I don't yet. I haven't gotten any indication from the-- the State Health Department that we have any of those strains. It's very possible that we do. What we do know and what we've been told is that the vaccines that we're administering for both Moderna and Pfizer are effective against the U.K. strain, which, of course, we all know is significantly more contagious than-- than, you know, the sort of previous version of-- of COVID-19. So, we're continuing to vaccinate both in the city of Miami at Marlins Park at about seven thousand a week.
The push for documents comes after the Justice Department submitted its filing with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit in New Orleans last month, which has an appeal pending challenging the law's constitutionality. A federal judge in Texas ruled back in December that Obamacare is unconstitutional because of the change in federal tax law passed by Republicans in Congress in 2017.
And we're also thinking, you would probably get some additional funding for rental assistance, Yaros added.
Lemek said there are two factors mainly spurring grassroots support: the images of some state capitol protesters bringing their assault-style weapons, and the type of panic purchasing of firearms in states where gun shops have been deemed essential.
Republicans in the White House and on Capitol Hill see their priority as working more closely to prevent a blowout, said one former administration official who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss private thinking.
MARGARET BRENNAN: But, Kelsey, the President's going to need Congress to confirm them.
Eight million kids every year have health insurance, because when I was first lady I worked with Democrats and Republicans to create the Children's Health Insurance Program. Hundreds of thousands of kids now have a chance to be adopted because I worked to change our adoption and foster care system. After 9/11, I went to work with Republican mayor, governor and president to rebuild New York and to get health care for our first responders who were suffering because they had run toward danger and gotten sickened by it. Hundreds of thousands of National Guard and Reserve members have health care because of work that I did, and children have safer medicines because I was able to pass a law that required the dosing to be more carefully done.
Declaring himself More Trump than Trump, Blankenship ran ads attacking Cocaine Mitch McConnell and accusing the top Republican in the U.S. Senate of corruption involving his wife, Secretary of Labor Elaine Chao, and her family—a storyline the resulted in headlines like West Virginia Pol Uses the Word 'Negro' to Defend Racist Ad About 'China People.'

He said the reason I'm endorsing Arlen Specter for U.S. Senate is because he's going to be there with us on the votes that we need him, Tyler said. Well everybody now knows that Arlen Specter was the decisive vote in Obamacare. So in a sense Romney invented Obamacare, but Rick Santorum gave it to us.
The percentage of female employees paying their own money for birth control pills has plunged to under 4%, from 21%, since contraception became a covered preventive health benefit under the Obama-era health law, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation.

President Donald Trump: --that would bring low-income housing into suburbia that is destroying-- that would destroy suburbia. And I said that in a joking way. The way you have it, it's like, Oh, like I'm begging. I w-- I'm kidding. Play it, and I'm kidding. That is such a misleading question, Lesley.
Rep. Tom Price, R-Georgia, has been named by President-elect Donald Trump as the Health and Human Services secretary, CBS News' Major Garrett confirms, citing a senior transition source.
MARGARET BRENNAN: The former vice president told us that despite his early losses, he's going to do well in the next round.
One of the things that has animated and characterized the president's approach is the way he has engaged American business to do their part and step up, Pence responded.
Trump is acutely aware that he's been accused of fomenting violence against protesters.
Vehement resistance from foes. To the ire of liberal opponents, the nominee has a long record of combating government regulation, a $15 minimum wage and Obamacare. Our system lacks any meaningful mechanism for tracking the cost of regulations, Puzder said in congressional testimony in 2012, and balancing that against the need for businesses to use their profits to expand, grow and thereby create jobs.

I noticed when Hillary Clinton and her supporters are asked in interviews, tell us what you're going to do about obamacare, how would you fix the economy, how do you explain the birth and growth of ISIS since 2013 -- they talk about Donald Trump, she said. So Hillary Clinton wants to talk about Donald Trump, we want to talk directly to the American people.
National Republicans are worried that if his name stays on the ballot they could lose this heretofore safe Republican seat, so they are looking into options to get his name off the ballot. But the process to get off the ballot in New York this late is burdensome, and the Republican party will have to appoint or elect him to another office in the state. They are trying to move him to a town clerkship race, and that would allow GOP county officials to handpick a new candidate for the race since the federal primary passed.
Koch-backed group uses Clinton to attack Ohio Senate candidate
While he's certainly a known commodity, it's not clear Trump has the personal popularity necessary to push him to the top of the presidential race. A Monmouth Univeristy poll released Monday, for example, found that 20 percent of voters view Trump favorably, while 55 percent view him unfavorably - the worst spread of any Republican contender.
Unemployment claims have hit a 45-year low. It's something I'm very proud of. African American unemployment stands at the lowest rate ever recorded. And Hispanic American unemployment has also reached the lowest levels in history.
The cost estimate comes days before the Senate is expected to vote on the measure -- just before lawmakers leave Washington for their week-long July 4 recess. And even with the clock ticking, leadership has not yet secured enough votes to pass it.
The president also said his administration will be adding 2 or 3 additional members to the task force with a renewed focus on re-opening the country. I look forward to when we can close the task force, because then the job will be essentially, hopefully over, Mr. Trump later added.
If I read into polls, it means he wouldn't even be elected, McCarthy quipped. I think this is a window of an opportunity to move forward.
The administration's legal brief makes no mention of the coronavirus.
He has 20,000 employees. But in early years, some found the office harsh. Allegations by women have challenged his political campaigns.

She was the sole senator from Minnesota until the resolution of the contested Senate election from January to July 2009, which Al Franken eventually won. When Franken was accused of sexual harassment in December 2017, Klobuchar did not call for Franken to step down, unlike many other senators. Franken resigned shortly after the allegations came to light.
MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to read a statement from the vice president who said, it's is a lengthy one, but in just part of it he says, In my many years on the campaign trail and in public life, I have offered countless handshakes, hugs, expressions of affection, support and comfort. And not once, never, did I believe I acted inappropriately. If it is suggested I did so, I will listen respectfully. But it was never my intention. That's a general denial, but Ms. Flores was on CNN this morning, Senator, and she said that really this needs to be taken more seriously as a party, suggesting that Democrats aren't taking it seriously enough. And she said she's coming forth--
Braeden Mannering Mannering family Braeden Mannering, 12, was inspired by attending the White House Kids' State Dinner and hearing President Obama and the first lady challenge kids to make a difference. Taking that message to heart, he started a nonprofit called Brae's Brown Bags to provide healthy food to homeless and low-income people. He's motivated more than 2,600 volunteers according to the White House, provided more than 4,500 brown bags of good food as well as raised more than $52,000 for hunger relief. The sixth grader has also joined the speaker circuit at schools, conferences and legislative sessions.
Lesley Stahl: Even though you won you're saying that--
Their 2020 goal is to knock on more than 10 million doors and get out the vote in 17 states for the presidential and Senate races. According to PTP, conversations will focus on helping voters make a plan to vote safely including by mail. They're targeting a mix of voters including those under 35, voters of color and people who stayed home in 2016. Donald Trump's response to the pandemic and recent protests further prove that he is fundamentally incapable of doing his job, said Executive Director Alex Morgan in a statement. It's essential that we get to work now by having the kind of early, face-to-face conversations that our research shows boost Democratic turnout.
Near the end of his speech, Ryan also made a pitch for electing a conservative majority in Congress, and exhorted the crowd, What do you say we unify this party, at this crucial moment when unity is everything?
Donald Trump: I don't tell you that. I don't tell you that.
Nobody knows for sure that the Republicans & Democrats will be able to reach a deal on DACA by February 8, but everyone will be trying....with a big additional focus put on Military Strength and Border Security. The Dems have just learned that a Shutdown is not the answer! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 23, 2018
And I think when you look at the letters that I get, a lot of people are worried that maybe they wouldn't have a place in Donald Trump's America. They write me, and one woman wrote me about her son, Felix. She adopted him from Ethiopia when he was a toddler. He's 10 years old now. This is the only one country he's ever known. And he listens to Donald on TV and he said to his mother one day, will he send me back to Ethiopia if he gets elected?
Calls for construction of a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border
I think there's been a lot of talk about individuals losing health coverage, Price continued. That is not our goal nor is it our desire nor is it our plan.
Well, all of these bad leaders from ISIS are leaving Mosul. Why can't they do it quietly? Why can't they do the attack, make it a sneak attack, and after the attack is made, inform the American public that we've knocked out the leaders, we've had a tremendous success? People leave. Why do they have to say we're going to be attacking Mosul within the next four to six weeks, which is what they're saying? How stupid is our country? RADDATZ: There are sometimes reasons the military does that. Psychological warfare.
Here tonight are Steve Staub and Sandy Keplinger of Staub Manufacturing, a small, beautiful business in Ohio. They've just finished the best year in their 20-year history. Because of tax reform, they are handing out raises, hiring an additional 14 people, and expanding into the building next door. Good feeling.

Good morning and welcome to FACE THE NATION. We begin this morning with Vermont independent senator and candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination Bernie Sanders. He joins us from Burlington. Good morning to you, Senator. Let's--
Yang is ramping up his campaign in Nevada, naming Jenny Lehner his new political director in the state. According to CBS News campaign reporter Alex Tin, Lehner previously served as finance director to the Assembly Democratic Caucus and for Chris Giunchigliani's gubernatorial bid in Nevada. She also helps run a nonprofit with Giunchigliani, who has since endorsed Elizabeth Warren.
Struggling communities, especially immigrant communities, will also be helped by immigration policies that focus on the best interests of American workers and American families.

11:30 a.m. ET British rock band Queen didn't take kindly to the convention's use of their song We Are the Champions, which played as Donald Trump's walked out on stage to introduce his wife Monday night.
In a Thursday interview with Pod Save America, Smith says that Democrats are underperforming compared to Republicans in the ballot returns so far, because Republicans more persistently vote.
And here's what Obama said in 2008:
Most Republicans have offered a muted response to Mr. Trump's attacks on McCain, mentioning their admiration for McCain without naming the president.
Republican presidential candidate and Ohio Gov. John Kasich is deriding his party's 2014 pledge to repeal the Affordable Care Act, President Obama's landmark healthcare overhaul, as a big joke and a stupid promise.
Americans are also divided over the recent tax cuts passed by Congress and signed into law by President Trump, though more disapprove than approve. Three in four Republicans approve of the new tax law, while three in four Democrats disapprove.
We need a nominee who can help democrats up and down the ticket, Biden argued. But if Senator Sanders is the nominee for the party, every democrat in America…will have to carry the label Senator Sanders has chose for himself…he calls himself a democratic socialist.
ED O'KEEFE: Right. Which, you know, has been relitigated ever since, and-- and there are a lot of people in the party, certainly a lot of women who were involved in party politics these days who say it should have been handled differently and there's a lot of people wondering, is he going to apologize the way his entire Senate legacy over the course of this campaign, because a lot of what he did and said back in the day doesn't sync with what the Democratic Party is. His behavior, his policies, his-- his, you know, hours of Senate floor speeches, his votes on different bills. He's going to have to spend the entire campaign, particularly the entire primary at least, relitigating all that. And you wonder really does he really want to stomach that? But this-- this situation with Flores, what's-- what's telling-- she was asked this morning elsewhere about this and whether politics were involved. She was the supporter of Bernie Sanders. She was at a Beto O'Rourke rally this weekend, and she said flat out, yes, it does, because we're in the midst of a reckoning in our party and trying to determine who our nominee should be. There have been examples of this his entire career, and it's never been seriously discussed that he hasn't been held to account for it.
She works tirelessly, always on the move - in three-inch heels – at 79.
During the economic downturn in 2009, Donald Trump pitched a recession-proof business opportunity. The Trump Network relied on participants selling health supplements and other products person to person. But our investigation shows some who bought into the idea ended up thousands of dollars poorer.
The bill doesn't fulfill the administration's supplemental request for $18 billion in cuts for non-defense domestic programs, according to the senior aide, though a GOP aide disputed that characterization and said some of those cuts were already built into individual bills. CBS News reported earlier this month that negotiators were expected to ignore the $18 billion request, partially because it's so late into the fiscal year. Instead, the legislation includes spending boosts to domestic programs. If approved by Congress, the National Institutes of Health (NIH), for example, would receive a $2 billion funding increase despite the president's request to cut it.
It's also running in Florida as part of an ad partnership with Everytown for Gun Safety Victory Fund. At the same time, the Super PAC MeidasTouch started airing an ad Wednesday that includes clips of President Trump promising to repeal and replace Obamacare on the 2016 campaign trail before moving on to clips as Mr. Trump as president promising to unveil a health care plan. In the years since efforts to repeal and replace Obamacare failed in Congress in 2017, the president has said on numerous occasions Republicans would put forward their own health care plan, but it has not yet happened.
While Democrats are unwilling to include any provisions to scale back Obamacare in a government spending bill, they have conceded to the sequester-level spending levels Republicans have called for -- at least in the short-term.
But the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals sided with the city and found it did not treat Catholic Social Services worse than it would have treated another organization that didn't work with same-sex couples but had different religious beliefs.
There are gubernatorial primaries in Connecticut, Minnesota, Vermont and Wisconsin on Tuesday.
WASHINGTON -- About two weeks before the election, candidate Donald Trump put out what he called a contract with the American voter -- a list of actions he said he would take in his first day and in his first 100 days.
MARGARET BRENNAN: --made in 2014 by the Vice President Joe Biden. Does this become disqualifying for him? He has not officially, yet, declared he's running.
President Donald Trump: I don't encourage it.
Savvy shoppers share 9 secrets to save you money
This morning love triumphed in the highest court in our land, she said, before quoting from the majority decision passed down earlier Friday, and allowed same-sex couples to marry. They ask for equal dignity in the eyes of the law and the Constitution grants them that right.
This melding of social and economic issues looks a lot like the strategy Mr. Trump is likely to deploy next year. Beshear, meanwhile, has said repeatedly that he supports abortion rights and accused Bevin of opposing the procedure even in cases of rape or incest.
Mayor Mark Luttrell Adrian Sainz/AP Republican Mark Luttrell is the Shelby County mayor in Tennessee. As mayor, he has created special courts for drug, mental health and veterans' cases for more effective rehabilitation possibilities for prisoners. Luttrell has also helped facilitate resources for those released from prison to assist them re-entering society to reduce recidivism. He served as Director of Corrections for Shelby Country, then elected sheriff in 2002, followed by becoming mayor in 2010.
Price said the initial legislation should not change Medicare, which covers older people.
On a personal level, the juxtaposition between my experience with cancer with the Trumps and my experience with the Bidens has been the yin to the yang, she said. Biden was incredibly there for me and my family, his son Beau died of the same cancer that my father had, glioblastoma, so we have this really strange and intense bond. And I love him dearly. If he becomes the nominee, I am going to have to quit television because I can't say anything bad about him.
COOPER: Please allow her to respond. She didn't interrupt you.
11:30 a.m. ET Cleveland Police Chief Calvin Williams talked to Face the Nation host John Dickerson this morning about things he's watching for and precautions that are being taken.
Mike Bloomberg: Well, I didn't write the book. So--
MANUEL BOJORQUEZ: Across the nation of the nearly fifty million doses distributed to states, just sixty percent have been administered. In an effort to speed up the process, FEMA is now asking the Defense Department to ready as many as ten thousand troops to assist in vaccine clinics. Yet for those who have received the shot, racial disparities persist, with white residents being vaccinated at higher rates than black residents, often double the rate or higher in one survey. At this clinic in South Los Angeles, a surprise shipment of six hundred doses before closing became a lifeline for those who have struggled to secure appointments.
Republicans in Congress are still working on their plan to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. In his speech Tuesday, President Trump spelled out some details, including a new series of tax credits to help Americans buy insurance.
It depends how frequently, though at least once a week, but sometimes, you know, if you've been around and could have been infected, you can get further testing.
Meanwhile, as the Trump administration continues its efforts in the courts to strike down the Affordable Care Act, Klobuchar said she'd support a constitutional amendment guaranteeing the right to health care for all Americans.
Insurers would not be required to cover pre-existing conditions;
We stepped in and rescued the automobile industry — General Motors and Chrysler — saving one million jobs, he said. And then what happened when Donald Trump came to office?
Price also acknowledged that the ACA has had some benefits, saying that the coverage has certainly improved.
TRUMP: And, again, Bernie Sanders, it's really bad judgment. She has made bad judgment not only on taxes. She's made bad judgments on Libya, on Syria, on Iraq. I mean, her and Obama, whether you like it or not, the way they got out of Iraq, the vacuum they've left, that's why ISIS formed in the first place. They started from that little area, and now they're in 32 different nations, Hillary. Congratulations. Great job.

MARGARET BRENNAN: So you- are you--
COOPER: Please allow her to respond. She didn't talk while you talked.
When it comes to family, it's being there that counts, the narrator says. Because every moment matters. And every family deserves to have good healthcare from day one. So let's build on Obamacare and finish the job.
MARGARET BRENNAN: That's what I want to ask you about because we heard from Johnson & Johnson and Novavax that potentially their vaccines may be less effective against that strain out of South Africa. How long will it take us to get the booster shots that you say may be necessary?
I disagree that there was any hesitancy or pause last time, McGahn said when pressed on why Barrett was passed over for the Supreme Court in 2018. She was a relatively new federal judge. She was placed on a short list. The public found out about the short list because it was publicly announced, so the process has really been transparent. Recall the president, even as a candidate, put out not one, but two lists of judges who could be on the Supreme Court. He's updated it a few times since. So I think that at the time, Brett Kavanaugh was the right person at the right time. And I think Judge Amy Barrett is the right person at the right time now.
QUESTION: Thank you, and good evening. The last debate could have been rated as MA, mature audiences, per TV parental guidelines. Knowing that educators assign viewing the presidential debates as students' homework, do you feel you're modeling appropriate and positive behavior for today's youth?
Mike Bloomberg: I have been training for this job for close to 20 years there is nobody else running that has any management experience whatsoever in any of these things, but you have to have somebody that's been there done that and will do it right and will guide us through the tough times particularly day one.
Lesley Stahl: Are you gonna take the salary, the president's salary?
SEN. KLOBUCHAR: As part of comprehensive immigration reform, we must move forward on making sure that people have health care. California just did that with Medicaid, and I am supportive of that but I think on the national basis, as we go forward, get immediate health care for people, yes. But as part of making this actually happen, you need comprehensive immigration reform. And one thing that was missing from the NBC debate, actually, that I hope we can discuss, is that we have a humanitarian crisis at the border right now. But we also did not talk about the other immigrants that are here. The people who are here on temporary legal status, we've got hundreds of thousands of people that are legally here that are at risk or are being deported that work in our nursing homes and our hospitals. We have got dreamers, two million of them, that came to this country through no fault of their own and are a major part of our economy. So, we need to have an economic discussion about this, as well as a border discussion--
JOHN DICKERSON: Here's what they say. And you have two Republicans in the Senate who voted against this funding measure for roughly similar reasons which is the president's been a moving target. Mitch McConnell, the leader of the Republicans in the Senate, said, We're spinning our wheels until we know where the president is. So the Democrats felt like, or this is their case anyway, they felt like, He's a moving target. Let's use this moment of leverage, as-- as Republicans did with Obamacare in 2013.
House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff, who has led the committee's own investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election, is now facing calls from Republican colleagues to resign as chairman for pushing a false narrative of collusion.
Health insurance markets also have well known market failures. The first is, once again, moral hazard, and it's similar to the moral hazard problem in retirement insurance markets. People know that a compassionate society will care for them if they break an arm, contract a life-threatening disease or have some other severe health problem. They can always go to the emergency room at society's expense, and for that reason many will choose to go without insurance.
President Donald Trump has vowed to dismantle Obamacare -- and con artists have been listening. Earlier this year, the government nixed the so-called individual mandate that required all Americans to buy health insurance or pay a tax penalty. And last month, new rules were adopted that allow millions of people to buy cheaper temporary health policies if they don't get coverage through work.
Biden regularly reminds his audience that the ACA's passage has allowed 20 million more Americans access to healthcare coverage, a fact supported by healthcare researcher Kaiser Family Foundation and quips about when he told Obama on hot mic the ACA was a big f**king deal — language for which he now performs the Sign of the Cross during his stump speech, to his audience's delight.
All we're simply saying is that they can keep $5.3 billion but we deserve a billion of that to come into this state for education, he said.
Cruz then turned Boehner's comments into a primary election issue, painting his main opponent, Donald Trump, as near and dear to Boehner's heart.
Be sure to compare all levels of coverage carefully, especially if you qualify for a subsidy. Gold plans, for instance, come with higher premiums but lower deductibles and other out-of-pocket costs. For some consumers with high out-of-pocket costs, premium subsidies help make these seemingly more expensive plans more affordable overall than some of the higher-deductible silver and bronze plans.
Lesley Stahl: And before the blood clot operation, did they mention glioblastoma to you?
If we weren't able to repeal and replace Obamacare, it would have been a bad midterm for us. I think we will hold our own, if not pick up seats, he told reporters.
It isn't, but President Trump did have an impressive string of economic accomplishments.
SEN. BARRASSO: I think government never does big things really well. I'm for more of a step-by-step and I want to start with the first step of people with preexisting conditions. My wife Bobbi is a breast cancer survivor. She's been through three operations, chemotherapy twice and I will tell you as a husband, as well as a doctor, I am committed to helping people with preexisting conditions. We can do that- they're a number of ways to do it. One is what Maine has done in terms of their high risk people helping with them with additional subsidies. But at the same time, then it allows insurance to be much cheaper, more affordable for other people. So I want to do- our-our children's health insurance plan that works across the country. It works so well because states have a bigger say in that. When I was in our state Senate in Wyoming, we knew that what we wanted to do in Wyoming may not fit what people would want in New York state. But if you give states that flexibility and freedom to do what works best with the money, I think it works much better for families and for patients.
We're going to see even more and more of it, she said.
At one point, a Code Pink protester -- who often demonstrates during hearings on Capitol Hill -- interrupted Trump's speech.
Ivanka Trump: I'm-- no. I'm going to be a daughter. But I've-- I've said throughout the campaign that I am very passionate about certain issues. And that I want to fight for them.
Our live updates during the hearing were below:
ICE just endorsed me. They've never endorsed a presidential candidate. The Border Patrol agents, 16,500, just recently endorsed me, and they endorsed me because I understand the border. She doesn't. She wants amnesty for everybody. Come right in. Come right over. It's a horrible thing she's doing. She's got bad judgment, and honestly, so bad that she should never be president of the United States. That I can tell you.
We'll be back in a moment.
The Senate measure, Better Care Reconciliation Act (BCRA), would leave 49 million people uninsured in 2026 compared to 28 million people uninsured by that year under Obamacare. And by 2026, there would be 15 million fewer Medicaid enrollees.
As for dumping the Electoral College, if anything, that idea's even more extreme than court packing. And why is it necessary?
10:50 a.m. ET Sen. Patty Murray of Washington pushes Price hard about his questionable stock investments.
Still, this was not likely how a young Ryan, who cut his teeth in Washington as a speechwriter for conservative icon Jack Kemp, imagined closing out his career.
President Donald Trump: I think it's an issue. To me it's an issue.
New campaign, same broken promises, said Daniel Wessel, deputy director of the DNC War Room. Trump will say anything to win an election, and then he never follows through. Look where we are today - health care costs more, prescription drugs cost more, and all Trump's done is help the rich and big corporations. The question voters need to ask is: what's he done for me? For working people, the answer is nothing.
Lesley Stahl: Four years ago, you were behind in the polls, as you are now, and you pulled it out. But this time, you have kind of a double migraine. You have unemployment claims going up. You have COVID cases going up. I mean, it's like the gods have suddenly decided-- decided to conspire against you--
When pressed on who is working on Mr. Trump's health care proposal, White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany referenced multiple stakeholders at the White House, including the Domestic Policy Council.
Donald Trump: Well, I'll tell you what I'm going to do, I'm going to think about it. Um, I feel that I want to focus on jobs, I want to focus on healthcare, I want to focus on the border and immigration and doing a really great immigration bill. We want to have a great immigration bill. And I want to focus on all of these other things that we've been talking about.
In 2012, a Tea Party challenger and a residency scandal cost long-serving Republican Sen. Dick Lugar his seat, allowing Democrat Joe Donnelly to eke out a win in this deep red Midwestern state. Republicans are hoping to knock Donnelly off in November, however, and they certainly could, given how Mr. Trump won the state by 19 points in 2016.
PAUL RYAN: We don't have control of our borders. We have a broken immigration system while we address the symptom of the problem. That's what the president is saying. And that's perfectly common sense.
BIDEN: It's not fi- I said I'm going to do well there. And I'll do well there and I'll do well-beyond there as well.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Well back of Sanders is former Vice President Joe Biden who'd hoped to score strong support in the state where a third of Democratic caucus voters are minorities.
This White House guidance comes just days after the Justice Department sued North Carolina over a new state law that says transgender people must use public bathrooms, showers and changing rooms that correspond to the sex on their birth certificate. The administration has said the law violates the Civil Rights Act.
The federal employees that Dougan represents are all too aware of the consequences. Around 800,000 federal workers, who make an average salary between 25,000 and 75,000 a year, have been furloughed without pay during the shutdown. This furlough comes on top of other furloughs they've seen this year because of budget cuts.
Yes, our political polarization is worse than it's ever been. But it's been bad for years and showed no signs of improving no matter which candidate won the White House in 2016. So why not cast a Why the hell not? ballot.
We are the party of new ideas in a world changing faster than ever before. Democrats depend on superdelegates and bureaucrats to sneak their agenda through the backdoor. We are the party of the grassroots. We honor what the voters say, he said.
Republicans cite the health insurance provisions as an example of coronavirus overreach by Democrats. Policy consultant Brian Blase, a former health care adviser in the Trump White House, said most of the additional subsidies for coverage will merely substitute for what private households would have otherwise paid. If made permanent, he predicts that over time the sweeter tax credits will have the unintended consequence of enticing small businesses to stop offering coverage to their workers.
Several lawyers and activists told CBS News that Biden, a former public defender, should run on protecting the popular liberal legacy of Ruth Bader Ginsburg.
On CBS This Morning Thursday, Patrick called the current field of Democrats really talented, but questioned if they could pull the nation together.
Donald Trump: Well, sometimes you need a certain rhetoric to get people motivated. I don't want to be just a little nice monotone character and in many cases I will be.
I worked very hard and was very proud to be re-elected in New York by an even bigger margin than I had been elected the first time. And as president, I will take that work, that bipartisan work, that finding common ground, because you have to be able to get along with people to get things done in Washington.
But President Obama has different plans for his speech. He concedes his name is not on any ballot in 2016, but it will be his best last chance to craft his legacy as the nation's 44th president.
These recent polls also reveal a deep pessimism about the trajectory of the country – a trend that may help explain the president's lackluster approval ratings, and one that seems to have gotten worse over the last few months.
The crowd of 1,800 gathered at George Mason University's Patriot Center in Fairfax, Va., divided into half-capacity by a dark curtain, was fired up long before Clinton took the stage. More than an hour earlier, Rep. Gerry Connolly (D-Va.), had to yell over applause and cheers as he praised the Supreme Court's decision.
MARGARET BRENNAN: But just to clarify, are you saying that Joseph Maguire, the former acting director of National Intelligence, did not inform you about the U.S. Intelligence Committee's-- community's findings?
Ransomware could infect computer without even a click
The poll employed a random digit dial methodology. For the landline sample, a respondent was randomly selected from all adults in the household. For the cell sample, interviews were conducted with the person who answered the phone.
As we see from Speaker Ryan's speech, Republicans remain fixated on a toxic special interest agenda that threatens the economic security of millions of seniors and hard-working families, said Drew Hammill, spokesman for House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-California.
Donald Trump: I think that I would rather not comment on that yet. I don't-- I haven't made up my mind. I respect him a lot. I respect the FBI a lot. I think --
Mike Pence tells Lesley Stahl, [I]t's probably obvious to people that our styles are different, but I promise you, our vision is exactly the same. And asked whether he could stand up to Trump, Pence demurred a little, but Trump said that if his vice president came and told him he thought he was doing something wrong, he probably wouldn't apologize, but he would very likely listen to him. One topic they don't agree on -- John McCain's valor in the Vietnam war.
John McCain: I am more energetic and more engaged as a result of this because I know that I've got to do everything I can to serve this country while I can.
If the health insurance requirement is invalidated, then it necessarily follows that the rest of the ACA must also fall, Solicitor General Noel Francisco wrote Thursday.
The deadline to sign up for health insurance through the Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare, is Saturday, but fewer people are enrolling through the ACA than in previous years. Enrollment is down 12 percent in 2018, although there has been a surge in the past week.
Donald Trump's campaign manager Kellyanne Conway on Tuesday seemed to question why the public needs extensive medical information about presidential candidates.
Americans should know that if they are temporarily unemployed, there are coverage options available to them, including COBRA and the individual Exchange, where individuals experiencing a qualifying event such as a job loss can enroll for coverage, the senior administration official added.
The organization already hired all of its district leadership positions in February, including about 115 people who would be opening offices and training staff in 17 states. It's opening offices, buying supplies, and setting up the technology needed by its teams.
This past summer President Trump was sharply criticized by some on social media for tweets referring to Suburban Housewives of America. And an ad produced by a pro-Trump group seemed to be designed to stoke fear:
Mr. Trump filed for reelection the day he was sworn into office, but is ceremonially launching his reelection campaign Tuesday night with a campaign rally at the Amway Center, the home of the NBA's Orlando Magic. The Democratic National Committee says it's joining the Florida Democratic Party, which is spearheading a rally outside the Amway Center ahead of Mr. Trump's 8 p.m. kick-off.
KELSEY SNELL: Yeah. And that is something that I have talked to many senators about their concerns, about backlogging the number of people who need to be confirmed. You got to remember, they still need to nominate, and approve an attorney general. But the thing that I think is interesting about the White House strategy here is they are looking forward to Democrats in the House, planning a number of investigations. And I've heard Democrats say that they don't think that just getting rid of the head of an agency is going to forestall those investigations. If it's the White House's intent to avoid that, this may not be the strategy that actually gets the outcome that they're hoping for.
Most Americans who do not own guns also think gun laws should be stricter (64 percent), while most who own guns think they should be kept as they are (50 percent) or made less strict (17 percent).
Americans are slightly more concerned about a homegrown threat than they are about an attack originating from abroad. Sixty-three percent of Americans are very concerned about an attack by people already living in the U.S. who have been influenced by foreign extremists, while 59 percent are very concerned about an attack committed by terrorists entering the U.S. from other countries.
With primary season behind us and 50 days between now and Election Day, here are 10 questions to consider between now and the November general elections:
Raymond Kethledge in testimony before the Senate C-SPAN
Many Americans are still feeling the squeeze of an economy too weak to raise income levels. We're feeling a crushing national debt, a health care plan that has made insurance less affordable and doctors less available, and chaotic unrest in many of our cities, she said. Even worse, we are facing the most dangerous terrorist threat our nation has seen since September 11th, and this president appears either unwilling or unable to deal with it.
Manafort also previewed the convention's scheduled speakers this evening, including Trump's wife, Melania, who the presumptive nominee will introduce.
JOHN DICKERSON: --the confirmation process. And then you said they were-- their statements were reminders of-- of how our society has let down survivors of sexual assault for decades. Have you heard from or what have you heard from constituents in the wake of the confirmation?
And this year suburban women in battleground states comprise one of the most crucial voting blocs.
Trump and Pence will also hold their first campaign rally together in Cleveland this afternoon.
On Friday, HHS Deputy Secretary Eric Hargan said in a statement that the department has since instituted new travel procedures for all political appointees, calling them the most rigorous controls on travel in the organization's history.
I beat him very, very soundly and you have to understand, this was a contentious, some people say the most contentious primary they have ever seen either party. If I were him and gotten beaten that badly, I probably wouldn't show up either. He has a problem though. He signed the pledge. And from. a standpoint of honor, I think he should show up. I also think this: If this were the Democratic convention, I think he should show up because it's good for Ohio, Trump said.
The ITEP analysis estimates that the 11 million-plus undocumented immigrants in the U.S. have a 50 percent tax compliance rate, which nets local and state governments $11.6 billion annually. The undocumented are actually paying a higher percentage of their income toward local and state taxes than the people in the top 1 percent, said Erika Nava, a policy analyst for New Jersey Policy Perspectives, which works with ITEP.
Federal law — the Hyde Amendment — already prevents federal funding from going towards abortions, except in instances of rape, incest, or to save the life of the mother.
The president also called reports of Former Vice President Joe Biden's possible involvement in efforts to unmask former national security advisor Michael Flynn a massive thing, taunting his likely democratic rival reports CBS News campaign reporter Nicole Sganga. He said he knows nothing about anything, Trump said of Biden. I suspect you'll have, if it's possible, even bigger stories coming out, he added.
President Donald Trump: I haven't gone after her.
JOHN DICKERSON: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION. The midterm elections are less than a month away. So, we'd like to welcome CBS News elections and surveys director Anthony Salvanto to share some new insights from our Battleground Tracker polling.
Tuesday's arguments were the latest in a lawsuit filed by Republican officials in 18 states, led by the Texas Attorney General's Office. It was filed after Congress — which didn't repeal the law, despite pressure from President Donald Trump — reduced to zero the unpopular tax imposed on those without insurance.
But lower premiums may be deceptive, says Karen Pollitz senior fellow, health reform and private insurance at the Kaiser Family Foundation. Cheap insurance is cheap for a reason, says Pollitz, referring to both short-term and association health plans. These plans are less expensive because they are offering you less protection.
10:04 p.m. ET A protester interrupted Sen. Jeff Sessions's, R-Alabama, speech. She appeared to be an anti-war demonstrator. It's unclear if she is a member of a group.
But the future of that trade agreement is shaky in the House, where it needs to pass to become law. That aside, the Trump administration hasn't been able to explain exactly how a better trade agreement would actually fund the border wall.
And that is part of John Durham, U.S. Attorney John Durham's portfolio. The reason we had to take this action now and why U.S. Attorney Jeff Jensen came in was because it was prompted by the motions that were filed in that case. And so we had to sorta move more quickly on it. But John Durham is still looking at all of this.
Well, as I said in my confirmation hearing, one of the reasons I came back is because I was concerned that people were feeling there were two standards of justice in this country. And that the political and that the justice, or the law enforcement process was being used to play political games. And I wanted to make sure that we restore confidence in the system. There's only one standard of justice. And I believe that this case, that justice in this case requires dismissing the charges against General Flynn.
Melania Trump: Yes, she was a gracious host. We had a great time and we talk about raising children in the White House. She was very warm and very nice.
President Donald Trump at rally: You've gotta get your governor to open up your state, okay...
President Trump said he would only choose a nominee he was confident would overturn the Affordable Care Act, he said. That's on the Supreme Court's docket just one week after the election. It defies comprehension why President Trump would continue in his efforts to strip away from the American people preexisting discrimination protection.
And they mean it. From Hurricane Florence to Roseanne Barr's twitter feed to — no joke — the shooting of a congressional Republican baseball practice by an avid, anti-Trump liberal, members of the mainstream media and political culture blame it all on Trump.
They could have made the shutdown in 2013 much less impactful, but they chose to make it worse, he said.
Rose asked Clinton if Trump is the most dangerous man ever to run.
President Trump continued his attacks against late Sen. John McCain at an event in Ohio on Wednesday, slamming McCain's vote against repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act and complaining that he did not receive a thank you after the senator's Washington funeral.
Boehner spokesman Brendan Buck shot back, How does the White House justify signing the troop funding bill, but vetoing similar measures for veterans, National Parks, and District of Columbia? The President can't continue to complain about the impact of the government shutdown on veterans, visitors at National Parks, and DC while vetoing bills to help them. The White House position is unsustainably hypocritical.
SENATOR RICK SCOTT: But, Margaret, this-- the President just put out a marker what he wants to accomplish. I-- I think all of us want to be helpful to try to get something done. We know it's going to be difficult with Nancy Pelosi and with the Democrats proposing Medicare for all. We know that. At the same time, what I'm going to do is what I believe we can get done. Let's focus first on prescription drug prices. They're way too high.
CNN/ORC surveyed 1,025 adults from March 1-4, and the poll's margin of error is +/- 3 percentage points.
SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN (D-Maryland/@ChrisVanHollen): Yeah.
As soon as Republicans cleared the threshold to pass the bill, House Democrats began singing in unison, Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, hey, hey, goodbye toward the Republicans.
TRUMP: Could I just respond to this, please?
Today, workers at the Rockingham County Rehabilitation and Nursing Center voted 75-42 to organize a union with SEA/SEIU Local 1984. The local union has yet to endorse a candidate.
We then asked the vice president to put on his hat as the head of the White House Coronavirus Task Force.
In an arena filled with thousands of cheering Kentuckians Monday evening, the president tied the future of the House-crafted health care proposal to his ability to fulfill other campaign pledges, like reducing taxes and renegotiating trade deals.
Lesley Stahl: I've got a lot of questions I didn't ask.
No, I'm doing the law's bidding. I'm doing my duty under the law, as I see it.
The Senate is seen as a moderating influence. And President Donald Trump, who once promised insurance for everybody, will have to weigh the specifics of what he's lately acknowledged is a complicated issue.
Last year, Congress also passed, and I signed, the landmark VA Accountability Act. Since its passage, my administration has already removed more than 1,500 VA employees who failed to give our veterans the care they deserve. And we are hiring talented people who love our vets as much as we do.
If an insurer allows people to wait until just before they think they need the insurance to start paying premiums, it will go broke because it likely hasn't collected enough money in premiums to cover the claim payments. That's why before the ACA became effective, insurance companies were allowed to deny coverage to new applicants if they had preexisting medical conditions, or they were allowed to charge higher premiums for people who had such conditions.
SEN. SCOTT: Premiums went up, co-payments went up--
You might not have heard the news this morning, he said, setting up a joke about the Winter Olympics. The gold medal Lindsey Vonn won last night has been stripped. It was determined President Obama has been going downhill faster than she is.
Chief Justice John Roberts is the Supreme Court's new man in the middle. It's just that the middle may have moved well to the right.
TRUMP: I'm shocked to hear that.
Texas Democrats aim to flip the state blue across the ballot, especially the state House in 2020. They are currently within nine seats of the majority and are looking to bring that down to eight in January's special election for House District 28.

The Trump campaign on Thursday blasted Joe Biden over his proposed plan.
In Nevada, Republican incumbent Sen. Dean Heller is expected to face off against Democratic Rep. Jacky Rosen in November.
One story initially broken by Politico and confirmed by CBS News involves a claim Verma filed in 2018 for $47,000 with the government for stolen property, including jewelry, after her luggage was stolen from a rental car while she delivered a work-related speech in San Francisco. The claim was for about $43,000 for jewelry and $4,000 for clothes. She received just $2,852.40.
A majority of Americans say passing laws to bring down prescription drug prices should be a top priority for Trump and Congress, according to recent polling by the Kaiser Family Foundation.
JOHN DICKERSON: Break-- break away from that technology but stay with us until the show's over. We'll be right back.
The decision from the high court is a victory for the Trump administration's efforts to safeguard religious liberty, including by fulfilling a 2016 campaign promise to ensure religious entities are not bullied by the federal government because of their religious beliefs.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Or what did you mean?
MARGARET BRENNAN: And there's no date for that to happen?
MARGARET BRENNAN: Jamal, Mayor Pete-- Pete Buttigieg had the most Google searches than anyone else in the field last week. So, do we go from the well-established name to the unknown? I mean is that what we have to kind of start from scratch?
If there is a coronavirus outbreak in November, a little less than half of Americans (46%) support allowing people to vote in person. Republicans (58%) are more likely to favor that than Democrats (38%). If there's an outbreak in November, 48% of Americans say they would support conducting the election only by mail. A majority of Democrats, 60%, favor that, compared to 37% of Republicans. There is much more support for no-excuse absentee voting by mail, however. A majority, 60%, of Americans say they would favor that if there's a coronavirus outbreak in November. Almost three-fourths of Democrats (73%) approve of letting people vote by mail without a giving a reason, compared to a little less than half of Republicans (46%). Five states conduct their elections by mailing every eligible voter a ballot and another 29 states plus Washington D.C. off no excuse absentee voting, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.
RADDATZ: Mr. Trump, would you like to go first?
The billionaire's projected win comes despite the fact that 41 percent of voters said he has been running the most unfair campaign, while a third said the same about Cruz.
Lesley Stahl: Oh, I bet he asked you not to undo it.
The requirement applies to all insurers, not just those in the exchanges, and polls show most Americans -- including many who don't support Obamacare overall -- want to preserve it. Even Senate Majority leader Mitch McConnell famously said, Everybody I know in the Senate, everybody, is in favor of maintaining coverage for preexisting conditions.
TRUMP: Absolutely. I mean, she calls our people deplorable, a large group, and irredeemable. I will be a president for all of our people. And I'll be a president that will turn our inner cities around and will give strength to people and will give economics to people and will bring jobs back.
According to attendees at a Friday meeting in New York City, Harris media adviser Jim Margolis told the room of supporters and donors in that Harris' moment at the first debate essentially set hard to match expectations for the second debate. They're now hoping expectations are where they should be for the third debate.
Lanny Davis, former attorney to Michael Cohen
Willie McCovey Robert Houston/AP A first baseman and left fielder, Hall of Famer Willie McCovey (January 10, 1938-October 31, 2018) was nicknamed Stretch for his 6'4 frame, and his long arms, which helped propel 521 home runs during his 22 major league seasons, 19 of them with the San Francisco Giants. (He also played for the A's and Padres.) A native of Mobile, Ala., McCovey made his major league debut at age 21 on July 30, 1959. He won that year's National League Rookie of the Year Award for batting.354, with 13 homers and 38 RBIs. The six-time All-Star was the NL's Most Valuable Player in 1969, while playing alongside the Giants' other Willie (Willie Mays), also a Mobile native. I'm not afraid of any pitcher, McCovey once stated. I've been pitched almost every way, and I've hit every kind of pitch. There wasn't much else to do in Mobile.
But on Wednesday, he explained why he launched missile strikes against the Syrian regime of Bashar al-Assad.
On this Face the Nation broadcast:
On global warming more broadly, Americans are increasingly coming to believe that global warming both exists and is caused mainly by human activity. Sixty-one percent now think so, a rise of seven points from just last April. Back in 2011, just 42 percent said the global warming was caused by human activity.
Not that President Trump's rhetoric is standard issue. It's not. His attacks on Mexican-Americans and women and Muslims and pretty much everyone else are beyond anything America has ever seen from a president. And he's been denounced for it by members of his own party. Polls show Republican voters don't like what Trump does on Twitter. In theory, there should be common ground for a conversation about civility.
Not only that, but has anybody noticed that for the past 18 months the court has been working just fine? It's ruled for Trump (travel ban, voter rolls) and against Trump (also the travel ban, and environmental regulation).
A: Among the ACA provisions that appear to be safe are closing the Medicare prescription drug coverage gap, allowing young adults to stay on parental plans until age 26, a ban on lifetime and annual dollar limits on coverage, and maximum limits on out-of-pocket costs.
SCOTT GOTTLIEB: There's some-- there's some evidence right now that does suggest that it is more pathogenic, that it does cause more severe illness. And we do know that it's about fifty percent more transmissible. But what we also know from the data, at least the data we have so far, both experimental evidence as well as the data that's come out of some of these vaccine trials like the Johnson & Johnson vaccine trial and the one with Novavax is that immunization and prior infection appears to be protective against the B117 variant, as protective. That's not the case with the Brazilian and the South African variant P1 and B1351, where prior infection, immunity you get from being infected as well as the immunity you get from vaccination, does not appear to be as protective against those variants. So the good news with B117, if there is good news is that as we vaccinate more of the population, it should be a backstop against the continued spread of that variant.
Only on one occasion did Roberts join with the liberal justices in a 5-4 decision, a ruling that said police generally must have warrants to get telecommunications companies' records showing where people have used their cellphones.
Look, think about this — can you imagine any other president of the United States focusing on this at a moment when the country is absolutely considered about their health of their children, the health of their families? he said. This is all about diverting attention. Focus on what is in front of us.
Mike Bloomberg: Oh, I think, for sure. You evolve with times. We're all a product of the world we live in. Shame on you if you don't learn and try to be better.
But I'll tell you what he's going to do. His plan will give the wealthy and corporations the biggest tax cuts they've ever had, more than the Bush tax cuts by at least a factor of two. Donald always takes care of Donald and people like Donald, and this would be a massive gift. And, indeed, the way that he talks about his tax cuts would end up raising taxes on middle-class families, millions of middle-class families.
ED O'KEEFE (CBS News Political Correspondent/@edokeefe): It's certainly one of them. And-- and, you know, a lot of people commented as he was entering the race that in some ways Bernie Sanders should kind of won the 2016 cycle because all of his ideas have now become, essentially, party orthodox here or at least open for more vigorous debate. And when it comes to Medicare for all, certainly that is one of them. The fact that the party is now comfortable having a-- a more robust discussion about it, I think is a signal that he and-- and Elizabeth Warren certainly have dominated the first few months when it comes to the ideas debate.
JOE BIDEN: Yes, a very small presence to be able to determine whether or not, I mean, a small footprint--
One seat will remain vacant in remembrance of the victims of gun violence. President Obama still wants Congress to act beyond his executive measures to keep guns out of the wrong hands.
There's evidence that the Obamacare marketplaces -- designed to help people on the individual market gain access to a range of private plans -- are working. A recent Gallup survey found that the uninsured rate has fallen 1.2 points since last year, meaning that about 2.5 million more adult Americans have insurance now that the marketplaces are open. Some of those newly-insured may be covered by the expanded version of Medicaid (also as a result of Obamacare) if not the new marketplace.
The companies, which sold insurance in Alaska, Illinois, Maine, North Carolina, Oregon and Washington, cite HHS statistics to claim they are owed $12 billion.
President Trump said Monday that he would reveal his Supreme Court nominee in a prime time announcement on Tuesday from the White House.
But on these initiatives, Democrats will have to pick and choose, Yaros said.
9:25 p.m. And just as I promised the American people from this podium 11 months ago, we enacted the biggest tax cuts and reforms in American history.Our massive tax cuts provide tremendous relief for the middle class and small businesses, he said. A typical family of four making $75,000 will see their tax bill reduced by $2,000 -- slashing their tax bill in half. This April will be the last time you ever file under the old broken system -- and millions of Americans will have more take-home pay starting next month.

Conway was promoted last week to campaign manager in a staff shake-up.
MARGARET BRENNAN: I-- I want to quickly ask you, though, about Afghanistan. If the Taliban does not make good on its promise to pull back on violence, to sign this deal at the end of the month, is the President positioned to stop the troop withdrawal?
JOE BIDEN: I told you, I'm not going to play this game with you. I don't know. It's not about who I stop. It's why I'm running, why I'm telling the people that I should be the next President and why I'm the best guy to beat Trump. All those other polls you all cite also show I'm the most person-- I'm the person most likely to beat Trump. I'm the person that, in fact, in-- in those polls in addition to that, I'm the only one, in terms of the Russians and all these stuff you've all been reporting. The-- the Russians don't want me to be the nominee. They spent a lot of money on bots on Facebook and they've been taken down saying Biden is a bad guy. They don't want Biden running. They are not-- no one is helping me to try to get the nomination. They have good reason.
MILLER: Well we also have to think about--
SENATOR JOHN BARRASSO: Well, there are a lot of things you need to do with border security. One is a physical barrier but also the technology, the manpower, the enforcement, all of those things, and our current laws are in some ways an incentive for people to come to this country illegally and they go through great risk and possibly great harm.
President Donald Trump: But the media is fake. And frankly, if I didn't have social media, I'd have no way of getting out my voice.
The latest Iowa caucus poll by Monmouth University indicates similar candidate popularity as these fair interviews with Biden and Warren amassing the most support.
JOHN DICKERSON: But their argument would be if you want to get these problems solved in the Senate where you know you need 60 votes when you have-- you need to do a little outreach and- and be ready. If you're gonna say, It's my way or the highway, be-- recognize the fact--
Mr. Biden is expected to sign an executive order Thursday, said two people familiar with the plan, whose details were still being finalized. They spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the pending order ahead of a formal announcement.
Critics contend the infrastructure plan will fail to reach its goals without more federal support. Proposals to streamline the permitting process as a way to reduce the cost of projects have already generated opposition from environmental groups.
This poll was conducted by telephone December 4-8, 2015 among a random sample of 1,275 adults nationwide. Data collection was conducted on behalf of CBS News and The New York Times by SSRS of Media, PA. Phone numbers were dialed from samples of both standard land-line and cell phones.

You take your state workers, you take your teachers, you take friends and family, that's a lot of votes. That's why I think it's close, he told CBS News.
Mnuchin said in the hearing that, we will review that.
I'm interesting because my favorite candidate is not who I am gonna vote for, Ellen Pirro, 70, said as she sat knitting with her local wool spinning guild. At the moment it seems to be Biden and if that's the case I will definitely vote for him because I want Trump beaten more than a particular candidate.
When asked by CBS News if she was preparing differently to stand center stage with Biden, Warren also demurred. Not really, she replied. For me, it's one more chance to talk about what's broken in this country, my plans for fixing it, and how I'm building a grassroots movement to get it done.
Lesley Stahl: And what do you think the future of our system is if that's true?
10:18 p.m. Alluding to his decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's official capital, he said, I am asking the Congress to pass legislation to help ensure American foreign-assistance dollars always serve American interests, and only go to friends of America, not enemies of America.
The reveal comes as Republicans begin to shore up their defenses in Texas. President Trump has held two rallies so far this year, and the Texas GOP has previously released its own voter registration and engagement efforts. In a statement, Texas Republicans Chairman James Dickey responded to the story and said that it's revealing that the Dallas Morning News reporter thinks that's newsworthy…We at the Republican Party of Texas are working on winning races all across Texas and growing support among both Republican and swing voters.
Democratic talk about expanding the Supreme Court to 11 or 15 members when they eventually take power in the future so they can appoint liberal justices and take back the majority would be far more damaging to the judiciary than any pick Trump would ever make.

For example, someone in a 37% tax bracket is able to deduct the full amount of a retirement plan contribution, so $37 for every $100 pre-tax contribution. That's a greater tax benefit than someone in a lower tax bracket, such as 20%, who would receive a $20 deduction for each $100 pre-tax contribution.

In 2013, as the Ohio legislature was considering Medicaid expansion, Kasich relied on an appeal to compassion and faith in making his case.
The rising deficits don't lay at Ryan's feet alone. Although the 48-year-old lawmaker from Wisconsin was an aggressive salesman for his plans, and was once viewed as the new face of a GOP focused on shrinking the size of government, the party ultimately did not turn his way. President Donald Trump had no interest in Ryan's Medicare proposal and even called it a political loser during the 2016 primary campaign. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., has made clear he's not interested in taking on Social Security reforms.
The New York Board of Elections has voted to remove candidates who have suspended their campaigns from the primary ballot on June 23, meaning Biden will win all of the 274 pledged delegates, reports CBS News political unit associate producer Eleanor Watson. The obscure provision allowing the board of elections to do this was entered into the state budget signed by Andrew Cuomo at the beginning of the month. Thousands of Sanders supporters signed a petition to keep Bernie Sanders on so he could amass delegates to influence decisions at the national convention, but that failed to sway the board. The co-chair of the board of elections Doug Kellner said, I think that it's time for us to recognize that the presidential contest is over. Kellner was asked if this means there's no primary, and he said, That's right. Joe Biden is the only candidate and therefore, he has effectively won the New York primary. In a statement, Democratic National Committee spokesman David Bergstein said Any substantive change to a state's first determining step in allocating delegates like this one will need to be reviewed by the DNC's Rules and By-Laws Committee. Once the state party submits an updated delegate selection plan, the committee will review that plan and make a determination. Bernie 2020 senior adviser Jeff Weaver also issued a statement, saying today's decision by the State of New York Board of Elections is an outrage, a blow to American democracy, and must be overturned by the DNC.
There will be no taxpayer bailout of Puerto Rico, Ryan said.

Hardiman has an appealing life story -- the first person in his family to go to college, he attended the University of Notre Dame as an undergraduate and then later financed his law degree at the Georgetown University by driving a taxi. If confirmed, Hardiman would be the only justice on the court who did not attend Harvard or Yale Law School. (Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg attended Harvard but obtained her law degree from Columbia. She transferred when her husband was hired by a law firm in New York.)

MARGARET BRENNAN: Today's Washington Post makes the observation about President Trump that …nearly every organization that he's led in the past decade is under investigation. To help us make sense of where we are in some of those investigations, we're joined now by Trevor Potter. He is the former chairman of the Federal Election Commission and our CBS news correspondent Paula Reid, who has been covering the Trump investigations. And you have your plateful there, Paula, with that description there. First off, I want to let you respond, was there anything there in the defense of Michael Cohen from Lanny Davis that stood out to you?
MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about your time in Congress. You, yourself were hunkered down on January 6th inside the Capitol when you were a sitting congressman during that siege. Speaker Pelosi said this week that the enemy is within the House of Representatives. Do you believe that some of your former colleagues, sitting lawmakers, pose a security risk?
John McCain: If I took offense at everybody who has said something about me, or disparaged me or something like that-- life is too short. You've gotta move on. And on an issue of this importance to the nation, for me to worry about a personal relationship, then I'm not doing my job.

The one-two punch is seen by the White House as providing more affordable options than consumers can find on the ACA exchanges. From 2013 to 2017 insurance premiums more than doubled under the Affordable Care Act, shutting out tons of middle-class Americans who don't get subsidies, according to a White House press release.
It's one of the few regrets of my presidency - that the rancor and suspicion between the parties has gotten worse instead of better, Mr. Obama said in a uniquely humble moment of his address. I have no doubt a president with the gifts of Lincoln or Roosevelt might have better bridged the divide, and I guarantee I'll keep trying to be better so long as I hold this office.
Give me a chance to take this to America, Kasich said to over 275 people in Florence, South Carolina Thursday. If I can't do that, I am blaming you.
SENATOR MARCO RUBIO: Well, I respect Carlos tremendously. He's been a leader on that topic. My view is climate, sea level rise, these are measurable things. You can measure that. So there-- it's not even a scientific debate. At some point, it's just a reality debate. You can measure whether sea levels are higher than they used to be, warmer than used to be and the like. For, as a policymaker the fundamental question is, what can we do about it? And if, in fact, humans are contributing to that, what public policy can we pursue that you can actually pass, does not destroy your economy and can be effective.
CLINTON: These are very important values to me, because this is the America that I know and love. And I can pledge to you tonight that this is the America that I will serve if I'm so fortunate enough to become your president.
Alker, the Georgetown University expert, said insurance protection has been neglected in the pandemic.

In the wake of the San Bernardino attack, President Obama's job rating for handling terrorism has sunk even lower. Just 34 percent of Americans approve of how President Obama is handling the threat of terrorism, inching below the previous all-time low of 36 percent recorded just last month. Fifty-seven percent now disapprove of his handling of terrorism - a record high. Interviewing for the poll was underway when the President gave his address last Sunday evening.

President Trump called a study from the Food and Drug Administration about hydroxychloroquine and its effectiveness in treating the coronavirus phony during a cabinet meeting Tuesday afternoon. I'll stay on it for a little while longer. I'm just very curious myself. But it seems to be very safe, said the president. CBS News campaign reporter Nicole Sganga says Mr. Trump, 73, revealed to reporters during a White House event on Monday that he has been taking the antimalarial drug he frequently touts as treatment for COVID-19. According to the FDA, hydroxychloroquine is linked to serious and even fatal heart risks in some patients. The largest study on the drug to date showed it did not improve the condition of coronavirus patients and was tied to a greater number of deaths. The agency has warned against its widespread use. White House physician Dr. Sean Conley confirmed in a memorandum he and Mr. Trump had several discussions about hydroxychloroquine and decided the potential benefit from treatment outweighed the relative risks.
Most of my days are spent talking to clients about what are the polls showing, which way are the winds blowing, what could the implications be. This, of course, touches on everything: trade policy, infrastructure, the Fed raising interest rates, Torsten Slok, chief international economist at Deutsche Bank, told CBS MoneyWatch.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. Is the President willing to compromise then and, perhaps, strip out something like this fifteen-dollar minimum wage demand that many Republicans object to? Could he make that a separate vote?
The #DefeatTrumpFL rally, the DNC says, will feature speakers from Florida sharing their personal stories about how Mr. Trump's policies have hurt them and their families. Democrats say the speakers will touch on topics like the administration's track record on health care coverage for preexisting conditions, an issue that helped derail the GOP's attempt to repeal Obamacare in 2017. Florida Democrats have about 90 organizers on the ground, and will use the rally to sign up more volunteers.
He rehashed other key tenets of his presidential platform as well, promising to do beautiful work by dismantling Obamacare, protecting the Second Amendment, ridding the country of Common Core education standards, and forcing Mexico to pay for a border wall.
Trump discussed his own personal financial picture at length, defying pundits who speculated that his reluctance to enter previous presidential contests stemmed from an aversion to publicizing his personal finances.
I pay hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes. But — but as soon as my routine audit is finished, I'll release my returns. I'll be very proud to. They're actually quite great.
The Senate had failed in dramatic fashion to repeal Obamacare, drawing Mr. Trump's wrath. He implored the Republican leader: Mitch, get to work.
His plan, he said, keeps revenue coming in by limiting some of the deductions and exemptions, particularly for people at the high-income level, so we can keep the progressivity of the code. ... Get our rates down, encourage growth, business startups and expansions, (that) mean jobs for middle-income Americans.

Tim Ryan Biography Ryan was born and raised in northeastern Ohio in 1973. He played football in high school and was recruited to play for Youngstown State University. Because of a knee injury, however, he transferred to Bowling Green State University, near Toledo. After graduating from college, Ryan earned a J.D. from the University of New Hampshire and worked in the office of longtime Ohio Congressman James Traficant, who was expelled from the House after being convicted of numerous counts of tax evasion, bribery and racketeering. At age 26, Ryan was elected to Ohio's state senate. When his old boss Tradicant became embroiled in scandal, Ryan ran an underdog campaign to fill his seat and won. At 29, he was the youngest member of Congress when he was sworn in 2003. Although he has served eight terms in the House, Ryan gained notoriety following Mr. Trump's unexpected election in November 2016. Citing Democrats' loss of Midwestern states during the election -- as well as the lack of youth in the party's leadership -- Ryan launched an unsuccessful bid to replace Nancy Pelosi, then House Minority Leader. After Democrats retook control of the House during the 2018 November midterm elections, the Ohio lawmaker again called for someone to replace Pelosi. Ryan, however, ultimately backed her bid to reclaim the speaker's gavel. Rep. Tim Ryan announces 2020 run 03:08 Issues Ryan has not staked out a clear ideological agenda during his 15 years in Congress.
CBS News Producer Rebecca Kaplan reports that House Democrats are proposing a new national requirement that states offer 15 days early voting and no-excuse absentee voting by mail, including mandating that states mail a ballot to all registered voters in an emergency. The requirement, which is part of a competing stimulus bill being crafted by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and her members, would offer states $4 billion in grant funding through the Election Assistance Commission to carry out the new requirements.
I believe it's Director Comey and the deputy's office.
Lesley Stahl: Well, congratulations, Mr. Trump.
A year after receiving a double hand transplant, 9-year-old Zion Harvey is -- to steal an old baseball metaphor -- batting 1,000. Doctors in Philadelphia transplanted donor hands and forearms onto Harvey in the first operation of its kind on a child. The youngster has been through a lot, but continues to impress.
STEPHEN MILLER: Obamacare was a disaster. Fortunately, again, the President is taking significant action to bring down the price of insurance on the exchanges. But Obamacare never worked. For example, even on the issue of preexisting conditions. American families earning eighty thousand dollars a year, with a few children, has to pay exorbitant out-of-pocket costs if they have preexisting conditions.
Congressmen-elect Mike Garcia of California and Tom Tiffany of Wisconsin were sworn in Tuesday on Capitol Hill. In a presser, Garcia, who won California's 25th special election, said the level of access to vote for his race was unique to the pandemic and said he still had concerns about vote-by-mail. It's concerning in that, there is a significant chain of custody challenges with voting by mail. In California, we're able to track it now online so we do get the warm fuzzy after about a week or so, that our ballot was not only received but also counted. But it also allows for opportunity for fraud, and other issues that we can't necessarily manage, he said. California Governor Gavin Newsom has switched to an all-mail-ballot election for November. Garcia's flip of a district Hillary Clinton won has been an energizer for House Republicans in their efforts to take back the House. Garcia seemed hopeful his success could be replicated in other House races in November, and said Tuesday, In the end if you've got the right candidate, if you've got the right message...we can win every election that we run in and we will. Garcia himself will have to face Democratic candidate Christy Smith in a rematch this November, where Democrats are expecting a different turnout due to the presidential election.
Reeves is banking that he can turn out Republican voters in a state Mr. Trump won by 17 points in 2016. The hope for Hood is that he can combine enough African American voters in cities like Jackson with rural white voters who backed Mr. Trump in the last presidential election.
Speaker Paul Ryan warned Tuesday that if GOP presidential candidates wait until after the Republican National Convention to get their acts together, it would be too late.
The Supreme Court refused Tuesday to consider a fast-track review of a lawsuit that threatens the Obama-era health care law, making it highly unlikely that the justices would decide the case before the 2020 election. The decision comes hours before Chief Justice John Roberts will preside over the president's impeachment trial.
Patrick clearly believes he's a viable option and is expected to emphasize his service as Massachusetts governor — the only Democrat to lead the state this century.
We'll be right back with more from our interview with former Vice President Joe Biden.
Democrats, however, had been demanding that they be included in the spending package that would fund the government through the rest of the fiscal year, or Sept. 30. Congress must pass a new spending bill by Friday night or the government will shut down on Saturday.
After devoting much of his speech to the health care law, an occasionally testy Santorum found himself the subject of reporters' regarding his socially conservative stances.
Meanwhile, Republican election officials are also urging people to vote-by-mail. Last week, the Georgia Republican secretary of state's office sent out a press release encouraging absentee ballot voting. Nevada's plan to hold an all-mail primary on June 9 was also announced by its Republican secretary of state. And in Kentucky, the Republican Secretary of State mailed all registered voters postcards explaining their options for the upcoming June 23 primary, including absentee voting by mail. He's been promoting the portal to request an absentee ballot online, as has the Kentucky Republican Party on Twitter, ahead of Tuesday's deadline.
SEN. KLOBUCHAR: --for immediate health care needs, but as far as other benefits I think we need to- that has got to be a part of the discussion of comprehensive immigration reform.
MARGARET BRENNAN: The other, President Trump says no one's helping him. We'll hear from the President's national security adviser Robert O'Brien.
MARGARET BRENNAN: So on that CDC plan, I know this report this week got a lot of attention really urging schools to reopen and-- and saying that transmission can be stopped if masks are worn and there's social distancing. But the same report said there should still be restrictions in the community and it cited indoor dining. Chicago has already opened its bars and restaurants. How do you feel about that?
I turned to my husband and said, 'No you don't get to do this,' Sloktin said. Bishop has forgotten that his, you know, boss[es] are the people who elected him, and his job description is to better their lives. He's doing the opposite.
Peter Martinez and The Associated Press contributed to this report.
I think politically it's not smart, said New York Republican Rep. Tom Reed. But more substantively, we should be finding areas where we can fix healthcare, and not continue this division of [repealing] Obamacare with no hardcore proposal as to what we're going to do about the millions of folks that are potentially adversely impacted.
He slammed conservatives for their reaction to the Islamic State, arguing that over-the-top claims that this is World War III just play into their hands.
Dr. Travis Gayles is the chief public health officer for Montgomery County, Maryland, the most populous in the state and one of the most diverse, right next door to Washington D.C.
We're talking about pre-packaging, Morgan said. Normally we would hand someone a clipboard. We are not going to do that this cycle because we don't want to exchange things back and forth.
If Republicans keep control of Congress, legislation mirroring some of these initiatives could become a reality. More immediately, the administration can continue implementing agency rule changes and executive orders that can also affect health care policy.
The Supreme Court will weigh in on contraceptive coverage under the nation's health care law this term, agreeing to hear a case involving the Obamacare rule requiring large companies to help pay for their employees' birth control. The high court will review whether the Trump administration was on solid ground when it gave religious employers and universities broader religious and moral exemptions to the Obamacare contraception mandate, which requires health care plans to offer free birth control.
Q: What about Republicans taxing employer-provided coverage?
JAMELLE BOUIE: Right, right. I-- I can't imagine the-- the kinds of people who run for president, right, are not the kinds of people who are going to save themselves. Well, I guess for the good of the party and-- and, you know, the-- someone else's political prospects I'm going to drop out to make sure that this candidate I don't think can win-- can win. I-- I think it's worth saying in that regards that the analogy the Trump falls apart when it comes to Trump's favorability within the Republican Party at this stage of the race, Sanders at the last poll I saw seventy-six percent of Democrats have a favorable view of Sanders, that's higher than any other candidate in the race. And for all the talk of reconstituting the Obama coalition has just kind of been the drumbeat among Democrats--
ED O'KEEFE (CBS News Political Correspondent/@edokeefe): He needs to win South Carolina, bottom line. He will spend the whole week in the Palmetto State trying to make the argument that he is best positioned to defeat President Trump that he can build the multiracial, multigenerational coalition to do it. But the numbers here in Nevada prove he is going to struggle with that. He had an interesting line last night that we're going to hear, a lot more of aides tell me. He said, I'm not a socialist, I'm not a plutocrat, I am a Democrat. Trying to make the argument that he best represents what the party wants to do in defeating President Trump.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Sixty percent of them children and-- and their parents. How do you respond to this idea that credit is not being given to a-- a real crisis at the border?
President Donald Trump: Just be fair.
Lesley Stahl: You are-- very powerful, and the people who love you, love you with passion. And if you go after somebody the way you've been going after her, they take it to heart--
In the end, Roberts sided with the liberals, a decision some court observers have attributed in part to concern about public perceptions of the court and the chief justice's desire to be seen as above the political fray.
But more to the point, he argued, voters don't care either way. This is going to be an election that's based on competence. Because people are tired of these nice people and they're tired of being ripped off by everybody in the world, he explained. Sadly, the American dream is dead. But If I get elected President, I will bring it back bigger, better, and stronger than ever before, and we will make America great again. Thank you.
MILLER: We could do so much more--
That I don't know. I was not present for his physical, Conway said.
Still, opposition groups have slammed Puzder for violations of labor law, citing class-action lawsuits against CKE for allegedly underpaying or denying overtime pay for workers that cost his company millions of dollars to settle. CKE has replied that it adheres to the law.
LANNY DAVIS: Well, he-- guess he did need to be tell-- told that because he ended up lying and he regretted it. And he's going to jail for it. And he said to the court in his heartfelt way, I take ownership and I don't blame anybody but myself, and apologized for that.
The average full cost of attendance is now $15,000 a year for community colleges and $23,000 for four-year institutions, according to the U.S. Department of Education. Two-year students typically borrow much less, though, roughly $4,000.
Lesley Stahl: How can you claim--
TRUMP: Well, you're right about Islamophobia, and that's a shame. But one thing we have to do is we have to make sure that — because there is a problem. I mean, whether we like it or not, and we could be very politically correct, but whether we like it or not, there is a problem. And we have to be sure that Muslims come in and report when they see something going on. When they see hatred going on, they have to report it.
Lesley Stahl: If he does something that you think crossed a line, will you tell him?
BIDEN: The White House is shedding light. The President is angry because the intelligence community, in fact, informed Bernie Sanders and I guess others and members of the Intelligence Committee that, in fact, the Russians want to see Trump reelected. And they like Bernie.
Asked about the report at the hearing, HHS Secretary Sylvia M. Burwell defended her department. With regard to the issue of making sure the right people are getting any taxpayer subsidy, we take it very seriously, she said.
Let's talk about what I think might be a sensitive area, but let's talk about it, Rather said to Trump. You have-- you describe yourself -- a beautiful relationship at the moment with a beautiful woman. Plus or minus to have a beautiful woman at your side?
Gillum, who is seeking to become the state's first black governor, brought up DeSantis' comments the day after the primary -- when he said that Florida voters shouldn't monkey this up by supporting Gillum. And Gillum added that DeSantis had been endorsed by President Donald Trump.
Clinton and [Tim] Kaine really needed a third person on that ticket to really get out individuals who weren't that excited by them as a team, and I think Joe Biden kind of has the same issue going forward, Melissa Murray, law professor at New York University and host of the Supreme Court-focused podcast Strict Scrutiny, told CBS News. Imagine how much more energizing it would be to also pick someone [for SCOTUS] who would excite parts of the Democratic base.
The main issue in Tuesday's hearing was whether Congress rendered the entire Affordable Care Act unconstitutional when it zeroed out the tax imposed on people who don't buy health insurance.
Democrats want moderate and swing voters to know that, if they do happen to win control of the House of Representatives, nobody is talking about impeaching President Trump….except everybody.
President Donald Trump: I don't encourage them. They say it.
For example, for the 2014 coverage year Social Security could not verify citizenship for about 8.2 million inquiries in which the applicants claimed they were citizens, the report said. (For 2015, that number was down by more than half, to 3.6 million.)
Just a reminder, Democrats: Despite his tremendous political talents, Bill Clinton was never able to win 50 percent of the popular vote.
In 2012, nine in 10 congressmen seeking re-election did so successfully. In the 2014 election so far, there are just about 40 truly competitive House seats, according to Sabato's Crystal Ball, the elections analysis site run by University of Virginia political scientist Larry Sabato. That means the vast majority of lawmakers will face more political competition during the primary process than the next general election.
Apple has just announced it plans to invest a total of $350 billion in America, and hire another 20,000 workers.
Ryan and McConnell said their goal for the rest of the year is develop an agenda that could be used under the next president, if it's a Republican.
PAUL RYAN: So we should open the government back up and resume negotiations, which were going on in earnest in good faith before they blew things up and shut down the government.
TRUMP: Well, I think I should respond, because — so ridiculous. Look, now she's blaming — she got caught in a total lie. Her papers went out to all her friends at the banks, Goldman Sachs and everybody else, and she said things — WikiLeaks that just came out. And she lied. Now she's blaming the lie on the late, great Abraham Lincoln. That's one that I haven't...
KELSEY SNELL (NPR/@kelsey_snell): I am not cancelling them just yet.
But yet, we know that talks are good, but I just don't see this president- when you look at what happened in Iran when he got out of that agreement and we were 10 minutes away from war and a month away from them blowing the caps when it comes to uranium- enriching uranium. When you look what he did with the nuclear agreement with Russia, he is constantly- climate change pulling us back from working with our allies to try to solve these problems.
The president's announcement of his intent to nominate Barrett to the Supreme Court officially kicked off what is likely to be a swift and highly contentious confirmation process, as Mr. Trump has urged the Senate to confirm Barrett before the November presidential election. Among Democrats' issues with Barrett are her views on Roe v. Wade, the 1973 Supreme Court decision that established a woman's right to an abortion, and the Affordable Care Act, which is being challenged in a case that will be heard by the justices on November 10.
I did say that, McCain told Colbert. And I mean it.
Donald Trump: And when you say lobbyists, lobbyists and special interests.
Even though the Trump rules remain blocked, a ruling by a federal judge in Texas in June already allows most employers who object to covering contraception to avoid doing so.
We are all wondering where the heck is everybody, said George Kalogeropoulos, CEO of Health Sherpa.
John McCain: They said that it's very serious. That the prognosis is very, very serious. Some say three percent, some say 14 percent. You know, it's a very poor prognosis. So I just said, I understand. Now we're gonna do what we can, get the best doctors we can find and do the best we can. And, at the same time, celebrate with gratitude a life well lived.
The woman -- a 39-year-old mother named Cara Jennings, according to local news station WFTS -- appeared to be working on a laptop at the Starbucks before Scott entered.
7:37 p.m. ET Correct the Record, a super PAC backing Hillary Clinton, obtained and leaked drafts of Donald Trump's speech Thursday night, a few hours before the GOP presidential nominee was set to deliver his first address to Republican voters since formally receiving the nomination Tuesday night, Politico reports.
While we cannot imagine the depths of that kind of sorrow, we can make sure that other families never have to endure this kind of pain.

After Harvard Business, she went to work for George W. Bush's 2000 presidential campaign, based out of the Austin, Texas office where she would eventually meet her future husband.
Laid-off workers should be able to get their children covered even if the adults in the family cannot help. The federal-state Children's Health Insurance Program and Medicaid cover kids in families with incomes well above the poverty level. Medicaid is open year round if you are a parent with kids who need coverage, said Joan Alker, director of the Center for Children and Families at Georgetown University. Children's coverage predates the ACA.
Price has also been a strong advocate, like his fellow Republicans, of repealing Obamacare. Price favors expanding health savings accounts and providing tax credits for purchasing health coverage.
The vice president specifically cited Roberts' vote in a dispute over a Louisiana law that required abortion providers to have admitting privileges at a nearby hospital, in which he joined the court's four liberal justices in striking down the law. Robert also joined the liberal majority in denying a request from a Nevada church to block enforcement of the state's 50-person limit at places of worship due to the coronavirus.
The throughline? Even after a recovery for the record books, the fallout of the Great Recession has left Americans questioning their economic security and government's place in their lives. President Obama's signature achievement: the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, provided health care to millions. But it also gave rise to the Tea Party. A conservative backlash to Mr. Obama took down the first female House Speaker, Nancy Pelosi.
Here's what's happening in Kentucky and Mississippi ahead of Tuesday's elections.
Mike Bloomberg: Nobody's-- virtually nobody's mentioned it and I think in this day and age, yes. We've moved on. It's a better world than it was back then.
Meanwhile, Lieutenant Governor Tate Reeves, the GOP nominee, has had his work cut out for him.
But — and I say that about a lot of things. You know, I've heard Hillary complaining about so many different things over the years. I wish you would have done this. But she's been there for 30 years she's been doing this stuff. She never changed. And she never will change. She never will change.
Patsy Crawford and Erica Rowland live in Wood County, Ohio, and both once voted for Barack Obama. But in 2016, they swung right for then-candidate Trump, just like their county itself.
That spirit is how I was raised, Slotkin said, and it's that spirit that I believe is completely gone from our domestic political conversation to the detriment of our country.
Unlike his fellow Democratic Senate colleagues running for re-election this fall, Donnelly's campaign ads include complimentary footage of President Trump. In the ad Fighting Chance, Donnelly's campaign includes a photograph of Donnelly and Trump shaking hands and video footage of Trump congratulating Donnelly for his work on the legislation saying, Senator Donnelly, thank you very much. Donnelly was the primary co-sponsor on the legislation, which allows terminally-ill patients to try experimental medical treatments that are not fully approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
McCain replied: Actually, I hope this program is blacked out in Arizona, please cut. Look, I respect Secretary, Senator Clinton. I respect her views. We have had disagreements on a number of issues but I think it's my job to work with every president, if she is regrettably, if she attains the presidency.
MARGARET BRENNAN: So, you-- why couldn't you move them to the front of 1b ahead of other essential workers with the supply you have now?
The Biden campaign insisted that sharing the stage with Warren for the first time is irrelevant.
Absent an extreme Christmas rally, most portfolios are going to show somewhat negative performance in 2018, said UBS analyst Michael Crook, in a report.
CLINTON: I will be the president and we will get it done. That's exactly right.
In response to the freeze by Philadelphia officials, Catholic Social Services and a group of foster parents filed a lawsuit against the city in May 2018, arguing it was targeted by city officials and the decision to stop foster care referrals was unconstitutional.
The White House kicked off a national Get Covered Day of Action on Tuesday. It's encouraging Americans to take to social media to spread the word about getting covered throughout the day, using the hashtag #GetCovered.
The procedural vote — which starts the clock for 30 hours of debate on her confirmation — split 51-48, with GOP Senators Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine joining Democrats in voting against limiting debate. Murkowski, however, said Saturday she will vote to confirm Barrett to the high court. A simple majority, 51 votes, was needed for the procedural motion to pass. Senator Kamala Harris of California, the Democratic vice presidential nominee, did not vote.
We proved that we could accomplish something this big, he said. I can't thank the president enough. President Trump and Vice President Pence have been directly engaged, adding that Pence called him twice on Thursday to check in about individual members.
CLINTON: I've proven that I can, and for 30 years, I've produced results for people.
Charles Krauthammer AP Conservative political columnist Charles Krauthammer (March 13, 1950-June 21, 2018) faced many battles throughout his life. A diving accident while in medical school at Harvard left him paralyzed. But he still managed to graduate on time and at the top of his class. He later gave up psychiatry and his studies of bipolar disorder, and followed his love of politics to Washington. His allegiance switched from Democrats to Republicans in the 1980s, when he became a Pulitzer Prize-winning commentator for the Washington Post. An unorthodox conservative, Krauthammer was a leading advocate for the Iraq War who approved of using torture to interrogate terrorism detainees, but he was also a passionate animal rights advocate. He also didn't shy away from challenging fellow conservatives. I think denial is what you do for yourself as a way to get through life; I'm not sure it's the way a party ought to get through politics, he said on CBS This Morning in 2013. And he was not adverse to expressing his criticism of President Trump, w
SUSAN PAGE: And the President notes correctly that he has gotten several people who had been held in North Korea and elsewhere, and-- and got them returned to the United States, and that's-- and that's a fair point. Although the bizarre element of that moment I thought was not the prayer, because, understandably, the pastor would say a prayer of gratitude of being back, but the President then asking him, let me ask you, did you vote for me in 2016 when, of course, he was in prison in Turkey.
The Trump campaign fundraised $26 million around Thursday night's debate, marking President Trump's single largest day of online fundraising this election cycle. That GOP uptick could not come fast enough. Team Biden entered October with nearly three times as much cash on hand as the president's re-election bid, leaving Trump campaign officials to make difficult choices on ad buy placements in battleground states. Trump campaign manager Bill Stepien told reporters Friday, he is hopeful field operations in places like Minnesota, Ohio and Florida will offset the Biden campaign's nationwide ad blitz. Joe Biden's been running a lot of TV ads. He's got nothing on the ground, Stepien said. The campaign manager also noted, We track the absentee and early vote numbers in every state. We know exactly where we stand pertaining to ballots out and ballots in. CBS News campaign reporter Nicole Sganga says Mr. Trump heads to Florida Friday for back-to-back rallies. As polls show the president hemorrhaging support among seniors in the Sunshine State, Mr. Trump made his pitch to the country's largest retirement community - the Villages. CBS News campaign reporter LaCrai Mitchell reports that the president's visit Friday marks his 14th to the state this year and his 4th visit to the Sunshine State within the past four weeks. This is also the Trump campaign's second stop to The Villages within two weeks.
But after Tuesday, for all Americans, there's only one description that counts: president-elect.
I think the metric should be care, Price said.
We will continue our fight until ISIS is defeated, Mr. Trump said after touting recent victories in the war with the terror group.
We're cutting Common Core. We're getting rid of Common Core. We're bringing education locally, Mr. Trump said at a Detroit debate in March 2016.
On Tuesday night, during a call with supporters, as results trickling in showed Garcia leading Democrat Christy Smith by more than 10 percentage points, Garcia said he won't give a victory speech tonight. By Wednesday morning he had seen enough and declared that his message had prevailed.
Washington - An annual congressional report says the U.S. budget deficit is likely to top the symbolic $1 trillion barrier this year despite solid economic growth.
There's new information about the controversial sentence 18-year-old David Becker got for sexually assaulting two young women at a house party in Massachusetts. The prosecution recommended Becker serve two years in jail, but he only got probation -- possibly thanks to the words of one of his victims.
New video is raising questions about events leading up to the apparent road rage killing of former New Orleans Saints player Will Smith. Was it a simple hit and run that sparked the deadly shooting of the NFL star and left his wife wounded, or was there more to it?
Molenbeek and Schaerbeek: A tale of two tragedies
Sanders pointed out that Mr. Trump claimed repeatedly he wouldn't cut Medicare during his presidential campaign, but the HHS nominee has been in favor of making deep cuts to the policy.
Tiffany Trump: I mean I don't think we can really prepare for our father becoming president. But we were all there together with everyone that's worked so hard. And my dad has worked so hard. And it's just – it's really awe-inspiring.
The Trump campaign issued a statement Tuesday night celebrating Reeves' win. President Trump's rally and endorsement in Mississippi undoubtedly had an impact and helped Governor-elect Tate Reeves nail down his victory, the statement said. Governor Reeves will be a tremendous conservative leader for Mississippians in fighting for freedom and keeping taxes low.
I think as long as politicians open their mouths, I'll have a job, Kessler said.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, you're hearing from Republicans, though, and you also heard some description from Senator Barrasso is that this isn't a whole scale shutdown, sort of this is shutdown light. It's not that big of a deal, is it, Margaret?
Lesley Stahl: You want to lock her up?
Washington — Judge Amy Coney Barrett officially became Justice Amy Coney Barrett on Tuesday morning, with Chief Justice John Roberts administering the second of two oaths Supreme Court justices are required to take before beginning her work on the high court.
I am glad he is trying to be transparent – since being on the inside, I've learned that this audit is a serious matter. I also know as a pollster that tax liability is important. We appreciate seeing both plans and who will give people relief, she said.
Most of Planned Parenthood's federal funding comes from Medicaid reimbursements. Medicaid is the health insurance program for low-income individuals and families.
In Rose Garden remarks at the White House Friday, Mr. Trump called his plan to bring soaring drug prices back down to Earth the most sweeping action in history to lower the price of prescription drugs for the American people. But it does not include his campaign pledge to use the massive buying power of the government's Medicare program to directly negotiate lower prices for seniors. That idea has long been supported by Democrats but is a non-starter for drugmakers and most Republicans in Congress. Democratic Rep. Lloyd Doggett of Texas dismissed Mr. Trump's plan as a sugar-coated nothing pill.
The district is 70 percent white, 13 percent black, and 13 percent Hispanic. The Cook Political Report has described the district as one of the wealthiest, most urban, and best-educated districts that voted Republican last fall. The report also called it an outlier and rather unrepresentative of the larger House playing field.
Between the Ossoff and Handel campaigns and outside groups, at least $40 million has been spent so far on this race. As of May 31, Ossoff had raised $23.6 million for the primary and runoff combined, a whopping $8.3 million for the primary and $15.3 million since. Republicans are loudly criticizing the fact that the vast majority of his campaign donations are from out of state.
Mr. Trump also called on Congress to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. Rubio said he agrees because people on Obamacare are truly uninsured.
A major health care item in the bill will depend on some Republican-led states going along. States mainly in the South have refused to expand their Medicaid programs to low-income adults under the ACA. The legislation offers them a temporary infusion of billions of dollars to reconsider. If those states, including Texas, Florida and Georgia, were to do that, Biden would be closer to his coverage goal.
Haley praised Mr. Obama for speaking eloquently about grand things, but also suggested his speech was far rosier than the record suggests.
He spoke in Toledo about his jobs and economic recovery plan and then will attend a get-out-the-vote event in Cincinnati.
As shown through its campaign ads, the House committee focused on healthcare as its number one issue, followed by specific claims of corruption involving Republican incumbents and challengers. After consistently high 2019 fundraising by Democrat incumbents, the committee began to expand their offensive targets to multiple Republican incumbent-held seats.
COOPER: Secretary Clinton, do you want to respond?
Before husband Ted Cruz announced his candidacy, she was a high-powered investment manager at Goldman Sachs's private wealth management office in Houston.
They need 51 votes to pass the 142-page measure, which means they need at least 50 senators to support it, with Vice President Mike Pence as the tie-breaking vote. Assuming all Democrats vote against the bill, more than three Republican no votes would kill the legislation. Five Senate Republicans have so far publicly said they oppose the current form: Ted Cruz of Texas, Mike Lee of Utah, Rand Paul of Kentucky, Dean Heller of Nevada and Ron Johnson of Wisconsin. Johnson and Heller have suggested it will be challenging to persuade them to vote in favor.
Iowa Republican Senator Joni Ernst, who is up for reelection in 2020, told constituents at a town hall in Templeton, Iowa this afternoon, I can't speak for him, when asked about President Trump's efforts to urge foreign countries to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden, report CBS News campaign reporter Adam Brewster and CBS News Political Unit associate producer Ellee Watson.
JONAH GOLDBERG: And it could be a good idea if there was any policy preparation--
The Commonwealth survey and other research consistently shows that people don't try to sign up for insurance because they believe they can't find an affordable plan, Collins explained. But for now at least, the health insurance exchanges are still in place and in most states are relatively stable, she added. While the mandate may have been eliminated, premium subsidies are still available to eligible consumers.
I do believe that for the good of the country, we need to give him a chance to be successful. And if we disagree with him, we'll take on those issues. I thought last night was a very presidential speech. I thought last night was the best speech I've seen him give, and I've been watching him now pretty closely for two years, Rubio said.
The law, she said, has reshaped the individual and small-group insurance markets so the range of choices for consumers is more robust than it has ever been, she said. Meanwhile, self-employed individuals and others who previously had no access to private insurance are finally getting coverage.
Dissecting Obamacare With the passage of the Affordable Care Act, everyone with a stake in the $3-trillion-a-year health industry came out ahead -- except the taxpayers, says author Steven Brill. Lesley Stahl reports.
We also continue on to delivers our promises to workers today will honor our promise to be to the hard working men and women of the labor of labor as we lift the Cadillac tax, protecting health benefits that workers have negotiated, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Thursday.
Lesley Stahl: You know, you surprised everyone by winning the primaries, beating 17 other Republicans or 16, whatever-- people are really surprised that you won this election. Are people going to be surprised about how you conduct yourself as president?
Obama administration officials said they usually see younger consumers signing up in the last weeks before enrollment shuts down, according to The Wall Street Journal. And when officials add in those under 18, the share of enrollees under 34 jumps to 35 percent.
Melania Trump: I think he hears me. But he will do what he wants to do on the end. He's an adult. He knows the consequences. And I give him my opinion. And he could do whatever he likes with it.
She urged voters to rise to the occasion and help her thwart the president's reelection bid and become America's first female president.
COOPER: Time is up. We have time for one more...
Mr. Trump won the state by 17 points in 2016. During his Tupelo rally, he said he was surprised to be in Mississippi fighting for a Republican to win a gubernatorial race.
Vice President Mike Pence: The scientists who've worked around the White House Coronavirus Task Force, who will meet again today here at the White House have provided a great public service. They've--

The first full day of government shutdown ended in another stalemate as Democrats rejected an attempt by House Republicans to restore funding to delayed veterans benefits and closed national parks and memorials, and to give the District of Columbia the authority to use local revenue to continue operations.
On Inauguration Day, Mr. Trump outlined his America First philosophy: We do not seek to impose our way of life on anyone.
The Dow and Nasdaq each fell more than 2 percent on the day and are both in the red in 2018. The Russell 2000 index of small-cap stocks is down 20 percent since it finished at its last record high at the end of August. Wall Street calls a 20 percent decline a bear market, and it's considered a major downturn.
Asked if the president intentionally misled the public about the seriousness of the virus, White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said, Absolutely not. On Wednesday, McEnany insisted the president has always been clear-eyed with the American people.
Last month, a federal judge heard arguments from 18 state attorneys general and two governors in a lawsuit designed to strike down the Affordable Care Act. The AGs argue that with the individual mandate fine having been eliminated as a result of the 2017 tax law, that mandate is unconstitutional and the entire law should be eliminated.
The choices are pretty stark. If we don't have universal coverage or an individual mandate, we need to be ready to allow hospitals, doctors, and health care providers to turn away uninsured patients. Otherwise, they won't receive the revenues they need to keep their doors open. As a society, we would need to accept that the uninsured won't be treated.
If you look at Bill Clinton, far worse. Mine are words, and his was action. His was what he's done to women. There's never been anybody in the history politics in this nation that's been so abusive to women. So you can say any way you want to say it, but Bill Clinton was abusive to women.

MARGARET BRENNAN: What happens to teachers if they don't show up tomorrow?
RADDATZ: Mr. Trump, Mr. Trump — I want to get to audience questions and online questions.
As things get underway, check out CBS News' fact-checking live blogs from the past two debates: one from the first presidential debate at Hofstra University in September, and one from the vice-presidential debate at Longwood University last week.
To keep up HealthCare.gov's construction and maintenance and continue consumer outreach, among other things, the administration is requesting about $600 million in new funding for 2015. The administration expects the continued Obamacare rollout will cost about $1.8 billion but that $1.2 billion will come from Obamacare taxes and fees.
Lesley Stahl: Was he that tough?
Jason Kelly: By changing the DNA of the bacteria. Yeah.
MARGARET BRENNAN: --talking about the intent of these migrants and-and trying to stop that, which really gets you more to the diplomatic issues of why people are fleeing in the first place, not the border wall itself but--
And Cruz has not explained how carpet bombing a terrorism group that is mingled with citizens in areas they control can be done without substantial deaths of innocents.
Larry Levitt, executive vice president of Kaiser Family Foundation, said the president's vision is something of a mirage.
Mr. Trump hasn't given up on repealing and replacing Obamacare. The budget supports eliminating ACA premium subsidy payments and Medicaid expansion, and distributing that money to the states in block grants they can use to run their own health care programs. Block grants were the backbone of the plan Republican Sens. Lindsey Graham (South Carolina) and Bill Cassidy (Louisiana) introduced last fall that went nowhere.
The legal battle before the justices was brought by a group of Republican-led states challenging the constitutionality of Obamacare's individual mandate. As part of the GOP's overhaul of the tax code in 2017, Congress abolished the financial penalty for people who do not purchase health insurance, and the GOP states believe the individual mandate — a key pillar of the Obama-era health care law — is now unconstitutional.
GOVERNOR NED LAMONT: Like I said, ninety-five percent of our kids right now are already have the option to go to school either full time or a hybrid --
Jim Hood will tell you that welfare and Washington are the only things we need, Reeves said after winning the Republican nomination.
Along with their heroic Afghan partners, our military is no longer undermined by artificial timelines, and we no longer tell our enemies our plans.
In his campaign announcement video, the Democrat claimed that Washington is broken, listing problems like rising prescription drug prices, the effects of climate change and crippling student debt. What Trump says Messam has not yet been a target for President Trump.
KELSEY SNELL (NPR/@kelsey_snell): There are some Democrats in particular who think there are options in front of them. But I have not heard anybody articulate what exactly that is. I think that they're-- as I talked to Democrats and Republicans, they're also worried that this could exacerbate problems with the USMCA, the trade agreement that they're trying to finalize that's already in serious trouble in Congress right now. They are worried that they're not going to be able to get the kind of support they need if the President is starting another fight with Mexico. And, you know, there are plenty of people on both sides of the-- of the aisle who would really like to get some sort of trade stability happening with both Mexico and Canada.
You know, ignorance is bliss! Haley laughed. All I knew was, there were too many lawyers at the statehouse, and they needed an accountant. And I needed to figure out how to get there.
When the law was proposed, friends and foes of Obamacare agreed that the tax was essential to persuade healthy people to get insured, thereby keeping premiums in check. But this year — the first time no fines will be collected — the number of people signing up for subsidized private insurance through the Affordable Care Act slipped only slightly.
PAUL RYAN: My point is this is ridiculous.
MARGARET BRENNAN: What does do well mean for you?
Puzder also has drawn brickbats for airing racy TV ads featuring scantily clad models munching hamburgers, which Democrats castigated as showing no respect for women. Puzder's response: I like beautiful women eating burgers in bikinis.
Lawyers for Sanders and Yang presented arguments in Manhattan Monday. If all but one of the presidential candidates are removed from the ballot and the primary is not held, Delegate Plaintiffs will be deprived of the opportunity to compete for delegate slots and shape the course of events at the Convention, and voters will lose the chance to express their support for delegates who share their views, Judge Torres wrote in her ruling, adding, The loss of these First Amendment rights is a heavy hardship.
SENATOR MARCO RUBIO: My view is that's what-- my view is that-- that's what a lot of scientists say. I think there are others that dispute what percentage of that is humans and not. I'm a policymaker. There's no way that I can ever debate with a scientist or people who spend their whole life on that.
He offered no details, however, on what he would specifically support.
President Trump is doing everything he can to try to control the news cycles he has dominated since he stepped into the political spotlight, floating half-baked trial balloons like ending birthright citizenship, claiming he'll advance a middle class tax cut, and sending thousands of troops to the border to whip up his base, which is already terrified by his false characterizations of a caravan of asylum seekers who won't be reaching the U.S. border for weeks.
The fate of former President Obama's signature health care law, and its coverage and insurance protections for millions of Americans, was again being argued before a panel of judges — this time a federal appeals court in New Orleans.
That sound likes somebody who's not trying to run as a Democrat, McSally said. So, look, her party is going so far left and are so far out of the mainstream of Arizona values. But the bottom line is, she's a Democrat.
Franken expressed skepticism at this, and went on to slam Price for the more than 300,000 dollars in health-care related stocks he held while at the same time sponsoring legislation that could have impacted those stocks.
In 1983 as his career was beginning to cool (a screenplay he'd written for The Right Stuff was rejected), he wrote a memoir of his years in Hollywood, Adventures in the Screen Trade, an invaluable treatise on the business and art of filmmaking. Other non-fiction books included Wait Till Next Year, a collection of sports writing; and Hype and Glory, about his experience judging the Cannes Film Festival. Goldman always wanted to write, but his early aspiration was to be a sports writer, and he did not seem to take the results of his Hollywood labors too seriously. In William Goldman: The Reluctant Storyteller, he rejected analysis of his work. I'm just trying to tell a story, he said. I wrote a movie called 'Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid' and I wrote a novel called The Princess Bride,' and those are the only two things I've ever written, not that I'm proud of, but that I can look at without humiliation.
Her son Johnny was born prematurely, and spent two months in the neonatal intensive care unit at Las Vegas Sunrise Hospital. His twin sister, Rose, died at just 4 days old. Bagley said she waited three hours in line to vote, despite juggling the hospital and work.
Vice President Mike Pence: And he's always ready. And the American people know that-- in this time, it's, it's-- it's less about the back and forth with the media, and it's-- it's really more about how we bring this country all the way back.
Voters are very upset with the actions Republicans took trying to repeal Obama's law, said Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., who heads Senate Democrats' campaign committee. This is an issue that we're seeing at the top of voters' minds, and this is across all states.
Bloomberg is pressing his case after a late start and poor showing in his first debate last month. This past Wednesday, after a better, second debate, he slept three hours before heading to his Times Square headquarters to phone voters. He's opened more than 200 offices with 2,400 staff.

CEDRIC RICHMOND: Look, I think you see us doing everything humanly possible to make sure we ramp up vaccinations. We're delivering another million six to the states every week. So we bumped up to order. We just purchased another two hundred million vaccinations so that we can vaccinate the whole three hundred million adults that we need to do. And so we're going to keep pushing. We're going to keep sending vaccines to the states and asking the states to hurry up and make sure that they get them all out. But our plan and why we need to pass the American Rescue Plan is to make sure that we give the school systems the ability to buy the masks, the ventilation systems, all of those things that's needed to open up.
I know that the senator says she's for Bernie, well, I'm for Barack, Biden said during the third Democratic debate, referring to Warren and Sanders' shared stance on Medicare for All. I think the Obamacare worked. I think the way — we add to it, replace everything that's been cut, add a public option, guarantee that everyone will be able to have affordable insurance.
SUSAN GLASSER: And, again, your supporters, you know, the thing is, is not that, you know, human rights has become another tool in the partisan arsenal, I think is-- is the big transition there. That's a great example of it.
How about China as a currency manipulator?
The legislation to undo Obama's signature law faces an uncertain future in both chambers - thanks largely to members of the president's own party, including some who see it as not enough of a repeal.

ANTHONY SALVANTO: Well, debates matter and voters in this poll have told us that debates matter. One example right there is Elizabeth Warren who's still doing okay nationally. People told us that they thought her debate performance last time was most impressive. And that could be helping bolster her at least national support, and you also look at by comparison Joe Biden's debate ranking was lower than that. So there's a lot of pressure on these candidates heading into that Tuesday debate.
Well, my understanding is, just looking at the documents, the way I interpret them, is there was a disagreement. And that one of the agents, one of the senior agents felt that Let's not be game playing here. We have the transcript. Show him the transcripts and find out what you wanna find out.
Host Andrea Mitchell then asked again if it was the same doctor who wrote the very brief letter that was four or five paragraphs.
I view us as nonpartisan, Cutts said. And our mission is pretty simple: try to do the most good for the most people who need it the most — and we're bringing technology to bear to help that happen.
The Muslim ban is something that in some form has morphed into a extreme vetting from certain areas of the world. Hillary Clinton wants to allow hundreds of thousands — excuse me. Excuse me..
With about 71% of the results released by the Iowa Democratic Party, Pete Buttigieg just ahead of Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren also leading Biden. While in New Hampshire, where next week's first-in-the-nation primary will be held, Biden also went after the top two candidates by name in his remarks, a tactic he has rarely used on the campaign trail.
MARGARET BRENNAN: But is she going to get in?
Patrick will make his second two-day swing to South Carolina since launching his presidential bid this week. As previously reported by Mitchell and CBS News campaign reporter Nicole Sganga, Patrick is expected to make a play for moderate voters in the first two early primary states. This visit comes on the heels of the hiring of Columbia, South Carolina-based political operative LaJoia Broughton to run the campaign's operation in the state. Broughton was a South Carolina lobbyist for JUUL Labs before she signed on with Patrick.
Over the last year, the world has seen what we always knew: that no people on Earth are so fearless, or daring, or determined as Americans. If there is a mountain, we climb it. If there is a frontier, we cross it. If there's a challenge, we tame it. If there's an opportunity, we seize it.
Twenty-two million more people would be without health insurance over the next decade under Senate Republicans' plan to repeal and replace Obamacare, according to an analysis released Monday by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.
The back and forth between Trump and Newsom comes after the Republican National Committee along with the National Republican Congressional Committee and the California Republican Party, filed suit Sunday night to reverse Newsom's order to automatically send every registered voter a ballot ahead of the November presidential election. Republicans are claiming Newsom's recent executive order to mail every registered voter in the state a ballot is an illegal power grab that redesigns the election system. One point of argument for Republicans has been mailing ballots to inactive voters because they say it leads to fraud. Ballots are mailed to all registered voters. There is a category of inactive voters that I think is the focus of their attention that don't receive these ballots, California's Secretary of State Alex Padilla said in an MSNBC interview on Tuesday. Now, Republicans are claiming this is a reversal of Newsom's executive order and that Padilla has promised the State would not send ballots to inactive voters. Republicans are also calling on Democrats in the state to clean up their active voter rolls, as five percent of voters in Imperial, Fresno, and LA counties have moved or passed away. Read more here about the lawsuit and Newsom's executive order that earlier this month made California the first state in the nation to mail voters a ballot ahead of the presidential election as a response to the coronavirus pandemic.
Past experience has taught us that complacency and concessions only invite aggression and provocation. I will not repeat the mistakes of past administrations that got us into this very dangerous position.

MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about the debates this week. One question to many of your colleagues and competitors was whether their health care plan would cover undocumented immigrants. Would your plan do that?
With its funds, the group is looking to help boost both incumbents and candidates. On Tuesday it endorsed one House Democrat challenger, 11 House Democrat incumbent Frontliners and two Senate candidates: Barbara Bollier in Kansas and Theresa Greenfield in Iowa.
At the same time, that does not mean we just flat out open our borders. We can't do that. 
As he prepares to give his first State of the Union address, thirty-seven percent of Americans approve of the job Mr. Trump is doing as president. He has lower ratings at the one-year mark than past presidents -- 58 percent now disapprove.
But top health care officials in the Trump administration testifying before Congress on Wednesday said they are not aware of a health care plan to replace the Affordable Care Act from the White House. At a Senate Appropriations subcommittee on the federal response to the coronavirus crisis, Admiral Brett Giroir told senators, I don't know what that is. I supply public health advice as much as I can for whatever that plan would be. Dr. Robert Redfield, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, concurred that he is not aware of any such plan. In 2017, Mr. Trump and congressional Republicans tried and failed to repeal Obamacare and pass their own health care plan.
JOHN DICKERSON: So, we have about thirty seconds. What can I do, I'm at home watching this, what can I do to just break out of this cycle?
RGA spokesperson Amelia Chassé Alcivar said Reeves has run a great campaign centered on the issues voters care about, and we feel strongly that he is going to be the next Governor of Mississippi.
That's why Ryan said he and House Republicans are focused on offering their own conservative agenda early so that people spend all summer and fall talking about it ahead of November's general election. Some of that agenda could include tax reform, regulatory relief, an Obamacare replacement and foreign policy ideas.
Just 11 days after his surgery, he returned to Washington – against doctors' advice – for the vote to repeal Obamacare.
I think it's an opportunity to have the stage winnow down a little bit, Buttigieg said recently when asked about the pressure to stand out. But he also emphasized it will still be a crowded stage with all 10 candidates at the podium. Look I've advanced past the first 20 or so candidates I needed to overtake. Now we've got some bigger hills to climb. That's what the next six months or so are for, he added.
And on what he called a big day for Seniors, the president announced Tuesday a breakthrough agreement slashing out of pocket insulin costs for Medicare recipients. The new benefit — available through Medicare Part D prescription drug plans and Medicare Advantage plans — caps the price of various types of insulin to $35/month. The list price of insulin has nearly tripled since 2002, according to a 2019 report from a working group at the American Diabetes Association (ADA.) Nobody has seen anything like this for a long time, the president said during a White House briefing in the Rose Garden, politicizing his administration's new policy. Sleepy Joe can't do this. That I can tell you. In fact, it was his problem with Obamacare that caused part of your problem. The President later added of the Obama administration, I hope the seniors are going to remember it because Biden is the one that put us into the jam. Cause they didn't know what they were doing. They were incompetent. A series of recent surveys find the president is lagging behind presumptive Democratic nominee Biden among seniors.
Eric Swalwell Biography Although he was born in Iowa in 1980, Swalwell moved with his family to attend middle school and high school in California. He was recruited to play soccer for North Carolina's Campbell University. After suffering an injury, however, he transferred to the University of Maryland. After completing his undergraduate studies, Swalwell earned his J.D. from the University of Maryland and was a congressional intern for former California Rep. Ellen Tauscher. In 2012, while a council member in Dublin City, in California's Alameda County, Swalwell mounted a primary challenge against fellow Democrat and 20-term incumbent Pete Stark in the state's 15th Congressional District, located in the outer suburbs of San Francisco. Although Stark bested him in the primary election, Swalwell beat the incumbent in the general election, which he qualified for because of California's top two primary system. Swalwell says he's running for president 01:40 Since he was sworn-in in 2013, Swalwell has won reelection three times. Although he has been a rank-and-file member of the House Democratic caucus during his congressional tenure, he has raised his profile during the Trump administration as a member of the Intelligence and Judiciary Committees, frequently rebuking the president in cable news appearances.
Considered the Republican front-runner for most of the race, Reeves had raised more than any candidate and won an early endorsement from the current two-term governor, Phil Bryant, who could not run again because of the state's term limits. Several crucial counties swung Waller's way, though, including Rankin county, home to Reeves and the largest amount of Republican voters in the state.
A threat to preexisting condition coverage -- and more
Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose announced that as of September 4, Ohio's county boards of elections have received 1,000,579 absentee ballot applications. CBS News campaign reporter Jack Turman reports the announcement comes 55 days before Election Day.
GAYLE KING: A hearing? You would be prepared to testify in front of the-- the Virginia general assembly.
And, yes, when I was a senator, I did vote to close corporate loopholes. I voted to close, I think, one of the loopholes he took advantage of when he claimed a billion-dollar loss that enabled him to avoid paying taxes.
Lesley Stahl: And went immediately into surgery?
On Saturday, Rep. Chris Collins, indicted for insider trading, announced that he would suspend his re-election campaign in his reliably Republican 27th District in western New York. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi issued this statement Saturday calling Collins' announcement insufficient: Speaker Ryan must call on Congressman Collins to resign. No person is above the law, not the President nor his first supporter in Congress. This insufficient and overdue announcement does little to drain the toxic cesspool of self-enrichment, special interest deals and corruption that has proliferated in Washington under GOP control.
But, Wilson said, the Republican Party continued to tolerate members who subscribed to racist beliefs, leading Trump to, in Wilson's words, play footsie with them by not immediately denouncing former Klan leader David Duke in 2016.
The former secretary of state will affirm her commitment to give Americans in every state the choice of a public-option insurance plan, something she has supported during this campaign and going back to her 2008 presidential campaign, the statement read.
It's shaping up to be the year of virtual reality. Video games, Hollywood and media giants are all embracing the technology and driving VR into the mainstream. But could the technology have lasting effects on our minds?
Since March, job loss has further gutted Americans reliant on their employers for health care. And according to the Federal Reserve, nearly 40% of households with income below $40,000 were laid off or furloughed by April.
He claimed that the Democratic Party is the political party that has divided the country.
WASHINGTON -- When the justices return to the bench next week, it will be the first time -- for all 8 -- they will serve without Justice Scalia. For 30 years, he was the court's most forceful and influential voice.
TED CRUZ: We have seen now in six years of Obamacare that it has been a disaster. It is the biggest job-killer in this country. Millions of Americans have lost their jobs, have been forced into part-time work, have lost their health insurance, have lost their doctors, have seen their premiums skyrocket. 
COOPER: That question begins for Mr. Trump.
The Clinton proposals represent a further shift towards the policies of her Democratic primary rival, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who has yet to declare his support for Clinton's presidential candidacy -- though he has said he would still vote for the former secretary of state come November.
The Supreme Court earned high marks for its live-streamed arguments, and judicial advocacy groups as well as lawmakers on both sides of the aisle urged the high court to make real-time audio a permanent fixture of oral arguments.
One of Staub's employees, Corey Adams, is also with us tonight. Corey is an all-American worker. He supported himself through high school, lost his job during the 2008 recession, and was later hired by Staub, where he trained to become a welder. Like many hardworking Americans, Corey plans to invest his tax‑cut raise into his new home and his two daughters' education. Corey, please stand. And he's a great welder. I was told that by the man that owns that company that's doing so well. So congratulations, Corey.
Last year, on the National Day of Prayer, the president signed a similar religious liberty executive order that would allow the IRS to opt not to enforce the Johnson Amendment, which prohibits nonprofits such as churches and charities from directly or indirectly engaging in a political campaign.
3:23 p.m. ET Sometimes things get awkward. Social media is going crazy over the air kiss Trump attempted to give Pence on stage after the Indiana governor's big speech last night.
JOE BIDEN: No I don't. Look, are you telling me that we should go into China because-- go to war with China because what they are doing to the Uyghurs, a million Uyghurs, in the-- out in the west in concentration camps? Is that what you're saying to me?
All of that said, General Flynn pled guilty to lying to federal investigators during his interview in January of 2017. And Flynn admitted in court, quote, his false statements and omissions impeded and otherwise had a material impact on the FBI's ongoing investigation into the existence of any links or coordination between individuals with the campaign and Russia's efforts to interfere with the 2016 presidential election. Does the fact remain that General Flynn lied to federal investigators?
Donald Trump: Do you know what the salary is?
So today, I'm keeping another promise. I just signed, prior to walking in, an order directing Secretary Mattis, who is doing a great job, thank you -- (applause) -- to reexamine our military detention policy and to keep open the detention facilities in Guantanamo Bay.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Is there wiggle room on that 5 billion?
I just want to lay it on the line, that the country deserves better, the McCain family deserves better, I don't care if he's president of the United States, owns all the real estate in New York, or is building the greatest immigration system in the world, Isakson said about Mr. Trump in an interview with the website The Bulwark on Tuesday evening. Nothing is more important than the integrity of the country and those who fought and risked their lives for all of us.
Later Tuesday, the president himself took to Twitter to thank Galifianakis for his role in pointing people to healthcare.gov.
BIDEN: I told you, I'm not going to play this game with you. I don't know. It's not about who I stop. It's why I'm running, why I'm telling the people that I should be the next president and why I'm the best guy to beat Trump. All those other polls you all cite also show I'm the most person- I'm the- the person most likely to be Trump. I'm the person that, in fact, in- in those polls in addition to that, I'm the only one, in terms of the Russians and all these stuff you've all been reporting. The Russians don't want me to be the nominee. They spent a lot of money on bots on Facebook and they've been taken down saying Biden is a bad guy. They don't want Biden running. They're not- no one's helping me to try to get the nomination. They have good reason.
Mike Bloomberg: We have to spend money to make us safe and protect this country. It's like saying I'm not going to fund the military. I'm not gonna fund the local fire department. We're not gonna have fires. I don't believe-- fires are hoaxes. This is about the level that he's talking.
In a call with reporters Saturday morning, Sanders congratulated Clinton for the proposals and called it a significant step forward in expanding healthcare access for tens of thousands of Americans.
In 1985, he made his first appearance on Face the Nation. By 2008, he had set a record for the most appearances on the broadcast. He did it on the Sunday after winning the Republican presidential nomination, with what may have been be the most unusual strategy in political history.
As Mr. Trump often touts the need to protect the Second Amendment, Kethledge is known for his defense of that amendment. In 2016 in Tyler v. Hillsdale County Sheriff's Department, for instance, Kethledge joined a concurring opinion holding that a federal statute permanently prohibiting a person who had been involuntarily committed nearly three decades before from owning a gun was unconstitutional.
PAUL RYAN: It's a good question because we're so babbled. If we were saying, for instance, We are never going to do a DACA solution. We're going to kick these kids out, then I might understand Democrats getting frustrated. But what-- what's baffling about this, John, is we were in negotiations on how to solve this problem, and then they blew that up and stopped these negotiations. So our-- we have Kevin McCarthy representing House Republicans who was negotiating with Dick Durbin and other leaders. That's what's baffling about this--
Kethledge, a graduate of the University of Michigan Law School, is a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit in Michigan. Like Kavanaugh, 51-year-old Kethledge clerked for Kennedy.
CLINTON: I would not use American ground forces in Syria. I think that would be a very serious mistake. I don't think American troops should be holding territory, which is what they would have to do as an occupying force. I don't think that is a smart strategy.
President Donald Trump: Okay. Are you ready--
With pressure building on both legal and legislative fronts, President Trump paid his respects at Arlington Cemetery on a gloomy Saturday pausing to praise a federal judge's ruling that invalidates the Affordable Care Act.
Then there are the Trump-isms - comments articulated in colorful rhetoric that would sound awkward coming out of any other candidate's mouth. Here's a smattering from a recent rally in Claremont, New Hampshire:
JOHN DICKERSON: Now we know that the news cycle changes, you know, multiple times a day. What is your expectation? Do you have anything in the data that tells us anything about whether that anger stays and sticks and takes people all the way to Election Day? Or, is it an acute momentary thing happening now?
We will work to fix bad trade deals and negotiate new ones. And they'll be good ones, but they'll be fair. And we will protect American workers and American intellectual property through strong enforcement of our trade rules.
MARGARET BRENNAN: You, today, have hit this benchmark, you know, end of first quarter funding financing for the campaign. I believe you said you wanted one million donors by this time. Did you meet--
JOHN DICKERSON: And we'll be right back.
Weaver pointed to the group's opposition to a compromise immigration reform bill as what he said is a particular mistake.
With these new economic policies, trillions of dollars will start flowing into our country. This new wealth will improve the quality of life for all Americans. We will build the roads, highways, bridges, tunnels, airports, and the railways of tomorrow, he will say.
Elizabeth Uihlein. President of Uline, a shipping and packing company, who publicly encouraged her employees to watch Fox News. Like Hendricks, Uihlein was also chosen by Priebus to serve on a Trump fundraising committee.
Lesley Stahl: Now you're not scared, but there are people, Americans, who are scared and some of them are demonstrating right now, demonstrating against you, against your rhetoric--
Employers also would be able to cover some birth control methods, and not others. Some employers have objected to covering modern, long-acting implantable contraceptives, such as IUDs, which are more expensive and considered highly effective in preventing pregnancies.
In Kentucky, Republican Governor Matt Bevin is looking to keep his job amid a strong challenge from Democrat Andy Beshear, the state's attorney general. Meanwhile in Mississippi, Democrat Jim Hood could pull off an upset win against Republican Lieutenant Governor Tate Reeves, the GOP's gubernatorial nominee.
And bashing the media is also a recurring theme. While routinely calling the media dishonest, he makes it a point to claim that the cameras on the risers don't show his crowd sizes. Immediately, crowds will turn around and jeer at the press. In Biloxi, Mississippi, earlier this month - Trump took it a step further and went on a six-minute diatribe against a single cameraman, who was shooting the rally on behalf of the national networks. When the cameraman did not turn his camera to show the crowd, Trump called it disgusting - and then said that he would fire his ass.
Mr. Trump's advisers, such as top economists Larry Kudlow, have tried to explain the president meant he would cut debt-to-GDP, although Mr. Trump also hasn't accomplished that, and that was not his original wording.
Pence warned that this election will shape the direction of the Supreme Court for the next 40 years.
RADDATZ: Thank you, Secretary Clinton. Mr. Trump?
We are all fighting, we are all putting as much energy as possible to getting these progressive reforms passed just to watch the Supreme Court strike them all down, Indivisible's Hatcher-Mays added. It's not worth the grassroots energy if we know that's going to be the outcome.
A renegotiated and renamed North American Free Trade Agreement will need Congressional approval. Also potentially on the legislative agenda are enormous economic issues like another income tax cut, rising drug prices, a substitute for Obamacare, federal spending increases (or cuts) and a ballooning public deficit fueled by the last GOP income tax cut.
The reasons for the increase are varied and still a bit speculative, said Sara Collins, Commonwealth vice president for health care coverage and access. She and her colleagues at Commonwealth point to the Trump administration's drastic cutbacks on advertising and outreach during open enrollment for the Obamacare health care exchanges. Many exchanges saw robust signups despite the cutbacks, but overall the number of people who declined to buy insurance increased.
In December, a federal judge in Texas ruled the law is unconstitutional without the tax. The Trump administration agreed with that ruling, and refused to defend the law -- so multiple states with Democratic attorneys general and the House of Representatives stepped in.
As you take a closer look at your financial footing amid the headwinds of a pandemic, it's an excellent time to examine the possible impact of a Joe Biden presidency on money matters.
California Attorney General Xavier Becerra, one of the defending attorneys general, called the ruling an assault on 133 million Americans with preexisting conditions. His spokesperson said they plan to appeal.
Republicans on Wednesday slammed the administration for the low enrollment figures, juxtaposing them with the millions being dropped from insurance plans that no longer meet Obamacare standards.
Whether the midterms are a #BlueWave or a #TealTrickle, if the Democrats win the House, the result will be an #ImpeachmentTsunami from their Democratic base. With another election just two years later, the last thing newly-elected House Democrats are going to do is #Resist.
SEN. KLOBUCHAR: You always have to talk to everyone when it is American security and the world's security at stake. But he keeps having these summits and meetings that really don't produce anything. There's been a number of them now, and this time, you know, you just can't look at this as going over and talking to your dictator next door and bringing them a hot dish over the fence. There is a lot more. And what this is about, is making sure that there are measurable results, that we have a plan when we go in there and we just haven't seen that. In fact, just in May you saw North Korea launch another missile into the sea in violation of the U.N. resolution and to me, you need to have a plan to denuclearize that peninsula or at least reduce those weapons immediately, and I just don't see that happening, yes.
President Donald Trump: --competitor. They're a foe in many ways, but they're an adversary. I think what happened was disgraceful, should never have happened. Should-- they should never have allowed this plague to get out of China and go throughout the world. 188 countries. Should never have happened.
Albert Bourla: We are on track to provide to the US government a total of 120 million doses by the end of March, and to reach 200 million doses released by the end of May, two months ahead of the original schedule of that milestone.
It was a reality TV show choice, he said. It was a mistake.
America is a nation of builders, Mr. Trump said. We built the Empire State Building in just one year – isn't it a disgrace that it can now take 10 years just to get a minor permit approved for the building of a simple road?
We're getting rid of carried interest provisions. I'm lowering taxes actually, because I think it's so important for corporations, because we have corporations leaving — massive corporations and little ones, little ones can't form. We're getting rid of regulations which goes hand in hand with the lowering of the taxes.
In a motion filed in U.S. district court, federal prosecutors asked the judge to dismiss the single count of making false statements to the FBI, claiming the government concluded that the FBI's interview of Flynn was untethered to, and unjustified by, the FBI's counterintelligence investigation.
I think that is something that Robert Mueller was responsible for looking at under his charter, which is the potential of Russian influence. But I think it was ignored and there was mounting indications that this could very well have been happening and no one really stopped to look at it.
Under President Trump, premiums are dropping and choices are returning, Azar said at a recent health conference.
The lesson many Republicans have taken away from their treatment by the media and prominent Democrats over the past two decades is that they — conservatives, gun owners, Tea Party supporters, Evangelical Christians — are always going to be portrayed as the bad guys. Always.
South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who is also running for president, wrote on Twitter: If you benefit from the #ACA, it is now the official position of the White House to take away your health coverage, with no sign of a plan to help you if they win and you lose.
The S&P 500 lost 54 points to close at 2,546, a 14-month low.
JOHN DICKERSON: Jonah, do you-- where do you think this fits in America First? Because the President in a sense is saying something that maybe previous Presidents wouldn't have said out loud--
No matter where we're from, we're united by the same daily needs -- a good job, a good education for our kids, good health care, an affordable place to live. The need to be acknowledged for our contributions, not for our gender or who we love. We all hope our children have clean air to breathe and clean water to drink. We all hope they can worry about their studies, not their safety, Castro said.
Despite the gallons of media ink and hours of airtime spent pushing the Dems Don't Do Impeachment narrative, this is less a political strategy and more of a forlorn hope. Pelosi and Schumer can try to tamp down the #ImpeachNow rhetoric, but actual Democratic voters are talking about little else.
How will vulnerable incumbent Republicans demonstrate independence from Trump in the general election?
MARGARET BRENNAN: But-- well, that-- that's contradicted by reports that the director of National Intelligence, Maguire, did brief White House officials. But, more broadly, the FBI director at the beginning of the month, Chris Wray, testified that Russia continues to try to influence the elections mainly through social media manipulation. So, this pattern of behavior has continued, Russia is undeterred. Are you denying that that is happening?
At the same time, Bertolini and other insurance industry leaders say the government is not doing enough to help insurers adjust for this added risk. Although Bertolini did say in his statement he is encouraged by the government announcement that it is looking at ways to modify the risk adjustment program.
In Arkansas, cancer survivor Clarke Tucker says he'll stand up to anyone who tries to take your health insurance as he competes for the Democratic nomination for a seat surrounding Little Rock.
JOE BIDEN: I'm going to go all the way through this thing.
Donald Trump: Well, I really felt we were doing well. I was on a string of about 21 straight days of speeches, sometimes many a day and the last two days I really-- I really had a pretty wild time. I did six speeches and then I did seven and--
President Donald Trump impeached – that's a mouthful all by itself, capping ten years of political turbulence, notes CBS News chief Washington correspondent Major Garrett.
Liuba Grechen Shirley is hoping to face off against Republican incumbent Republican Rep. Peter King in New York's 2nd District in the fall. She made headlines earlier this year when the Federal Election Commission approved her request to use federal campaign funds to cover the childcare expenses for her two children while she is on the campaign trail.
SEN. KLOBUCHAR: I don't think we should be doing business with them right now. And I agree with my colleagues not just Senator Rubio, but also Senator Warner, Mark Warner, who is the ranking on the Intelligence Committee, that this is a major security risk for America. You know, you look at everything from China to Russia using cyber against us. It is the modern warfare we certainly know that from our elections in 2016. They may not use tanks or missiles but they can go after our electric grid. They can go after our security in a very different way. And so I don't know why he would just give that away right now. I would think that he would put firm, firm standards in place as part of any agreement with China. And that's not what we have. We just have another promise that they're going to buy American agriculture. Okay, that's positive. But I wouldn't give it up in that short term gain for the long term where we need to protect our security and our cybersecurity.
But people with health problems may not see much relief. And many low-income people may be priced out again.
MARGARET TALEV: Oh, no. He-- oh, he's ready. Although he's still scheduled to leave for Mar-a-Lago at the end of the week, on Friday. But he's ready. But there are many people inside the White House as well as on the Hill, Mitch McConnell, the Senate Republicans who are like, you know, maybe-- and so there have been ongoing conversations between the White House ledge team and-- and those Republican leadership teams in the House for now and-- and in the Senate about how to stave it off under what conditions. But that-- that ultimate conversation that the President wants to have about immigration reform, DACA and wall funding, the place where some kind of a compromise could be possible, is probably not really possible until next year, if at all.
Banning a pharmacist gag rule, which prevents druggists from telling customers when they can save money by paying cash instead of using their insurance.
Speaker Nancy Pelosi: Oh yeah, I would do that.
He said 'yes' to starting a new company to analyze voter data for targeting ads and social media. This was President Trump's big advantage in 2016 and Bloomberg is spending heavily to catch up.
People do unexpected things and pigeon holes ignore gray areas in the law, Gorsuch told South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham, who was the only senator on the Judiciary Committee who showed up at Gorsuch's 2006 confirmation hearing to question him in person. My personal views, as I hope I have made clear, have nothing to do with the case before me in any case.

Bill Whitaker: How many employees do you have working on this vaccine?
TRUMP: ... but we believed that we could make the country better. And I was proud of that.
At least two left-leaning super PACs are wading into an already bitter GOP primary in New Mexico's second congressional district, as Republicans decide on a nominee to challenge vulnerable freshman Democratic Congresswoman Xochitl Torres-Small. Patriot Majority PAC, a group organized by Democratic political strategist Craig Varoga, has spent nearly $200,000 on ads in the race per Kantar/CMAG data. The political arm of EMILY's List has reportedly sent mailers to voters in the district. Though the groups reported their expenditures to the FEC as opposing GOP candidates Yvette Herrell and Claire Chase, the ads paint Herrell as more loyal to President Trump than Chase — a charge Chase's campaign has denied, calling on Republicans to condemn these Pelosi allies for meddling in favor of a deeply flawed general election candidate. In a statement to CBS News campaign reporter Alex Tin, Herrell said, Liberal Super PACs have no business getting involved in this primary and they should stop immediately.
Meanwhile in the House, Republican incumbents fighting to hold onto seats in suburban, affluent, and educated districts will have to thread the needle of appealing to the base while distancing themselves from some of the administration's more divisive policies. While Mr. Trump has made it clear he is willing to travel and help in the midterms, some of these campaigns may not welcome him in their districts.
While Booker's South Carolina operation stayed at around 20 paid staffers throughout his time on the trail, the New Jersey senator had made the first-in-the-South primary state a priority early on and made 16 visits to the state after launching his candidacy—the most of any candidate.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Are you investigating some of this rule breaking? You're saying you're confident that people are being asked for ID, but, obviously, people are exploiting that.
STEPHEN MILLER: This administration is going to be working with members of both parties, not only on health care reform but also reducing the price of prescription drugs, infrastructure. We have an extremely ambitious domestic agenda and of course at the forefront of that agenda is the vital issue of border security.
Lesley Stahl: Tell us about the meeting.
JOHN DICKERSON: But what's going to change that they would vote on that--
The president's stance on the problem of dropped plans has shifted significantly in the past few weeks -- while he has now apologized for the issue and has acknowledged it is a problem, he initiallysuggested that he wasn't breaking his promise. Late last month, Mr. Obama pointed out that plans that existed before the Affordable Care Act was enacted were grandfathered in to the system -- consumers only lost coverage if insurers altered those policies after the law took effect. In that case, Mr. Obama said, insurers had to replace them with quality, comprehensive coverage.
Lesley Stahl: You can do things lickety-split.
The cancellation of more than a dozen parades and large outdoor festivals cancelled this summer has resulted in economic hardship for independent contractors who rely on those events for work. It is not the same world that I spent most of my life basing my career around, Mufson said, adding that to survive and thrive, you have to adapt.
Lesley Stahl: FBI director James Comey. Are you going to ask for his resignation?
Look for a third round of pandemic relief shortly after Biden's inauguration, said Bernard Yaros Jr., an economist with Moody's Analytics. Analysts expect the new administration to roll out direct payments of $1,400 to millions of Americans.
Lesley Stahl: Let me ask whether any of you think that the campaign has hurt the Trump brand.
In April, this will be the last time you will ever file under the old and very broken system, and millions of Americans will have more take-home pay starting next month -- a lot more.
Kamala Harris responds to Pence's false claim that Biden will raise taxes on day one of his presidency: I think this is supposed to be a debate based on fact and truth.

The president seemed to take pride in undermining the ACA, but now his administration is resisting the argument that they have undermined the health law, said Levitt, who reviewed the report for AP. They can point to benefits of deregulation, but will also have to live with the costs, which include higher premiums for middle-class people with pre-existing conditions.
Jan Crawford contributed to this report.
When it comes to child poverty, we cannot be silent, Booker said in a statement. In the richest country in the world, we have a moral responsibility to look after each other and make sure that every child living in America has the opportunity to grow and thrive.
RADDATZ: Secretary Clinton, I want to follow up on that.
He's late to the 2016 race – but not to politics New Day for America While Kasich could be the last Republican to enter the presidential race (former Virginia Gov. Jim Gilmore has said he'll join, too), he's by no means a latecomer to the political world. In 1970, while a freshman in college, Kasich asked the president of Ohio State University to deliver a handwritten letter to former President Nixon during a meeting in Washington. The letter was later found by the Dayton Daily News. I would immediately pass up a Rose Bowl trip to see you. My parents would permit me to fly down and see you anytime and I know my grades wouldn't suffer, Kasich wrote. I know how busy you are and this is probably a ridiculous request but to me it would be a dream come true. Mr. Nixon wrote back that he would welcome a visit at the White House, and Kasich took him up on the offer three weeks later. They met for about 20 minutes. From there, his political career took off. Here are some things Kasich has been doing since that 1970 letter: 1974: Graduated from Ohio State University
Donnelly countered, Just doing something isn't necessarily a good thing. You have to do something that is good. I want to work with the president on this.
Among the cases awaiting action from the court is a request from Pennsylvania Republicans to halt a decision from the state's high court allowing mail-in ballots received three days after the election to be counted. South Carolina Republicans also asked the Supreme Court on Thursday to reinstate its witness requirement for absentee ballots.
Election officials across the state have asked the legislature to let them begin processing, but not tabulating, ballots early. The current governor, Democrat Tom Wolf, and the Pennsylvania Secretary of State's office have recommended that the state legislature allow counties to begin opening, checking signatures on and scanning mail ballots three weeks before the election.
Morgan said the group is taking precautions to protect both staff and voters. With that in mind, PTP is deciding to launch based on metro areas meeting several public health criteria including areas that proceeded at least 28 days without stay-at-home orders and gatherings of 10 people or more. Locations must also have flat or decreasing coronavirus cases, large COVID-19 testing capacity, and be cleared for canvassing with an infectious disease expert. Measures also include providing staff with masks, disinfectant wipes, and hand sanitizer, maintaining social distancing including when talking to voters, and setting guidelines to not enter voters' homes or apartment buildings. TPT's effort to turn out Democrats comes soon after the RNC and Trump campaign recently resumed in-person campaigning with door knocking and in-person volunteer training sessions.
Over and over, Obama and Hillary apologized for America and allowed jihadists to spread like wildfire. We need someone who can repair the damage he has done, take the fight to the enemy and put America first. That man is Donald Trump. I am proud to be a member of his national security team.
Since the election, demonstrations against him have broken out in over a dozen cities across the country. And people on both sides are on edge.
It seems to me than assiduous focus on text, structure, and history is essential to being a good judge, Gorsuch told students during a 2016 speech at Case Western University. Mark me down, too, as a believer that this traditional account of the judicial role that Justice Scalia defended will endure and the predictions of its imminent demise are much exaggerated.
MARGARET BRENNAN: We had this significant decision out of Texas on Friday with this federal judge striking down Obamacare as unconstitutional and you have tweeted, now it's on us and the Democratic attorney generals. Let's get to work. What does that mean?
Many experts expect the ruling will be overturned, but with the markets suffering steep declines in recent months, investors didn't appear willing to wait and see.
The appropriate course is instead to defer any review in this court until after the district court has completed its reassessment of severability on remand and the court of appeals has reviewed that determination on appeal, Solicitor General Noel Francisco said. That approach not only will ensure that the court has the benefit of the lower courts' considered views, but it also may narrow the scope of the issue ultimately presented to this court.
There are gubernatorial primaries in Maine, Nevada and South Carolina. In Maine, four Republicans and seven Democrats are running to succeed Gov. Paul LePage. Maine now uses a ranked-choice system. The Wall Street Journal explained how this works: In contests with three or more candidates, voters rank the candidates in order of preference. If no candidate gets more than 50% of the first-choice votes, a process is triggered in which the lowest-ranked candidate is eliminated. The voters whose first choice was eliminated then have their ballots reallocated to their next highest-ranking choice. This process continues until two candidates are left and someone has majority support.
Let's take a look at Democrat Hillary Clinton's and Republican Donald Trump's positions in five critical categories that have the potential to affect retirement for millions of working Americans: Social Security, medical insurance for early retirees, Medicare, financial industry regulation and investments/capital markets. Which candidate has the better plan for each one?
MARGARETR BRENNAN: We'll have more of our interview with the former vice president in our next half hour. We'll be back in one minute with National Security Advisor Robert O'Brien.
[A]s the coronavirus surges and the stock market plummets, we are still awaiting the Trump administration's promised responses on multiple items of critical importance, she said.
In recent weeks, two terrorist attacks in New York were made possible by the visa lottery and chain migration. In the age of terrorism, these programs present risks we can just no longer afford.
The president's top contenders had been Amy Coney Barrett, Brett Kavanaugh and Raymond Kethledge -- each has distinct records which Mr. Trump can refer to in weighing his decision. Barrett has the least experience on the bench and has emphasized social issues; Kavanaugh has extensive experience working in D.C. courts and its political scene; and Kethledge has built his conservative judicial credentials in federal court in Michigan, removed from Washington's politics.
Indiana Gov. Mike Pence was my first choice. I've admired the work he's done, especially in the state of Indiana, Trump said at a news conference in midtown Manhattan. I admire the fact that he fights for the people and he fights for you.
There's a lot more FACE THE NATION ahead. We'll be speaking with Democratic Senator Amy Klobuchar in a minute.
Even the pre-rally soundtrack is not what you would expect at a Republican political rally, where country music often plays on a loop. Trump's playlist typically consists of opera, Adele, Elton John and selections from thePhantom of the Opera soundtrack. The playlist is handpicked by Trump and sometimes is at odds with his audience. At a November rally in Beaumont, Texas - a number of attendees tried to implore the audio technician to play better music. The Beatles' Hey Jude, elicited a more positive reaction -- many started waving phones in the air.
SUSAN PAGE: You know, it's true, though, it may be divisive or not but it is an accurate depiction of what we see happening. And you-- you mentioned kind of the eerie parallels to the 2016 race on the Republican side where you had a very controversial candidate. You had a wide field that was much more acceptable to the party establishment that fought with each other and divided the-- the other side of the-- and created this path for Donald Trump to win the nomination. And that is what-- what we see now happening I think with the Democrats and with-- with Bernie Sanders. And the-- and the only comfort for Democrats I think is a lot of Democrats don't think Bernie Sanders can win at a national election. A lot of Republicans didn't think Donald Trump could either last time around.
Cruz's devotion to her husband -- from her cross-country move to Texas to her financial support of his presidential campaign -- is clear.
This week, the House is expected to pass the $1.9 trillion COVID relief package, and then President Biden will sign it into law. The legislation sends money just about everywhere — to families struggling to get by, to states and cities where tax revenue has fallen, to restaurants and to the unemployed.
Yeah, as I've said, you know, he's been a great partner to me in our effort to restore the American people's confidence in both the Department of Justice and the FBI. And we work very well together. And I think both of us know that we have to step up. That it's very important to restore the American people's confidence.
Anti-Trump activists aimed to change party rules to unbind delegates and allow them to vote their conscience, opening up the nomination fight once more once the convention started. But the Republican National Committee (RNC) and the Trump campaign teamed up to quash the Never Trump forces.
Romney also praised former President George W. Bush, saying, I am convinced that history will judge President Bush far more kindly.
SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR: We need universal healthcare and there are many ways to get there. That is one of them. The other is to at least expand Medicare to age fifty-five. There's a number of bills that I'm part of including allowing the expansion of Medicaid which I think is something we're not talking enough about that Senator Schatz from Hawaii is leading. And then of course allowing for an expansion of Medicare. So, there's many things we can do. But right now with an administration in place that seems bound and determined to take away people's health care, we have to protect the ability of people to even have their health care exist because they are talking about throwing them off for preexisting conditions.
There are gubernatorial primaries in both Alaska and Wyoming.
Donald Trump: I don't want to hurt them. I don't want to hurt them. They're, they're good people. I don't want to hurt them. And I will give you a very, very good and definitive answer the next time we do 60 Minutes together.
National Parks, for example, will remain open this time, he said, as well as the U.S. Postal Service and the Transportation Security Administration (TSA), but said workers will be working for nothing, which is simply not fair.
MARGARET BRENNAN: We want to go now to former FDA Commissioner Doctor Scott Gottlieb. He sits on the board of Pfizer as well as Illumina. And you all heard Governor Lamont mention him and the help he gives in his home state of Connecticut. Doctor joins us this morning from Westport, Connecticut. Good morning.
Hillary Clinton is expected to criticize the plan at Sunday night's debate. She has previously warned Sanders would raise taxes on middle-class families to pay for his plan.
Arizona voters on both sides of the aisle tell CBS News there's one thing they agree on: The race to replace Flake is ugly, and they want the ugliness to stop.
This is about your health care. This is about whether or not the ACA will exist. This is about whether or not preexisting conditions will be continued to be covered, former Vice President Joe Biden, the Democratic presidential nominee, said Sunday in remarks from Delaware. This is about whether or not a woman can be charged more for the same procedure as a man. This is about people's health care in the middle of a pandemic.
We all need to make the federal government work well, he said.

When asked about his thoughts on Donald Trump's inauguration and all three branches of Congress under Republican control, McCarthy said the GOP know[s] the responsibility that we have.
PAULA REID: Absolutely not. I mean, the special counsel came out hitting pretty hard this week against these claims by Flynn and his lawyers that he was somehow caught off-guard by his FBI interview. And they released a memo and they said, Look, you got a call from the deputy director of the FBI. You set up a voluntary interview at the location of your choice, you have three decades of public service, you've worked with the FBI, you know not to lie. We didn't do this to you, you did it to yourself.
In a 2017 law article for Notre Dame Law School, where she was a professor for 15 years, Barrett was critical of Chief Justice John Roberts for his decision in 2012 to side with four liberal justices and uphold the constitutionality of the individual mandate. Roberts, Barrett wrote, pushed the Affordable Care Act beyond its plausible meaning to save the statute.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, you do have many more. And I want to actually switch to another area--
SUSAN GLASSER (The New Yorker/@sbg1): Well, first of all, look, this is a story I think that really has captured the attention of Washington and many capitals around the world because it seems to show directly implicate not just this horrific question of this Saudi dissident journalist who is in a self-imposed exile here in the United States, writing column for The Washington Post. He's broken with the leadership of Saudi Arabia. And it appears to be a very personal feud with the-- the young crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman. But that's also why it's a Washington story. President Trump and, in particular, his son-in-law Jared Kushner have made the relationship extremely personal with Saudi Arabia. They have doubled down on America's traditional alliance with the Saudis. Jared Kushner has enforced a personal relationship with MBS, as he's known, overriding concerns have many here that, in fact, he was not so much a liberal reformer as someone consolidating power and cracking down on dissidents. So you see this case kind of bringing all those concerns together. And there's a real question, of course, of the judgment of the Trump administration--
When the people of Iran rose up against the crimes of their corrupt dictatorship, I did not stay silent.
According to an agreement struck with the U.S. Office of Government Ethics, which polices conflicts of interest, Devos must divest herself of 106 businesses.

In a Cabinet meeting on Thursday, Mr. Trump touted the administration's steady dismantling of Obamacare, saying, And one of the big things is the individual mandate is gone. We got rid of that. That was from Obamacare. That was, by far, the most unpopular thing in Obamacare. We actually got rid of Obamacare, except for one vote. But we essentially have -- so we're doing it piecemeal, and it's going to be gone pretty soon.
Right after the meeting, she walked to the mics in her orange coat, with a whole new image, her ascendance to the speakership no longer in jeopardy.
The modern regulatory state didn't really begin until Nixon, and since the 1970s, the Post points out that there have been periods when entire segments of the economy were deregulated -- airline and trucking, for instance, in the 1970s and 1980s. And those acts had greater impact on the economy than rolling back individual rules.
Opening the insurance markets is also likely to result in higher Medicaid enrollment, since people who qualify for that program are automatically referred.
Lesley Stahl: So you are going to keep it up?
MCGAHN: I think- I think the president has made an outstanding choice in nominating her. He promised justices in the mold of Antonin Scalia, a great justice. She clerked for Scalia, became a protege of his and I think she's a fantastic judge. There's no reason why the Senate shouldn't confirm her. And I think she's already had a distinguished career on the bench and it will continue on in the Supreme Court.
Republican and Democratic negotiators on Capitol Hill struck a deal Sunday night over funding the government through September, three congressional aides confirmed to CBS News.
It is not true that Clinton supports amnesty for everybody, but she does want to make it easier for people who came here illegally to stay by passing legislation with a path to citizenship. If that does not work, she has promised to enact a simple system for those with sympathetic cases...to make their case and be eligible for deferred action. She has said that she would focus on deporting violent criminals.
And I will tell you very strongly, when Bernie Sanders said she had bad judgment, she has really bad judgment, because we are letting people into this country that are going to cause problems and crime like you've never seen. We're also letting drugs pour through our southern border at a record clip. At a record clip. And it shouldn't be allowed to happen.
On closer inspection, however, the Republican argument starts to fall apart. Lamb's victory does indicate that the GOP is looking at a midterm bloodbath this fall, and they'd be smart to accept that reality now rather than later.
MARGARET BRENNAN: So if the courts strike down the ACA does that ultimately help you?
Mike Bloomberg: I would have raised it rather than cut it.
JOE BIDEN: Look-- well, it looks like se-- several thousand people--
These reforms do not 'sabotage' the ACA but rather provide a more efficient focus of tax-funded care to those in need, the report says. The council is a White House agency that advises the president.
Beyond assisting people with Alzheimer's and other chronic medical conditions, her comprehensive proposal would also call for strengthening Medicare and Social Security, reducing drug prices, creating personal savings accounts to help Americans save for retirement and ensure paid family leave for all.
They are a key leverage and hedge point against Iranian influence in the region. But that cannot supersede our commitment to human rights.
Harris first said this to her opponent when he began to interrupt her answer about coronavirus. Harris said both President Trump and the vice president knew about the pandemic on January 28 but Pence, the head of the White House's coronavirus task force, said they didn't tell anyone because Mr. Trump wanted people to remain calm.
Working with the Senate, we are appointing judges who will interpret the Constitution as written, including a great new Supreme Court Justice, and more circuit court judges than any new administration in the history of our country.
Based upon the bills he had previously introduced in Congress, Clinton said it was not a traditional kind of single-payer system as I understand it.
Altheia Franklin, who lives near Houston, lost her medical plan after being laid off from a job at an upscale retirement community, as a counselor to seniors making the move. Stay-at-home orders and higher virus risks for older people have put such life transitions on hold in the pandemic.

Mr. Biden also issued a presidential memorandum unwinding the Mexico City Policy, known as the global gag rule, which prohibits U.S. dollars from flowing to international non-governmental organizations that provide abortions, advocate to legalize and expand abortion access, or provide abortion counseling.
But Democrats are also facing questions over how to address the rising costs of premiums. Some are advocating for single-payer government run Medicare for All. The KFF study found coverage losses due to losing employer provided insurance will affect at least a million people in each of eight states including California, Texas, Pennsylvania, New York, Georgia, Florida, Michigan and Ohio. Several of these states are considered battlegrounds in the November election.
The returns show former South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg leading in statewide delegates.

His philosophy that judges should interpret the Constitution they way it was originally understood defined the conservative legal movement.
9:37 p.m. He said, I call on the Congress to empower every Cabinet Secretary with the authority to reward good workers -- and to remove Federal employees who undermine the public trust or fail the American people.
But appellate judges Kurt Engelhardt and Jennifer Walker Elrod both noted the law still says people must buy insurance. They questioned whether that command now violates the Constitution. Engelhardt also suggested Congress, not the courts, should choose which parts of the law should be salvaged.
But everybody else, the 170 million of us who get health insurance through our employees got big benefits. Number one, insurance companies can't deny you coverage because of a pre-existing condition. Number two, no lifetime limits, which is a big deal if you have serious health problems.
2:58 p.m. Mr. Trump hosted a lunch with TV news anchors Tuesday afternoon ahead of his address and emphasized that he wants to unite the country.
The following is a transcript of the interview with Independent Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont that aired Sunday, March 31, 2019, on Face the Nation
Spending money is what the Trump administration has in mind now. It's asking for nearly $2 billion for a virus response led by the vice president. Despite that, markets plummeted about 10% last week.
But when we get rid of those lines, you will have competition, and we will be able to keep pre-existing, we'll also be able to help people that can't get — don't have money because we are going to have people protected.
Trump renews attacks on Obamacare President Trump is starting a new effort to get rid of Obamacare. In a closed-door lunch with Republican senators, the president called for lower health care costs, according to lawmakers who participated. In a legal filing earlier this week, the Trump Justice Department announced support for a full repeal of Obamacare. But the White House has offered no details on a new health care law. Paula Reid reports.
Lesley Stahl: But why doesn't anything get done--
The Office of Management and Budget instructed agencies just before midnight that they should execute plans for an orderly shutdown due to the absence of appropriations.
In that moment, Ryan said he felt God speak to him: You will do it, because you can. He heard those words. He took out a picture of his wife and their four kids. Then, he went home to tell his wife Rebecca. In an instant, she agreed to adopt. The Holets named their new daughter Hope. Ryan and Rebecca, you embody the goodness of our nation. Thank you. Thank you, Ryan and Rebecca.
Until recently, CHIP was an extremely popular bipartisan program that covers children whose families earn too much to qualify for Medicare, but not enough to afford private insurance for their children. Congress failed to reauthorize funding for the program, which was launched in 1997, after it officially expired on Sept. 30 last year. A key problem: Disagreements last year in the House about how to pay for the program. Republicans wanted cuts in Obamacare and Medicare, while Democrats were opposed.
In a glowing profile published by The New Yorker last year, Patrick said he campaigned during the 2018 midterm elections in congressional districts where Democrats had not been competitive in a long time and were running at the grassroots level.
While serving as White House counsel, McGahn was instrumental in the confirmations of Justices Neil Gorsuch and Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court. Overseeing the judicial selection process, McGahn also played a key role in the Senate's confirmation of more than 200 of Mr. Trump's nominees to the federal courts, including more than 50 judges to the federal court of appeals.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Would you keep these children in detention longer or deport them faster? What would you do?

Most people understand that too much monopoly power is a problem, that financial markets need some degree of regulation to prevent fraud and to insulate against financial crashes. And it's widely agreed that companies need to be prevented from creating pollution that can impose costs on society. Similarly, the need to regulate natural monopolies such as the utilities that deliver water and electricity is broadly accepted.
JAMELLE BOUIE: --in the past three years. Sanders seems to be the one doing it, right? We see-- we saw this in Nevada, pulling together a coalition of union households, of minority voters of working class voters, to young voters into something that looks like potentially an electoral juggernaut. So I-- I sort of think the certainty among the Democratic establishment such that it is that Sanders is unelectable runs into the fact that looking at what we know so far he appears to be quite electable based on the measures we use for everyone else.
The nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget recently estimated that Clinton's economic proposals would add $200 billion to the federal debt over the next decade, while Trump's would add $5.3 trillion. It's hard to imagine such a jump in the debt being favorable to capital markets. An increasing appetite for federal debt could crowd out other borrowers and leave the country more vulnerable to overseas governments that own our debt.
The Democrats' counter-rally could pose a logistical challenge, as Mr. Trump's rally — according to the president — already has far more requests for tickets than the 20,000-seat venue can accommodate. And the Trump campaign announced Friday it will hold an all-day tailgate party starting at 10 a.m. to celebrate the reelection launch. Attendees typically line up outside Mr. Trump's rallies for hours ahead of time in an attempt to grab a good seat.
CLINTON: Democrats, Republicans, independents, people across our country. If you don't vote for me, I still want to be your president.
FDA moves to pull pork antibiotic linked to cancer
MARGARET BRENNAN: It's just getting people to doubt that the systems and institutions are actually functioning. Can Democrats form a united front here or are they falling prey to some of this? Because you heard it bubble up a little bit in that Biden interview as well where he said I don't buy that these are, you know, Russian bots interfering and spreading hate online that Senator Sanders is responsible for some of it.
In addition the group has launched an effort called Turnout 2020, which is a virtual phone banking program. Through that program, millions of supporters on their email list who were going to travel to engage with voters could still volunteer.
We removed a symbol that was being used to divide us, and we found a strength that united us against a domestic terrorist and the hate that filled him, she said.
In a 2017 essay published by Notre Dame Law School, where she served as a law professor, Barrett wrote Roberts pushed the Affordable Care Act beyond its plausible meaning to save the statute. The decision, she continued, might be explained by the fact that Chief Justice Roberts has not proven himself to be a textualist in matters of statutory interpretation, unlike Justice Antonin Scalia, a staunch textualist and originalist.

In 2015, Bevin beat his Democratic opponent in a surprise landslide, with voters decisively breaking his way in the week before Election Day. It was something of a comeback win for Bevin, a millionaire businessman who had never held elected office but who had tried to beat Senator Mitch McConnell in the 2014 Republican primary. McConnell won that race by nearly 40 points.
MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to get to this question of the border wall which I know you're a huge advocate for. We are about five days from a potential government shutdown and Republican leadership says there's no plan. What is the President's plan and will he shut it down to get this five billion in border wall funding?

That's when the discourse between DeSantis and Gillum turned nasty.
In a politically significant change, the bill would provide health insurance tax credits to people with solid middle-class incomes who don't now qualify for help with their premiums. That's a demographic that includes many self-employed people and business owners who were hit with higher premiums as a result of the ACA, but cut out of the benefits. Their complaints fueled Republican opposition to the health law. These are the people Trump was responding to, said Laszewski.
CBS News campaign reporter LaCrai Mitchell reports that the North Carolina Democratic Party announced in a press release Monday that it hosted virtual county conventions in 90 of the state's 100 counties over the weekend. According to the state party, more than 9,600 participants attended. In Wake and Mecklenburg Counties alone — which include the cities of Raleigh and Charlotte, respectively — the party saw its highest voter turnout numbers, which totaled more than 1,500 attendees combined. In recent weeks, our staff has worked tirelessly to assist county parties in adapting these events into a virtual platform, said NCDP Chairman Wayne Goodwin in an emailed statement. On Saturday, fired up Democrats across North Carolina participated in record numbers. Our members are energized, united and ready to take on President Trump and Republicans down the ballot in November.
Atop the dome of this Capitol stands the Statue of Freedom. She stands tall and dignified among the monuments to our ancestors who fought, and lived, and died to protect her. Monuments to Washington, and Jefferson, and Lincoln, and King. Memorials to the heroes of Yorktown and Saratoga; to young Americans who shed their blood on the shores of Normandy and the fields beyond; and others, who went down in the waters of the Pacific and the skies all over Asia.
And freedom stands tall over one more monument: this one. This Capitol -- this living monument -- this is the moment to the American people.

The president has reached a new low in this country's history of oppressing religious freedom that we have never seen before, he said. If he doesn't want to call his imposition of his values a theology, that's fine, but it is an imposition of his values over a church who has very clear theological reasons for opposing what the Obama administration is forcing on them.

After several years in the Bush White House, which included a time as White House staff secretary, Kavanaugh was nominated for the D.C. Appeals Court. The fight over his confirmation was contentious, with Illinois Democratic Sen. Dick Durbin at one point calling him the Zelig or Forrest Gump of Republican politics…whether it's Elian Gonzalez or the Starr Report, you are there.

TREVOR POTTER: Correct. The-- the owners of the National Enquirer who agreed, apparently in a meeting with candidate Trump to use their corporate money to buy the story and prevent the American public from knowing about it right in the middle of the run-up to the general election.

In 2017, the South Carolina veteran suicide rate was significantly higher than the national suicide rate. Charleston native Stephanie Hammond is an Air Force veteran and says she loved that Harris chose to unveil the plan in her home state. I think that that's what's needed, said Hammond. Being a veteran myself and knowing other veterans that have come back and are dealing with some mental health issues, the unveiling of the plan is welcome in my eyes as a veteran, as well as...for the veterans that I served with, and veterans that are suffering from some mental health illnesses.

9. Does a possible Democratic wave extend to state and local elections?
About three-quarters of GOP voters described themselves today as born-again or evangelical Christians. Of that group, Trump won slightly more of the vote, 30 percent, than Cruz, who got 29 percent. Trump also did better than any of the other candidates with those voters who aren't evangelical or born-again.
Becoming a pilot for Frontier Airlines was a dream come true for Shannon Kiedrowski, but now she and three other female flyers are suing the carrier, claiming discrimination over pregnancy and breastfeeding accommodations. The dispute seemingly pitches unequal treatment against passenger safety.
Well, you know, people sometimes plead to things that turn out not to be crimes. And as I said, the question of lying, you know, it's something he would know about. On its face, as Director Comey said, it's not so clear. But the question of materiality is not something he would know about. That's something that the government knows about. And we have now gotten into it, drilled down, obtained new information. And the Department of Justice is not persuaded that this was material to any legitimate counterintelligence investigation. So it was not a crime.
What Boehner is angry with me for isn't anything I've said to him -- I haven't said much of anything to him, Cruz said. What Boehner is angry with me for is standing with the American people -- is energizing House conservatives to stand with the American people and actually honor the commitments we've made.

In Connecticut, Democratic incumbent Governor Dannel Malloy is not seeking re-election. The Democratic primary race is between Ned Lamont and Bridgeport Mayor Joseph Ganim. Ganim served a seven-year prison sentence for corruption charges but voters still elected him mayor. Ganim also ran for governor in 1994, but he dropped out of the race. Similar to Ganim, Lamont ran for governor in 2010, but lost to Malloy. He also defeated Sen. Joe Lieberman in the primary, but lost to Lieberman in the general election when Lieberman ran as an independent. Lamont was also a businessman as he started his own company in the telecommunications industry. Lamont said that if Ganim won the primary, he would not support him. Ganim portrayed Lamont as an established millionaire candidate. The Republican primary race includes Danbury Mayor Mark Boughton, Tim Herbst, veteran Steve Obsitnik, former DFC Global executive Bob Stefanowski, and hedge fund founder David Stemerman. Boughton ran for governor in 2010 and 2014, but lost each time. The two favorites in the race are Lamont and Boughton as they each won their party's nomination.

Here's who's featured in this week's episode:
President Trump rejected Redfield's science-based conclusion. It's not more effective by any means than a vaccine, the president said of mask-wearing. Breaking with public health officials who agree mask-wearing reduces spread of COVID-19, the president called wearing face coverings a mixed bag.

One day after every Florida county entered into a full phase 1 reopening across the state, the number of COVID-related deaths surpassed 2,000 in Florida on Tuesday. The full Phase 1 reopening allows for restaurants and retail establishments to expand indoor occupancy to 50% and also permits museums, libraries and gyms to operate at 50% of their buildings' capacities. During a virtual press conference with the Florida Democratic Party, Demings and state leaders, CBS News campaign reporter LaCrai Mitchell asked what the leaders thought about this new phase of the state's re-opening. Our economy is suffering, this is Florida where tourism is so critical. But to reopen while our numbers are continuing to increase — and look, I know also that the rate of increase has gone down somewhat — but we have to be so careful and so, strategic in terms of reopening, said Demings who added that she did appreciate the idea of a phased re-opening but countered that Floridians have received mixed messages from the state's governor. Florida Democratic State Senator Victor Torres said that idea of a gradual re-opening isn't being adhered to by some patrons in restaurants, salons, and bars. That's where I have a problem because guess what? If this comes back, it's gonna come back double the amount, said Torres during the virtual press conference Tuesday. We're gonna really face a challenge in the safety for our people.
SUSAN GLASSER: Well, that's right. It's interesting that he started to-- to do so, as you know, his major health care initiative failed, essentially, which was the repeal of Obamacare, which was something that President Trump as well as Republican Party for years campaigned upon, it failed by a single vote. Trump is still interestingly bashing the late Senator John McCain for his decisive vote on that. He did that in an interview with Fox this week, you know, even because he understands that, you know, they haven't really come up with a convincing answer to it. Interestingly, tax cuts doesn't figure on that list. I did-- that-- call it crazy or what you want, effort of binge-watching all six hours and fifty-one minutes of President Trump's six rallies so far. There was another one last night for my column in the New Yorker this week. So that's almost seven hours of Trump. Interestingly, tax cuts which was going to be the centerpiece of Republican campaigns, generally, came in at about the fifty-one-minute mark to his rallies. These are not about--

Smaller steps might be in keeping with Roberts' preference for avoiding major divides where possible, and attracting votes from both conservatives and liberals. The 63-year-old chief justice may be in no hurry to move quickly, as he could be on the bench another 15 to 20 years.
And I think that taxpayer money is better used to get free community college, to help kids get certifications, when those are some of the fastest growing degreed jobs we have in this nation. And so to me, this is a legitimate policy argument about how we help people afford college, help them pay off their loans, make bold policy changes, which this president is not doing. But I think there's room in our party for a legitimate debate. I just think it's important to realize there's a lot more that unifies us than separate- that there's a lot more that unifies us than there is that divides us, and that divide right now is with the American people and the president. He promised them pharmaceutical prices going down, they've gone up. He promised them infrastructure, he has done--
JOHN DICKERSON: Well, it's my last show, Mr. Speaker. So-- so look--
The president sat down for an interview with Fox News' Fox and Friends, which aired Tuesday morning, to preview his address.

Santorum recalled his prominent role in the 1990s debates over the controversial procedure that critics call partial-birth abortion. He lambasted the president's health care law requiring insurance policies to include free prenatal testing, because free prenatal testing ends up in more abortions and therefore less care that has to be done because we cull the ranks of the disabled in our society.

Rather than pursuing Obamacare Romney said, the government should leave coverage for the uninsured up to the states. While some have said the president's health care plan has lost popularity among the public because they did not understand exactly what he has been advocating, Romney said the Democrats have only themselves to blame for their legislative failures.

Although she began her career opposing LGBTQ rights, she is now a supporter of LGBTQ issues and has apologized for her previous views. Controversy Gabbard's father was an anti-gay activist whose views influenced his daughter during her early political career. When she ran for the Hawaii state legislature in 2002, Gabbard boasted about supporting her father in his effort to promote the constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage passed in 1998. After her election, she continued to espouse anti-gay views. In 2004, she opposed a bill legalizing civil unions. To try to act as if there is a difference between 'civil unions' and same-sex marriage is dishonest, cowardly and extremely disrespectful to the people of Hawaii, Gabbard said at the time, according to CNN's KFile. As Democrats we should be representing the views of the people, not a small number of homosexual extremists. Gabbard apologized to LGBTQ activists in the state when running for Congress in 2012. She apologized again after launching her presidential campaign. Gabbard has invited controversy for her iconoclastic views on foreign policy. In January 2017, she visited Syria and met with Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad. A few months later, the U.S. bombed the Syrian airfield thought to be the origin of a government-ordered deadly chemical attack. Gabbard called the U.S. bombing reckless and questioned whether Assad was behind the attack, garnering criticism from other Democratic politicians.

Cary Dixon - Opioid reform advocate Pablo Martinez Monsivais/AP President Barack Obama listens as Cary Dixon describes having an adult child struggle with a substance use disorder, during a community forum at the East End Family Resource Center in Charleston, W.Va., Wednesday, Oct. 21, 2015. Obama was in Charleston to lead a community discussion on prescription drug abuse and heroin epidemic.
I was there in the meeting and conversation and I've read the different reports, and as participant in the conversations I don't--I wouldn't characterize the way it has been, he told Garrett. I thought that there was conversations about the legal case in front of us, and I think that there was different opinions expressed. But I think the notion of--of sort of this acrimony or chaos inside, that's not what I witnessed. I think that--that it was a healthful conversation and I think that the president made a decision that everybody got behind.
John McCain appeared on Face the Nation 112 times.
The case focuses on the ACA's individual mandate after a lower court used it to find the entire law to be unconstitutional. What they're arguing is when we voted to get rid of the individual mandate, we voted to get rid of Obamacare, Alexander said. I don't know one single senator that thought that.
Asked if Donald Trump should be bemoaning how bad things are, Ryan said, I think that's what happens in presidential primaries, but he declined to comment specifically on any candidate.

In Wisconsin, incumbent Democratic Senator Tammy Baldwin is running for re-election. She will run in the general election against state Senator Leah Vukmir or veteran and first-time candidate Kevin Nicholson. Baldwin is one of 10 Democratic U.S. senators trying to defend their seats in states that Trump won in 2016. Hillary Clinton expected to win the state, but according to the New York Times' count, Mr. Trump won the state by just 27,000 voters. The Times went on to point out that turnout in the lowest-income neighborhoods had dropped dramatically -- 19.5 percent from 2012.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Barrasso who was just here said that he does think there's room for legislation to protect preexisting conditions. One of the things that would get thrown out with this ruling if it's upheld.
In December, a divided panel of judges on the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals also ruled in favor of the GOP-led states, finding the individual mandate unconstitutional. The New Orleans-based court, however, did not decide whether the rest of Obamacare could stand and kicked the case back to the lower court.

Years before Biden was the Democratic Party's presumptive nominee and Mark Kelly was the best-funded Senate candidate in the country, Republicans say they were already ramping up their operation to defend Arizona. The state is now a key battleground where Democrats, citing promising polls and a recent Senate victory, hope to score a win in a state that last elected a Democrat to the White House nearly three decades ago. Arizona Democrats claim they are planning their largest ever ground operation this cycle. But Mr. Trump's team already has more than 30 staff on the ground, with thousands more Arizonans trained through their volunteer program. The RNC understands, and the president understands, that Arizona is a top priority state and the resources are following, Greg Safsten, executive director of Arizona's Republican Party, told CBS News campaign reporter Alex Tin this week as Mr. Trump made his second visit to the state in under three months.
In doing what I'm doing now, a lot of it is heart, a lot of it is compassion, a lot of it is far beyond money -- such as immigration, such as the things we're talking about. From a purely economic standpoint -- if I was doing this purely from an economic standpoint, I would sit down and tell you in one second what I'd be doing, okay? It's so simple.
Most of the feedback that I've been getting from members is that they're still pretty much wide open, SEIU Local 1984 President Rich Gulla told Sganga.
Without ever explicitly naming Trump, Mr. Obama scolded the 2016 candidate for proposing to ban all Muslims from the U.S. When politicians insult Muslims, whether abroad or our fellow citizens... that doesn't make us safer, he said. That's not telling it like it is. It's just wrong. It diminishes us in the eyes of the world. It makes it harder to achieve our goals. And it betrays who we are as a country.
There were reports that several top administration officials had been at odds over the Justice Department's brief. However, when Vice President Mike Pence's chief of staff, Marc Short was asked about this by CBS News' Major Garrett, he denied that there had been much chaos, and characterized the discussion as a healthful conversation.
Jason Kelly: That's exactly the idea.
JOHN DICKERSON: But what the congressman and others are saying is-- is that if you believe the science about human contribution that there are mitigation efforts you can take with greenhouse gases and that that's where there needs to be a little more focus from Republicans is on admitting that that climate change is caused by human activity and taking actions with-- whether it's coal plants or emissions from cars or methane gas to actually get-- get it where the problem is occurring.
PAUL RYAN: But my point is--
That statement comes after he raised the idea last week of subjecting Muslims to take a test and deport those who supports Sharia law.
The CEO of the convention, Jeff Larson, addressed the anti-Trump delegate coalition and noted that their efforts to change the rules of the nominating process was a little unfair.
Public outrage over drug costs has been growing for years as Americans face pricing pressure from multiple sources: New medicines for life-threatening diseases often launch with prices exceeding $100,000 per year. And older drugs for common ailments like diabetes and asthma routinely see price hikes around 10 percent annually. Meanwhile Americans are paying more at the pharmacy counter due to health insurance plans that require them to shoulder more of their prescription costs.
America has also finally turned the page on decades of unfair trade deals that sacrificed our prosperity and shipped away our companies, our jobs, and our wealth. Our nation has lost its wealth, but we're getting it back so fast. The era of economic surrender is totally over. From now on, we expect trading relationships to be fair and, very importantly, reciprocal.

Tulsi Gabbard Rep. Tulsi Gabbard launches 2020 campaign 05:28 Tulsi Gabbard was born in American Samoa in 1981, and her family moved to Hawaii when she was 2 years old. Her mother, Carol, is a practicing Hindu, a religion Gabbard adopted. Her father, Mike, is a member of the Hawaii state Senate. After growing up in a politically active family, Gabbard became a member of the Hawaii House of Representatives when she was 21 years old in 2002, the youngest woman to be elected to a state legislature at the time. While serving in the state legislature in 2003, she enlisted in the Hawaii Army National Guard. She deployed in Iraq and returned in 2006. After returning from her second deployment in 2009, Gabbard ran for Honolulu City Council. She served on the council from 2011 until 2012, when she resigned to focus on her congressional campaign. She was elected to the House of Representatives in 2012. She was the first practicing Hindu in Congress. Issues Gabbard is very progressive, and one of the few members of Congress to endorse Sen. Bernie Sanders during the 2016 Democratic primary. She resigned her position as vice chair of the Democratic National Committee to endorse him. Gabbard is a supporter of a woman's right to an abortion and received a 100 percent rating from NARAL. She has emphasized environmental and economic issues during her tenure, and supports a $15 minimum wage. She also supports Medicare for All.
Coffman has called for a permanent DACA solution and has pushed for a vote on it in the House. But although Coffman stood up to the administration and its policies, it's telling that he did not criticize the President heading into his primary but rather cast the blame on his senior policy advisor Stephen Miller. This is indicative of the predicament of House Republicans in competitive seats that the Democrats are fighting to flip this fall. While these vulnerable Republicans want to distance themselves from Mr. Trump's more controversial policies, they fear poking him too much and facing the wrath of him or his supporters, who they need to turn out to vote for them in the fall.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you have a benchmark infection rate where you'd shut down?
Kennedy is competing in the primary on September 1 against incumbent Senator Ed Markey.
Maryland's Democratic gubernatorial primary race shines light on the struggle for the heart of the Democratic party between the progressive and establishment wings. Progressive first-time candidate Ben Jealous, a former NAACP president, has been endorsed by potential 2020 hopefuls Sens. Bernie Sanders,I-Vermont, Kamala Harris, D-California, and Cory Booker, D-New Jersey. His main competitor in a crowded field where eight democrats are vying to challenge incumbent Republican Gov. Larry Hogan is establishment-backed Rushern L. Baker III, a two-term Prince George's county executive. Jealous and Baker are both African American and are hoping to be Maryland's first black governor. If progressive Jealous wins, it could be a sign for how these potential presidential hopefuls will position themselves and their agendas as they try to unseat President Trump in 2020.
[Donald Trump: You look great, honey.]
President Donald Trump: --11.4 million jobs. It's the largest number in the history of our country--
RADDATZ: And, Secretary Clinton, I do want to follow up on e- mails. You've said your handing of your e-mails was a mistake. You disagreed with FBI Director James Comey, calling your handling of classified information, quote, extremely careless. The FBI said that there were 110 classified e-mails that were exchanged, eight of which were top secret, and that it was possible hostile actors did gain access to those e-mails. You don't call that extremely careless?
Rep. Primila Jayapa: As the co-chair of the Progressive Caucus, she doesn't try to shut something down before it needs to be shutdown.
MANUEL BOJORQUEZ: Vaccinating Americans remains a logistical problem. In Alaska, medical workers try to find ways to remote villages.
Polls closed at 7 p.m. EST in the first-in-the-south Republican primary on Saturday and exit poll results began to trickle in just after 5 p.m. EST.
JOHN DICKERSON: We'll have more from tonight's 60 MINUTES interview. We'll ask a key senator on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Florida Republican Marco Rubio, what's next for the U.S. relationship with Saudi Arabia? He'll also give us an update on Florida's recovery from Hurricane Michael. Then in a week of back to back to back presidential rallies, we'll check in on November's midterm elections with chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, Chris Van Hollen. And we'll take a look at who's ahead in the battle for control of the House with our CBS News Battleground Tracker. Plus, we'll talk to Nebraska Republican Senator Ben Sasse about his new book.
7:26 p.m. ET Donald Trump is expected to address the violence and chaos affecting communities across the U.S. on Thursday night, according to excerpts of his speech released by his campaign.
Lesley Stahl: You know, I asked your husband if he was at all intimidated and scared about what lies ahead. The enormity. You're about to be first lady. Are you a little nervous about it? Little tense? A little--
And I think that taxpayer money is better used to get free community college, to help kids get certifications, when those are some of the fastest growing degreed jobs we have in this nation. And so to me, this is a legitimate policy argument about how we help people afford college, help them pay off their loans, make bold policy changes, which this president is not doing. But I think there's room in our party for a legitimate debate. I just think it's important to realize there's a lot more that unifies us than separate- that there's a lot more that unifies us than there is that divides us, and that divide right now is with the American people and the president. He promised them pharmaceutical prices going down, they've gone up. He promised them infrastructure, he has done--
The court wrestled with whether it could get rid of just the government-debt restriction or would have to invalidate the entire ban on cellphone robocalls. No one wants robocalls on their cellphone, Roberts said, though he typically votes for the challengers in free-speech cases.
RADDATZ: OK, we're going to move on.
The last thing in the world we need is a Supreme Court to be a reflection of what Congress has become: tribal warfare, McCaskill said.
Mike Bloomberg: Correct. 1946, and the guy who sold it to us said his sister would never forgive him.
His wife's speech is the beginning of what I would call the family testimonials that will describe Donald Trump the man, Manafort said.
Responding to Jennings' rant, Scott said he was responsible for creating a million jobs in the state.
Like Horn, Torres Small also voiced her disagreement with Biden on Thursday, tweeting, I will continue to stand up to my party when they're out of touch with the reality on the ground in #NM02. The freshman Democrat has been outspoken on the issue before through debates and ads. CBS News campaign reporter Alex Tin says the oil and gas industry claim to support 51,000 jobs in the district, directly or indirectly, with its revenues accounting for almost 20% of the district's total economy. In Texas' 23rd, Republican Tony Gonzales called on Democrat Gina Ortiz Jones on Friday to pledge to oppose Biden's radical environmental policies. Jones' spokesperson Sharon Yang told CBS News political unit broadcast associate Aaron Navarro that Jones doesn't support a ban on fracking and believes energy leaders should be incentivized to participate in more clean technology development. Texas is already a clean energy superpower, and Gina is committed to building on Texas' leadership and investing in our workers so we can address the threat climate change poses to our national security, our economic security, and our public health while creating more good-paying jobs in South and West Texas, Yang said in a statement. Jones is in a competitive race for the state's open seat, left by retiring Republican Congressman Will Hurd.
A plurality of Democrats — 40 in total — said they were not yet settled on a candidate. As summer came to a close, however, nearly every Democrat said they were starting to give the field a closer look.

10:18 p.m. ET Ivanka introduces her father, Donald Trump, who comes to the stage for his major speech accepting the 2016 GOP presidential nomination.
At their annual retreat in Baltimore, Maryland, Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wisconsin, and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, were asked whether they are confident Republicans will support Trump or Cruz.
Galt MacDermot Martha Swope, New York Public Library/Billy Rose Theatre Division; CBS News; RCA Records Canadian-born composer Galt MacDermot (December 18, 1928-December 17, 2018), who had studied African music in Cape Town and won a Grammy, was enlisted by Gerome Ragni and James Rado to write the music for their irreverent stage show replete with drug use, profanity, and a racially diverse cast, called Hair. In those days, there was a Broadway style of singing that we didn't want to use, MacDermot told Sunday Morning in 2009. So Jim and Gerry used to go out and look for people who weren't trained, but just had natural talent. MacDermot would win a Grammy for his score, which included Aquarius, Good Morning Starshine, Easy to Be Hard and the title song – memorable blends of rock and funk. The '60s, when we were doing it, was a wonderful time for American music, MacDermot said. That's when rock and roll reached its peak, really. So I was influenced by everything I heard. And everything I heard, I liked. Play excerpt: Hair MacDermot's other credits would include the stage shows Two Gentlemen of Verona, Dude, and The Human Comedy, and the films Cotton Comes to Harlem and Mistress.
The red states and the Trump administration also argue that the mandate cannot be separated from the rest of the health care law, and the entirety of the statute should fall as a result.
JANICE JACKSON: Yeah, I think we've learned a lot about reopening from the past spring. Definitely prioritizing the reopening of schools has to be at the top of the list and our mayor has done that. We have reopened bars and restaurants at limited capacity here in the city. But one thing that was really important in that report is that it showed that community spread does not necessarily impact spread within a particular school and that implementing mitiga-- mitigation strategies with fidelity actually is more successful, you know, lead to more success with reopening. And so we're focused on that. We have a solid plan in place that goes above and beyond a guidance that we've heard from city as well as CDC officials. And we believe that we can safely reopen. And we've been open for three weeks or we have been open for three weeks with a great degree of success. So, the time is now for students to return to the classroom.
But the tax hikes may be smaller than widely anticipated, says Michael Zezas, head of U.S. public policy research at Morgan Stanley.
There isn't a religious test for service in the government, whether it's in the Senate or on the Supreme Court, he said. What should be raised is her opinions, her speeches, her public statements as a professor and a judge, and whether or not she will uphold precedent.
MAYOR FRANCIS SUAREZ: Well, like I said, we're only doing about a third of all of the vaccinations, so it's very possible that those cases are happening in the other two-thirds. But-- but definitely--
Senior Adviser to the President Gov. Ned Lamont, (D-Connecticut
While Mr. Obama said he apologizes for the poor Obamacare rollout, he said, I make no apologies for us taking this on, because somebody sooner or later had to do it... We've got to move forward on this. It took 100 years for us to even get to the point where we could start talking about and implementing a law to make sure everybody's got health insurance. And my pledge to the American people is, is that we're going to solve the problems that are there, we're going to get it right, and the Affordable Care Act is going to work for the American people.
So, first and foremost, I will do everything I can to reach out to everybody.
Fulfilling a campaign promise, President Joe Biden plans to reopen the HealthCare.gov insurance markets for a special sign-up opportunity geared to people needing coverage in the coronavirus pandemic.
Right now the economy is good but I think we have some warning signs here, Robert Head, 80, a farmer who rents his land, said. We're actually paying for these tariffs — not China.
Speaker Nancy Pelosi: That's right. He has.
MARGARET BRENNAN: So when you were at the White House, this was your project. And looking at Pew Research--
But the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals sided with the city and found it did not treat Catholic Social Services worse than it would have treated another organization that didn't work with same-sex couples but had different religious beliefs.
I think it will get authorized by the FDA after a careful review, and it's going to provide a lot of additional supply on the market and some differentiation as well from the other vaccines.
John McCain: Personal? Sure. I'd be glad to converse with him. But I also understand that we're very different people. Different upbringing. Different life experiences.
Donald Trump: I think so, it's enormous. I've done a lotta big things, I've never done anything like this. It is so big, it is so-- it's so enormous, it's so amazing.
Speaker Pelosi at November 7, 2018, press conference: I think I'm the best person to go forward.
Speaker Nancy Pelosi: The Mueller report is about an attack on our elections by a foreign government. And we want to know about that. We wanna know about that in terms of being able to prevent it from happening again. So it's bigger even than Donald Trump.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Good morning and welcome to FACE THE NATION. We begin today with White House Senior Adviser Stephen Miller. He is the President's point person on policy. Good to have you here in studio.
SEN. KLOBUCHAR: I- no, I would not. What I'm saying is you need to have steps and measures and you would- could start there and then of course you have dates and you have times and you have a focus and you have a plan. But that is not what he does. He goes and gets a letter and says, I love the guy, right in the face of the Warmbier's, who lost their son, Otto. So I am concerned just because of the track record here. Talk is good, but if all it is is talk it doesn't produce anything for national security for America and international security for our allies.
In the end, CHIP became a bargaining chip, said Edwin Park, vice president of health policy at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. Unfortunately, CHIP was held hostage in the debate over [Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals] and other broader issues.
The third pillar ends the visa lottery, a program that randomly hands out green cards without any regard for skill, merit, or the safety of American people. It's time to begin moving towards a merit-based immigration system, one that admits people who are skilled, who want to work, who will contribute to our society, and who will love and respect our country.
Police chief Calvin Williams said the city added 300 more bicycles for the convention, hoping that officers would be more maneuverable and less threatening.
Azar later told reporters that the administration would seek input on doing away with drug rebates in the Medicare system to encourage more direct discounts. He gave no timeframe for more concrete steps.
That leaves the president with few options. He could compromise with them — one of Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi's aides said Mr. Trump expressed to her that he liked her message of bipartisanship in her victory speech Tuesday. Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham said he thinks legislation on prison reform and infrastructure has a good chance of passing. Mr. Trump himself mentioned infrastructure and drug pricing in a press conference that was quite laudatory of Pelosi, a stark contrast from his caustic words on the campaign trail.
SENATOR RICK SCOTT: We shouldn't be paying more than what they pay in Europe. It's unfair to Americans. And let's go piece by piece to try to fix it.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back. We are now joined by Minnesota senator and 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Amy Klobuchar. She joins us from Minneapolis. Good morning, senator.
1:15 p.m. ET This is clearly going to be Donald Trump's convention, Trump Campaign Chairman Paul Manafort told John Dickerson this morning on Face the Nation. He says the Republican convention will afford Americans an up-close and personal view of Trump. Manafort said that the speakers -- his family and friends -- will show him how he's built his successful empire.
Donald Trump, Jr.: You know-- we-- we know him pretty well. And we've got to, you know, be by his side for many years, both as a father and in business. So, you know-- the tenacity that he's always shown-- was just there. But it was just so much more. When I was watching him working 20-hour days, doing seven major speeches to tens of thousands of people and just saying, Well, it wasn't triage. Which state are we gonna do today, it's, We're just gonna do 'em all. We're gonna speak to all of these people. And I think people saw that energy. They fed off that energy. That energy was so much of the movement-- that he was able to create. And, you know-- it-- it only furthered what I already knew.
Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick on Friday compared President Obama to Judas, as he responded to a directive the Obama administration issued to public school districts across the country Friday on transgender students.
America is a nation of builders. We built the Empire State Building in just one year. Isn't it a disgrace that it can now take 10 years just to get a minor permit approved for the building of a simple road? I am asking both parties to come together to give us safe, fast, reliable, and modern infrastructure that our economy needs and our people deserve.
Max Rose is expected to win Tuesday night's Democratic primary to run against Rep. Daniel Donovan or Michael Grimm in the fall. He is the first post-9/11 combat veteran of the war in Afghanistan to seek office in New York City.
And then you've got the base of the party is furious because they didn't repeal Obamacare. How are you gonna repeal Obamacare when Obama's president? he questioned.
When the special counsel report was released last year, you were accused by critics of putting your thumb on the scale in the president's favor. Are you doing the president's bidding in General Flynn's case?

If we had the political environment where we could pass something like that, that would be good because I see health care as a right and not a privilege, she said.
Enrollment, however, began at a snail's pace in October because of all the technical problems with HealthCare.gov, the federal Obamacare website serving 36 states. Some state-run Obamacare websites have had their own problems as well.
Kofi Annan FABRICE COFFRINI/AFP/Getty Images The son of an elite family from Ghana, Kofi Annan (April 8, 1938-August 18, 2018) spent much of his career in the United Nations, where his aristocratic style, cool-tempered elegance and political savvy helped guide his ascent to become its seventh secretary-general, and the first hired from within. He was also the first black African to lead the world body, from 1997 to 2006. From the outset of his tenure, Annan struggled to restore the U.N.'s tarnished reputation (including notable failures by the U.N.'s peacekeeping operations, which he had previously lead). When he departed, he left behind a global organization far more aggressively engaged in peacekeeping and fighting poverty, setting the framework for its 21st-century response to mass atrocities and its emphasis on human rights and development. He was chief architect of what became known as the Millennium Development Goals, and played a central role in creating the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, and the U.N.'s first counter-terrorism strategy. Despite his well-honed diplomatic skills, Annan was never afraid to speak candidly. That didn't always win him fans, particularly in the case of President George W. Bush's administration, with whom Annan's camp spent much time bickering. Much of his second term was spent at odds with the United States, the U.N.'s biggest contributor, as he tried to lean on it to pay almost $2 billion in arrears, at the same time he pushed against the invasion of Iraq.
He and his wife Cindy raised four children. They survived two grueling presidential campaigns, a battle against melanoma – and then this.
Lesley Stahl: I'm gonna be fair.
We've placed barriers or barricades at certain key streets and intersections around the downtown neighborhood just to make sure that things like that transpired in Nice are thwarted here in Cleveland if they're attempted. Or at least mitigated.
CLINTON: Well, like everyone else, I've spent a lot of time thinking over the last 48 hours about what we heard and saw. You know, with prior Republican nominees for president, I disagreed with them on politics, policies, principles, but I never questioned their fitness to serve.
He also said he is eager to reduce the cost of medicine through the competitive bidding process. Some people think that's just as important as health care.
MARGARET BRENNAN: You mentioned on spending: Steyer. You think the amount of money he's spending in South Carolina--
A few months ago, it almost seemed like this administration was prepared for war with North Korea. Were you prepared for that? asked Braver.
Jason Kelly: For example, for the optimization project we did earlier this year, we roughly tripled the amount that we could get out in-- in a tank from the starting process.
It is unlikely that a single review will cover all three aspects sought in your request; however, we believe our planned work, to include the flash reports, will provide the transparency necessary to inform the concerns noted relative to lending practices of the banks in implementing PPE, he wrote.
After huddling Wednesday night, House GOP leaders decided to move forward and schedule the vote for Thursday afternoon, despite the lack of a score from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO), which estimates how it would affect the federal deficit and Americans with health insurance. The CBO's score of the original bill estimated that 24 million people would lose their insurance over the course of a decade.
On Tuesday, President Trump will head to West Virginia, home to one of the most competitive Senate races in the country. Republicans are setting their sights on flipping incumbent Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin's seat in a state that Mr. Trump won by nearly 42 percentage points in 2016 and where his approval rating remains high. A Gallup poll following Mr. Trump's first year in office found that he received his highest approval ratings in 2017 from West Virginians.
While Clinton has not publicly backed a federal $15/hour minimum wage, the Democratic National Committee agreed late Friday night to include this proposal in their official party platform.
MARGARET BRENNAN: The President tweeted this morning about your former client, Remember Michael Cohen only became a rat after the FBI did something that was absolutely unthinkable and unheard of and they broke into an attorney's office. What is your response to that?
WASHINGTON -- With billions in taxpayer dollars at stake, the Obama administration has taken a passive approach to identifying potential fraud involving the president's health care law, nonpartisan congressional investigators say in a report released Wednesday.
Earlier this week, Clinton rolled out a new college affordability plan that seemed to take into account Sanders' own policy positions. The proposal would make public college tuition-free for families that make less than $125,000 per year.
And by the end of the convention, people will see that he's ready to be president of the United States.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Let me ask you a little bit about a few other matters.
Neither platform addresses how to directly improve college preparation or the soaring underlying cost of higher education. Although the Clinton plan would certainly make college more affordable for more middle- and lower-class families, Trump's proposals will economically harm students. His approach is poorly conceived and comes up short in addressing the core problems of higher education.
By not tracking, the administration foregoes information that could suggest potential program issues or potential vulnerabilities to fraud, GAO said.
CLINTON: Well, thank you for asking your question. And I've heard this question from a lot of Muslim-Americans across our country, because, unfortunately, there's been a lot of very divisive, dark things said about Muslims. And even someone like Captain Khan, the young man who sacrificed himself defending our country in the United States Army, has been subject to attack by Donald.
President Trump again this week vowed to release a proposal to protect Americans with pre-existing conditions. I have it all ready. I have it all ready, Mr. Trump told ABC News on Tuesday during a Town Hall. Since running for president in 2015, President Trump has promised to bring forth a terrific and phenomenal new health care plan to replace the Affordable Care Act, but has yet to deliver.

SEN. KLOBUCHAR: --for immediate health care needs, but as far as other benefits I think we need to- that has got to be a part of the discussion of comprehensive immigration reform.
A Republican National Committee spokesperson said, President Trump enjoys historic support among Republicans. Any assertion to the contrary is simply a fool's errand.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the State Department is now telling Congress that they are stopping some of this aid, which was meant to stabilize the country, to stop migrants from fleeing-- fleeing. Kelsey, can Congress stop the President? Bernie Sanders seemed to think they could.
Lesley Stahl: Really? What did he say?
SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: We will look at their average costs, which are fifty percent lower than they are in the United States, and we will do that.
One of the world's richest men, he devoted more than $2 billion of his wealth to philanthropy (including founding the Allen Institute for Brain Science). He also spent on such interests as music (he played in his own rock 'n' roll band, and built Seattle's Museum of Pop Culture), sports (he bought the Seattle Seahawks and the Portland Trail Blazers), science (he funded an antenna farm listening for signals from outer space, and built the aerospace firm Stratolaunch), movies (he invested in DreamWorks), and travel (he built a yacht longer than a football field, equipped with its own submarine). Look, in the Microsoft days, you had some great ideas and some great execution between me and Bill and many other people, he told 60 Minutes correspondent Lesley Stahl in 2011. In technology most things fail. Most companies fail. But I had some whoppers!
She said her proposal would be paid for by imposing a tax on trust funds that are normally untaxed, resulting in an estimated $200 billion.
Mr. Trump said as he signed the order that it requires two regulations to be removed for every new regulation added, making good on a promise he made during the campaign. The White House argues that this will reduce the burden the private sector has in complying with federal standards.
But he has chastised politicians with other words: false, dubious, statistical mendacity, debunk, no evidence, deeply flawed, wildly inflated, wildly mischaracterized, bizarre claim, inaccurate and misleading.
COOPER: Ken Karpowicz has a question.
McCaskill is fighting for her political life. She's a 65-year-old two-term Democrat in a state that President Trump won in 2016 by nearly 20 points.You could call McCaskill the Missouri compromiser — that rare Democrat who voted nearly half the time in support of President Trump's agenda — and she hasn't kept it a secret.
SEN. BARRASSO: Well I know we're trying in the House and the Senate to come up with a proposal to get passed in both of those bodies before Friday the 21st and then send that to the White House which I hope the president would choose to sign.
My plan now is to number one get rid of Obamacare, Trump added.
For strategist John Weaver, the Freedom Caucus helped catalyze the Republican Party's transformation. Formed in 2015, the congressional caucus is made up of conservative Republican members of Congress who are often at odds with members of their own party. Among its founders are Rep. Jim Jordan, Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida, and former Director of the Office of Management and Budget and Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney.
Romney was the only party-breaking vote from the Republican Senate on impeachment. Not counting newly-minted Republican Jeff Van Drew, House Democrats had two No votes on articles of impeachment: Collin C. Peterson of Minnesota and Jared Golden of Maine, who only voted Yes for one of the articles. After months of seeing their members get targeted by Republicans for their Yes votes on impeachment, DCCC spokesperson Robyn Patterson said Romney made clear that impeaching President Trump was about the rule of law and not party loyalty.
JOHN DICKERSON: And we're back with Nebraska Republican Senator Ben Sasse. He's the author of a new book, Them: Why We Hate Each Other--and How To Heal. Welcome, Senator.
Biden participated in a conference call with Democratic Senators on Thursday where, according to senators on the call, Biden spoke about how he wants to work with everyone and understands the work of the senators, report CBS News Capitol Hill producer Alan He and CBS News associate producer Eleanor Watson. Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia told reporters there weren't many questions on the call but there were comments asking Biden to come to their state, and Manchin said that Senator Doug Jones of Alabama was appreciative of the effort and support Biden has put toward the state. Senator Chris Coons of Delaware told reporters Biden and the senators during the call spoke about current Senate races broadly with some incumbents speaking about their own races.
Just last week Vice President Biden warned the American people that President Trump could use the current crisis as an excuse to postpone the November election. Well, he now has a precedent thanks to New York state.
We were joined by the next first lady, Melania Trump. She'll be only the second foreign-born first lady. She's from Slovenia. John Quincy Adams' wife Louisa was the first.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you know if you have any of the cases of P1, the strain out of Brazil, or B1351 out of South Africa?
The average cost for single coverage was $6,435, with workers paying, on average, 18 percent of that cost, or $1,158. Again, employers subsidized the difference -- $5,277 per year.
What we're finding is that if more Americans find just how affordable insurance can be, more are signing up to get covered, Sebelius told reporters.
I don't think there was any accuracy in that, he said. This isn't a tough vote. This is a vote we promised America. This is living up to our promise to repeal and replace Obamacare which is failing minute by minute and day by day.
Mr. Trump has nominated 12 circuit court judges who have been successfully confirmed by the Senate, more than any other president since circuit courts were created in 1891. Barack Obama got three through the Senate in his first year. -- Gaby Ake
President Donald Trump: Excuse me. When they say Lock her up, it's not me. They say it. It starts, it-- it ends up being--
Speaker Pelsoi in Oval Office meeting: Mr. President, please don't characterize the strength I bring to this meeting as a leader of the House Democrats who just won a big victory…
And perhaps most pointedly, Team McConnell worked aggressively to counter Bannon's influence, mocking the strategist's support for controversial candidates, including Roy Moore in the Alabama special election, which cost Republicans the long-held Senate seat.
Perhaps someday in the future, there will be a magical moment when the countries of the world will get together to eliminate their nuclear weapons. Unfortunately, we are not there yet, sadly.
Republicans, however, have been steadfast in keeping up their opposition to Obamacare.
When the convention delegates voted on the Committee on Rules report, which outlines the rules for the convention, members of the Delegates Unbound movement called for a roll call vote--rather than a simple voice vote--on the rules. Shouts broke out in the convention hall, with pro-Trump delegates chanting their candidate's name and USA!
MARGARET BRENNAN: And we will be tracking that.
I like to think of myself as a very flexible person, Mr. Trump said during a meeting with King Abdullah II of Jordan.
JAMELLE BOUIE: And so if-- if-- if what you're doing is-- is saying, I'm for unrestrained capitalism and the people who wanted generous welfare state for socialism, then you might end up losing that branding game if-- if you insist that if's the-- the generous recognizable policies that are the bad thing.
MARGARET BRENNAN: And we'll be right back with a lot more FACE THE NATION. We hope you stay with us.
More broadly, there are also calls for Biden to outline how he plans to navigate his policy proposals through both a Senate that is unlikely to have a filibuster-proof Democratic majority and a conservative court that could challenge legislation.
Democrats' control of the House also means they will run all of the lower chamber's committees. From the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, to the House Ways and Means Committee, Democrats will control the agenda, the schedules, and what kind of investigations they pursue.
Well, as you know, I'm not gonna predict the outcome. But I said that we're certainly — there probably will be a report as a byproduct of his work. But we also are seeing if there are people who violated the law and should be brought to justice. And that's what we have our eye on.
Because Bernie Sanders believes in American democracy, he said. He believes in American elections. He believes in the fairness of the election process. And that's what this is all about.
Make America great again! he concluded his sales pitch. Engelskirchea is from Charlotte, North Carolina. His life now is all Trump all the time.
Emanuel replied that, while in some exchanges there have been very steep rises in premiums, we need to be accurate. The health care inflation rate has actually stabilized under the Affordable Care Act.
A judge must apply the law as written, she said Saturday at the White House. Judges are not policymakers, and they must be resolute in setting aside any policy views they might hold.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Are we misreading it to say, though, that it's a break from the President or is Congress essentially handing the White House diplomatic tool by saying, oh, look, you know, here is some leverage in your relationship to potentially force some change in Saudi Arabia?
Hours out from speech, Trump has yet to tweet Tuesday
Scott Pelley: What about Wall Street?
JOHN DICKERSON: Let-- let me switch to politics. A couple of weeks ago in the Senate people were writing about, hey, the Democrats have a chance. They are writing that less these days. What happened?
Is McCaskill too liberal for Missouri?
SEN. SCOTT: Look, let's focus on--
Lesley Stahl: You said the other day to suburban women, Will you please like me? Please, please--
The Rules and Bylaws Committee of the Democratic National Committee is meeting on May 12 to discuss what to do with delegates of states who have moved their primaries past the designated window in the party's rules. According to the rules, states must hold primaries by June 9, and all delegates must be elected by June 20. While states may request a waiver, it must be ultimately approved by the Rules and Bylaws Committee.
We have never in the history of our country been in a situation where an adversary, a foreign power, is working so hard to influence the outcome of the election. And believe me, they're not doing it to get me elected. They're doing it to try to influence the election for Donald Trump.
And what he has said about African-Americans and Latinos, about Muslims, about POWs, about immigrants, about people with disabilities, he's never apologized for. And so I do think that a lot of the tone and tenor that he has said — I'm proud of the campaign that Bernie Sanders and I ran. We ran a campaign based on issues, not insults. And he is supporting me 100 percent.
The audit on Trump's returns from 2002 to 2008, however, is complete, and Conway was asked about releasing those returns, too, on CNN.
SEN. BARRASSO: Well, there are a lot of things you need to do with border security. One is a physical barrier but also the technology, the manpower, the enforcement, all of those things, and our current laws are in some ways an incentive for people to come to this country illegally and they go through great risk and possibly great harm.
The district was mostly white for a large time, middle to upper-middle class. Now whites are less than half of the population. About one-third is Hispanic, 14 percent African-American and 11 percent Asian. While many areas in Texas outside of the cities are getting even redder, big cities are bluer, Murray said.
DeSantis fired back, saying Gillum wants to put Floridians into a government-run health care system that would decimate Medicare and private and employer-provided insurance programs.
We cannot continue to allow immigrants to come here illegally. And in this age of terrorism, we must not let in refugees whose intentions cannot be determined, she said. But she added that the U.S. should continue welcoming properly vetted legal immigrants, regardless of their race or religion.
The difference is that, while Republicans are clearly uncomfortable with Trump's behavior, it's not clear at all that Democrats or the liberal media feel the same way about excesses from their own side of the aisle. It's hard to take the New York Times' calls for civility seriously when they are literally running fantasy fiction about assassinating President Trump the day the pipe bomber is caught. Hillary Clinton's insults about the 60 million American deplorables are only criticized by Democrats for costing her votes, not for the disdain of her fellow citizens.
For some South Carolinians, Kasich's strong finish in New Hampshire is inspiring them to jump on board.
SEN. BARRASSO: Thanks for having me.
Consider a couple of examples: A hypothetical 45-year-old making $58,000 now gets no aid under the ACA. With the bill, they'd be entitled to a $1,250 tax credit, or 20% off their premiums, according to the Congressional Budget Office. A 64-year-old making $19,300 already gets generous subsidies that reduce premiums to $800 a year. But with the bill, that person would pay no premiums for a standard plan.
Donald Trump: I'm saying that they know the system right now, but we're going to phase that out. You have to phase it out.
But one day I will score.
MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be right back with the mayor of Miami, and former FDA Commissioner Doctor Scott Gottlieb.
However, if Handel wins, the deep divisions within the Democratic Party about which direction the party should go will surely be amplified. An Ossoff loss would hit Democrats hard, after his candidacy was fueled by so much cash and Democratic voter enthusiasm. And it would continue the party's winless streak in the 2017 special elections. The continuing battle between progressives and establishment Democrats would likely intensify. Even if Ossoff wins, that battle within the party will continue to rage, though it may be briefly tamped down as Democrats celebrate his victory.
JOHN DICKERSON: Help people understand what you mean by place.
Trump campaign spokesperson Tim Murtaugh doubled down on the president's expressed commitment to replace Obamacare on CNN on Wednesday night. Of course it's real, Murtaugh said. The senior campaign official offered no further details, adding, I'm not going to get ahead of the White House and their plans for the announcement.
When it comes to the ability of working Americans to retire, positions and policies that both parties' presidential nominees advocate could have a significant impact, considering that both candidates differ remarkably in key areas concerning retirement.
As U.S. consumer confidence hits a 15-year high, credit card debt is expected top $1 trillion in 2017, its highest point in more than a decade, according to a forecast from WalletHub. Total outstanding credit card debt was $978.9 billion as of the fourth quarter of 2016, up 7 percent from the previous year and approaching the $981.8 billion people had wracked up by 2007 before housing crash.
In 2010, the average unlawful immigrant household received around $24,721 in government benefits and services while paying some $10,334 in taxes, according to Robert Rector and Jason Richwine in their analysis for the Heritage Foundation.
Democrats are also pushing for employers to make retirement saving easier for the U.S. workforce.

SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: --if the pharmaceutical industry which made fifty-- the five major companies made fifty billion dollars in profits last year. They pay their CEOs outrageous compensation packages. If they don't like that, then we'll take a look at their patents. But you have people--
Lesley Stahl: --that you are not being more strongly encouraging about wearing masks--
Me? A liberal? he said. What is the Club for Growth and who are they supporting?...I had heard that they have a favored candidate, whoever that may be.
President Trump has been every bit as divisive as Candidate Trump. His response to the investigation into Russia's election interference? Fire the FBI director, James Comey.
Here are the four pillars of our plan: The first pillar of our framework generously offers a path to citizenship for 1.8 million illegal immigrants who were brought here by their parents at a young age. That covers almost three times more people than the previous administration covered. Under our plan, those who meet education and work requirements, and show good moral character, will be able to become full citizens of the United States over a 12-year period.
She opened her briefing by talking about the protesters, including some who were armed and entered the Capitol building, criticizing some of the attendees. Yesterday's scene at the Capitol was disturbing, to be quite honest, Whitmer said. Swastikas and Confederate flags, nooses and automatic rifles do not represent who we are as Michiganders. Whitmer declined to say whether she should remove her name from the list of potential vice presidential nominees, given the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. But she insisted, all of my focus is right here at home in Michigan. This is the only place I've ever called home. And this is the place where I always want to be.
The costs have gone up too much, she said. So we're going to really tackle that.
While there were plenty of accomplishments for the president to list, he rarely received a unanimously positive response from the congressional audience before him. Both Democrats and Republicans wholeheartedly applauded the president's assertion that the U.S. military remains the finest fighting force in the history of the world. Both parties were pleased with the president's announcement that Vice President Joe Biden will lead a new national effort to find the cure for cancer. Otherwise, the chamber remained divided.
Democratic White House hopefuls are seizing on health care as an issue, with some pushing for a government-run system that would cover all Americans and replace Obamacare.
MARGARET BRENNAN: You heard me ask Larry Kudlow about Republican senators' concerns about Huawei. You are a sitting senator, would you vote to ban American companies from doing business with them?
We are totally defending our Second Amendment, and have taken historic actions to protect religious liberty.
CHUCK SCHUMER: That is exactly right. You don't have the votes in the House.
MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be right back with a lot more FACE THE NATION. We'll look at this question of whether the Democratic front-runner should be disqualified from the race some alleging that. We'll talk about some of the problems Joe Biden may face. So stay with us.
There is no vacancy on the Supreme Court, but it is possible the next president will appoint at least one justice in years to come. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who has emerged as the high court's liberal icon in recent years, faces health challenges. The bench's longest serving member, Justice Clarence Thomas is 72. Justice Stephen Breyer turns 83, next week.

On the trail in New Hampshire Wednesday, Joe Biden called the latest results Iowa caucuses a gut punch and said, I'm not gonna sugarcoat it. CBS News campaign reporter Bo Erickson said Biden added, The whole process took a gut punch. He was referring to what is at this point his fourth-place finish in the first voting contest in 2020, which took place Monday.
MARGARET BRENNAN: The Washington Post quoted you this week in a story about Afghanistan, saying that back in 2010 you said to Richard Holbrooke, the then-envoy, I'm not sending my boy back there to risk his life on behalf of women's rights. It just won't work. Not what we're there for. Is that how you remember it?
Lesley Stahl: And asking for the president's tax returns?
Joe Biden's limp claim that he doesn't know anything about the railroading of Gen. Michael Flynn just got even more unbelievable, Trump Campaign Manager Brad Parscale wrote in a statement. Biden is listed among the Obama administration officials who requested the unmasking of Flynn. We already knew Biden was briefed on the Flynn case before President Trump took office and now we know that he wanted Flynn unmasked. Americans have a right to know the depth of Biden's involvement in the setup of Gen. Flynn to further the Russia collusion hoax.
He attributed the delay in its release to a further examination of the plan's legislative components to determine what can also be done unilaterally due to gridlock on Capitol Hill.
Americans love their country, and they deserve a government that shows them the same love and loyalty in return. For the last year, we have sought to restore the bonds of trust between our citizens and their government.
We can do anything we want.' And then you get bad reviews and then you think, 'Oh no, the whole world is falling apart.' But after time, you get used to the ups-and-downs. … It's far more enjoyable, because you get to realize what [the work's] true value is.
CEDRIC RICHMOND: Well, yes. And the key to it is making sure that we pass the American rescue plan so that we provide the school systems and local municipalities the ability to open schools safely. And we think that if we invest in the resources to make it safe, schools should reopen.
The company bioengineers bacteria to produce DNA and enzymes, the ingredients to generate RNA for the vaccine. Ginkgo's master stroke was to figure out how to manipulate bacteria to make more of those key ingredients - much more.
The district, which consists of Atlanta's northern suburbs, comprises parts of Cobb, DeKalb and Fulton counties.
Missing from that policy preview list was health care. The senior administration official declined to say whether that would be included in the president's address. After the GOP failed multiple times to repeal and replace Obamacare last year, Congress appears to be moving on to other matters.
We're going to do it; we're going to do it, the president said, though not with the vigor that marks his signature lines. He said he was determined to get the legislation passed in some form.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Now, vaccine tourism is also drawing people to Miami. I know you've tried to stop some of this and your governor has said to prioritize residents, but there was a Mexican TV star posting on social media last week that he flew into Miami, got a shot, and then flew back to Mexico. Rules are still being broken here. How are you going to discourage that from happening?
In her prime, at nearly 80, she's deploying everything she's got into keeping the House in Democratic hands, flipping the Senate and, above all, defeating the president.
I'm going to talk about the choices we have to make to set this country firmly on an even better, brighter course for decades to come, said Mr. Obama over the weekend about his address.
Indiana may be a red state, but we got Joe Donnelly, she said.
MARGARET BRENNAN: --perceived as a moderate from the Midwest. Do you feel, sometimes, that the rest of the party is- is- is leaving you behind? That it's--
During the campaign, candidate Trump said he would help America win again. Right now, more than half of Americans (55 percent) feel America is losing at the things it tries to do. Three in four Republicans see a country that is winning, but most Democrats and independents do not.
Donald Trump supported the invasion of Iraq. Howard Stern interviewed Donald Trump on Sept. 11, 2002, noted BuzzFeed, and he asked Trump, Are you for invading Iraq? Trump responded, Yeah, I guess so.
A little-known federal program started under President Obama has played a central role in the Trump administration's response to the coronavirus pandemic. The U.S. Digital Service has embedded technology experts throughout federal agencies, and they have been responsible for some of the country's most valuable data.
Even President Obama's former White House counsel Bob Bauer sees that. In a recent Atlantic article with the subtle title Don't Pack The Courts, Bauer supports the view of legal scholar Richard Pildes that President Franklin D. Roosevelt's court-packing proposal in 1937 was so wildly unpopular that it damaged the New Deal coalition beyond repair, drastically weakening Roosevelt's capacity in the following years to implement his domestic-reform program.
In a lengthy, wide-ranging and upbeat State of the Union address Tuesday night, President Trump called for bipartisanship even as he pushed an agenda sure to alienate his political opponents.
MARGARET BRENNAN: And I know your own campaign has had some reckoning with this as well in the past.
William Dougan, national president of the National Federation of Federal Employees, said to CBSNews.com that he doesn't expect House Republicans to really get the message of the severity of the shutdown until they hear from more constituents -- which may take more government services being denied.
There may not be a federal action to reopen the marketplaces, but 11 states and the District of Columbia have established an extended special health insurance enrollment window for those impacted by the coronavirus pandemic. The 11 states are California, Colorado, Connecticut, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Nevada, New York, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington. All these states control their own marketplaces.
SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: Look, you know, the-- the President is energizing a lot of Democratic voters to get out because he's been so polarizing and so divisive. I would say in a lot of our red states, what we have are Senators who are standing up first and foremost for the people of their states and people even in red states want someone who will hold the President accountable.
There are several options, not easy to sort through. Some have application deadlines; others do not. And the Trump administration, which still plans to ask the Supreme Court later this summer to declare Obamacare unconstitutional, is doing little to promote the health law's coverage. Here's a quick look:
The problem, meanwhile, has been compounded by the fact that many people have been unable or discouraged from shopping the new Obamacare marketplaces because of the significant technical problems with HealthCare.gov and some state-run Obamacare websites.
Conservatives are called racists for supporting immigration law, haters for defending their faith's long-standing views on sexuality and marriage, deplorables for not supporting President Obama's political agenda — and then they've waited (largely in vain) to see anything resembling similar treatment of politicians and pundits of the Left.
[Barack Obama: We talked about foreign policy, we talked about domestic policy.]
Even if Biden can swing the tax hikes, they aren't expected to kick in until 2024, Yaros said, to make sure that there's no fiscal drag, at all, on the economy in these next couple of years when we're still digging ourselves out of the pandemic.
MARGARET BRENNAN: The President's attorney Rudy Giuliani is defending his client and saying that Michael Cohen is just a liar, a serial liar. And he is pointing to the idea that there's no way he was ever loyal to President Trump since he surreptitiously recorded him.
John Hickenlooper John Hickenlooper joins crowded 2020 race 04:09 Biography Former Colorado Governor John Hickenlooper grew up outside of Philadelphia, the youngest of four children. He attended Wesleyan University and received a bachelor's in English and a master's degree in Geology. Hickenlooper followed an unusual route into politics, beginning his professional life as a geologist with Buckhorn Petroleum in the 1980s. But the oil bust in the mid-'80s cost him his job in 1986. There were no jobs to be had in the oil industry, so Hickenlooper went into the brewpub business, opening the Wynkoop Brewing Co. The brewery with 15 brewpubs and restaurants, was a success, and it made him a millionaire. In 2003, Hickenlooper ran for Mayor of Denver, in his first ever campaign. Considered a bit of a dark horse candidate who never ran a negative ad, he shocked many and won in a landslide. In 2010, Hickenlooper became the first Denver Mayor elected Governor in 120 years. He was re-elected in 2014, running on another entirely positive campaign Hickenlooper is the second governor or former governor to announce a Democratic presidential bid this cycle, following Washington Gov. Jay Inslee. Issues Finishing his second term in the statehouse, Hickenlooper was a popular, pro-business governor. He left Colorado with a strong economy and his tenure was marked by an emphasis on consensus-building. It's that record that he touted in h is campaign video.
Finally, no matter how many insurers participate in the exchanges, consumers can expect to see premium increases in 2017. Several insurers have set the stage for major price hikes in the wake of losses. One reason, explained Corlette, is that many insurers priced their plans too low when the exchanges started in 2014. For the first couple of years, insurers were blind in figuring out their pricing strategy because there was no data. It really was a guessing game.
Melania Trump: Well, there is a lot of responsibilities. And it's-- a lot of work needs to be done. And-- it's-- your-- stuff on your shoulders. And-- we will take care of it-- day by day. I will stay true to myself. I'm very strong and um-- tough and confident. And I will listen myself and I will do what is right and what feels to my heart.
With Democrats gaining two seats in the Senate from the Georgia runoffs, there is now a greater possibility of moving from relief to stimulus mode in late 2021.
MARGARET BRENNAN: And, Dan, it was your paper, The Washington Post, that reported Russia is attempting to help Sanders' presidential campaign as part of an effort to interfere with the Democratic contest. What is unusual is to have the national security adviser talk about this in a political context. And there was reaction to O'Brien commenting in this way. It's unusual for someone in that position to do so.
It's also worth nothing that Lamb's victory didn't happen in a vacuum. December's special election in Alabama saw that deep-south state send a liberal Democrat, Doug Jones, to the U.S. Senate. Before that, there was the Virginia election in November that, defying polls a bit, became a blue wave that replaced a number of venerable Republican state lawmakers with progressives.
Mr. Trump and Ryan already pushed to blaming Democrats, with Mr. Trump saying we had no Democrat support and Ryan saying that moving from opposition party to a governing party comes with growing pains.
President Donald Trump: We have done-- that's right because we're doing so much testing.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator, we'll be watching your campaign. Look forward to talking to you again sometime soon.
MARGARET BRENNAN: --I didn't say that.
And I think it is very important for us to make clear to our children that our country really is great because we're good. And we are going to respect one another, lift each other up. We are going to be looking for ways to celebrate our diversity, and we are going to try to reach out to every boy and girl, as well as every adult, to bring them in to working on behalf of our country.
RADDATZ: No, we can — no, Mr. Trump, we're going to go on. This is about the audience.
Clinton took aim at her Republican opponents, chiding them for their objections to the Supreme Court's rulings on both same-sex marriage and, earlier in the week, the Affordable Care Act.
The politics of racial hatred and religious bigotry practiced by the Klan and others have no place in this country, and are destructive of the values for which America has always stood… I firmly believe there is no room for partisanship on this question. Democrats and Republicans alike must be resolute in disassociating ourselves from any group or individual whose political philosophy consists only of racial or religious intolerance, whose arguments are supported only by intimidation or threats of violence.
SENATOR MARCO RUBIO: So it is true that arms sales gives us leverage.
It's unclear, however, how much of an emphasis the president will place on abortion rights issues — last week, Mr. Trump said he probably wouldn't bring up Roe v. Wade with candidates.
Internal Trump campaign polling shows the president is struggling in key states and is lagging behind former Vice President Joe Biden, the early Democratic front runner. Mr. Trump has insisted that polls showing that he is vulnerable are fake, fabricated by the media or some other entity, or simply don't exist.
During a media avail Wednesday, DCCC executive director Lucinda Guinn said the targeted districts will not overlap with any voter education efforts already being made by the Biden campaign or the Senate committee.
Pelosi and Mnuchin have been engaged in negotiations over another coronavirus relief measure for weeks, but hopes of a deal passing before the November 3 election have slipped away. Members of the House have been in their home districts for much of October, while the Senate adjourned Monday after voting to confirm Justice Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court. The Senate will next convene November 9, while the House will not hold votes until the week of November 16.
MARGARET BRENNAN: The State Department says--
At a Bloomberg Politics breakfast, however, RNC Chair Reince Priebus said he would probably fire Trump's speechwriter if the person had worked for him.
MARGARET BRENNAN: One of many. Fair. But President Trump- we'll get to that, but President Trump has appointed more federal appeals court judges to date than any recent president. He's not sitting around reading legal briefs. As you talked about, there's a list that was put in front of him of possible choices. You've been working with Mitch McConnell to really have this be a conveyor belt that has helped to confirm these in- in a high number. But do you worry that that kind of churn in this process can- can undermine faith that- that the court is above the political fray?
On his way to Ohio, Biden told reporters Barrett's Catholic faith shouldn't be a factor in Democrat senators' questioning this week.
Handel hasn't shunned Mr. Trump but she's hasn't exactly emphasized him in her campaign, either.
MARGARET BRENNAN: --hasn't been able to deter them from making that trip.
It's not about them. It's about us. It's about us — what we were, what we are and what we should be, McCain told Face the Nation in 2014. And that's a nation that does not engage in these kinds of violations of the fundamental basic human rights that we guaranteed when we declared our independence.
After years of wage stagnation, we are finally seeing rising wages. Unemployment claims have hit a 45-year low. African-American unemployment stands at the lowest rate ever recorded, and Hispanic American unemployment has also reached the lowest levels in history, he said.
Not many, replied Leader. Lots and lots of pollsters have said the numbers of undecided in this election are really very minimal.
Fifty-six senators voted to invoke cloture on Tillerson's confirmation, which limits debate on the nomination ahead of a final vote, while 43 senators voted against the motion.
Sondra Locke Warner Brothers Sondra Locke (May 28, 1944-November 3, 2018), whose passing was not publicized until several weeks after her death, grew up in Tennessee, where she worked at a radio station and appeared in a handful of plays before winning a nationwide talent search to be cast opposite Alan Arkin in the movie adaptation of Carson McCullers' The Heart is a Lonely Hunter. She won raves, and an Oscar nomination, for her debut film performance. She was best known for the six films she made with director and co-star Clint Eastwood (whom she dated for 13 years), starting with the Western The Outlaw Josey Wales (1976), and including The Gauntlet, Every Which Way But Loose, Any Which Way You Can, Bronco Billy, and the Dirty Harry movie Sudden Impact. Locke also played singer Rosemary Clooney in a 1982 TV biopic, and directed the 1986 film Ratboy, which flopped in the U.S., but was popular with critics in Europe. In 1997 she released her memoir, titled The Good, the Bad and the Very Ugly: A Hollywood Journey, an account of her tumultuous relationship with Eastwood (she would sue him for palimony, and then fraud), and her battle with breast cancer. She told the Associated Press at the time that the title (a play on one of Eastwood's films) was applicable to the story. I try to cover the good years as well as the bad and the ugly, Locke said.
Most Americans across party lines think fundamental changes are needed in the health care system, including about three in 10 who think there's so much wrong with it that it needs to be rebuilt completely. Asked who is responsible for what they dislike about the current system, six in 10 Republicans blame the Democrats for passing Obamacare in 2010, while nearly six in 10 Democrats blame the Republicans for making changes to Obamacare in 2017.
Jeff Zients fixed the bungled rollout of the Obamacare website in 2013. Now he's tasked with fixing this vaccine rollout. As part of the plan, the administration has opened seven of 18 mass FEMA vaccination sites, supported more than 400 smaller vaccine centers across the country and has approved distribution of vaccine through pharmacies, targeting under-served communities.
While many have argued that requiring colleges to have more accountability in graduating students is a positive reform, much of the preparation for college success needs to happen in high school and even middle school. Neither candidate has talked in depth about education reforms on that level, nor have they directly addressed how to lower the core costs of a public college education.
A $1 trillion coalition of global investors is urging McDonald's, Domino's and other fast-food chains to curb their use of poultry and meat raised on antibiotics, warning that overuse is increasing health risks by heightening resistance to the vital drugs.
Lesley Stahl: And that's what it was like. (LAUGH) And, you know, you have this--
McConnell told reporters on Tuesday most of the things we'll be doing will be on a bipartisan basis, but he did not elaborate on where President Trump still stood on pending immigration policies.
MARGARET BRENNAN: He said he couldn't do that.
RADDATZ: This tape is generating intense interest. In just 48 hours, it's become the single most talked about story of the entire 2016 election on Facebook, with millions and millions of people discussing it on the social network. As we said a moment ago, we do want to bring in questions from voters around country via social media, and our first stays on this topic. Jeff from Ohio asks on Facebook, Trump says the campaign has changed him. When did that happen? So, Mr. Trump, let me add to that. When you walked off that bus at age 59, were you a different man or did that behavior continue until just recently? And you have two minutes for this.
Take me back to my own home.
But people with solid middle-class incomes and upper earners who currently don't qualify for help would get assistance. Consumers could also contribute more money to tax-sheltered health savings accounts for out-of-pocket costs.
Lesley Stahl: Exactly.But do you think--
To make matters worse, you have no plan, you can't produce a document, you can't give us a detail, you're skirting the issues and all we are getting are talking points, said Democratic Representative Raul Ruiz of California.
The group's chief executive, Stephen Ubl, said in a statement that some Trump proposals could help patients afford their medicines, but others would disrupt coverage and limit patients' access to innovative treatments.
An April 2017 Pew Research Center report says the U.S. civilian workforce includes 8 million unauthorized immigrants, accounting for 5 percent of those who were working or were unemployed and looking for work, according to separate Pew Research Center estimates. With so many millions, the New York Times points out there's a range in which that's the case -- they are both taking the jobs nobody wants, as their defenders would have you believe, and they are taking American jobs and resources, as the White House and Republican hardliners believe. -- Katiana Krawchenko
Donald Trump: It's a great form of communication. Now, do I say I'll give it up entirely and throw out, that's a tremendous form-- I pick up-- I'm picking up now, I think I picked up yesterday 100,000 people. I'm not saying I love it, but it does get the word out. When you give me a bad story or when you give me an inaccurate story or when somebody other than you and another network, or whatever, 'cause of course, CBS would never do a thing like that right? I have a method of fighting back. That's very tough--
He added that the American people are pretty sensible, and I think they'll make a sensible choice in the end.
JOHN DICKERSON: Majority Leader Mitch McConnell made the case that the behavior of Democrats with respect to this confirmation was a shot in the arm for Republicans and that the President was, essentially, playing on that idea that Democrats overreached and that's what's energized a lot of these Republican voters.
FACT CHECK: True. Clips of Donald Trump talking about Muslims has appeared in jihadist propaganda. According to the Washington Post, a propaganda video from the al Qaeda affiliate al-Shabab does include footage of Trump talking last year about his plan to bar Muslims from entering the U.S.
Lauren Leader, co-founder and CEO of All In Together, a non-partisan voter education group, said, Women voters have been driving the election outcomes for the better part of the last 30 years.
MARGARET BRENNAN: I thought it was remarkable there to hear a Republican mayor criticize a Republican governor in saying we-- we need to actually be able to control what's happening in our own city and that not being allowed to happen. Are cities like Miami, places where they are seeing B117, this strain of the U.K. circulate. Are they really at risk of being overrun?
SENATOR RICK SCOTT: And I know a lot of people liked it-- liked the grand bargains. I personally don't believe in grand bargains. I believe in piece by piece fixing things.
It will be truly great HealthCare that will work for America. Also, Republicans will always support Pre-Existing Conditions. The Republican Party will be known as the Party of Great HealtCare (sic). Meantime, the USA is doing better than ever & is respected again! he added.
The new rules aren't a surprise. The Trump administration has been calling for the expansion of association health plans as a way of offering more options outside of Obamacare and a way for small businesses and individuals to have access to more affordable group insurance.
Degette was just one of many members to press or criticize Verma about the existence of a contingency plan.
Based on the polling, Evers seems to be the favorite among the Democratic candidates. He has been touting his ability to win a statewide election, which he has done three times. Mitchell, Vinehout and Roys could make history if elected governor. Mitchell would be the first black governor of Wisconsin, while either Vinehout or Roys would be the first female governor of Wisconsin. Roys received national attention for a campaign video that showed her breastfeeding and she has also received support from EMILY's List.
SEN. SANDERS: Well I think that's a decision for the vice president to make. I'm not sure that one incident alone disqualifies anybody, but her point is absolutely right. This is an issue not just the Democrats or Republicans, the entire country has got to take seriously. It is not acceptable that when a woman goes to work or is in any kind of environment that she feels anything less than comfortable and safe. And this is an issue the entire country has got to work on.
10:10 p.m. ET Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani delivered an impassioned speech about Trump and his record protecting and helping New York.
Of course they are — in part because they have no choice.
Separately, a company working with Mr. Trump's re-election campaign is defending a nearly $3 million loan it received from the federal coronavirus relief fund for small businesses, responding to criticism and a lawsuit accusing it of receiving preferential treatment. According to CBS News senior reporter Stephen Gandel and CBS News investigative reporter Graham Kates, Phunware was eligible for the low-interest loan through the Paycheck Protection Program, which is aimed at businesses with 500 or fewer workers. The digital data company said in a news release Monday that on March 27 it furloughed 34 full-time employees and three interns, leaving it with 54 full-time employees and one intern. Phunware's $2.85 million loan was nearly 14 times the current PPP average of $206,000.
As we rebuild America's strength and confidence at home, we are also restoring our strength and standing abroad.
And FACE THE NATION will be back in one minute, to talk with the governor of one of the states that has a strong record when it comes to vaccinating and in-person learning.
The Mississippi Strong PAC, backed by the Republican Governors' Association, has spent over $2.37 million to help Reeves. The Democratic Governors Association has pretty much spent an equal amount, with $2.36 million in disbursements for Hood.
I, you know, admire the rest of the field from Bernie [Sanders] to Elizabeth [Warren] to Kamala [Harris] who want, you know, Medicare for all... Biden said Saturday in Atkinson, New Hampshire, about his opponents' $3 trillion plans, I don't know why we'd get rid of what in fact was working and move to something totally new.
Braver said, Some people say there's a little too much swagger, you know that.
Hillary Clinton on Monday night explained the way she would at least partially expand access to Obamacare to undocumented immigrants.
JOE BIDEN: Look, you guys can do all the pontificating about what it means. I'm not going to-- that's not my job. My job is to go in and make the best case I can. And I think we're going to do well. I think we're going to go on to Super Tuesday and do very well.
The current deadline to request a vote-by-mail ballot is three days before election day, which creates a likelihood that voters will not receive their ballot on time, according to the fact sheet. Aaron Ockerman, the executive director of the Ohio Association of Election Officials, a bipartisan organization that represents the county boards of elections and their employees, told CBS News campaign reporter Jack Turman that the association is supportive of LaRose's proposals.
Advocates for low-income people say the problem isn't fraud, but a convoluted documentation system that leaves out hundreds of thousands of consumers legally entitled to benefits because their personal information may not exactly match what's in government files. About 12.7 million have signed up for coverage this year.

Joe Biden again on Wednesday tried to clarify his position on the possible effectiveness of a COVID-19 vaccine approved by the Trump administration. Last week he said he would take the vaccine tomorrow if deemed scientifically sound.
SEN. SANDERS: No. No- look, yes Trump has an idea on health care. His idea is to throw 32 million Americans off of the health insurance they have, doing away with insurance for kids who are 26 years of age or younger who are on their parent's plans, doing away with the protections that the ACA has for pre-existing conditions, Margaret. That means if you have cancer, you have heart disease, you have diabetes. If Trump gets his way the cost of health insurance for you will be so high that many people literally will not be able to afford it. Thousands of people will literally die. That's Trump's health insurance plan. My plan's just a little bit different. I think we should join the rest of the industrialized world. Guarantee health care to all people as a right. End the absurdity of the United States spending twice as much per capita on health care as any other nation while our life expectancy is actually going down and our health care outcomes are worse than many other countries. And by the way, we pay by far the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs. Margaret let me make a campaign promise to you and you can repeat this, play this tape over if I'm elected president. And that is, if I am elected president I'm going to cut prescription drug costs in this country by 50 percent so that we are not paying any more than other major countries are paying.
JOE BIDEN: Well, look, the people who occupy my office, maybe they were Russians. I don't know. But they-- they said they were Bernie supporters. The people who occupied other offices and the people who did these terrible things to the Culinary Workers and the women who run that operation, I-- I guess anything is possible, but they are identified as Bernie supporters. So I-- I'm not making any comment beyond that. But there should be absolute condemnation of the conduct of these folks who are engaging in that kind of behavior and the misogynistic behavior against the Culinary Workers and people coming into my office. The police had to-- this was back in-- in-- in, you know, the first two primaries and have to call the police to get them out of our office. I mean that-- that's Trump-like stuff. I mean this is not the stuff that we've done in Democratic primaries before.
MARGARET BRENNAN: A threat to shut parts of the southern border to stop the flow of illegal immigration from Mexico, and plans to slash aid to Central American countries for not doing more to reduce the flow of migrants to the U.S.
Her comments follow reports that Obamacare premiums are expected to drop next year, for the second year in a row.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, all of us would like to know a little bit more about exactly what's happening, but U.S. intelligence hasn't made any of this public yet. White House isn't shedding much light. But the bottom line seems to be that-
Should the health care law be found unconstitutional by the Supreme Court, those 20 million people buying health insurance on the individual market would almost certainly see ACA protections go away, including the following:
MARGARET BRENNAN: --start from scratch on a new health care law?
Married couple Marla Johnson, 61, and Marla Rigby, 66, from Prairie City, Iowa, said even though they are not innately familiar with the details of Warren's plans, they know she has them and trust her as knowledgeable. Similarly, a group of bandana-clad Des Moines University medical students agreed and said her focus on student loans could benefit the debt-saddled future doctors.
We have ended the war on American energy, and we have ended the war on beautiful clean coal. We are now very proudly an exporter of energy to the world.
President Trump also confirmed Wednesday another White House staff member has tested positive for coronavirus. It was one person, Mr. Trump announced in the briefing room. Not a person I was associated with. The president said he first learned of the positive case, last night, but did not reveal the identity of the staff member.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Anthony Salvanto breaking down the details. Thank you, Anthony. And we will hear from Anthony later in the broadcast as well. As the Nevada caucuses were going on yesterday, we spoke with former Vice President Joe Biden. He told us that he was confident about his prospects in South Carolina and beyond.
Scott Pelley: Who's gonna get a tax increase--
Just to be clear, you said this was your decision.
TRUMP: It is such a great question and it's maybe the question I get almost more than anything else, outside of defense. Obamacare is a disaster. You know it. We all know it. It's going up at numbers that nobody's ever seen worldwide. Nobody's ever seen numbers like this for health care.
Donald Trump: Well, there's been a lotta leaking, there's no question about that. But I would certainly like to talk to him. And see him. This is a tough time for him. And I would like to talk to him before I'd answer a question like that.
TRUMP: No, it hasn't. It hasn't. And it hasn't been finished at all.
Any Biden administration wins on issues like gun safety, climate change or voting rights are going to run head-long into a hostile court based on the 200-plus judges that Donald Trump has confirmed, Fallon explained.
Calls for gun control failed, and three years later, a white gunman prayed with nine black parishioners in Charleston, S.C., then shot them dead.
In terms of standing abroad, the 2018 edition of Edelman's annual trust barometer showed trust in the U.S. declining by 9 percentage points since their 2017 report, the steepest decline ever measured. By way of contrast, trust in China increased by the biggest proportion globally. -- Markham Nolan
Hiking drug prices in the rest of the world, however, will have little effect on Americans' prescription costs, health policy experts say.
During his second term, Inslee has been a frequent cable news critic of the president and, with the help of the state's attorney general, Bob Ferguson, has challenged some of the Trump administration's policies, including the travel ban, through high-profile lawsuits. In a campaign video focused on climate change, Inslee announced his White House bid on March 1. Issues Inslee will make climate change the top issue of his 2020 campaign, hoping to draw sharp contrasts with the environmental policies of Mr. Trump, who has repeatedly cast doubt on human-induced climate change, and even called it a Chinese hoax. He has been an ardent backer of sweeping federal action to mitigate the irreparable harm climate change is having on the global environment since his days in Congress. With most 2020 Democrats throwing their support for the audacious Green New Deal proposal introduced by New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Inslee's focus on climate change has the potential to gain traction among Democratic primary voters and prompt fellow contenders to discuss the issue even more during the nomination process. Inslee is also likely on the campaign trail to tout the growing economy in his deep-blue state, his role in the passage of a net neutrality bill and what he called the best paid family leave and one of the best minimum wages in the country. Controversy Inslee's tenures in Congress and as Washington's governor have largely been scandal-free.
Jason Kelly: And that's typical. But something like 10X or 50X. So ten or 50 times more-- would be what we'd try to hit.
Donald Trump: I am so saddened to hear that. And I say, Stop it. If it-- if it helps. I will say this, and I will say right to the cameras: Stop it.
Yes, he did, she said. When you say 'believe,' he certainly is taking it very seriously and digesting it and nobody looks at something that complicated in one sitting. So this will be ongoing.
The department has fielded reports about everyone from anarchists, to black separatists, to, you know, just regular Trump followers, anti-Trump followers. I mean, everybody has been, you know, in some way, shape, or form touted as coming to Cleveland to either cause trouble or to exercise their first amendment rights. But we're prepared for it all.
Falwell said that Trump has created jobs for thousands of people and is one of the greatest visionaries of our time. He added that Trump is a true patriot and the champion of the common man.
The policy also would allow some employers, though not publicly traded companies, to raise moral objections to covering contraceptives.
However, the president faced another legal defeat on the issue Thursday when a federal judge struck down the administration's push to allow health insurance plans outside the ACA that avoid the law's coverage requirements.
No one has a fax machine, Cleaver said. This means that they don't need to print and then mail. This seems like such a small thing but asking people to print and mail a form in 2020 is asking them to do something that is almost impossible.
I take classified materials very seriously and always have. When I was on the Senate Armed Services Committee, I was privy to a lot of classified material. Obviously, as secretary of state, I had some of the most important secrets that we possess, such as going after bin Laden. So I am very committed to taking classified information seriously. And as I said, there is no evidence that any classified information ended up in the wrong hands.
There are several ways for the Republican Party to evolve. The new firebrands who have captured the attention of the nation may be at the start of a conservative constitutional revolution in the party. Or they may be taking a party that is shrinking and driving it to an ever-narrower base of Tea Party loyalists that represent about a fifth of the country. Or, Washington is a sideshow and the Republicans in the states who actually have to accomplish something are where the real long-term energy in the party is. That was the message Jindal came to town to sell. It remains to be seen whether he or another pragmatic Republican governor can get back behind the steering wheel.
10:11 p.m. Donald Trump says he was against the war in Iraq, and that suggestions he was not have been debunked.
Donnelly was ranked as the most bipartisan Senate Democrat according to the Lugar Center and Georgetown University's McCourt School of Public Policy. He is marketing his bipartisanship in ads this cycle as well in an effort to appeal not only toDemocratic voters, but also to pro-Trump and independent voters. Last week, Donnelly released an ad titled Working, where he highlights his recent immigration stance by joining with President Trump to build a wall and protect our borders.
Bill Whitaker: When you came into office.
Since that awkward rebuffed handshake following Tuesday night's debate, we have not heard much from Senators Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren or their campaigns, note CBS News campaign reporters Cara Korte and Zak Hudak. Reporters caught Sanders on Capitol Hill this afternoon and asked what was said between he and Warren. Sanders joked, The weather.
Sanders has said before that an endorsement for Clinton would only be forthcoming if she adjusted her policy platforms on health care, education, and minimum wage -- though source close to the Clinton campaign told CBS News Thursday that Sanders would endorse Clinton at an event in New Hampshire next week.
But what the president doesn't mention is that since he took office, the number of deaths has continued to rise. From June 2016 to June 2017 the number of overdose deaths increased by 16 percent, to 66,817.
Mike Bloomberg: Yeah, sure. There's an election seven or so days later. There's another one 14 days later. There's a number of elections after that.
On Ohio Gov. John Kasich's decision not to attend, Manafort noted that it was embarrassing that he chose not to play an active role at the convention.
At the socialist publication Jacobin, leftist activists say the danger is so great that Democrats must pack the Supreme Court to protect it from the legacy of President Trump.
JAMELLE BOUIE: Right. And more pro-- pro-Palestinian, more willing to kind of question alliances the U.S. has with Saudi Arabia, with other authoritarian countries. And that I think may -- if, in fact, the domestic policy debate among Democrats is everyone is kind of on the same page, and that might be an issue that ends up shaping debates as the race goes on.
Even when she takes time to visit one of her 9 grandchildren, as she did recently with Bella and her mother Christine, Nancy's second, it's brief.
PAUL RYAN: You can't blame Donald Trump for the Senate Democrats shutting down the government. They shut down the government with no end game in sight. I frankly don't think they felt we were going to pass our bill. And when we passed our bill, funding children's health insurance, keeping the troops funded, preventing the medical device tax from- from kicking in in a few days which
MARGARET BRENNAN: --which is that our election process actually works. And undermining faith in the integrity of the election is a massive risk. I think, everyone can agree on that. What we have heard in the past few days, I think, is frankly confusing. And National Security Adviser Robert O'Brien said not just that he had not seen the underlying intelligence that Russia was intervening with a preference for Trump, but also that he had never received a briefing to that effect. He also told us-- told us in our interview that the FBI did tell him that Russia was interviewing-- intervening to help Sanders. This morning Trump says he was never told that. What should Americans at home understand from this? Because bottom line isn't the national security adviser's job to say, our elections will be protected no matter who is interfering and no matter whom they are interfering on behalf of?
Barrett is expected to jump right into the fray, and was greeted on her first day on the job with a petition from the Board of Elections in Luzerne County, Pennsylvania, to recuse herself from consideration of a case involving the state's deadline for mail-in ballots.
I think we've sadly stigmatized the issue of mental health and so, so many people experience it every day, said Harris. I know enough to know that almost everyone here has experienced this with someone you know, work with, or love. CBS News campaign reporter LaCrai Mitchell says one of the key points of Harris' plan is to focus on vulnerable populations, which would include doubling U.S. Departments of Defense and Veterans Affairs research dollars to address and treat PTSD, military sexual trauma, and traumatic brain injury.
MARGARET BRENNAN: --they are not actually his supporters. Do you buy that?
DOJ shifts position, says Obamacare is unconstitutional The Trump administration failed to get Congress to throw out Obamacare. Now it's turning to the courts. In legal papers filed Monday, the Justice Department argues for the first time that the entire Affordable Care Act is unconstitutional. Paula Reid reports.
But Dan Scavino, the president's social media director, did tweet this of the president as he was about to run through the speech.
The Democratic base has certainly rendered its verdict. In the latest Gallup poll, Donald Trump's approval rating among Democrats is seven percent. As in single digits. It's never been above 13 percent among Democrats at any point during his presidency.
It is true that of the 22 million jobs lost since February, 11.4 million have been restored. Yet, unemployment claims are running at historically high levels. But the president sees the economy as his strongest suit.
Leader said, The fact is that American suburbs are now extraordinarily diverse – over 30 percent women, people of color, live in American suburbs.
It's clear the American people simply can't trust this White House, he said. The only way to fully protect the American people is to scrap this law once and for all. There is no way to fix this.
8:49 p.m. ET Trump spoke to Fox News' Bill O'Reilly and said that Black Lives Matter is calling for death to the police and suggested that he will have the group investigated.
White House spokeswoman Amy Brundage added, These piecemeal efforts are not serious, and they are no way to run a government.
JOE BIDEN: Well I-- I was told that-- that the-- there are a lot of bots on Facebook and they've been all taken down. And so there were--
The pro-Second Amendment protest was poorly attended, and in the wake of the Baton Rouge police shooting, Stephen Loomis of the Cleveland Police Patrolmen's Association called on Ohio Gov. John Kasich to temporarily suspend open carry laws in the protest area. (Kasich's office replied that it did not have the authority to do so.)
Paula Reid, CBS News correspondent, and Trevor Potter, president of the Campaign Legal Center
CBS News campaign reporter Nicole Sganga says the president also remarked that keeping the country on economic shutdown is not sustainable, calling the coronavirus pandemic, the worst attack we've ever had. Trump continued, This is worse than Pearl Harbor. This is worse than the World Trade Center. There's never been an attack like this. And it should have never happened.
Of some 28 million uninsured Americans before the pandemic, the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation estimates, more than 16 million were eligible for some form of subsidized coverage through the health law.
This is our New American Moment. There has never been a better time to start living the American dream.

So I'm just trying to piece together the information that I need to show here's what really happened, Kiely said.
Hillary Clinton celebrated the Supreme Court's ruling on same-sex marriage Friday evening at a Virginia Democratic Party fundraiser that may as well have been a Clinton campaign rally.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Is there wiggle room on that five billion?
Lesley Stahl: Ivanka, you said that your father's changed in the campaign. How has he changed?
MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we know the White House said this week that they will boost supply about sixteen percent, give you three weeks' notice of what you're about to get instead of just the one week that you were getting under the prior administration. But then I saw that two health systems in your state have been canceling appointments for shots in arms for the coming week. So I'm wondering is there still a problem with federal supply?
Senate Democrats have made the Obamacare case an integral part of their campaign against the nomination of Barrett, a judge on the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.
It's got to be an open convention, he told Schieffer. And gee we haven't had one. We sort of had an open convention back in 1976, probably didn't have a full-blown one until back in the fifties. And so no one knows what it's going to be like. Is there a path for Newt to win? Absolutely.
Lesley Stahl: --and they, then there are plots and threats, and the same with Dr.--
I have to be honest, I've never liked him much. Hasn't been for me. I really probably never will, Mr. Trump said.
I'm disgusted by all of it, said Laurie Bernstein, one voter.
President Obama's main focus, says his spokesman, are the opportunities he wants to pursue in the time before he has to escort his successor to the 2017 inauguration.
President Donald Trump: Well, we're gonna have to see what happens. I think-- I hope that they end it. It'll be so good if they end it--
MARGARET BRENNAN: And just quickly to clarify, the President says the FBI broke into his office, I believe Michael Cohen said that it was an okay transaction with the FBI something he consented to.
This weak plan abandons the millions of hard-working families struggling with the crisis of surging drug prices, said Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi, in a statement.
Much of Tuesday was spent with the two parties trading barbs about who was responsible for a shutdown. No one seemed to stray from their respective positions: Senate Democrats refuse to consider anything other than a spending bill with no extra measures attached, and House Republicans are seeking last-minute negotiations that could offer a chance to chip away at the health care law.
The stay-in-session strategy can also be seen as payback to Democrats, who often force several days of procedural steps to delay final votes on Trump-backed nominees or legislative priorities.
Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer commented on speculation that she is being considered as Democratic presumptive nominee Joe Biden's potential running mate, according to CBS News campaign reporter Jack Turman. Asked on the Today show if she is being vetted by the Biden campaign, Whitmer responded that she has had a conversation with some folks, but added that she is focused on leading Michigan through the coronavirus pandemic. It was just an opening conversation and it's not something that I would call a professional, you know, formalized vetting, Whitmer later added. This is the most direct answer Whitmer has given to a question about being a vice presidential contender. Whitmer has been asked repeatedly about vice presidential speculation in the last month but has typically only responded that her energy is dedicated to handling the current crisis. Whitmer, one of the national co-chairs for Biden's campaign, recently participated in a virtual roundtable hosted by the Biden campaign with Connecticut Governor Ned Lamont and New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy.
Warren sits in Macomb County, home to many white working class voters who backed President Trump in 2016. But while Mr. Trump won the county by 11.5 points in 2016, Michigan's Democratic Governor Gretchen Whitmer won the county by 3.5 points during her 2018 election. Winning in Macomb County, which is considered the home of Reagan Democrats, has often been predictive of statewide success. Since 2006, every gubernatorial candidate and presidential candidate who has won statewide carried Macomb County. That's four wins for Democrats and three wins for Republicans in the past seven statewide elections.
The outcome in the latest chapter in the longstanding battle over Mr. Trump's border wall awards Mr. Trump with $1.4 billion for new barriers — equal to last year's appropriation — while preserving Mr. Trump's ability to use his budget powers to tap other accounts for several times that amount. That's a blow for liberal opponents of the wall but an acceptable trade-off for pragmatic-minded Democrats who wanted to gain $27 billion in increases for domestic programs and avert the threat of simply funding the government on autopilot.
REPRESENTATIVE NANCY PELOSI: The enemy is within the House of Representatives.
Right now, roughly 30 House Republicans are driving the bus in Washington. Along with Sen. Ted Cruz, they have been the titanium backbone, as Rep. Marsha Blackburn likes to call it, in the effort to defund Obamacare. They have stood their ground and helped bring the government to a halt. This is either an act of lunacy or a shining example of standing for conservative principle.
SENATOR BEN SASSE: There's a lot that's going on that's acute in the last two years, but I think what we're really struggling with is decades in the coming. We're living through a digital revolution which is undermining place. I think the biggest problem in America right now is loneliness. And the good news is it's fixable, but it requires friendship. It requires more attention to place and family and shared vocation and work and neighborhood and worshipping communities.
Vice President Mike Pence: I think they should adhere to whatever criteria the school administrators and local health officials determine to be appropriate. But really, again, I wanna say, the American Academy of Pediatricians made it clear early on that distance learning, this online learning, is no substitute for being in the classroom.
This time last year, the two men were barely on speaking terms. Mr. Trump bashed the GOP leader on Twitter after the collapse of Republican efforts to repeal President Barack Obama's health care law. McConnell said Mr. Trump had excessive expectations for what was possible. The phone lines between them went quiet for days.
Donald Trump: That's only because they don't know me. I really believe that's only because--
PAUL RYAN: Am I going to be Speaker? Yes, if we keep the majority, then-- then the Republican Speaker. You're asking me if I'm going to run for reelection? That's a decision my wife and I always make each and every term when we have filing in Wisconsin late in spring. And I haven't-- I'm not going to share-- share my thinking with you before I even talk to my wife.
In 2005, Cruz's depression came to a head when, according to a New York Times report, a police officer in Austin found her sitting on the side of a highway, head buried in her hands.
Our nation must be governed not from chaos but from opportunity. Not by wallowing over what's wrong, but by marching inexorably toward what's right, she added.
SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: And by the way, let me challenge President Trump to do the same. Trust me, we do not have investments in Russia or Saudi Arabia or any place else. Yes, we will be releasing them.
Gillum said he isn't a subject of the FBI probe.
Nancy Pelosi is the most powerful woman in American political history. She's been speaker of the House not once, but twice. And President George W. Bush's nickname for her was 3 because of her place in line for the presidency.
On December 2, the justices are set to consider a showdown between the Justice Department and House Democrats over the disclosure of secret grand-jury materials from Mueller's investigation, which concluded last year.
Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wisconsin, is a new addition, and actor Scott Baio will also be speaking. CBS News' Sean Gallitz confirmed that Johnson was personally invited to speak by Reince Priebus, first reported by Politico. Johnson's topic is national security, and he'll only be at the convention on Tuesday -- the day he's speaking -- so that he can go home and campaign for his reelection.
Similarly, the administration isn't tracking how many enrollees have begun paying premiums yet.
I learned in 2012 running with Mitt Romney if you wait until after the convention to all of a sudden get your act together and then produce an agenda in say August or September, it's too late, the Wisconsin Republican said in an interview on CBS This Morning.
A health policy expert with a business organization that represents large employers said he doubted there would be much of an impact on major companies, which are better able to pool risk and have long been accustomed to covering all employees regardless of health issues.
Lesley Stahl: They're talking about a fence in the Republican Congress, would you accept a fence?
I will bring our energy companies back. They'll be able to compete. They'll make money. They'll pay off our national debt. They'll pay off our tremendous budget deficits, which are tremendous. But we are putting our energy companies out of business. We have to bring back our workers.
ED O'KEEFE: Sanders also likely to dominate the money race when-- when fund-raising totals come in starting tomorrow.
In the debate over how to best ensure optimal healthcare for Americans, former Vice President Joe Biden is rooted on not allowing the Affordable Care Act (ACA) to be whittled away in the courts by the Trump Administration. Biden instead wants the signature legislative achievement of the Obama Administration to stay in place.
Judge sides with House Republicans in Obamacare suit
Connecticut GOP Chair J.R. Romano has asked congressional candidate Robert Hyde to end his campaign. The move came after Hyde's name and messages were unveiled in some new documents released by the House Intelligence Committee, reports CBS News broadcast associate Aaron Navarro.
Washington — In her first appearance before a Democratic-led House committee, Seema Verma, the head of the agency that oversees the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, spent hours dodging questions about the current and future state of the U.S. health care system.
Still, in the end, if the election is tight, an ad that doesn't win new hearts may still be successful if it enflames hearts already won.
The new online tool available at voteamerica.com allows voters to check their voter registration status and apply for an absentee ballot. Cleaver explained that voter registration tools are much easier because every state except Wyoming and New Hampshire will accept the same form. But registering to vote-by-mail is a bit more complicated, Cleaver said, because it's all state and election specific. Cleaver said her organization's new tool gives voters who want a mail-in ballot the right form and it also gives you the right mailing address. There are 10,000 mailing addresses and it is so much more complicated than voter registration.
JOE BIDEN: I'm a candidate. And I just-- I'm going to tell you, I'm going to go all the way through this thing.
CLINTON: Now, maybe because he has praised Putin, maybe because he says he agrees with a lot of what Putin wants to do, maybe because he wants to do business in Moscow, I don't know the reasons. But we deserve answers. And we should demand that Donald release all of his tax returns so that people can see what are the entanglements and the financial relationships that he has...
Booker also plans to reform the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program by increasing funding by 40 percent and requiring that states use the funds to help provide educational and skill based opportunities for parents receiving TANF benefits.
Obama's response: The same time everybody else learned it -- through news reports.
He said Democrats are interested in gaining power and control over the American people by growing the federal government.
MARGARET BRENNAN: He's describing himself as kind of powerless.
COOPER: Mr. Trump, let me follow up on this. TRUMP: Well, I just want — just one thing. First of all, Hillary, everything's broken about it. Everything. Number two, Bernie Sanders said that Hillary Clinton has very bad judgment. This is a perfect example of it, trying to save Obamacare, which is a disaster.
About two hundred miles southwest, demonstrations raged into the night Tuesday outside Madison's state capitol as protesters smashed in statehouse windows, attacked a state senator and tore down two long-standing statues. Since the death of George Floyd in police custody, both cities and protesters have been taking down confederate statues nationwide. A new Marquette University Law School poll released on Wednesday reveals a majority of registered voters in the poll disapprove of Trump's handling of nationwide protests after the death of George Floyd in police custody (58%), his handling of the coronavirus pandemic (52%) and his job performance overall (51%).The survey shows presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden leading Mr. Trump in the state 49% to 41%, a jump from his three-point lead last month.
The question remains, why can't big insurers make Obamacare work? One important reason: Not enough healthy people sign up.
Incumbent Republican Rep. Don Young is running for reelection in Alaska's one at-large House seat. On the Democratic side, candidate Carol Hafner is running in the Democratic primary. She is garnering the most attention because she doesn't live in Alaska and has never been to the state, but filed to run. She is campaigning for the seat online against challengers Dimitri Shein and Alyse Gavin. Gavin is well-known for her work in advocating for more education funding. Shein is an advocate for a single payer Medicare-for-All health care system.
MANUEL BOJORQUEZ: Another challenge facing states, getting students back in the classroom. A CDC report found schools are low risk for widespread transmission, provided mask and distancing guidelines are followed. But there is a clash between the teachers' union and the City of Chicago over a planned return to in-person learning tomorrow. In Denver, it's already started.
COOPER: We have to move on.
It was heavy. Filled with executive orders, congressional initiatives, but no comprehensive health plan.
Newly declassified footnotes in the Horowitz report suggest that the Steele dossier was likely the product of Russian disinformation. And there were multiple warnings to the FBI at that time, yet they continued to use that. How do you explain that?
Lesley Stahl: Well, tell me then about these rallies you've been having--
You're going to see how he's taking care of people who, you know, he just meets them, you know, through newspaper stories he read about and has that sense of community, a sense of philanthropy, Manafort said. So you're going to get a broader perspective of the man.
President Trump is kicking off his reelection campaign next week with a rally in Orlando, but Democrats are looking to steal his spotlight with their own event, part of a broader Democratic messaging strategy to counter-program Mr. Trump's reelection launch.
SCGOP Chairman Drew McKissick says no former lobbyist who supports policies like impeaching President Trump, the Green New Deal, and socialized healthcare is going to beat Senator Graham. However during a campaign kick-off event earlier this week, CBS News campaign reporter LaCrai Mitchell says Harrison had a message for dubious voters. When I travel around the state people say that they're pulling for us, but they don't know if we can win in a red state, said Harrison. We represent a new South that is bold, that's inclusive, that's diverse, and powerful [and] my friends, that new South is rising and it's time to let them hear our voices.
Dr. Travis Gayles: Extremely frustrated and exhausted.
U.S. Democratic Senate Candidate Mike Espy attended a demonstration Thursday at the Mississippi State Capitol urging the State Legislature to take the Confederate Flag out of the Mississippi state flag, reports CBS News political unit associate producer Eleanor Watson. It an ugly symbol, meaning it harkens back to an ugly time when people owned other people, Espy said, The flag is a divisive symbol and symbols should be unifying. Espy joined religious leaders Thursday in Jackson to pressure lawmakers to take action before they wrap up the 2020 legislative session on Friday. Espy is also again campaigning against GOP Senator Cindy Hyde-Smith in November. Espy lost a Special Election runoff to Hyde-Smith in 2018.
The seat has been in Republican hands since Newt Gingrich won in 1978. Johnny Isakson, now a senator, replaced him in 1999, and Tom Price replaced Isakson in 2005.
Georgia Democratic Senate candidate Raphael Warnock launched his third TV ad of the cycle on Wednesday, recounting a childhood experience with racism in his hometown of Savannah. CBS News campaign reporter LaCrai Mitchell reports that in the 30-second ad titled Store, Warnock says he'll fight for the vulnerable if elected.
Pelosi also indicated there is disagreement between Democrats and the White House on six issues: funding for state and local governments; funding for schools; child care; the earned income and child tax credits; unemployment benefits; OSHA and liability.
7:55 p.m. ET Jerry Falwell, Jr., the president of Liberty University, said his father stood at the Republican National Convention in 1984, to deliver the open prayer as Ronald Reagan accepted the nomination.
MARGARET BRENNAN: --of the Senate Judiciary Committee that ran these hearings.
MAN #1: Grandmas and grandpas, non-English speakers, how are you supposed to use that complicated website?
If Congress doesn't pass new funding by Friday night, the government will shut down early Saturday morning. So far, the House passed a short-term spending bill Thursday night, but the bill lacks enough votes to pass in the Senate.
Our Justice Department, where our husband goes on to the back of a airplane for 39 minutes, talks to the attorney general days before a ruling is going to be made on her case. But for you to say that there was nothing wrong with you deleting 39,000 e-mails, again, you should be ashamed of yourself. What you did — and this is after getting a subpoena from the United States Congress.
The drug industry's top lobbying arm, Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, spent nearly $26 million to sway federal decision makers last year, according to records tallied by Center for Responsive Politics. The annual total was the group's highest since the 2009 congressional fight that led to Obamacare.
As expected, the president also called for a massive infrastructure package, which he said he hopes will attract bipartisan support.
On Wednesday, Biden was endorsed by the Human Rights Campaign saying his dedication to advancing LGBTQ equality, even when it was unpopular to do so, has pushed our country and our movement forward.
Joe Biden 2020: Former VP runs for president 03:25 Behind Joe Biden's search for a running mate 02:04 More Democratic candidates jumped into the presidential race in 2019 than America has seen since the inception of the modern primary system. Here's a look at all the Democrats who campaigned for a chance to take on President Trump in November 2020.
SEN. SCOTT: Well first off, I'm going to make- I- I think it's first off it's very important that we make sure that people have a pre-existing condition can get in- can get a health care plan. Getting the health care plan that they can afford and I- and I want to work on that with other senators to make sure that happens. We talked about it at the Budget Committee last week and everybody was supportive of that. I want to make sure individuals can stay on their parent's plans. But- but this idea of taking- the government taking over health care and running all of health care has never worked. It's not going to work. We're going- we're going to ruin the entire system. Let's focus on the problem we have. The problem is not access, the problem is the cost of health care and the unbelievable inflation we've seen. Let's start with drug prices. Why are drug prices going up the way they have?
Dick Cheney Urged to Run for President at CPAC
When Cruz first moved to Texas to be with her then-solicitor general husband, she struggled with a bout of depression.
They are really mad. In fact, they're hopping mad about prescription drug price increases. They are frustrated at the idea that protections for pre-existing conditions and the other consumer protections that are in the law now are in jeopardy, McCaskill said.
10:05 p.m. The president said that the immigration plan will also support our response to the terrible crisis of opioid and drug addiction.
The shift in the administration's policy, should it prevail in court, could put millions of American's health care coverage at risk and deliver on a signature campaign promise made by Mr. Trump. The Justice Department says that it now agrees with a lower court ruling out of Texas that declared the entire health care law invalid. That ruling came a year after the GOP's tax bill repealed the ACA's tax penalties for people are are uninsured. The judge in the Texas case ruled the provision was so central to the law, it couldn't stand without it.
BEN DOMENECH: We're still operating under the same sort of regime that was put in place after 9/11. Congress has kicked the can on this issue time and again. And I do think it's-- it's significant, it is symbolic but it is significant. But I-- I think it needs to lead to more steps in order to actually have any real power, otherwise this is just sort of Congress saying, yes, we're still here and-- and pretending as if-- I mean, time and again Congress likes to cede its power over an issue to the administrative branch then complain about it, because it's-- it's a lot easier to do that than to make hard choices.
In a podcast interview with supporter Dan Bongino Friday, the president expressed sympathy for the former vice president, noting he too has been accused of sexual assault.
SEN. SCOTT: First off, it's very important to me that people get health care. I- I will only support something where people have access to health care, but it's got to be at a price they can afford.
Donald Trump: I wanna do the job. We have some great generals. We have great generals.
Cruz spoke about the shooting in Dallas and the terrorist attack in Orlando.
As tourism surges in Iceland, many visitors don't realize a large volcano is due to erupt. Scientists predict when Katla blows, it will create a flash flood that could wipe out everything in its path.
MARGARET BRENNAN: You were in office obviously in 2016--
I'm very concerned about doing anything that's going to tinker too much with Medicare. I protect the senior citizens, Trump said. I think Paul Ryan is too far out front with this issue.
In dissent, Justice Samuel Alito wrote that the court's decision has the effect of providing a massive bailout for insurance companies that took a calculated risk and lost. These companies chose to participate in an Affordable Care Act program that they thought would be profitable.
Biden is set to travel to his native Scranton, Pennsylvania on Thursday for a television town hall. On Wednesday--with his travel much closer to home--his remarks started almost 83 minutes behind schedule.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Since that time, a bipartisan Senate Intelligence Committee finding faulted the Obama administration for its response and said that the actions taken undermined public confidence in the election and allowed for further Russian interference. Do you agree with these findings--
PAUL RYAN: They don't get paid--
And I was making the point that it is hard sometimes to get the Congress to do what you want to do and you have to keep working at it. And, yes, President Lincoln was trying to convince some people, he used some arguments, convincing other people, he used other arguments. That was a great — I thought a great display of presidential leadership.
Mike Bloomberg: Wall Street does not do well with uncertainty. And it's-- the worst thing is nobody knows how bad this is going to get. I can just tell you, in my company, we're splitting in all our big offices into two different buildings, even if it's just a temporary thing. If this flu does strike, and strikes our employees, it won't strike all of them, because we have to continue to provide a service.
Trump calls on Congress to reexamine the Iranian nuclear deal
Romney also accused the president of cutting a special and certainly unconstitutional deal with the unions in his health care deliberations.
And when you talk to Larry Kudlow and he talked about the patriotism of our farmers, I'm in a very heavy ag state. Iowa, my neighbor is a heavy ag state, North Dakota. I've talked to farmers in those areas and what they tell me is, they're not going to get that soybean market back in one year because that market has gone to farmers in other countries. And so that's why there's an urgency to this when we have an 891 billion dollar trade deficit, which is the worst that we've seen. You can't just keep talking about it. You actually have to get it done.
Are the actions you're taking today bigger than the Flynn case?
She closed the speech by promising that Republicans will stand up for our beliefs and offered a laundry list of things that a GOP president would do if elected to the White House: lower taxes, stop runaway spending and debt, encourage American innovation, reform education, end and replace Obamacare, respect differences in modern families while insisting on respect for religious families, recognizing the importance of the Constitution, strengthening the military, and making agreements that are celebrated in Israel and protested in Iran, not the other way around.
TRUMP STATEMENT: When I look at the Iran deal and how bad it is for us, it's a one-sided transaction where we're giving back $150 billion dollars to a terrorist state.
A month before the end of Obamacare's open enrollment period, 4.2 million Americans - 25 percent of whom were between the ages of 18 and 34 - signed up for coverage through the new health care marketplaces, Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius announced Tuesday. The numbers lag behind the administration's original hopes for the program, but officials said the administration expects millions more to sign up before the March 31 deadline.
Like UnitedHealth, Aetna's latest earnings beat analyst expectations, even though net income dropped 7 percent. The company also boosted profit projections for the full year. In the call Bertolini said Aetna also is on track to close its merger with rival insurer Humana in the second half, pending approval in only six more states. Humana will report first quarter earnings May 4.
The legislation would forestall a government shutdown this weekend and give Mr. Trump steady funding for his U.S.-Mexico border fence. The year-end package is anchored by a $1.4 trillion spending measure that caps a difficult, months-long battle over spending priorities.
Oh, we had some great bouts there, and yet I remember one time we had a huge fight that two freshmen had begun and we drove them from the floor and afterwards, we were walking off the floor and he put his arm around me and he said, 'We really did a good one that time, didn't we, John?' McCain recalled in 2015.
During the 2016 campaign, every time it appeared Trump's campaign fortunes were about to collapse, he was able to turn the conversation to the Washington political class and his argument that they weren't getting the job done for the American people. It would be just enough to keep him in the race and eventually win an Electoral College victory.
And when you talk to Larry Kudlow and he talked about the patriotism of our farmers, I'm in a very heavy ag state. Iowa, my neighbor is a heavy ag state, North Dakota. I've talked to farmers in those areas and what they tell me is, they're not going to get that soybean market back in one year because that market has gone to farmers in other countries. And so that's why there's an urgency to this when we have an 891 billion dollar trade deficit, which is the worst that we've seen. You can't just keep talking about it. You actually have to get it done.
The convention theme for Monday is Make America Safe Again and will highlight the party's counterterrorism and immigration platforms as they relate to national security.
10:46 p.m. Hillary Clinton claims her rival's tax plan will give corporations and the wealthiest Americans the largest tax breaks they've ever had.
A: Obama's law could not hold down premiums, and whether the GOP can succeed remains to be seen.
You sound like a liberal, said Braver.
The State of the Union address starts at 9 p.m. ET, CBS News live coverage starts at 5 p.m.
MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to read a statement from the vice president who said, it- it's a lengthy one but in just part of it he says, In my many years on the campaign trail and in public life, I've offered countless handshakes, hugs, expressions of affection, support and comfort and not once, never did I believe I acted inappropriately. If it is suggested I did so, I will listen respectfully but it was never my intention. That's a general denial, but Ms. Flores was on CNN this morning, senator and she said that really this needs to be taken more seriously as a party, suggesting that Democrats aren't taking it seriously enough. And she said she's coming forth--
ELIZABETH PALMER: --as South Africa battles a dangerous new virus variant that sent deaths rocketing up. The fact is ninety-five percent of the vaccines on Earth have so far gone to the ten richest countries. For life to return to normal, that's going to have to change, warns the WHO.
JOHN DICKERSON: Where do you think the state of that revolt is and what are the possible range of actions Congress could take?
Instead, the new budget deal and last year's tax cuts herald the return of trillion dollar-plus deficits. Last year, Trump's budget predicted a $526 billion budget deficit for the 2019 fiscal year starting Oct. 1; instead, it's set to easily exceed $1 trillion once the cost of the new spending pact and the tax cuts are added to Congressional Budget Office projections.
In a response, Hyde said Romano should resign from the @CTGOP ASAP. Never did anything but rig elections including his own and was a staunch advocate against @realDonaldTrump and still is. Romano had previously criticized Hyde for his crude, now-deleted tweets about Senator Kamala Harris.
STEPHEN MILLER: We're going to do whatever is necessary to build the border wall to stop this ongoing crisis of illegal immigration--
So, yes, this is who Donald Trump is. But it's not only women, and it's not only this video that raises questions about his fitness to be our president, because he has also targeted immigrants, African- Americans, Latinos, people with disabilities, POWs, Muslims, and so many others.
Speaker Nancy Pelosi: No, people do. People do. It-- it is--
Lesley Stahl: You have complained, I'm quoting you, President Trump h-- is engaged in an unconstitutional assault on the Constitution.
While the ad will reach voters across Iowa, the campaign says it will specifically focus on new parents, and it will target voters who are engaging with products designed for newborns.
CEDRIC RICHMOND: Look, the other people want to argue process. We want to argue purpose in moving this country forward. And President Biden is very clear and he said it in his inaugural, we face deep challenges and we're going to meet the moment and we're not going to leave anybody behind. That's the whole purpose of building back better. We're not going to leave --
Nationally, the public remains divided on Obamacare. However, voters who went to the polls believe the Democratic Party will do a better job protecting coverage for pre-existing conditions.
These reforms will also support our response to the terrible crisis of opioid and drug addiction. Never before has it been like it is now. It is terrible. We have to do something about it. In 2016, we lost 64,000 Americans to drug overdoses -- 174 deaths per day; 7 per hour. We must get much tougher on drug dealers and pushers if we are going to succeed in stopping this scourge.
How serious should we take O'Meara Sanders' certainty? Her son, Dave Driscoll, weighed in on Twitter: I've heard my Mom say this only a handful of times before 'This discussion is over'... we should all listen.
President Trump applauded the decision on Twitter Friday night, writing that he had predicted all along that the Affordable Care Act is unconstitutional. Now Congress must pass a STRONG law that provides GREAT healthcare and protects pre-existing conditions. Mitch and Nancy, get it done! Mr. Trump wrote.
If this goes through to the debt ceiling... the total cost to the taxpayers and the economy and to America's world image will have been great, and somebody's going to pay the bill for that, Sabato said. And usually it's in an election.
The justices are set to hear 10 cases in October, including a copyright dispute between Oracle and Google. The court will also consider a legal battle over Obamacare on November 10, one week after the general election.
The fourth and final pillar protects the nuclear family by ending chain migration. Under the current broken system, a single immigrant can bring in virtually unlimited numbers of distant relatives. Under our plan, we focus on the immediate family by limiting sponsorships to spouses and minor children. This vital reform is necessary, not just for our economy, but for our security and for the future of America.
Republican lawmakers in the state and the Pennsylvania Republican Party asked the justices last month to put that ruling on hold, thereby shortening the deadline for mail-in ballots. But the Supreme Court split 4-4, denying their request. Roberts joined the liberal wing of the bench in leaving the Pennsylvania Supreme Court's ruling in place.
I have a very simple message to John Boehner, he said. Let the House vote. Stop trying to force a government shutdown. Let the House work its will -- all 435 members, not just the majority.
If these three Republicans join all Democrats in voting to subpoena witnesses, then they'd only need one more Republican to join them to summon witnesses the House did not hear from. Democrats have asked to hear from four government witnesses, including Acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney and former national security adviser John Bolton. McConnell warned Democrats on Tuesday that he couldn't imagine that only the witnesses that our Democratic colleagues would want to call would be called.
The tax plan did lower individual income taxes for roughly 80 percent of Americans, according to the Treasury Department, even though many Americans say they're not feeling the benefits.
But Trump's initial comments on North Carolina's anti-LGBT Bathroom Bill suggested the state made a mistake by passing the law requiring transgender individuals to use public restrooms that correspond with the sex listed on their birth certificates.
How good is that? President Obama said, when he finished the cards and the mic dropped. You think that's going viral? That's going viral.
MAYOR FRANCIS SUAREZ: We'd love to have more vaccine. We think if we get significantly more, we can more quickly vaccinate the vulnerable population as well as the general population.
We will always protect patients with preexisting conditions, he said.
Perez told reporters on Monday that no official decision has been made regarding the upcoming Democratic Party Convention in Milwaukee amid the coronavirus pandemic. We are planning and hoping for the best, but planning for every eventuality. And safety will always be paramount in planning the convention, Perez said on the call commemorating the 10th anniversary of the Affordable Care Act. We still have roughly 4 months until the convention, he noted.
Contrast his situation with those of DeVos, who was confirmed Tuesday as education secretary, and new Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who have more easily set up mechanisms to divest their business holdings. DeVos had ownership positions in numerous private businesses that she and her husband control, thus she had much greater flexibility.
RADDATZ: What do you think will happen if it falls?
7:30 p.m. ET. The RNC releases the official program for the 2016 Republican National Convention, which is being billed as the Make America Great Again convention. Each day will have a different theme -- Monday is Make America Safe Again, Tuesday will be Make America Work Again, Republicans will aim to Make America First Again on Wednesday, and on Thursday, the final night of the convention, Trump's theme will be Make America One Again.
Even though the Trump rules remain blocked, a ruling by a federal judge in Texas in June already allows most people who object to covering contraception to avoid doing so.
The case was brought by Republican-led states challenging the constitutionality of the 2010 law's individual mandate to purchase health insurance, arguing the entire law should be invalidated since Congress eliminated the penalty for not buying insurance in 2017. The Trump administration supports the GOP-led lawsuit, which would also eliminate protections for Americans with preexisting conditions if successful.
When the president is saying that that he doesn't respect John McCain and he's never going to respect John McCain and all these kids are out there listening to the president of the United States talk that way about the most decorated senator in history who is dead it just sets the worst tone possible, Isakson said.
At IRS, income and family size information -- critical for health insurance subsidies -- was not available for inquiries representing 30.7 million people in 2014. GAO said the number hadn't changed much for 2015. It was down to 29.2 million.
COOPER: Just for the record, though, are you saying that what you said on that bus 11 years ago that you did not actually kiss women without consent or grope women without consent?
The last thing we want to do as a state is go backwards and close down businesses. This temporary pause will help our state corral the spread until we can safely enter the next phase of opening our state for business, said Abbott. Businesses that were already permitted to open under the state's previous phases of reopening can continue to operate at the designated occupancy levels and under the minimum standard health protocols provided by the Texas Department of State Health Services, according to the statement. The Texas Democratic Party launched digital ads on Thursday, criticizing Abbott's handling of the coronavirus pandemic and claiming he ignored the data about a second wave.
So I have very clear views about what I want to see to kind of change the balance on the Supreme Court. And I regret deeply that the Senate has not done its job and they have not permitted a vote on the person that President Obama, a highly qualified person, they've not given him a vote to be able to be have the full complement of nine Supreme Court justices. I think that was a dereliction of duty.
McIver offered her resignation to the Trumps Tuesday, but they rejected it.
Our country needs a truly great leader, and we need a truly great leader now, he said. We need a leader that wrote 'The Art of the Deal.' We need a leader that can bring back our jobs, can bring back our manufacturing, can bring back our military.
Ryan's speech came as the Senate began to vote on a series of amendments Thursday to a bill to repeal major portions of Obamacare. Because it was created through the rarely-used budget reconciliation process, it only needs a simple majority of 51 votes in the Senate to pass, meaning it's not subject to the filibuster. The House passed the legislation last month along party lines and Mr. Obama has threatened to veto the legislation if it lands on his desk.
Health care is the top issue for Democrats in Iowa, with 89% saying the issue is very important, according to a July CBS News poll. In that poll, 66% of Iowa Democrats said they preferred a national health insurance plan that competes with private insurance, while 34% preferred eliminating private insurance.
That, too, is part of Obamacare, another hidden message as to what President Obama thinks of those who are less able than the elites who want to govern our country, Santorum said.
CLINTON: Well, thank you. Are you a teacher? Yes, I think that that's a very good question, because I've heard from lots of teachers and parents about some of their concerns about some of the things that are being said and done in this campaign.
Sen. Johnny Isakson, a Georgia Republican, was one of the few Republicans to denounce Mr. Trump in a radio interview Wednesday afternoon.
But I think it's clear to anyone who heard it that it represents exactly who he is. Because we've seen this throughout the campaign. We have seen him insult women. We've seen him rate women on their appearance, ranking them from one to ten. We've seen him embarrass women on TV and on Twitter. We saw him after the first debate spend nearly a week denigrating a former Miss Universe in the harshest, most personal terms.
Donald Trump: I think it's horrible if that's happening. I think it's built up by the press because, frankly, they'll take every single little incident that they can find in this country, which could've been there before. If I weren't even around doing this, and they'll make into an event because that's the way the press is.
At least 80 active fact checking sites now span the globe, according to the Duke Reporters' Lab, which in January helped launch an archive of U.S. political TV ads waiting to be vetted.
The United States is a compassionate nation. We are proud that we do more than any other country anywhere in the world to help the needy, the struggling, and the underprivileged all over the world. But as President of the United States, my highest loyalty, my greatest compassion, my constant concern is for America's children, America's struggling workers, and America's forgotten communities. I want our youth to grow up to achieve great things. I want our poor to have their chance to rise.
Lesley Stahl: What about the pledge to deport millions and millions of undocumented immigrants?
President Donald Trump: --so negative. You're so negative. These are the biggest rallies we've ever had. You just come in here with that negative attitude. These are the biggest rallies we've ever had.
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP (60 MINUTES): There's something really terrible and disgusting about that if that were the case. So we're going to have to see. We're going to get to the bottom of it and there will be severe punishment.
But I will tell you that, number one, I pay tremendous numbers of taxes. I absolutely used it. And so did Warren Buffett and so did George Soros and so did many of the other people that Hillary is getting money from. Now, I won't mention their names, because they're rich, but they're not famous. So we won't make them famous.
President Donald Trump: --that's helping her. Oh, I do criticize her, yeah.
The Trump administration has already been administratively dismantling key parts of Obamacare. The administration has stopped enforcement of the individual mandate, meaning people are no longer financially penalized for failing to have health insurance, even though that's technically still the law of the land.
At Wednesday's hearing, Verma refused to answer how many people would lose insurance if the ACA is struck down. Representative Diana DeGette, the subcommittee's Democratic chairwoman, placed the number at 21 million.
Scott Pelley: If you're not the nominee, will you support the nominee of the party?
Lesley Stahl: And you want to get rid of all of that?
Small business coverage. This siphoning effect may hit small business owners and employees particularly hard, said John Arensmeyer, CEO of the Small Business Majority, a liberal advocacy organization. The Trump administration estimated that as many as 1.6 million people will purchase short-term plans by 2022. Arensmeyer predicted nearly all of these people will be younger and healthier. Small businesses have come to rely on the exchanges, he explained. When you create an unbalanced risk pool that can destabilize the exchanges, and so small business owners and employees will have to pay more for comprehensive plans or be tempted to buy cheaper plans with inadequate coverage, Arensmeyer said.
Donald Trump, Jr.: I-- I think the fears, you know, while they may be there, some fabricated, some not-- are totally unfounded.
Cruz has also exercised a little influence over her husband behind the scenes. According to a 2013 New York Times report, during Ted Cruz's 21-hour Senate speech objecting to Obamacare, his chief of staff called her for a bedtime story recommendation that could be read to their two daughters from the floor. She suggested Green Eggs and Ham, by Dr. Seuss.
SUSAN GLASSER: Well, that's right. But-- but I think, you know, you mentioned the issues that-- that are top of the list, health care, the economy, it's not really an issues campaign if you listen to President Trump, and, frankly, if you even listen to voters in your poll, the-- the issue is President Trump. And more than any midterm election that I can remember this genuinely for both Republicans and Democrats is a-- a vote about President Trump it seems to me.
MARGARET BRENNAN: And don't expect a wholesale plan until after 2020?
MARGARET BRENNAN: Governor, we've talked about your state being a-- an outperformer in terms of actually getting vaccine supply out to constituents, and I wonder what your advice to the Biden administration would be. Should they continue prioritizing states based on population or reward good behavior by giving more vaccine to states that can actually put it in arms?
Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard reached out to Senator Bernie Sanders' wife, Jane, yesterday by phone, following news of her fellow 2020 candidate's health.
Scott Pelley: If you don't finish in the top three on Super Tuesday is that it for you?
The president will, however, mention the opioid crisis ravaging the country — and he will have a guest at the speech who is affected by that crisis, the official said.
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: And on the assumption that the Supreme Court upholds, we will get great, great health care for our people. We'll have to sit down with the Democrats to do it, but I'm sure they want to do it also.
Some aspects of the Obamacare law are still very popular with Americans, however: 87 percent, for example, say they would like to maintain provisions preventing people with pre-existing conditions from being turned down for coverage, and 61 percent would not support a bill that eliminates Obamacare's Medicaid expansion.
MARGARET BRENNAN: How are you going to do that?
The president wasn't the only leader on Tuesday night to push back against Trump's divisive brand of politics. Delivering the GOP's official response to the State of the Union, South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley similarly implored Americans to resist the siren call of the angriest voices.
He also said he was in touch with Donald Trump, the presumptive GOP nominee, on Thursday night about the issue, which Patrick said will both help elect Trump and drive children out of public schools.
I've done a lotta big things, I've never done anything like this. It is so big, it is so-- it's so enormous, it's so amazing. President-elect Donald Trump
Cruz, during an impromptu press conference in Fort Wayne, Indiana, replied to the critical remarks by denying that he ever knew the former House speaker, saying he'd never had any substantive conversation with John Boehner in any respect.
Mr. Trump's comments came the day before Manchin's campaign released a new television ad attacking Morrisey for joining a lawsuit with state attorneys general targeting the Affordable HealthCare Act (ACA). Manchin argues that if the ACA were to be overturned, 800,000 West Virginians would be at risk of losing coverage for pre-existing conditions.
In July 2017, Sen. McCain learned he had glioblastoma - a deadly and unforgiving brain cancer. Our Lesley Stahl joined him for some straight talk about how he lived his life and faced his death.
Testing for COVID-19 has been expanded in the Atlanta, Georgia, area through Test & Vote sites at three Fulton County early voting sites. CBS News campaign reporter Tim Perry reports that Fulton County, the most populous county in the state of Georgia with a population of more than 1 million residents, announced the new effort Tuesday and says it will run through May 29th. Testing will be offered in voting facility parking lots and is provided by the Fulton County Board of Health and CORE (Community Organized Relief Effort). The tests are free and available to any resident without regard to their symptoms or risk factors. Fulton County residents will not have to vote to receive a test or vice versa.
If the Supreme Court rules that Obamacare is out, we will have a plan that is far better than Obamacare, Mr. Trump vowed.
MEXICO IS PAYING FOR THE WALL through the many billions of dollars a year that the U.S.A. is saving through the new Trade Deal, the USMCA, that will replace the horrendous NAFTA Trade Deal, which has so badly hurt our Country. Mexico & Canada will also thrive - good for all! Mr. Trump tweeted in December 2018.
STEPHEN MILLER (Senior Adviser to President Trump): It's great to be here. Thank you. Merry Christmas.
Members of Congress, meanwhile, still get their six-figure paychecks during a shutdown because the 27th Amendment prohibits any session of Congress from changing its own pay. To the members of Congress who have offered to give up their pay during the shutdown, Dougan suggests they donate their paychecks to the Federal Employees Education and Assistance Fund, a nonprofit that gives grants and no-interest loans to financially-strapped federal workers.
JONAH GOLDBERG: Yeah. It's great she wasn't left on a tarmac, for example. Yeah, full disclosure, my wife works for-- for Nikki Haley and so I-- I'm conflicted and biased about this. but I-- I think you can make a persuasive case that she's arguably-- first of all, she's probably the most popular politician in America right now when you think about it. If you look at her poll ratings in-- in-- among Democrats and independents, also among pro Trump conservatives and anti-Trump conservatives, she's kind of a unifying figure. And I think her timing in all of this was, you know, either lucky or brilliant. To no other person who has worked for the Trump administration has seen their reputation enhanced in the process. And she is getting out while the getting is good, by doing it this way, it won't look like she's abandoning a sinking ship, if the midterms go south on the Republicans. And I-- looking forward to find out what happens with her next.
I know there are a awful lot of folks out there who are writing off this campaign, Biden said at the outset of the speech. Well, I've got news for them. I'm not going anywhere.
My opponent ... has run this race very, very close to the Trump handbook, where we call each other names, where we run false advertisements,
As it did at the end of its last term, the high court will hear oral arguments for its first sitting remotely and by telephone, as the coronavirus pandemic forced the Supreme Court in March to close its doors to the public indefinitely. The 10 cases slated to be argued remotely in October were initially scheduled for March and April, but postponed because of the pandemic. It's unclear whether the Supreme Court will resume in-person arguments in November.
Two months ago, Mitchell spoke with a physical therapist in Maitland who was trying to break-even after taking a financial blow during the pandemic. Dr. Fitzherbert Harry, 35, was just a few months away from having to consider other sources of income. And just over an hour away in Lakeland, Glenn and Jahlinda Jones were utilizing more digital and social media tools to expand their business, Ensure Financial Group, while dealing with the impacts of not being able to meet clients in person.
He talked about liberating Americans from the crime and terrorism and lawlessness that threatens their communities.
I don't care what people say - as long as they get the facts straight. In 2005 a retired FBI agent uncovered new evidence and witnesses supporting Dummar's claim of finding Hughes and driving him to the Sands, and about the delivery of the envelope containing the will. But in 2008 a U.S. appeals court affirmed a Nevada state court jury's decision 30 years earlier that found the will was a fake. You've got to keep on living, Dummar told the Salt Lake Tribune in 2005 about his set-backs. But as the aspiring songwriter wrote in All-American Dreamer: Some say I'll never make it.
Whistleblowers should be protected, Ernst said. I stand with Chuck Grassley on this.
After winning reelection in November 2016 -- the same time Mr. Trump unexpectedly won the presidency -- Inslee declared that Washington was, is and will always be a beacon for progressive values. During his second term, Inslee has been a frequent cable news critic of the president and, with the help of the state's attorney general, Bob Ferguson, has challenged some of the Trump administration's policies, including the travel ban, through high-profile lawsuits. In a campaign video focused on climate change, Inslee announced his White House bid on March 1. Issues Inslee will make climate change the top issue of his 2020 campaign, hoping to draw sharp contrasts with the environmental policies of Mr. Trump, who has repeatedly cast doubt on human-induced climate change, and even called it a Chinese hoax. He has been an ardent backer of sweeping federal action to mitigate the irreparable harm climate change is having on the global environment since his days in Congress. With most 2020 Democrats throwing their support for the audacious Green New Deal proposal introduced by New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Inslee's focus on climate change has the potential to gain traction among Democratic primary voters and prompt fellow contenders to discuss the issue even more during the nomination process. Inslee is also likely on the campaign trail to tout the growing economy in his deep-blue state, his role in the passage of a net neutrality bill and what he called the best paid family leave and one of the best minimum wages in the country.
Warren quipped that she had a suggestion for Price: Print out a copy of Mr. Trump's pledges not to cut funding from Medicare and Medicaid and post that on your desk above your new office.
President Donald Trump at rally: Lock 'em all up.
Before heading to New Hampshire, Tom Steyer on Tuesday stopped in Nevada for a brief appearance at a Las Vegas middle school. CBS News campaign reporter Alex Tin says the event marks his 15th total day stumping in Nevada, more than any other candidate, as rivals have dispatched surrogates to the state or battled it out on the airwaves. He kicked off his appearance asking whether the crowd had seen the news out of the delayed Iowa caucus, where he has yet to pick up a delegate. There is such a big muddle that in fact they have put this into your hands, Steyer remarked.
Democrats in the House secured increased funding for early childhood education and a variety of other domestic programs. They also won higher Medicaid funding for the cash-poor government of Puerto Rico, which is struggling to recover from hurricane devastation and a resulting economic downturn.
CLINTON: Well, I certainly will, because I think that's a very fair and important question. Look, I respect his children. His children are incredibly able and devoted, and I think that says a lot about Donald. I don't agree with nearly anything else he says or does, but I do respect that. And I think that is something that as a mother and a grandmother is very important to me.
It is a state-based system kind of similar to Medicaid if you will, and I do think there are very legitimate questions that can be raised.
Price, an orthopedic surgeon-turned-lawmaker who once chaired House Budget Committee, faced a grilling over his positions on the Affordable Care Act, the Republican repeal efforts, funding for social security programs, and the latest contentious revelations about potential conflicts of interest in stock buys Price made while in Congress.
Insurers are entitled to the money under a provision of the Obamacare health law that promised the companies a financial cushion for losses they might incur by selling coverage to people in the marketplaces created by the health care law, the justices said by an 8-1 vote.
There are four primaries on Tuesday, August 14: Connecticut, Minnesota, Vermont, and Wisconsin.
In the morning, an estimated 800,000 of the 2.1 million federal workers who are deemed nonessential for the operations of the government will be sent home after they have shut down their work. Only employees who are necessary to ensure national security and protect Americans' lives and property will be allowed to work, albeit without pay, along with a few other types of workers.
On the very day they prepared the final papers, the seventh floor, that is the director's office and the deputy director's office up there, sent down word they should keep that open. So that they could try to go and question Flynn about this call he had with the Russian ambassador.

Scott Pelley: I should say that the Congress didn't allow that to happen, so the cuts didn't happen. But what do you make of the effort to cut those budgets?
It's his last year and last chance to achieve the goals he has set for the nation. I want to make sure that we maximize it, he said.
Trump said on ABC's Good Morning America that he things the state should make the decision, adding, They're more capable of making the decision. I felt that from the beginning.
A successful orthopedic surgeon before winning a congressional seat from the Atlanta suburbs, Price rose to become one of the top GOP experts on budget and health care issues. But as secretary of HHS, he never produced a health care plan to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act.
JAMELLE BOUIE: It is divisive. I'm not sure-- I guess my perspective on these sorts of things is informed by previous election cycles, which is compared to some of the language that emerged in 2016 or 2008 or 2004, it's not that divisive, right? I-- I distinctly remember in the 2008 pri-- Democratic primary, the candidates Clinton-Obama throwing extremely hard punches at each other saying things that in the moment made it feel like there may not be unity once the primary ended, but what happened was unity the party got back together. So Sanders calling out the Republican establishment, the Democratic establishment, that's-- should have been his brand--
What he has laid out is the most dangerous, reckless approach to being President than I think we've ever seen, Clinton said in an hour-long interview with CBS This Morning host Charlie Rose Monday.
Suraj Patel, a 34-year-old hotel executive, is challenging Democratic incumbent Rep. Carolyn Maloney in New York's 12th Congressional District. He has received attention for using Tinder banking to reach millennial voters
The group to watch this election is educated suburban women -- will they turn out to vote and how their votes swing this fall? And the place to keep a close eye on is Minneapolis, where #MeToo looms over the political landscape.
President Donald Trump: What's your-- what's your next--
MARGARET BRENNAN: But the bottom line is doesn't all of this shake the confidence of the American people to a certain extent in the-- in terms of the integrity of the election itself? I mean this is--
Rep. Karen Bass: The president has no idea.

For discussion on the latest developments in the 2020 presidential race:
JONAH GOLDBERG: It might well be. I actually wrote a column about this on Hillary Clinton coming in very late in the early Kavanaugh controversy about getting something completely wrong that Kavanaugh allegedly said about birth control. And it was very strange that she would jump in after it had already been debunked by all the fact checkers. I made exactly this argument is that we sort of live in the republic of trolling now, and everybody-- it benefits you more to be the sub-- in a world of negative polarization, to be attacked by your enemies is a benefit in and of itself even if the attack is legitimate. And I think it's a sort of spreading model of Trumpism that is infecting a lot of our politics and our media.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Ed, he was chairman--
And it's not just because I worked with George W. Bush after 9/11, and I was very proud that when I told him what the city needed, what we needed to recover, he said you've got it, and he never wavered. He stuck with me.
John McCain: Of course. Of course. I've supported him on national security. I've supported his team--
But they have a history of going head-to-head.
ANTHONY SALVANTO: Yeah. And they mean it when they say it now.
President Trump ordered the first U.S. strike aimed at Syrian dictator Bashar Assad's military, taking out the airbase American officials believe was behind the deadly chemical weapons attack this week on a rebel-held town in northern Syria. Assad, and his Russian backers, say the U.S. strike was an illegal aggression. How Moscow reacts in the coming days will determine the next phase in the Syrian war, in which the U.S. government now has larger role.
Kavanaugh has also generally sided against the Environmental Protection Agency in cases over its authority to regulate — a boon for an administration that has worked to loosen or eliminate environmental regulations viewed as too burdensome.
Sixteen years later, the GOP's tax cut failed to receive a single Democratic vote in the House or Senate.
Lesley Stahl: One of the issues that has come up in the campaign is your father's temperament. And he has himself has said, If someone insults me or says something unkind about me, I'm gonna strike back. And now people are saying, Well, maybe he should kinda soften that, control that a little. What-- how do you think he's going to comport himself as president?
ELIZABETH PALMER (CBS News Senior Foreign Correspondent/@CBSLizpalmer): Good morning. The U.K. is now more than halfway toward its goal of vaccinating fifteen million people over seventy and medical staff by mid-February. And that's in sharp contrast to the situation in Europe.
MANUEL BOJORQUEZ: There are also questions about how the vaccines will stand up to new strains. Johnson & Johnson, which is set to ask for emergency authorization of its one-dose vaccine this week, noted that its efficacy dropped from seventy-two percent in the U.S. to fifty-seven percent in South Africa, where the mutant strain is driving new cases.
We are going to start winning for our country, Trump told supporters at his campaign headquarters in Spartanburg. I was watching upstairs and it was really amazing to be watching what I was watching. Some of the pundits said 'well, if Trump and the other candidates dropped out - if you add them together, they'll equal Trump.' They don't understand -- as they drop out, I'm gonna get a lot of those votes also.
MARGARET BRENNAN: South Carolina, though, is your firewall.
RADDATZ: Mr. Trump, Mr. Trump, your two minutes is up.
As CBS News noted, Government shutdowns are unusual, but they're not unheard of.
In December, Texas-based U.S. District Judge Reed O'Connor agreed with Republicans that Congress had rendered the law unconstitutional when it zeroed out the tax penalty imposed on those who didn't buy insurance. The law's supporters appealed.
Lesley Stahl: Well, what do you think they're demonstrating against?
It's no secret Donald Trump is bold, tenacious, courageous and he's an outspoken leader and he knows how to create jobs and successful businesses, she said. He has bold ideas and he speaks truth to power. He is a man who will get this country on the right track, who believes in peace through strength and will protect America against radical Islamic terrorists who seek to destroy our nation.
Controversy Although he has a liberal voting record in the Senate and has been a staunch critic of the Trump administration, Booker has faced criticism from some progressives for receiving large donations from pharmaceutical corporations and banks. In what he touted as his Spartacus moment, Booker claimed to have released confidential committee documents during the contentious Senate confirmation of Justice Brett Kavanaugh. His Republican colleagues accused him of grandstanding and said the documents had already been cleared. What Trump says In an exclusive interview with CBS News Face the Nation host Margaret Brennan the same day Booker announced his candidacy, President Trump said he thinks Booker has no chance in the 2020 election. When asked why, Mr. Trump replied: Because I know him. He has no chance. In a November interview with the New York Post, the president said Booker ran Newark into the ground and falsely accused him of not living in the city when he was mayor. During the 2016 campaign, Mr. Trump claimed to know more about Booker than the New Jersey senator knew about himself. If Cory Booker is the future of the Democratic Party, they have no future! I know more about Cory than he knows about himself, Mr. Trump tweeted in July of that year.
JOHN DICKERSON: Does that represent a-- a change more for the Republicans or the Democrats recently?
After a rally at the South Hills Country Club here, Santorum asked Republicans to pick any other Republican in the country than GOP presidential front-runner Romney, based on issues that make the former Massachusetts governor uniquely disqualified to run against Obama.
TRUMP: It's an absolute disgrace. COOPER: Secretary Clinton, two minutes.
PHOENIX — In one of the key races in the battle for control of the, Arizona Democrat Kyrsten Sinema is running against Republican Martha McSally for the seat that's being left open by retiring Republican Jeff Flake.
But some White House officials say the dispute has become an obstacle to working relations between the two.
On Tuesday, Donald Trump reached deep into America's ranks of the discouraged and neglected, a largely white constituency. They feel their America hasn't been great for a long time. And they accepted a promise to make it great again.
Biden finished fourth in Monday's caucuses, the first voting contest of the 2020 election. With 86% of precincts reporting on Wednesday, Buttigieg had 26.6% of delegates and Sanders was close behind, with 25.4%, Warren was in third place with 18.3% followed by the former vice president, who had 15.9%
MCGAHN: So the people have spoken not once but twice.
This election is a broader referendum on Republicans, who hold both houses of Congress, the White House, and the overwhelming majority of governor's mansions nationwide. Republicans campaigned in 2016 on repealing Obamacare, but their efforts failed because they couldn't answer the question, Then what? A jittery public worried about losing health care coverage ultimately doomed the repeal effort in the Senate. Yet Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is still thinking about trying again to repeal the Affordable Care Act and cutting back on Medicare and Medicaid to help pay for the ballooning deficit caused by the Trump tax cuts.
MARGARET BRENNAN: --well she says she's coming forth now because she thinks it's disqualifying for Joe Biden. Do you think it's disqualifying?
What astonished me, then and now, Cruz told the Times, was Heidi within 60 seconds said, 'Absolutely,' with no hesitation.
He would - did not want a child and his wife didn't want a child, Trump said. And they were going to abort. And they didn't do it for very complicated reasons. And now they have the child. And it's the apple of his eye. And he said, 'Thank God.' He changed also, by the way. 'Thank God, I didn't do it.' And I've seen that, and I've seen other things. And I am pro-life.
SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: Yeah. We will. I mean we have it all done. And it's just the question of dotting the Is and crossing the Ts. Yes, we will, absolutely.
So the White House became aware of the decision when it filed today?
But on Wednesday, Justice Sonia Sotomayor questioned why the Little Sisters of the Poor were even at the court, given that they don't have to provide contraceptive coverage. Sotomayor also referenced the coronavirus pandemic during her questioning, asking attorney Paul Clement, who was representing the nuns, whether an employer might be able to object to paying for a coronavirus vaccine. He said no.
MARGARET BRENNAN: It's time now for some political analysis. Ben Domenech is the founder and publisher of The Federalist. Kelsey Snell covers Congress for NPR. Ed Wong is a diplomatic and international correspondent for The New York Times. And Margaret Talev is senior White House correspondent at Bloomberg News. Kelsey, are you cancelling your Christmas plans?
Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar blasted a ruling by a federal judge in Texas on Friday declaring the Affordable Care Act unconstitutional, calling the judge's decision absurd and saying the Trump administration is standing while the house is burning down.
BIDEN: Well, look, the people that occupied my office, maybe they were Russians. I don't know. But they- they said they were Bernie supporters. The people who occupied other offices and the people who did these terrible things to the Culinary Workers and the women who run that operation, I- I guess anything's possible, but they're identified as Bernie supporters. So I- I'm not making any comment beyond that. But there should be absolute condemnation of the conduct of these folks who are engaging in that kind of behavior and the misogynistic behavior against the Culinary Workers and people coming into my office. The police had to- this was back in- in- in, you know, the first two primaries and have to call the police to get them out of our office. I mean, that- that's Trump-like stuff. I mean, this is not the stuff that we've done in Democratic primaries before.
I think any time you try to take any one demographic and fit them into a neat, little box, there is a danger for backlash, Franklin Fowler replied.
KELSEY SNELL: I mean I was out in several of these Majority Maker districts, districts where the Democrats beat Republicans in 2018. And I talked to voters there who say when they hear the word Democrat they hear socialist and they don't make those distinctions. They don't hear the policies. They hear the word. And I saw people showing up at town halls yelling-- Abigail Spanberger in Virginia out there at her town hall had people showing up and, specifically, wanting to ask her, are you a socialist? You're a Democrat, does that mean you're a socialist? That's not something that, you know, moderates like her want to talk about.
SENATOR RICK SCOTT: Well, of course. I mean--
President Trump has been trying to throw out the Affordable Care Act for four years. The Republican Party has been trying to eliminate it for a decade. Twice already the Supreme Court has upheld the law. And the Congress, expressing the popular will of the American people, has rejected President Trump's efforts as well, Biden said in Delaware. Now, all of a sudden this administration believes they've found a loophole in the tragedy of Justice [Ruth Bader] Ginsburg's death.
Legislative Republicans filed the lawsuit after Wisconsin Health Secretary-designee, Andrea Palm, extended the safer at home order until May 26 at the direction of Evers. They argue the Evers administration has overreached its executive powers and say Palm didn't have the authority to extend the order on her own. Evers and Palm have defended safer at home, saying it's working to keep Wisconsin safe, and believe the law is on their side. Conservatives hold a 5-2 advantage on the Wisconsin Supreme Court.
Well to constitute a false statement, you need two things. One, you need a false statement, lie. And then it has to be material to a legitimate investigation. And I think on the question of lying, it's as Comey, Director Comey said just a few months after this episode, he said it was a close question. And that, while you might make that argument, it was a very close question.
Lesley Stahl: You're taking both radiation and chemotherapy?
One week after votes for the next president are cast, the Supreme Court is scheduled to hear oral arguments in a blockbuster dispute involving the fate of Obamacare.
SEN. SANDERS: But you have people--
It is good that once again the president seems to be backing off his threat to hold health care and government funding hostage, he said in a statement. These payments are essential to ensuring that millions of Americans won't see their premiums skyrocket, and they won't be kicked off their plan. Like the withdrawal of money for the wall, this decision brings us closer to a bipartisan agreement to fund the government and is good news for the American people. There are outstanding issues to be resolved, particularly with riders, but this is a positive development for the negotiations.
My administration has also imposed tough sanctions on the communist and socialist dictatorships in Cuba and Venezuela.
Mulvaney, who was joined by White House legislative affairs director Marc Short, said that Democrats are opposing a short-term spending bill that they normally would support, noting that it's technically a clean bill that includes an extension to the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) -- for six years -- and some support the delay in some Obamacare taxes.

BIDEN: You said it, my firewall.
But expanding voting by mail wouldn't be cheap. An analysis from the Brennan Center for Justice estimated it could cost $982 million to $1.4 billion to ensure voting by mail is available to all voters. That includes costs for postage, ballot printing, securing drop boxes for ballots and improving absentee ballot processing. Those proposals are part of a larger set of recommendations to protect elections in the event the Coronavirus pandemic continues into November. The price tag on all of the Brennan Center's recommendations, including the vote by mail expansion, is up to $2 billion.
With little more than four months to go until the midterm elections, President Trump is hitting the road this week, traveling to South Carolina, North Dakota, and Wisconsin. Sunday's event in Nevada offered a solid preview of what's to come. On Saturday, Mr. Trump headlined a campaign rally, where he praised incumbent Sen. Dean Heller, R-Nevada, while dubbing his opponent Jacky Rosen Wacky Jacky. He also continued to focus on immigration, despite a week of turbulence and criticism of his administration's policy of separating children from their families at the border; and he boasted that he has gutted Obamacare.
SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: We are going to do-- yes.
The article also retold the governor's story of growing up on the south side of Chicago, earning a scholarship to the elite Milton Academy prep school in Massachusetts and attending Harvard University and Harvard Law School.
Even if the hold-outs spurn the offer, the legislation provides plenty of other benefits.
Now it's gone, and Democrats are hoist on their own political petard.
8:35 p.m. ET Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi said that Donald Trump will stop lawlessness in the U.S. and will reverse President Obama's unconstitutional executive orders.
The Post measured the tax cut as a percentage of the gross domestic product (GDP), in order to take inflation adjustments out of the equation. Assuming the growth that Mr. Trump anticipates, the Post calculated that the tax cut would be 0.9 percent of GDP.
Scott Pelley: How can you be the standard-bearer for a party that claims the high ground on the rights of women and minorities?
We want to go now to New Orleans and former Congressman Cedric Richmond, who is now senior adviser to the President. Good morning to you.
I think there's a lot of merit in every area, Price said, noting that he looks forward to working to ensure more transparent dealings when it comes to fluctuating drug prices.
If the courts rule in favor of the argument, all protections under the ACA, including the most popular protection for people with preexisting conditions, would no longer exist. Back in June, the Trump administration decided not to defend the ACA against this lawsuit, and it agreed in part that protections for people with preexisting conditions should be overturned.
The Republican-led House on Friday plans to vote on a bill called Keep Your Health Plan Act, which would allow plans that existed on the individual market as of Jan. 1, 2013 to stay in effect through 2014. While the legislation would enact a policy change similar to the administration's, the White House has said it opposes the bill because it would allow insurers to sell 2013 plans in 2014 to anyone, not just customers who already have those plans. That, White House spokesman Jay Carney told reporters Tuesday, creates all sorts of problems for insurers trying to meet the basic standards set by the Affordable Care Act, undermining the whole law.
Brooke Rollins. President and CEO of the Texas Public Policy Foundation think tank, Rollins is a staunch free-market advocate who served as an aide to former Texas Gov. Rick Perry.
While President Trump has vowed to take up his campaign promise to once again repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act (ACA), the president appears to be delaying those efforts, at least for now. Mr. Trump tweeted Monday night that a vote on Republican's revitalized effort to reform the ACA would be held right after the election when Republicans hold the Senate and win back the House.
TRUMP: ... so that we will be able to take care of people without the necessary funds to take care of themselves.
The study comes as lawmakers are grappling with how to navigate the health care debate as a case over the Affordable Care Act heads to the Supreme Court. On Sunday, Republican Senator Lamar Alexander was asked if he was disappointed that the president decided to go ahead with the Obamacare lawsuit after arguments in the case were filed with the country's highest court last week.
The ACA, the Economy, Direction of the Country
Thank you. And God bless America. Goodnight.
TRUMP: Why didn't you do it? Why didn't you do it?
MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you see him changing the way he campaigns in a way that-- that broadens his appeal, particularly to black voters?
Texas Sen. Ted Cruz will also address the convention.
Donald Trump: I'm going to do very restrained, if I use it at all, I'm going to do very restrained. I find it tremendous. It's a modern form of communication. There should be nothing you should be ashamed of. It's-- it's where it's at. I-- I do believe this, I really believe that, um-- the fact that I have such power in terms of numbers with Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, et cetera, I think it helped me win all of these races where they're spending much more money than I spent. You know, I spent my money. A lot of my money. And I won. I think that social media has more power than the money they spent, and I think maybe to a certain extent, I proved that.
Trump is under attack, they believe, because Trump stands up for them. If he weren't president, many Republicans believe, they would still be smeared as bigots, they would still be insulted nightly on prime-time TV and by late-night comics. The only difference would be that there wouldn't be tax cuts or a conservative majority on the Supreme Court.
SENATOR BEN SASSE: It has huge downstream implications for shared work together.
After acknowledging there have been differences in the GOP, Ryan goes on to deride Clinton's candidacy as a third term for Barack Obama. Watch the Democratic convention, next week, he instructs. It'll be a four-day infomercial of politically correct moralizing. You'll be able to get through those four days with a little help from a mute button, but four more years? Not a chance, Ryan says.
JOHN DICKERSON: unable to get past it--
QUESTION: What steps will your energy policy take to meet our energy needs, while at the same time remaining environmentally friendly and minimizing job loss for fossil power plant workers?
TRUMP: I would be a president for all of the people, African- Americans, the inner cities. Devastating what's happening to our inner cities. She's been talking about it for years. As usual, she talks about it, nothing happens. She doesn't get it done.
A million jobs? Jennings questioned in disbelief. Great! Who here has a great job? Or is looking forward to finishing school? Do you really feel like you have a job coming up? She asked, looking around the Starbucks.
In Virginia's competitive 10th district, three Democrats are leading the field in the fight to take on Comstock this fall, including two women -- Alison Friedman and state Sen. Jennifer Wexton. Friedman is a single-mom and former State Department official in the Obama administration. She is a first-time candidate who was inspired to run for office after her 9 year old daughter wrote a letter to President Trump about kindness. Elaine Luria, a small business owner and former Navy commander who served 20 years, is hoping to take on incumbent Republican Scott Taylor in Virginia's 2nd District.

COOPER: Mr. Trump, let me follow up with you. In 2008, you wrote in one of your books that the most important characteristic of a good leader is discipline. You said, if a leader doesn't have it, quote, he or she won't be one for very long. In the days after the first debate, you sent out a series of tweets from 3 a.m. to 5 a.m., including one that told people to check out a sex tape. Is that the discipline of a good leader?
9:50 p.m. Donald Trump claims that Bill Clinton was impeached, lost his law license and had to pay Paula Jones $850,000.
President Trump defended his administration's coronavirus response following new revelations that he admitted to downplaying the threat of COVID-19 amid worldwide spread, in a March interview with journalist Bob Woodward.
Finally, we are joined by one more witness to the ominous nature of this regime. His name is Mr. Ji Seong-ho.
Vance is seeking the president's business records, including his tax returns, dating back to 2011 as part of a criminal investigation into his business dealings and hush-money payments made to two women who claimed they had affairs with Mr. Trump years before he was elected.
She's a fan of her husband's method of coping with stress
The last pillar, Mr. Trump said, protects the nuclear family by ending chain migration...Under our plan, we focus on the immediate family by limiting sponsorships to spouses and minor children.
I'm sure many people were surprised, but I'm not there to prove anything, Franklin later told The Associated Press. Not necessary.
4:51 p.m. ET More than just the pageantry of primetime speeches, the Republican convention is where the GOP works to solidify a platform of policies on which it is based and will run in the general election. CBS Politics has a good overview of this year's platform highlights here, including building a border wall, putting increased scrutiny on refugees and overturning the Supreme Court's decision on same-sex marriage.
The text of the directive says that a school must not treat a transgender student differently from the way it treats other students of the same gender identity.
BEN DOMENECH: The Authorization of the Use of Military Force.
In 1994, he was appointed by Bill Clinton to lead the Justice Department's civil rights division and focused on investigating a series of arson fires at southern black churches.
JOHN DICKERSON: All right. Let me switch topics now to the case of Jamal Khashoggi. You-- you said that if it turns out that Saudi Arabia had something to do with his murder that, quote, a complete revolt against our policies with Saudi Arabia would take place in Congress.
How will colleges be evaluated on this measure? Will they be punished by losing federal funding if they don't make the grade? How will this approach lower the total cost of college? How will low-income students receive financial support if the Department of Education is shut down, along with its Pell Grant program?
It was former prisoner of war McCain who took on many Republicans to declare America could never condone torture, even against our worst enemies.
The group will grow to 1.9 million by January 2021 when worker unemployment benefits expire, leaving them with incomes below the threshold to qualify for tax credits.
All those inquiries don't result in final applications, much less ones that get approved.
This outlook is too grim for voters like twins Tonya and Tiffany Hamilton, 37, who, while waiting in line at Biden's St. Louis rally in March, talked about Ginsburg's cancer treatment. Tiffany Hamilton pleaded, All we need is her to hold on until at least November!
Franklin said she received plenty of government information about coronavirus safety and economic stimulus payments, but the insurance piece just has not been mentioned.
Lesley Stahl: You walk out onto the Senate floor. You thought it was gonna be normal, empty, mostly empty. And the entire Senate is there. They stand up. They give you an incredible ovation. What went on inside--
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: And I'll tell you what, I am proud to shut down the government for border security, Chuck.
The Republican National Committee raised $14.2 million in July -- the most it has ever raised in that month in a non-presidential year -- bringing its total haul for the cycle to $227.2 million. Despite historic odds and voter enthusiasm favoring Democrats, the RNC is finding record-setting support among its donors, according to numbers shared first with CBS News. The RNC raised more in July of this year than it did in 2010 and 2014 combined.
MARGARET BRENNAN: But as you just said, in the course of your answer there, you do think there should be some U.S. presence that remains--
Donald Trump: Sure I can. I can be easily, that's easier. Honestly to do that, it's easier.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Jamelle, I mean, the theory of the case here as-- as Susan was saying is that division, confusion, that's the endgame in and of itself. It's not having the Manchurian Candidate per se.
Meanwhile, President Trump reiterated support for the Republican-led effort today. We're not doing anything, we're staying. In other words, we're staying with the group, with Texas and the group, he said in the Oval Office. Obamacare is a disaster, but we've run it very well. And we've made it barely acceptable, he added.
Now the White House report undercuts the notion that the tax penalties at issue in the case are central to the health law. Officials at the Council of Economic Advisers said they're not policymakers or lawyers, but economists.
Lesley Stahl: You think those people down there are—
In challenging the law anew, Obamacare opponents noted the 2012 ruling of a divided Supreme Court that upheld the law. Conservative justices had rejected the argument that Congress could require everyone to buy insurance under the Constitution's interstate commerce clause. But Chief Justice John Roberts, joining four liberal justices, said Congress did have the power to impose a tax on those without insurance.
Price was also asked whether he would support Medicare negotiating drug prices -- a stance Trump has articulated.
10:30 a.m. ET CBS News Battleground Tracker poll, out this morning, shows Hillary Clinton with a four-point lead over Donald Trump in Ohio and a three-point lead in Michigan. The two are virtually tied in Iowa -- Trump has a one-point edge.
Donald Trump: Well, it was very interesting. I got a call from Father Bush, who is a wonderful man. And he just said, Congratulations. It was an amazing campaign. And then I got a call from George and he said-- Congratulations. It was great. And, you know, look, it's-- it's a tough situation. I went to war with Jeb. And Jeb's a nice guy, but it was a nasty campaign. It was a nasty campaign. And, I mean, I'm disappointed in one thing. He signed a pledge and I don't know how you sign a pledge and then you don't honor it. It was a rough primary. It's a rough primary. Although I think the general was probably just as tough. Probably as a combination, it was the roughest ever.
President Donald Trump: Well, he's been wrong a lot. I like him, but he's been wrong a lot.
STEPHEN MILLER: You also have to think about the twenty-eight million Americans who still don't have health insurance because Obamacare didn't work. Fortunately, because of the dramatic action this administration has taken, we've increased choice, we've increased competition. And, for the first time in a long time, premiums on the exchanges are going down, not up.
Five days after the surgery, lab results confirmed he had glioblastoma, the brain cancer that took his life.
SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: Look, what I think Hillary Clinton was saying is that Democrats are in a pitched battle on very important issues in our country and we need to fight hard. Look, nobody goes lower than Donald Trump. I mean that's a bottomless pit. No one's competing with that. He gets up at his rallies, he says go beat the crap out of them. He says lock them up. I actually don't think voters, especially independent voters like that. But we are going to put up a tough fight. Phil Bredesen, two-term governor, nonpartisan, bipartisan. He is doing very well in Tennessee.
About running for president, Haley says, I don't think about it. No one wants to believe this. But people spend more time talking about my future. My job is to be the best U.N. Ambassador I can possibly be and make sure that people are proud of it. I don't think about the future, and honestly, I don't have time. Between North Korea, Russia and Syria, the last thing I'm thinking about is what I'm gonna do in the future.
MARGARET BRENNAN: We spoke to the national security adviser to the President, who is denying that the White House was informed of the preference for Trump. But-- but you and I both know that in 2016, that was the intelligence community's clear--
In 2018, a federal district court judge in Texas agreed with the states that the individual mandate is unconstitutional and struck down the entire Affordable Care Act on grounds that it cannot survive without the mandate. The judge put his ruling on hold while litigation continued.
CAITLIN HUEY-BURNS: Right. Well, I think it shows the perils of waiting and lingering about making a decision about whether to get into this race. The longer that he waits out there, the more scrutiny is applied to him and his record, especially as these voters are getting a look at all of the other options that they have available to them. It also shows this kind of contrast that Biden will be faced with within his own party, a party that has been dramatically changed in the era of Me Too. I have-- we'll say that I've been reporting in New Hampshire and Iowa and South Carolina, following all these candidates, and every time I ask a voter about what they think of Joe Biden, almost to a tee they say, I love him so much, I just don't want him to run. And part of that is that they feel kind of personally invested in his legacy and they know what a presidential race could do to him. And they want him to be a player, but not necessarily inside. Now, he does have high name recognition.
Larry Levitt of the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation said less regulation isn't automatically an act of sabotage, but Mr. Trump has made clear his hostility to Obamacare.
But look at that deal. Iran now and Russia are now against us. So she wants to fight. She wants to fight for rebels. There's only one problem. You don't even know who the rebels are. So what's the purpose?
This man has done such a bad job -- he has set us back so far, and for him to say that actually is a great compliment, if you want to know the truth, Trump said.
Democrat Jon Ossoff, 30, is a documentary filmmaker and a former Capitol Hill staffer, working for five years as a legislative aide, with a focus on national security, to Rep. Hank Johnson, D-Georgia. This is his first run for political office.
John McCain: He is in the business of making money and he has been successful both in television as well as Miss America and others. I was raised in a military family. I was raised in the concept and belief that duty, honor, country is the-- is the lodestar for the behavior that we have to exhibit every single day.
Carson said, Are we willing to elect someone who acknowledges Lucifer? The secular, progressive agenda is antithetical to the principles of the founding of this nation.
But I want to emphasize that what is at stake here is the ambitions and the aggressiveness of Russia. Russia has decided that it's all in, in Syria. And they've also decided who they want to see become president of the United States, too, and it's not me. I've stood up to Russia. I've taken on Putin and others, and I would do that as president.
Meanwhile in Colorado, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee's (DCCC) efforts to back Democratic candidate Jason Crow in Colorado's competitive 6th District garnered some negative attention. Crow, an attorney and Army veteran, appeared to have establishment-backing early on. But that did not stop Levi Tillemann, a former official in Obama's Energy Department, from moving home to run against Coffman as well.
In Minnesota, both Senate seats are currently held by Democrats, Sen. Amy Klobuchar and Sen. Tina Smith. Klobuchar is expected to win re-election. Jim Newberger has emerged as the top Republican contender to challenge Klobuchar this fall. Smith was appointed by Gov. Mark Dayton to fill Al Franken's seat after he resigned. She is running in a special election in November to fill the remainder of Franken's term, which was set to end in 2020. Five Democrats are challenging Smith in the primary: Ali Chehem Ali, Gregg Iverson, Nick Leonard, Richard Painter, and Christopher Seymore. On the Republican side, State Senator Karin Housley is the frontrunner in the primary and won the party's endorsement to compete in the special election to fill Franken's vacated seat.
Already, Senator Chris Coons of Delaware, a Democrat on the Judiciary panel, said he intends to ask Barrett about her past statements on the health care law.
And Democrats aren't. They're just pretending to. In fact, the Washington Post ran an article last December headlined Forget What They Say—House Democrats Are Readying for Impeachment.
McSally and the national GOP are hoping that Ward and Arpaio will split the hard-right vote and allow McSally to win easily and get a clean shot at beating Sinema. But the GOP primary won't be held until late August, meaning that whoever wins will have only a brief window to unite the GOP heading in to the November 2018 election.
The spending spree, along with last year's tax cuts, has the deficit moving sharply higher with Republicans in control of Washington.
There is no next thing, said Mr. Obama. This is it.
The Senate voted to acquit President Trump on Wednesday. However, a Republican broke ranks on the first article of impeachment. Senator Mitt Romney was the only Republican who voted to convict Trump of abuse of power. He joins the 47 other Democrats in voting to remove the president for office for this offense. Senators voted along party lines on the second article of impeachment, obstruction of justice.
Rep. Ann McLane Kuster: Trust me. You don't wanna cross her. (LAUGH)
Another reason exchanges are unprofitable for big insurers has to do with the products they are selling. Accustomed to offering expansive provider networks and a range of coverage for employer-sponsored group plans, big insurers designed similar high-cost plans for the exchanges. These broader networks are likely to attract patients with health issues who may be willing to pay more in premiums to stay with their doctors and other providers. Healthy people, on the other hand, are more likely to go for the lowest-cost plans, usually offered by smaller, regional insurers.
Suddenly, crisis management is an urgent issue in the presidential campaign. Coronavirus has infected world financial markets. And now, Wall Street is calculating the chances of a recession. Into this, a new name will appear on primary ballots for the first time. Michael Bloomberg, the 78-year-old billionaire and former mayor of New York City, skipped the early contests. But he's already spent almost $500 million, much of it aimed at this week's Super Tuesday. We spoke to Mike Bloomberg Saturday, and earlier in the week, about how he would lead, his reputation with women and minorities and the virus crisis.
Just as I promised the American people from this podium 11 months ago, we enacted the biggest tax cuts and reform in American history.
SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: Well, you can stop it by overriding what he is doing and making sure that we fund these programs. Look here is the story, you have a terrible humanitarian crisis. You have women and children traveling a thousand miles or more, often by foot, in order to escape the violence and poverty in their countries. So what we need to do, of course, is (A) comprehensive immigration reform but (B) we need to make sure that our borders are secure but also we need a humane policy at the border in which we are not yanking tiny children--
And we'll be right back with a lot more FACE THE NATION. Stay with us.
Washington — Despite ongoing discussions with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin over another coronavirus relief package, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Thursday revealed several areas that are still unresolved in talks with the Trump administration, indicating the two sides remain far apart on another measure designed to provide assistance to American families struggling during the coronavirus pandemic.
Since taking control of the House in 2011, Republicans have repeatedly promised to repeal and replace ObamaCare and have voted on this nearly 60 times. But none of their legislative proposals has made it to President Obama's desk and the Supreme Court ruled on a key element of the healthcare law in June, upholding its subsidies.
I mean, it's not gonna be the end of it.
Scott Pelley: I guess that puts a lot of you girls out of business.
A cutaway shot featuring members of the Congressional Black Caucus showed them not applauding in the chamber.
Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, who has expressed strong concerns about the measure, had been waiting for the CBO score before making a decision about her position.
Clinton's campaign did not deny sending the photos and responded by calling the issue nothing more than an obvious and transparent attempt to distract from the serious issues confronting our country. However, Clinton told MSNBC at the time that so far as I know it didn't come from her campaign.

One-time Trump rival, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio did not make it to Cleveland but will be speaking at the convention via video.
We as Republicans need to own that truth. We need to recognize our contributions to the erosion of the public trust in America's leadership. We need to accept that we've played a role in how and why our government is broken. And then we need to fix it, she said.
Changes in how drug company rebates are distributed, how insurance formularies are constructed and how Medicaid and Medicare drug prices are negotiated are all part of the budget. Some experts worry that these changes are just a matter of moving money around and don't address the underlying causes of ever-increasing prescription drug prices.
People with pre-existing health problems would be protected against being turned down. But they'd have to maintain continuous coverage, and a significant break could lead to a 30 percent penalty on top of their premiums, for up to a year.
Lesley Stahl: He has been through so much?
JOE BIDEN: We have to restore the integrity of this country internationally. We have to get off of this God awful effort on this President's part to divide the country. We have to bring the middle class back. We have to have a health care policy that makes sense, that is doable, which I can do by-- and by building on Obamacare. And we have to have an immigration policy that, in fact, is rational and reasonable and represents who we are. They are all the reasons why I'm running, among others. But, look, the next President of the United States also is going to have to stand on the stage on day one and lead the world. They are going to have to be able to know what they are doing internationally. And the other leaders are going to have to know who that person is and know that person knows them. And I'm the best qualified person by a long shot of anybody running to do that. That's why I'm running.
Harlan Ellison AP Photo At 5'5, science fiction writer Harlan Ellison (May 27, 1934-June 28, 2018) was bullied as a youth, which may have fueled his loud-mouthed attitude, once punching an Ohio State University professor who said he lacked writing talent. He brought that pugnacious style to his work, penning nightmarish, sometimes darkly humorous stories. He wrote some 50 books and more than 1,400 articles, essays, TV scripts and screenplays, and earned nearly a dozen Nebula and Hugo awards. He once said he wanted his stories to grab you by the throat and tear off parts of your body. Some of his most popular works were surrealistic fantasies set in grisly worlds run by totalitarians and conformists. A Boy and His Dog, set in a world devastated by nuclear war, featured a protagonist who communicated with his dog via telepathy; he recently expanded the novella into a full-length novel, Blood's A Rover. He edited the seminal 1967 sci-fi anthology Dangerous Visions, and his short story, I Have No Mouth & I Must Scream, is about the last humans, eternally tortured by a malevolent, godlike computer. His 1967 Star Trek episode, The City on the Edge of Forever, is thought by many to be the best ever, in which a young woman played by Joan Collins is saved from a fatal accident by the starship Enterprise's time-traveling Dr. McCoy. Later, the ship's Capt.
Community colleges are damn near free now, and almost anyone can afford community college, Clovis told the publication.
The battle between the two has instead leaned on state issues like education, Medicaid expansion and gas taxes. Mississippi is one of 14 states that didn't expand Medicaid in 2010, a policy Hood promises to reverse. Reeves, meanwhile, says that doing so would be an Obamacare expansion.
The White House is preparing for what officials are calling the Schumer shutdown on Friday, Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney said at a press briefing.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Last month the top three elected officials in Virginia, all Democrats, became entangled in a series of scandals. The governor, Ralph Northam, and the Secretary of State, Mark Herring, faced accusations of racist behavior in their past, but the accusations facing Lieutenant Governor Justin Fairfax were of a different sort. Two women, Doctor Vanessa Tyson and Meredith Watson, accused Fairfax of sexual assault. He has denied the allegations. CBS THIS MORNING co-host Gayle King spoke with both women separately in their first television interview since they came forward with their allegations. Doctor Tyson is a political science professor at Scripps College. Here is some of their conversation.
President Donald Trump: --the corner. We have turned the corner.
Azar and other Trump officials have hinted for weeks that the plan would, in part, dismantle the convoluted system of rebates between drugmakers and the health care middlemen known as pharmacy benefit managers, which negotiate price concessions for insurers, employers and other large customers.
As the Senate reconvenes to cross more items off our to-do list, we should take pride in all we have already accomplished this summer, McConnell said in opening remarks for the August session. Important work remains for the weeks ahead.
Nine in 10 Republicans and six in 10 independents disapprove of how the President is handling terrorism, while two-thirds of Democrats approve.
SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: --we have the best military in the world.
Trump has flirted with running for president numerous times before, but he's never quite taken the plunge. Now that he's officially in the race, he said Tuesday, he feels liberated.
In a preview of the 2019 budget, the White House on Sunday focused on Trump's $1.5 trillion plan for the nation's crumbling infrastructure. He also will ask for a $13 billion increase over two years for opioid prevention, treatment and long-term recovery. A request of $23 billion for border security, including $18 billion for a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border and money for more detention beds for detained immigrants, is part of the budget, too.
New York Governor Cuomo announced Thursday that New York is extending open enrollment for health insurance through May 15 while California is expanding its special enrollment period until June 30.
The president will discuss how the economy is faring under his leadership, specifically focusing on deregulation efforts and the tax cuts passed in 2017.
Mitchell and Sganga note that seniors are among a critical voting bloc that the president is courting, in an effort to make up ground with a group that some polls say he could be losing steam with.
Between now and Inauguration Day, the team must fill the new administration with 4,000 political appointees. That's 4,000 new hires in just nine weeks.
RADDATZ: Thank you very much. We're going to move on...
MARGARET BRENNAN: When he says the ugly stuff, may be because of the Russians. Sounds like you're saying no.
But the trade deficit in goods with China was $343 billion in 2014 - significantly below what Trump has suggested in multiple statements.
The HHS inspector general's long-awaited report chastised the department for flouting federal travel rules, which require officials to book trips in the most cost-efficient way for taxpayers. Price announced his departure in September 2017 over the controversy.
JAMELLE BOUIE: I think the-- the problem is that precisely because President Trump's framing is of this dire sort of violent, you know, crisis at the border, and he's not talking about the human-- human-- humanitarian aspect. They're sort of-- there's no-- there's no real space to give him credit. It also does not help the President that he wants to withdraw funding to the-- the relevant countries or-- or aid to the relevant countries that he is not working as closely as he could with the Mexican government to help manage the flow of-- of migrants to the United States that there are all these levers of policy that President Trump could take that he's either not doing or actively pushing against, which just exacerbate the problem. And I-- I think also (INDISTINCT) to which he hasn't-- he's been saying, we're going to close the border for so long--
Donald Trump is different. I said starting back in June that he was not fit to be president and commander-in-chief. And many Republicans and independents have said the same thing. What we all saw and heard on Friday was Donald talking about women, what he thinks about women, what he does to women. And he has said that the video doesn't represent who he is.
After a gas attack in Syria, she held up pictures of injured children, blaming Russian-backed forces. How many more children have to die before Russia cares? she said.
9:00 p.m. The candidates, Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton and Republican nominee Donald Trump, have just walked onto the debate stage.
Allow retirees age 55 and over to buy into Medicare.
Even as he expressed his regret about this shortcoming, pleading with Americans to help him strive for a better politics, Mr. Obama couldn't resist diving back into the political fray with combative remarks about the GOP.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Did he need to be told that?
State Attorney General Patrick Morrisey, who is running against Manchin, is tying himself closely to the president and his policies. His campaign issued a memo this past week saying Mr. Trump's support has a larger impact in this race than any Senate race in the country. He is welcoming the President to West Virginia with open arms.
PAUL RYAN: So to the serious point, we are still in shutdown. We're waiting for the Senate Democrats to open the government back up. This is solely done by the Senate Democrats. It's absolutely meaningless. They shut down the government over a completely unrelated issue. And the bill that they're opposing is a bill that they support which is just baffling to us.
One week after the general election, on November 10, the justices are poised to consider again the fate of the Affordable Care Act, the 2010 health care law enacted under former President Barack Obama's administration. In 2012, the Supreme Court upheld the law's individual mandate in a pivotal decision, in which Chief Justice John Roberts joined the four liberal justices in ruling that Congress had the authority to enforce the mandate under its taxing power.
In 2017, the Trump administration announced it would broaden an exemption to the contraceptive coverage requirement that previously applied to houses of worship, such as churches, synagogues and mosques. But the administration's change was blocked by courts.
On Tuesday, Minnesota has two Senate primary elections, and Connecticut, Vermont, and Wisconsin each have one Senate primary election.
MARGARET BRENNAN: As Commander-in-chief what would you do differently with China? What leverage would you use to get them to capitulate on trade?
A recent analysis by Moody's Analytics estimates that Trump's economic policies might spark a recession, while Clinton's policies might boost GDP and lower unemployment. Moody's, which has been monitoring and analyzing credit risk for over a century, can hardly be considered part of the liberal media that supposedly opposes Trump.
Oh, my crying (Oh, my crying),
Mr. Trump has made 24 visits to Mar-a-Lago, totaling all or part of 149 days, according to CBS News White House correspondent Mark Knoller. And Mr. Trump has made 135 visits to Trump-branded golf clubs, totaling all or part of 191 days, by Knoller's count.
Since 1996, immigrants who didn't qualify to get a Social Security card numbers have been able to apply for an Individual Taxpayer Identification Number (ITIN) from the IRS. ITINs were originally granted to foreign citizens who were active investors in the American real estate market.
Good news is Melania's speech got more publicity than any in the history of politics especially if you believe that all press is good press! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 20, 2016
He also declared that the American people have a choice to make when it comes to the starkly different views between Democrats and Republicans over how to address income inequality. Seemingly dismissive of conservative economic concerns, the president said, Food Stamp recipients didn't cause the financial crisis; recklessness on Wall Street did. Immigrants aren't the reason wages haven't gone up enough.
Overall, Trump's approval rating remained relatively steady -- 42% approve of the job he is doing, compared to 54% who disapprove. The president's approval numbers have barely changed since June.
Turnout is always been low in Kentucky for these off-year elections. Last time when I won it was in the low thirties. It's going to be somewhere in the mid-thirties, I would say. What the president coming does is just reminds people, 'Oh, there's an election tomorrow?' It actually reminds people that tomorrow is Election Day. So that's good, no matter how people vote, Bevin told reporters in Winchester.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Lanhee, I-- I want to ask you about someone you know who you worked with in a prior campaign, and that is Rick Grenell--
Major Garrett digs into the politics and process of passing the American Rescue Plan, and tries to answer the question, $2 trillion for what?
President Donald Trump: It was our Justice Department that's helping her. And, you know, people aren't so-- they're not liking her so much, because she's got everybody locked down.
In addition to reprivatizing the student loan industry, which many critics contend would raise costs to borrowers, the GOP platform declares that states should be empowered to allow a wide array of accrediting and credentialing bodies to operate.
What America needs, Trump continued, is more action, less talk.
JOHN DICKERSON: So what does that mean? Everybody knows what looking for work looks like. But what does that mean in terms of policy change even at the very local level?
Regarding the burden of more than $1.3 trillion in student loans that more than 43 million Americans owe, Clovis said Trump would ensure that colleges have more skin in the game by sharing the risk for borrowing, adding that colleges should be more vigilant in choosing students likely to graduate on time. He also sees more local banks partnering with student and colleges to ensure college success.
Nevertheless, any premium relief is welcome news, especially for people who don't qualify for government subsidies designed to help with premium costs. These consumers have been bearing the brunt of premium increases in the past few years.
SENATOR JOHN BARRASSO: You know as a doctor people say to me what does this mean to me. And for right now, very little if you're a doctor, if you're getting treatment, if you have a preexisting condition, if you signed up for Obamacare on this recent sign up period, it doesn't change a thing.
These are very good people, but they are angry. They want their lives back again, Trump tweeted. We're not in a political crisis where we should just negotiate and find some common ground here. We're a public health crisis, Whitmer said.
Trump boasted of his victory in a tweet Friday morning:
Washington — The Supreme Court ruled Monday that insurance companies can collect $12 billion from the federal government to cover their losses in the early years of the health care law championed by President Barack Obama.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Prosecutors also said he provided information concerning contacts with persons connected to the White House during 2017 to 2018. Can you tell us who he was in contact with?
Many on the right have also made a big deal about Lamb's abortion stance, noting his insistence that, as a Catholic, he was personally opposed to the practice. But he also said he would vote against a 20-week abortion ban, which again places him firmly in the liberal camp. (As a sidenote, Lamb's I'm against abortion, but argument isn't exactly novel, having been boilerplate Catholic Democrat messaging for some 40 years now.)
RADDATZ: What do you think will happen if Aleppo falls?
10:24 p.m. ET Melania Trump said her husband has always been an amazing leader and she said she's proud of Republican voters' choice for president.
Texas' opposition to the recommendation, Patrick said, has nothing to do with being against a transgender or gay child and is not a partisan issue.
Health and medical advocacy groups have slammed the legislation through all of its forms. The president of the American Medical Association, Andrew W. Gurman, warned Wednesday millions of Americans will lose their health insurance as a direct result of this proposal.
The report didn't address constitutional arguments in a Texas court case against the ACA brought by red-state officials. But its economic analysis could have a bearing on that case.
Whether it was President Obama or President Bush or President Trump I vote for whatever is in the best interest of our country, Donnelly said. I'll work with any president. I don't work for any president.
10:00 a.m. ET Donald Trump's convention manager and campaign chair Paul Manafort stressed the importance of party unity ahead of the convention kickoff Monday, pointing to Trump's running mate, Gov. Mike Pence of Indiana, as one reason the unification process has accelerated.

I think there are lots of people who are really – they are pretty happy with their private insurance, so the way to go at this is a buy into Medicare, no matter what age you are, Slotkin said.
SENATOR JOHN BARRASSO: I think that--
BIDEN: No I don't. Look, are you telling me that we should go into China because- go to war with China because what they're doing to the Uyghurs, a million Uyghurs, in the- out in the West in concentration camps? Is that what you're saying to me?
Vice President Mike Pence: And-- and I'm looking forward to it with our family.
That's not stopping Democrats from featuring health care in the campaign's earliest ads.
More Than A Vote and the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, Inc. launched a 30-second ad that will air during gme 2 of the NBA Eastern Conference Finals. The ad, titled We Got Next, focuses on recruiting younger people to become poll workers and is narrated by Portland Trail Blazers guard CJ McCollum. The ad features visuals of NBA players kneeling, activists protesting and footage of young people staffing polling Glocations. We got a legacy to uphold. People to make proud, McCollum says in the ad. We got to take advantage of the moment. Of the momentum. To protect our power, be the vanguards of our voices. Sherrilyn Ifill, the president and director-counsel of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, said in a statement that COVID-19 has disproportionately impacted Black communities and that the elderly population is particularly vulnerable to the virus, reports CBS News campaign reporter Jack Turman. For decades, we have relied on our seniors to staff polling places on Election Day, Ifill added in her statement. This year, we are making the call to young people to serve so that we can protect our vote and protect our seniors during this pandemic. This is an important, powerful, and urgent call to action to serve our communities in one of the most consequential elections in our lifetime.
Republicans in Congress have tried repeatedly to overturn the Affordable Care Act, most recently attempting and failing in February to override President Obama's veto of legislation which would have gutted much of the law.
Her message for Republican candidates on Obamacare: move on.
He's not un-American. Donald Trump is fundamentally un-American… Rick Wilson said. He doesn't believe in the role of a president as a leader of a nation. Instead, Donald Trump looks at the presidency as a way to enrich himself and aggrandize himself. And these are just fundamentally different categories.
The court denied a request by 20 mainly Democratic states and the Democratic-led House of Representatives to decide quickly on a lower-court ruling that declared part of the statute unconstitutional and cast a cloud over the rest.
Retailers and technology stocks also sank. Some of the biggest losses are going to utilities and real estate companies, which have done better than the rest of the market during the turbulence of the last three months.
This comes as the Justice Department shifted legal positions this week and argued the entire Affordable Care Act should be invalidated.
2:30 p.m. ET Trump's tweet in response to the Baton Rouge shooting came as the head of the Cleveland Police Patrolmen's Association, told CBS News that the group plans to ask Ohio Gov. John Kasich to declare a state of emergency and issue and executive order to ban open carry until the end of the RNC, saying that it's irresponsible at this time to allow open carry.
LANNY DAVIS: Let's see what the facts show.
TRUMP STATEMENT: I don't like Assad at all but Assad is killing ISIS. Russia is killing ISIS and Iran is killing ISIS and those three have now lined up because of our weak foreign policy.
Lesley Stahl: No-- as a matter of fact, I don't know that.
Lesley Stahl: But why is this still an issue? Why do people, they're not gonna vote on that--
Joe Osborn Magnolia Pictures, The Wrecking Crew The Wrecking Crew was the name given the unsung heroes of many '60s pop hits – session musicians, gifted in jazz, classical, blues and rock, who served as backup for artists like Herb Albert, Glen Campbell, Frank Sinatra, the Beach Boys, Simon & Garfunkel, the Mamas and the Papas, and Sonny and Cher. Among their number was bassist Joe Osborn (August 28, 1937-December 14, 2018), who performed on Bridge Over Troubled Water, California Dreamin', Aquarius/Let the Sun Shine In, MacArthur Park, Windy, and the theme song of the TV show The Monkees, among hundreds of others. Play excerpt: Aquarius/Let the Sun Shine In Play excerpt: California Dreamin' Play excerpt: The Monkees Theme Song After Osborn moved from L.A. to Nashville he performed with Merle Haggard, Reba McIntire, Kenny Rogers, Chet Atkins, Neil Young, Billy Joel and Bob Dylan. In a 2013 interview with KHCS DJ Chris May, Osborn recalled how in the 1950s, when he first took up the electric bass, he was criticized by other bass players for using a pick, telling him, 'The bass should be felt and not heard.' I didn't pay any attention to that!
Of course, it's hard to pin down exactly how much Mr. Trump has to do with the added jobs. And experts warn manufacturing — due to the globalized economy and increasing automation of such work— will never be what it was in the first half of the 20th century.
JOHN DICKERSON: The president, you talk about blame for the Democrats and all that. But they're- they're not the only players in this. In 2013, the president, Donald Trump as a civilian said, It always happens to be the top. I mean, the problems start from the top and have to get solved at the top. The top he was talking about was the presidency. So why is this president who came in as a negotiator who said he was going to fix Washington, why is he not contributory to this problem that we have a government- government shutdown--
MARGARET BRENNAN: Terry McAuliffe, still a name floating out there. Stacey Abrams this week, Jamelle, was asked about the idea of her being on the Biden ticket. And she said, You don't run for second place. She seemed to be kind of rebuffing this idea.
He means a 5% surtax on household incomes over $5 million and a roll back of President Trump's 2017 cuts for the wealthy.

CLINTON: Well, 67 percent of the people voted to re-elect me when I ran for my second term, and I was very proud and very humbled by that.
Harris snuck in a quick reply. Good line, she told Pence.
Under the current broken system, a single immigrant can bring in virtually unlimited numbers of distant relatives.
Lesley Stahl: You said that lobbyists owned politicians because they give them money.
Barrett's thoughts on Roe v. Wade, the 1973 landmark Supreme Court decision that established a woman's right to an abortion, were also scrutinized by Democrats on the panel. She also declined to commit to recusing from any case stemming from the 2020 presidential election that ends up before the Supreme Court.
Indiana Republican Mike Braun is not a witch. He hasn't suggested Second Amendment remedies for an overreaching Congress, nor does he have anything to say about legitimate rape.
The president praised the Cajun Navy that helped save lives in the wake of Hurricane Harvey last year. He noted strangers who helped each other after the mass shooting in Las Vegas.
The Democratic differences over healthcare come as the constitutionality of Obamacare is tested by the Trump Administration in federal court due to the taxation provision of the law, a move that could ultimately place its fate in the hands of the Supreme Court.
And he was still fighting when time ran out.
Anthony Senecal, who worked as Donald Trump's butler for 17 years at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida and knows he billionaire Republican presidential candidate well, frequently expresses his hatred for President Obama on social media. But his latest missive has drawn the attention of the Secret Service.
I don't do a knee-jerk opposition to the president, she said. I try to figure out each nomination and each policy position based on the merits and I'm going to have to explain it to Missourians.
Preston's reverence for those who have served our nation reminds us of why we salute our flag, why we put our hands on our hearts for the Pledge of Allegiance, and why we proudly stand for the National Anthem.
Terrorism and Islamic extremism have risen dramatically as a concern since the recent attacks in Paris and California. Now one in five Americans volunteer either terrorism generally (14 percent) or Islamic extremism specifically (5 percent) as the most important problem facing the country today, compared to just 2 percent combined in October. For the first time since 2006, terrorism outstrips the economy as the country's top concern.
Lesley Stahl: You don't like it, but your own transition team, it's filled with lobbyists.
Nonetheless, Mr. Trump has repeatedly assured Americans that people with preexisting conditions would still be protected. Neither the White House nor congressional Republicans have specified how.
Two Democratic senators, Patty Murray of Washington and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, held a forum featuring a current and two previous CKE employees complaining they weren't paid for overtime or had to work on breaks. Last month, fast-food workers and others held anti-Puzder demonstrations in 12 cities.
John McCain served his country for over 60 years, as a naval officer, a prisoner of war, a congressman, a six-term senator and a presidential candidate.
That's not our intention or goal. We want to get this done on time. That's our plan, he said.
CHUCK SCHUMER: We disagree. We disagree.
The justices were hearing their third day of arguments conducted by phone because of the coronavirus pandemic. The first of two cases before them Wednesday stemmed from the Obama-era health care law, which requires most employers to cover birth control as a preventive service, at no charge to women, in their insurance plans.
Republicans have a 51-to-49 majority in the Senate, meaning Democrats have to flip a net total of two seats to win back the chamber. But the Republicans are only defending eight Senate seats, and only two of them currently look competitive. Democrats, meanwhile, are defending 25 seats, including a number in states Mr. Trump won in 2016.
MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to get to this question the border wall which I know you're a huge advocate for. We are about five days from a potential government shutdown and Republican leadership says there's no plan. What is the president's plan and will he shut it down to get this 5 billion in border wall funding?
If you're considering one of these plans, many of which are expected to be available in September just before the 2019 ACA open-enrollment period, be sure to read everything you can get your hands about the plan as carefully as you can. You'll want to be sure you understand any limitations in coverage so you can determine if the plan is right for you.
With 55 days until the presidential election, President Trump's campaign announced, it along with the RNC and joint fundraising committees raised more than $210 million in August - $154 million less than Joe Biden and Democrats raised last month with their record $364.5 million cash haul.
While America's relationship and tone with China continues to be debated at the presidential level, House candidate ties to the country are also being magnified. In Pennsylvania's 8th District, CBS News political unit broadcast associate Aaron Navarro reports the largest donor for a single-candidate PAC supporting Republican Jim Bognet, has made more than $1 million in cash fees and stock options from being on the board of a Beijing-based biopharmaceutical company. The donor contributed $60,000 to the Keep PA Great PAC, as well as $5,600 to Bognet's campaign.
Barrett, a Catholic, is considered reliably socially conservative, and conservatives consider her as someone who will faithfully uphold principles of religious liberty from the bench.
Like a lighthouse in the storm, Glenn Kessler tries to cut through the fog of facts as the columnist for The Washington Post's Fact Checker. Business these days is better than ever, he said. Kessler and colleague Michelle Lee assign one to four Pinocchios, using the beloved children's character whose nose grew when he didn't tell the truth.

Minutes later, Jeff Zeleny of The New York Times followed up with a question about his outburst, to which Santorum asked, What speech did you listen to? Stop lying. (watch the full exchange at left)
Another factor may be related to the so-called coverage gap. When the ACA was passed, it mandated that all states expand their Medicaid coverage, including increasing qualifying income limits. At the same time, the ACA ruled that people whose income fell below 100 percent of the poverty level would not qualify for the ACA's government subsidies to help pay health insurance premiums. The assumption was these people would be covered by expanded Medicaid coverage, Collins explained.
Lesley Stahl: Okay. And the president's not coming back?
JOHN DICKERSON: Two things related to the Kavanaugh nomination. First, I want to get your sense-- you talked to a number of your constituents who reached out to you during--
[Barack Obama: I want to emphasize to you, Mr. President-elect, that we now are gonna want to do everything we can to help you succeed, because if you succeed then the country succeeds.]
In this final State of the Union address of his presidency, President Obama issued a warning to the American public: The Union is strong and full of promise, but it risks being dragged down by partisan rancor and divisiveness.
Lesley Stahl: You won't be able to walk down the street--
It's a course correction that's enabling Senate Republicans to motor through their agenda this summer. They're confirming Mr. Trump's new judges, approving funding bills ahead of a government shutdown deadline and laying the groundwork for a fall vote on Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh. They've decided that forfeiting the August break is a small price to pay to prevent another round of Republican-on-Republican infighting before the midterm election.
The president has made lowering Rx drug prices a top priority. Polls show the majority of consumers are frustrated with the high cost of medicine. The administration's package to lower drug costs is long and complex, but ultimately doesn't offer a whole lot of relief to consumers.
Charles Aznavour AP Photo/Claude Paris Over eight decades, the French singer and actor Charles Aznavour (May 22, 1924-October 1, 2018) endeared himself to fans around the world with his versatile tenor, lush lyrics and kinetic stage presence, selling more than 180 million records. Often compared to Frank Sinatra, Aznavour started his career as a songwriter for Edith Piaf. He would write upwards of 1,000 songs by his own estimate, including the classic La Boheme. Play excerpt of Charles Aznavour singing La Boheme He resisted description as a crooner, preferring instead  a songwriter who sometimes performs his own songs. What were my faults? My voice, my size, my gestures, my lack of culture and education, my honesty, or my lack of personality, the 5' 3 inch performer wrote in his autobiography. My voice? I cannot change it. The teachers I consulted all agreed I shouldn't sing, but nevertheless I continued to sing until my throat was sore. He also performed occasionally an an actor, appearing in Francois Truffaut's classic Shoot the Piano Player (1960), The Tin Drum (1979), and Ararat (2002). Of Armenian descent, Aznavour campaigned internationally to get the 1915 massacres of up to 1.5 million Armenians under the Ottoman Empire formally deemed a genocide. He also founded the nonprofit Aznavour and Armenia to aid victims of the 1988 earthquake. He also served in several ambassadorial roles, and in 2001 was awarded France's prestigious National Order of Merit.
Scott Pelley: What does a multibillionaire know about people who are living paycheck to paycheck and hoping that the car doesn't break down?
BIDEN: What I meant was there's a thousand places we could go to deal with injustice. I can think of 10 countries where women and or children and or people are being- are being persecuted or being hurt. But the idea of us going to be able to use our armed forces to solve every single internal problem that exists throughout the world is not within our capacity. The question is is America's vital self-interest at stake or the vital self-interest of one of our allies at stake? And the fact that they have a system in Afghanistan, as they do in parts of Pakistan, as they do in parts of other countries, that we're going to send troops to- because there is not a- a- human rights are not being valued to the same degree that we are, that's a different story about sending combat troops. We should call it out. We should go to the United Nations. We should be saying this is what's happening. We should try to shame and get the world to put pressure on, an economic pressure, on people who engage- countries who engage in that but not send troops. That's what I meant. It is not sufficient. That was my point. And the idea was, and I think Richard had said something like, well women are being abused there. I said they're being abused in a lot of places around the world.
Rep. Anna Eshoo: She constantly is weaving, weaving people together.
Five Democrats said they were backing Sen. Kamala Harris, while another four said they were backin Mayor Pete Buttigieg. Both Harris and Buttigieg were also frequently mentioned as second-choice alternatives, as was Sen. Cory Booker.
Asked about the concern that the final bill hasn't been scored, Collins said, We have the score on the base bill that saves billions and billions of dollars.
While Jason Kelly is optimistic about the future supply of vaccine, Dr. Travis Gayles on the frontline in Montgomery County, Maryland is less upbeat. He told us those most likely to get COVID-19, the county's Black, Brown and poor residents, are least likely to get inoculated. And he says that inequity can't be explained away solely by community hesitance to the vaccine.
Others say pragmatism is pushing them towards Biden.
CBS News campaign reporter LaCrai Mitchell reports that Democratic leaders and voting rights activists weighed in on a federal court ruling Monday, that will allow South Carolina voters to vote absentee in the state's June primary without a witness signature. According to the Brennan Center for Justice, some of the 16 states that require an excuse to vote absentee, have broadly interpreted or modified voting laws to allow all voters to vote by mail in the states' primary contests amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Adriel Cepeda Derieux, a staff attorney with the ACLU's Voting Rights Project, called the ruling a huge victory. The court recognized the gravity of forcing voters to needlessly risk their health to obtain a witness signature, said Derieux in a statement Monday. This ruling means voters in South Carolina can safely cast a ballot in the June primary elections in this time of COVID-19. Susan Dunn, legal director of the ACLU of South Carolina, called the ruling a critical victory for our democracy and all voters in South Carolina. Dunn continued, The elimination of the witness requirement protects not only those who are most vulnerable to the pandemic, it also ensures that no one will have to risk exposure to COVID-19 in order to exercise their fundamental right to vote in the primary elections. DNC chair Tom Perez said in a statement Monday that the ruling is another critical step toward ensuring a safe, fair, and accessible election.
In addition, fraudulent telemarketing calls for health insurance are on the rise. I've gotten at least a call a day from some health care enrollment center that sounds like it might be part of the exchanges but is not, Fish-Parcham said.
It's been a bitter fight over the battle to confirm Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court. Hawley would support him, while McCaskill did not.
In the six-decade history of Face the Nation, Sen. John McCain was our most frequent guest, with 112 total appearances. Former moderator Bob Schieffer, who conducted most of those interviews, looks back on some of McCain's memorable Sunday morning appearances and his impact on American life.
SENATOR JOHN BARRASSO: Well, I know we're trying in the House and the Senate to come up with a proposal to get passed in both of those bodies before Friday the twenty-first and then send that to the White House which I hope the President would choose to sign.
President Trump in Oval Office meeting: You know, Nancy's in a situation where it's not easy for her to talk right now.
New Jersey Senator Cory Booker released a plan to reduce child poverty in the United States, according to CBS News campaign reporter Jack Turman. Booker would create a child allowance for families with children and would expand the Child Tax Credit. The child allowance would come from an authorization of a monthly payment program under which families with younger children would receive a monthly allowance of $300 and a monthly allowance of $250 for families with older children up to 18 years of age.
A former county attorney, Klobuchar was first elected to the Senate in 2006 and easily won reelection to a third term in 2018 with a 24-point margin. She is known for her willingness to work in a bipartisan fashion, and has sponsored 111 pieces of legislation that have been signed into law.
Mr. Trump has held rallies for the Republican nominees in both states as Republicans try to focus both races on national issues such as immigration and impeachment. The president remains popular in Kentucky and Mississippi and hopes he can turn out his base in what are typically low-turnout elections.
Ken Berry Warner Brothers/ABC A song-and-dance man who, while in the Army's Special Services entertainment branch served under Sgt. Leonard Nimoy, Ken Berry (November 3, 1933-December 1, 2018) had hoped for a career in movie musicals. But as that genre died out in Hollywood, he found himself a popular presence in television comedy, from guest appearances on musical variety shows (including Carol Burnett's, Glen Campbell's and Sony & Cher's), to starring roles in the sitcoms F Troop (as the pratfall-prone Captain Parmenter), Mayberry RFD and Mama's Family. He also performed musical numbers in Las Vegas revues, and starred in family films like The Cat From Outer Space and Herbie Rides Again. A self-described working actor who loved his calling, despite the rejections and hard work he experienced in building up a career, Berry prided himself for being on time, knowing his lines, and not costing anybody any money, he said in a 2012 interview for the Television Academy Foundation.
Can you do that without mandates? asked co-host Charlie Rose. That's what drove the opposition to Obamacare.
But I think it's also important to point out where there are some misleading accusations from critics and others. After a year-long investigation, there is no evidence that anyone hacked the server I was using and there is no evidence that anyone can point to at all — anyone who says otherwise has no basis — that any classified material ended up in the wrong hands.
On this issue, Clinton has the advantage.
Needless to say, President Trump does not have high approval ratings to cushion any blow to the GOP, and if anything, Democrats will be trying to use his unpopularity to sink Republicans across the country.
Republicans are hoping their ideas will spur insurers to offer more affordable products tailored to younger people and consumers of modest means.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Trevor, in an op-ed this week, you say that the President could become the target of a very serious campaign finance investigation--a criminal one. One of the defenders of the President say, This-- this is small ball. This isn't something that actually gets-- while it gets to the doorstep of the President, it doesn't actually become something that could really become a legal issue for him. Why do you disagree?
Lesley Stahl: Let me ask you what you think your-- the biggest domestic priority is for you right now.
However, when ideological or political goals (such as lower taxes for the wealthy or reduced regulation so that businesses can exploit market imperfections) lead to attacks on those who call for government to make markets work better -- often in the guise of getting government out of the way of the market system -- it undermines government's ability to promote the competitive market system the opponents claim to support.
JOHN DICKERSON: Okay. So, what just to remind people you're not saying that it is chiseled in stone that Democrats will take-- will take the House. You're saying right now as trends go forward it looks like the Democrats have a shot, give me-- run me through those two scenarios and how they play out.
After transferring 8 million dollars split evenly between the National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC) and the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC) in July, the RNC started August with $41.9 million cash-on-hand and no debt.

4:10 p.m. ET With Melania Trump scheduled to take the stage tonight, Jennifer De Pinto, Manager of Surveys for CBS News, sends over some information on how she's viewed in polls:
Mr. Trump has previously expressed support for government-funded health care. In an interview with 60 Minutes as a candidate in 2015, Mr. Trump said that the uninsured will be taken care of much better than they're taken care of now and the government's gonna pay for it.
President Trump announced Saturday his intent to nominate Barrett, a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit, to the Supreme Court. If confirmed, Barrett will fill the seat left vacant following the death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg earlier this month.
What you saw for the first time with Palin was someone who was breathtakingly dishonest not being held to account for her breathtaking dishonesty by a lot of news organizations, particularly those with a partisan agenda, he said. She was unfit in a profound level.
Clovis appears to be underinformed on community college expenses: The gap between the cost of community colleges and four-year schools has narrowed in recent years.
The Supreme Court has done its work, she said, and now we have to do ours.
Lesley Stahl: So do you still think it's rigged?
Trump delivered his grand announcement from the lobby of a skyscraper that bears his name in Manhattan. He was introduced by his daughter Ivanka, who noted, perhaps unnecessarily, My father is the opposite of politically correct. He says what he means and he means what he says.
MARGARET BRENNAN: And there's no date for that to happen?
Roberts pointed out that's only for people who already have insurance.
At a press briefing from the Coronavirus Task Force on Sunday afternoon, Mr. Trump expressed his support for guaranteed healthcare coverage for Americans with pre-existing conditions. Well, that's a lawsuit coming out of Texas. Again, that was headed up by Texas, Mr. Trump said, probed about the pending case. And what we want to do is get rid of the bad healthcare and put in a great healthcare. And I will say this, I can make this commitment to you: The Republican Party is fully backing preexisting conditions.
While the president refers to drug pushers and drug dealers, 80 percent of heroin users developed their addiction because of a previous addiction to prescription opioids, according to the federal government.
Even some Republicans concede the issue will be a tough one.
The Ohio governor will be the last Republican... 01:01 John Kasich enters a crowded field of Republican candidates Tuesday, as he becomes the 16th person to declare he is running for president. It will be an uphill climb for the Ohio governor, who's in the three percent range in national polls. But he does bring three distinct advantages to the race: he'll be the most popular sitting governor running, with a 60-percent approval rating in his state, a June Quinnipiac poll says, a presidential operation with more than $11 million in the bank, and a long resume that includes nearly 20 years in Congress, the statehouse in Ohio and time in the private sector. Kasich's shot at moving up in the polls may come if one of his opponents starts sinking. He's a business-friendly governor that will appeal to the same crowd as former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie. Plus, he has Christie's brash style that appeals to some voters, but with a better state economic record to back up his leadership. Republican voters do like the style that Chris Christie made famous back in 2012, the style of where you just don't take criticism sitting down, Ohio State University Political Science Professor Paul Beck told CBS News. Kasich may be able to differentiate himself from Bush within that same niche as being more like Chris Christie and less like Jeb Bush. Click through to learn five things to know about John Kasich.
Blue Earth County, which includes Mankato, voted for President Obama twice and then flipped for Mr. Trump in 2016, reports CBS News campaign reporter Jack Turman. Two years after Trump carried the county by nearly four points, the county overwhelmingly supported Democratic Senators Amy Klobuchar and Tina Smith. The county includes a younger population who attend Minnesota State University, Mankato, a rural population outside of Mankato and a refugee population. Mark Halverson, the chair of the Blue Earth County Democratic Farmer Labor (DFL) Party, said he expects Biden to win the county, adding that Trump's character has turned off people in the county. A lot of people thought he was maybe going to be a breath of fresh air, but you know he's been just the opposite, he added. He's kind of bogged everything down in personality conflicts and temper tantrums. Blue Earth County is also in Minnesota's first congressional district, where Democrats are hoping to unseat Republican incumbent congressman Jim Hagedorn. Hagedorn flipped this district in 2018, defeating 2018 Democratic congressional candidate Dan Feehan. It is a rematch of 2018, with Feehan is challenging Hagedorn again in 2020.
As Clinton's appearance drew closer, John Legend's version of Wake Up Everybody reverberated through the arena. It was hard to tell whether it was the same-sex marriage news or the candidate that was exciting the crowd. Clinton was introduced by her longtime friend Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe.
Asked about court reforms like these during his New York Times editorial board interview in January, Biden said he did not support any of them.
Rep. Karen Bass: I-- I like the way that the president can't figure out--
Emanuel also had suggestions for what patients should ask their doctors: The first one is, do they do open access scheduling? Which means, they start the day with half of their appointment slots empty for people who walk in or happen to get sick or happen to find that they have the time and they need that checkup done. Open access scheduling is very important; it's so the doctor doesn't say, 'I'll see you in six weeks,' or double-book you, and everyone is waiting and being annoyed.
When is Trump's speech to Congress?
MAN #2: It's been tense at times to think about, like, you know, the possibility of getting infected, the possibility of bringing home an infection.
Heller has never been particularly popular and may have endangered himself further by casting a vote in favor of the GOP's unpopular Obamacare replacement legislation. And even if he outmaneuvers Tarkanian in the primary, he'll be up against a strong Democratic challenger in Rep. Jacky Rosen.
TRUMP: Why don't you interrupt her?
JONAH GOLDBERG: And if Trump wins fifty-one percent of that argument about defining the terms, it's very good for him. If he loses it, it's very bad for him.
What you should know before Tuesday, August 21: Primary Overview
I don't think there should be any questions about her faith, he said Monday morning.
Instead of instead of, you know, essentially reading excerpts and saying, Do you remember saying that? which seemed to be all for the purpose of trying to catch him in something that could be called a lie. But, again, because the FBI knew about the call, there was nothing wrong with the call, the FBI has the transcript of the call, whether or not he remembered saying something is not material to anything.
McCain said that when she was working on the eulogy before her father's death, she did not know Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump would be attending the funeral. A funeral is obviously a sacred time, and I thought that my family had made it clear, or at least I had, that the Trumps were unwelcome around me, she said.
For weeks, Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wisconsin, insisted that the bill would only come to the floor when Republicans had the votes to pass it. They can only afford 21 defections, assuming all Democrats vote against it. Rep. Dan Newhouse, R-Washington, will miss the AHCA vote, his office confirmed to CBS News. He's out of town due to a family emergency. This means that Republicans can afford 21 defections.
Asked about Feinstein's comments, Coons said religious faith should not be at issue here.
Pence said GOP voters nominated a man who never quits, who never backs down and who's a fighter and a winner.
JOE BIDEN: You said it, my firewall.
He expressed robust support for the promise of Medicare to seniors.
She says she doesn't trust Attorney General William Barr.
Your responses are critical for our negotiations to continue, the California Democrat told Mnuchin in the letter dated Thursday. The president's words that 'after the election, we will get the best stimulus package you have ever seen' only have meaning if he can get Mitch McConnell to take his hand off the pause button and get Senate Republican chairmen moving toward agreement with their House counterparts.
Bill Whitaker: You can handle more?

I would also consider arming the Kurds. The Kurds have been our best partners in Syria, as well as Iraq. And I know there's a lot of concern about that in some circles, but I think they should have the equipment they need so that Kurdish and Arab fighters on the ground are the principal way that we take Raqqa after pushing ISIS out of Iraq.
Cruz, in his comments to reporters, later lamented how unproductive Congress had been under Boehner's leadership, ticking off a number of conservative policy positions that were never passed while Boehner was House speaker.
Donald Trump: Well, I think in some cases, you have professional protesters. And we had it-- if you look at WikiLeaks, we had--
A third approach also is possible, which has been tried without much success. That's sponsoring high-risk medical plans with higher premiums to reflect the increased risk for people with preexisting conditions. Predictably, enrollment in such plans has been low because the premiums are often out of reach for the target audience (see below).
Asked if former Speaker Dennis Hastert should go to prison as a result of violating federal banking laws in a hush-money case involving allegations of sexual abuse, Ryan declined to answer directly.
MARGARET BRENNAN: As we mentioned you sit on the Judiciary Committee, I want to ask you about some testimony before your committee this week from Customs and Border Patrol. We mentioned the-- the case here of this seven-year-old from Guatemala, this migrant girl who died tragically after passing into U.S. territory. Should the commissioner of CBP said to you during that testimony that this had happened? It wasn't disclosed until days later.
As Congress sought an end to the impasse, parents fretted over how they would pay for health care for their kids, many with special needs. And states caught in the political crossfire tried hard to balance the administration of dwindling CHIP funds and the obligation to notify CHIP parents that funding may soon end.
SENATOR JOHN BARRASSO: I would certainly hope not. I'm working to the fact of keeping the government open. I think that's what the American people expect of the people that they elect; keep the government open. And if there's any sort of a shutdown, it would certainly only be a partial shutdown. Remember, Margaret, we, through the appropriations process, already have approved seventy-five percent of the funding for the government for the next year. But I still think it's better to not have any sort of, even a partial shutdown whether it's over Christmas or anytime. I don't think people benefit by that.
We're going to be doing some trade deals as soon as we get the health care finished - oh, I'm looking forward to these trade deals, Trump said, seeming to sing those last two words as the audience applauded.
Monday marks 10 years since President Obama signed the Affordable Care Act, also referred to as Obamacare, into law. The anniversary comes at a time of national emergency amid the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, notes CBS News campaign reporter Nicole Sganga. The ten-year mark also hits just weeks after the Supreme Court agreed to hear a case brought forward by Republican state officials against the law. Justices are set to review a federal appeals court decision that found part of the law — Congress' 2017 removal of the individual mandate clause, requiring citizens to possess health insurance — unconstitutional. Though timing is up to the Supreme Court Justices, oral arguments are likely to fall around the time of the 2020 presidential general election in November, with a decision due in spring or summer 2021. The litigation aimed at eliminating the centerpiece of Mr. Obama's legacy is backed by the Trump administration.
The president has been doing interviews, conference calls, and posting online videos. Press Secretary Josh Earnest is on Instagram with behind-the-scenes material on speech preparation. The White House has even launched a site on Snapchat to attract viewers to Tuesday night's speech.
Lesley Stahl: Okay, I don't wanna bicker over that.
John McCain Brian Snyder/REUTERS He was an American hero and a maverick. By most standards, Arizona Senator John McCain (August 29, 1936-August 25, 2018) was a man of courage and zealously-guarded ideals. The son and grandson of four-star Navy admirals, McCain was a rebellious student who, by his own volition, didn't conform to the rules and regulations of either high school or the Naval Academy. Nevertheless, he volunteered for combat duty during the Vietnam War, and was shot down during a bombing mission. Severely injured, McCain was captured and held at the so-called Hanoi Hilton, enduring torture and frequent beatings. He remained in captivity for five-and-a-half years, rejecting an early release when he refused to leave his fellow POWs behind. In 1982, he took his fighting spirit to Washington, as a Congressman and later Senator, standing out for his straight talk, especially on subjects like campaign finance and climate change. He ran for president in 2000, and again in 2008, when he won the Republican nomination to run against Senator Barack Obama. One of the most forceful voices in the Senate, where he led the Armed Services Committee, he wasn't afraid to buck his own party, voting last year against the Republicans' attempt to kill Obamacare. I was raised in the concept and belief that duty, honor, country is the lodestar for the behavior that we have to exhibit every single day, he told CBS News.
So, when I saw Congressman Bishop smiling at the White House after voting to gut protections for pre-existing conditions, something inside me broke, Slotkin said. I'm running for Congress, and I approve this message because Mr. Bishop, that's dereliction of duty and it's a fireable offense. While Slotkin narrates this portion of the ad, video footage of Bishop smiling at the White House on May 4, 2017 plays.
After longtime New Jersey Senator Frank Lautenberg died in the summer of 2013, Booker ran to fill his seat and defeated a little-known Republican mayor in a special election. In 2014, he won reelection to serve a full term in the Senate. During his years in the Senate, he has sought to promote bipartisanship through conciliatory rhetoric. Booker announced he was running for president on Feb. 1, 2019, the first day of Black History Month. Issues He has made criminal justice reform and the decriminalization of marijuana integral issues of his agenda in the Senate. Pointing to the disproportionate incarceration of minorities for marijuana-related offenses, he crafted the Marijuana Justice Act in the summer of 2017. The bill would remove marijuana from the 1970 Controlled Substances Act, withhold federal funding for states which continue to criminalize the substance, require courts to expunge convictions for marijuana use or possession and establish a federal fund to help low-income communities affected by the so-called war on drugs. The junior senator from New Jersey is one of the chief architects of the First Step Act, a landmark bill that President Trump signed into law in December after rare overwhelming bipartisan support in Congress. The legislation increases investment in programs to curb recidivism among federal prisoners and modifies several sentencing laws, including mandatory minimum sentences for nonviolent drug offenders. Although he hopes to tout it as a signature achievement of his career in Congress, Booker acknowledged that the bill is just one stepping stone to overhaul the criminal justice system.
The issue of health care is again emerging at the center of the 2020 Democratic platform. Most candidates have embraced the idea of universal health care, most notably Vermont Independent Sen. Bernie Sanders who is advocating a Medicare for All plan.
Now, we're at a point where we are so fragile and so week economically as - as a country, it's a very, very scary thing, he said. The last thing you can be do - is - doing is raising taxes.
Democrats in Kentucky have framed Tuesday's vote as a referendum on Bevin and focused on local issues such as education and healthcare. At the recent Carl D. Perkins Memorial Breakfast in Pike County, in the heart of the state's coal country, Beshear said the state cannot survive another four years of Matt Bevin.
But Roberts has also helped deliver rulings this term deemed to be victories for conservatives. He was in the 7-2 majority of a decision upholding the Trump administration's broad exemptions to employers who raise religious and moral objections to Obamacare's contraceptive mandate, as well as in a 7-2 ruling that found federal employment laws don't apply to teachers at religious schools whose duties include religious education.
I would be thrilled if the Republican Party just tried to compete on the issue of health care, Cannon said, arguing that the administration has been effective on conservative policy, such as expanding short term health care plans. Still, Cannon said he's skeptical of the administration's new approach.
The chances of former Sheriff Joe Arpaio, who was convicted of contempt and then pardoned by Mr. Trump last year, getting elected to the U.S. Senate are exceptionally low. But he's running in the GOP primary to replace retiring Republican Sen. Jeff Flake anyway. The winner of that primary is almost certain to face Democratic Rep. Kristen Sinema in the general election, and her party is bullish on flipping this Sun Belt seat in what was until recently deep red territory.
Nancy Wilson Ronald Zak/AP Photo The polished pop-jazz vocals of Nancy Wilson (February 20, 1937-December 13, 2018) made her a platinum artist and top concert performer. Influenced by Dinah Washington, Nat King Cole and others, Wilson covered everything from jazz standards to Little Green Apples, and in the 1960s alone released eight albums that reached the top 20 on Billboard's pop charts. Born in Chillicothe, Ohio, the eldest of six children of an iron foundry worker and a maid, Wilson sang in church as a girl and by age 4 had decided on her profession. In high school she won a local TV station's talent contest and was given her own program. When she later moved to New York, she soon had a regular gig at The Blue Morocco. Then, a demo recording of Guess Who I Saw Today got her a phone call from Capitol Records. Within six weeks I had all the things I wanted, she said in an interview. Sometimes elegant and understated, or quick and conversational and a little naughty, she was best known for her breakthrough Guess Who I Saw Today, and the 1964 hit (You Don't Know) How Glad I Am, which drew upon Broadway, pop and jazz.
JOE BIDEN: --to make sure that we have a place from which we can operate, if in fact, you find that there's a re-amassing of Taliban capacity, excuse me, of al Qaeda and/or ISIS capacity to strike the United States like happened in 9/11.
JOHN DICKERSON: Why couldn't Congress have fixed that?
60 Minutes' Stahl pushed back, asking whether Wilson feels responsibility for previously promoting a party that had never fully eradicated racist elements.
Lesley Stahl: But are you going to be tweeting and whatever you're upset about just put out there when you're president?
At a rural drive-in church service, Christopher Burwell said he's concerned about what's he heard about President Trump's pick for the Supreme Court, judge Amy Coney Barrett. She will do away with Obamacare, she will do away with Roe v. Wade.
Mr. Carter, I have tried my entire life to do what I can to support children and families. You know, right out of law school, I went to work for the Children's Defense Fund. And Donald talks a lot about, you know, the 30 years I've been in public service. I'm proud of that. You know, I started off as a young lawyer working against discrimination against African-American children in schools and in the criminal justice system. I worked to make sure that kids with disabilities could get a public education, something that I care very much about. I have worked with Latinos — one of my first jobs in politics was down in south Texas registering Latino citizens to be able to vote. So I have a deep devotion, to use your absolutely correct word, to making sure that an every American feels like he or she has a place in our country.
MARGARET BRENNAN: About eighty six hundred is the number of troops.
I wouldn't be proud of it to be honest with you, Bush said. Calling this a sign of desperation, a Kasich top strategists pushed back and countered that Florida's spending on Medicaid increased significantly while Bush was governor.
The COVID-19 bill follows President Joe Biden's strategy of building on the health law to move the U.S. toward coverage for all. It's still unclear how big a dent the legislation will make in the number of uninsured people, which has risen to an estimated 33 million or more.
Tuesday is the third and final day of the 2020 Eid al-Fitr celebrations. This weekend, Muslim communities across the country resorted to new ways to celebrate the holiday marking the end of the holy month of Ramadan, reports CBS News campaign reporter Musadiq Bidar. The three-day holiday after a month of fasting from dawn to sunset is traditionally one that brings families and friends together for large and intimate gatherings, but this year, Muslims relied on Zoom calls, live-stream sermons and drive-through celebrations. Typically, Muslims gather at the mosque on the first morning of Eid, which was on Sunday, for prayers and a sermon. The rest of the day is spent visiting relatives, exchanging gifts — usually cash handouts referred to as Eidi — and hosting food parties. The adjustments the Muslim community had to make for this cultural and religious holiday might prove as a test run for what could happen if there is a second wave of the coronavirus outbreak that hurts the ability of Americans to gather for Thanksgiving and Christmas.
JOHN DICKERSON: I- I want to see if I can get your reaction to something that the Trump campaign has run. It's an ad they're running right now in the middle of these negotiations, where everybody is thinking the other side has bad faith. Let's watch a little bit of it. I want to get your reaction about how this affects things.
The Texas 7th has been controlled by the GOP since a young George H.W. Bush won his first race there in 1966. At 62, John Culberson, the 18-year incumbent who serves on the powerful House Appropriations Committee, has never faced a challenge this difficult: A 43-year-old well-financed Houston attorney named Lizzie Fletcher.
Is Ben Carson the worst campaign surrogate ever?
GOVERNOR NED LAMONT: --and that we're going to keep that going. The only variant could be is if this U.K. variant takes off like wildfire.
There is limited in-person voting in the state Tuesday as well. If voters are disabled or do not have a mailing address, they can vote in-person at the board of elections. In addition, if voters did not receive their absentee ballots, they can cast an in-person provisional ballot at their county board of elections. Precautions are being implemented to maintain safety amid the coronavirus pandemic. In Cuyahoga County, which is home to Cleveland, officials are planning to take voters' temperatures and hoping to maintain social distancing, according to the Cuyahoga County board of elections. In Franklin County, which encompasses Columbus, election board members will have masks and partitions will be in place between election staff and voters.
JAMELLE BOUIE: --as a national politician. And I don't think relative to past contest, even relative to this contest is all that divisive. I see this is just part of everyone's brand management when it comes to the role they're playing in this primary.
TRUMP: Oh, you didn't delete them?
RADDATZ: And why did it morph into that? No, did you — no, answer the question. Do you still believe... TRUMP: Why don't you interrupt her? You interrupt me all the time.
A new poll shows consistently higher approval ratings for governors and their handling of the coronavirus pandemic, according to data by SurveyMonkey and shared with the Washington Post. Of the eight governors running for re-election this year, their combined average was a 72% approval rating. The lowest of this group was Missouri Republican Governor Mike Parson, who had 54%, and the highest was New Hampshire Republican Governor Chris Sununu, who had 82%. Vermont Republican Governor Phil Scott also had a 82% rating, but has not yet finalized his reelection plans says CBS News political unit broadcast associate Aaron Navarro. The poll shows every governor having a higher approval rating than Mr. Trump, except for Georgia's Republican Governor Brian Kemp who tied with the president at 43%. On a Monday teleconference call with first lady Melania Trump and the governors with their respective spouses, Mr. Trump praised Georgia's reopening process. I'm hearing your numbers are going down as you open. That's a pleasant thing to hear, the president said to Kemp, a departure from his previous disagreements with his early reopening.
Well, no charges like that have been brought. And I'm not gonna speculate about what charges there may be.
WHITE HOUSE SENIOR ADVISER STEPHEN MILLER: It's great to be here. Thank you. Merry Christmas.
MARGARET BRENNAN: The Washington Post quoted you this week in a story about Afghanistan, saying that back in 2010 you said to Richard Holbrooke, the then envoy, I'm not sending my boy back there to risk his life on behalf of women's rights. It just won't work. Not what we're there for. Is that how you remember it?
More than half of voters favor a simultaneous repeal and replace of Obamacare: 59 percent said the White House and congressional Republicans should only repeal parts of the current law when they are able to implement a replacement.
I think this administration was creating the tone with North Korea to remind them exactly what could happen to them if they threaten the United States, Haley replied. No one wants war. The president doesn't want war. I don't want war. No one wants war. But it is an option.
QUESTION: Thank you. Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare, it is not affordable. Premiums have gone up. Deductibles have gone up. Copays have gone up. Prescriptions have gone up. And the coverage has gone down. What will you do to bring the cost down and make coverage better?
Billionaire businessman and reality television star Donald Trump officially announced his 2016 presidential candidacy on Tuesday with a promise to do for America what he's always done for himself: nurture the brand.
In the three months since, that gap has widened considerably. In the same average today, only about 33 percent of Americans say we're on the right track, while over 60 percent say we're headed in the wrong direction.
If you're lucky enough to have a pension, it's one of the most important financial decisions you'll have to make: Should you receive your benefits in one lump sum or collect monthly payments? Your choice could spell the difference between a steady income during your golden years, and running out of cash.
The state was removed from the appeal in that case last week and on Tuesday U.S. District Judge Reed O'Connor of Texas withdrew it from the underlying case. O'Connor also issued the order granting Wisconsin's withdrawal from the case seeking to repeal Obamacare. O'Connor ruled in December that the law is unconstitutional, but it remains in effect while the case is under appeal.
JONAH GOLDBERG: Yeah. There's also just a label problem, you know. I think it was Quinnipiac had a poll recently that showed that support among Democrats for single-payer health care is going down, but support for Medicare for all is going up. They think the Medicare for all is like not socialism, you know, it sounds like a more moderate, you know, kind of approach. And if you look at the Gallup polling on socialism over the last ten years, you find that basically support for socialism is basically a referendum on the state of capitalism.
Asked whether she had any advice for Donald Trump and the Republican Party on how to approach the topic of transgender rights, Jenner spoke about the need for sensitivity to the transgender community.
MILLER: --a flawed law- a flawed law would be off the books. And this president working with members of both parties would be able to replace it with something that not only expands choice, expands competition, enshrines purchasing across state lines, but also protects preexisting conditions in a much better way than the current law does.
Early Wednesday, Trump phoned into NBC News for a Today Show interview, where he called himself Obama's worst nightmare.
No further detail are provided on what the GOP accrediting proposal entails -- colleges are already accredited by independent organizations to various degrees. It's also not clear if this move would make college more affordable or accessible.
Ahead on FACE THE NATION, we'll have some analysis.
Lesley Stahl: No, it's-- the progressive group is more than five.
President Donald Trump: And we won't do anything-- will and is. We won't do anything and no plan unless we have preexisting conditions covered.
You know, it's amazing. I'm watching Hillary go over facts. And she's going after fact after fact, and she's lying again, because she said she — you know, what she did with the e-mail was fine. You think it was fine to delete 33,000 e-mails? I don't think so.
North Carolina is up for grabs, and the stakes are high: 15 electoral votes in that swing state have become pivotal to both President Trump and Democratic nominee Joe Biden.
Donald Trump: I think what Ivanka trying to say, Who cares? Who cares? This is big league stuff. This is-- this is our country. Our country is going bad. We're going to save our country. I don't care about hotel occupancy. It's peanuts compared to what we're doing. Health care, making people better. It's unfair what's happened to the people of our country and we're going to change it. As simple as that.
Controversy Although he has a liberal voting record in the Senate and has been a staunch critic of the Trump administration, Booker has faced criticism from some progressives for receiving large donations from pharmaceutical corporations and banks. In what he touted as his Spartacus moment, Booker claimed to have released confidential committee documents during the contentious Senate confirmation of Justice Brett Kavanaugh. His Republican colleagues accused him of grandstanding and said the documents had already been cleared. What Trump says In an exclusive interview with CBS News Face the Nation host Margaret Brennan the same day Booker announced his candidacy, President Trump said he thinks Booker has no chance in the 2020 election. When asked why, Mr. Trump replied: Because I know him. He has no chance. In a November interview with the New York Post, the president said Booker ran Newark into the ground and falsely accused him of not living in the city when he was mayor. During the 2016 campaign, Mr. Trump claimed to know more about Booker than the New Jersey senator knew about himself. If Cory Booker is the future of the Democratic Party, they have no future! I know more about Cory than he knows about himself, Mr. Trump tweeted in July of that year.
So people should have complete confidence in what's happening in New Hampshire until we really hear exactly what's going on in Iowa. I don't think that anyone should be jumping ahead. Unlike the caucus in Iowa, New Hampshire's primary is run by the state, not the party. The primary's protector-in-chief, Secretary of State Bill Gardner, is overseeing his eleventh presidential primary this year. When asked about election security ahead of the 2018 midterms, Gardner noted that New Hampshire's old-school way of conducting elections ensured their safety and reliability.
SEN. KLOBUCHAR: I- no, I would not. What I'm saying is you need to have steps and measures and you would- could start there and then of course you have dates and you have times and you have a focus and you have a plan. But that is not what he does. He goes and gets a letter and says, I love the guy, right in the face of the Warmbier's, who lost their son, Otto. So I am concerned just because of the track record here. Talk is good, but if all it is is talk it doesn't produce anything for national security for America and international security for our allies.
I think that's up to voters, McCaskill said.
Lesley Stahl: Okay, but forget him for a minute. You're President--
JANICE JACKSON: Well, our city's health department is in charge of that, but what I've heard them say is that, look, the vaccine is a part of a public health tool kit in order to mitigate the spread of COVID. Rule number one is that you have to disseminate those vaccines in places where we're trying to stop the spread of COVID. Schools are not significant sources of spread. And so this is as much-- this-- not as much-- this is a public health solution. We have to start with that. Some of these other things are incredibly important, but some of them are political decisions. Our health department is trying to combat the effects and the spread of COVID. And we are prioritizing places where we see the spread raging on.
An Office of Management and Budget (OMB) official said the administration will continue to pay CSRs, but a final decision for how long that will last for hasn't been made yet.
Additionally, a CBS News/New York Times poll released last week revealed that Republicans may take more blame for the shutdown: 44 percent of Americans would blame Republicans in Congress more for a shutdown, 35 percent would blame Mr. Obama and congressional Democrats more.
MARGARET BRENNAN: So you mentioned that one of the issues you're still in disagreement with-- with the union is over vaccination. Chicago is one of the few cities in this country that gets its supply directly from the federal government. The federal guidelines prioritize based on age. That's why I was asking Cedric Richmond, the adviser to the President, about it. I wonder if it would be helpful to you if the Biden administration explicitly said to prioritize teachers in the front of the line as essential workers?
The Biden campaign is also expanding its team. Campaign officials confirmed Tuesday to CBS News correspondent Nikole Killion that Rachana Desai Martin has been hired as National Director of Voter Protection and senior legal counsel. The position will focus on voter rights, including the disenfranchisement of people of color amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Martin previously worked as chief operating officer of the Democratic National Committee and also oversaw its civic engagement and voter protection efforts.
As part of Republicans' overhaul of the tax code in 2017, Congress abolished the financial penalty for individuals who do not purchase health insurance. The move prompted a group of GOP-led states to file a lawsuit challenging Obamacare, arguing the individual mandate is unconstitutional because the fine had effectively been eliminated. The red states — with the Trump administration in agreement — also said that because the mandate could not be separated from the rest of the health care law, it should fall.
President Trump and Vice President Mike Pence struggled to provide answers during Wednesday's Coronavirus Task Force briefing on how Americans who are uninsured can become insured during the coronavirus pandemic.
Pressure is mounting on Congress to pass an emergency package to fund the fight against the Zika virus before this summer's mosquitoes really start to bite. Several funding packages have been proposed, but not even a health emergency can easily bridge the bitter partisan divide in the U.S. legislature.
During what seemed an interminable campaign, a divided country found all kinds of ways to describe Donald Trump: visionary businessman, vulgar self-promoter, political neophyte.
Mr. Trump called out those companies in his speech: Our plan will end the dishonest double-dealing that allows the middleman to pocket rebates and discounts that should be passed onto consumers and patients, Mr. Trump said.
But Justice Sonia Sotomayor said in her opinion for the court that the congressional action was not sufficient to repeal the government's commitment to pay. These holdings reflect a principle as old as the Nation itself: The Government should honor its obligations, Sotomayor wrote.
Clinton gave 30,490 work-related emails to the State Department in December 2014 and deleted an additional 31,830 she said were personal emails (she did, indeed, say these were related to planning Chelsea's wedding or my mother's funeral arrangements, condolence notes to friends as well as yoga routines, family vacations, the other things you typically find in inboxes).
Mr. Biden's executive order allows for HealthCare.gov, the federal health insurance marketplace, to open for a special enrollment period from February 15 to May 15, which will allow Americans more time to sign up for health insurance coverage. The order also directs federal agencies to review rules and policies to ensure they do not hinder Americans' access to health care, such as those that may reduce affordability of health coverage or undermine the Affordable Care Act's protections for people with pre-existing conditions.
SUSAN PAGE: You know that's in part by President Trump's design.
Melania's immigrant experience and love for America shone through in her speech, said Jason Miller, Trump's senior communications adviser.
The president touts a strong economy
We heard tales of Americans like Coast Guard Petty Officer Ashlee Leppert, who is here tonight in the gallery with Melania. Ashlee was aboard one of the first helicopters on the scene in Houston during the Hurricane Harvey. Through 18 hours of wind and rain, Ashlee braved live power lines and deep water to help save more than 40 lives. Ashlee, we all thank you. Thank you very much.
Now, McConnell can often be heard highlighting Republican accomplishments, delivering a not-so-subtle reminder of what they have done together. He talks to the president at all hours, increasingly about the campaigns ahead. He says he's even warmed to Trump's tweets.
On its face, this argument is ridiculous. Soros has given hundreds of millions of dollars for causes conservatives oppose. Criticizing him is no more anti-Semitic than criticizing the libertarian Koch Brothers for funding Americans for Prosperity is anti….well, whatever religion they are. Tom Steyer is a prominent liberal bankroller who's an Episcopalian but whose father was a non-practicing Jew. He's spending millions trying to help Democrats take over the House and is believed to be considering a 2020 run from his party's Left flank. Do Republicans really need a religious reason to criticize him?
JOHN DICKERSON: That's right. That's why I wondered if that's where people are going. People are addicted to what they are seeing on the news and we all experience that. Those of us who report or live in this world. Wouldn't it be-- if you had examples, for example, after this Kavanaugh fight if a Democrat had said, you know I understand what my Republican colleague was-- how passionate they got in defense of this person who was wrongly accused. Or if a Republican had said instead of calling them evil, had taught people through the power of their example--since everybody's watching anyway--taught people through the power of their example of what it looks like to forgive the other side? We just don't see that.
Lesley Stahl: You looked pretty sober sitting there in the Oval Office, did something wash over you or--
With three weeks to go before Election Day, Ohio is a toss-up, according to the CBS News Battleground Tracker, which shows Mr. Trump with 50% support, compared to 49% for Biden.
President Trump delivered his first State of the Union address Tuesday night, arguing his administration is responsible for an economic upswing and heralding a new American moment marked by deregulation, tax cuts and new immigration restrictions.
Among other things, GOP presidential nominee Donald J. Trump is unlikely to deserve the moniker The Education President.
TRUMP STATEMENT: Ambassador Stevens sent 600 requests for help.
9:34 p.m. ET Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Florida, appeared in a brief video Wednesday night and argued that Trump is a better alternative compared to Hillary Clinton.
President Donald Trump: A lotta people are wearing masks, and they're outside.
While time is running out, Ryan downplayed the idea of Congress passing a short-term continuing resolution (CR) to buy more time to reach an agreement.
The retirement of Justice Anthony Kennedy means Roberts probably will be the conservative justice closest to the court's four liberals, allowing him to control where it comes down in some of its most contentious cases.
We're getting really close. The administration, [Office of Management and Budget], along with appropriators are getting down to the last final things. I think we're making really good progress, Ryan told reporters.
The 419-6 vote is a signal of bipartisan unity against a key provision of the Affordable Care Act. The 40% tax on high-cost plans is meant to help subsidize other plans under the Affordable Care Act, but it's become unpopular even among many Democrats.
She earned her MBA from Harvard Business School and also has a Master's of European Business from the Université Libre de Bruxelles' Solvay Brussels School in Belgium, according to her LinkedIn profile. Cruz holds a bachelor's degree in economics and international relations from Claremont McKenna College, where she was involved with the school's College Republicans group.
I am sorry about her mother's passing, Hudson said in the statement. Families have to deal with unfortunate situations. But unfortunately Elissa Slotkin is lying about Mike Bishop's record. Mike Bishop voted for a replacement plan for the Affordable Care Act that kept existing preconditions. He was also an original cosponsor to the Pre-Existing Conditions Protection Act (HR1211) that reaffirmed the guaranteed health care access to those with preexisting conditions.
There's an automated payment system that will coming online fully in the next several months, which will include in the flow of information... timely data relating to the payment of premiums by enrollees, Carney said.
On November 4, the Supreme Court will weigh a dispute that stands at the intersection of religious liberty and LGBTQ rights. At issue in the case, known as Fulton v. City of Philadelphia, is whether Philadelphia violated the First Amendment by excluding a religious foster care agency, Catholic Social Services, from its foster care system because the agency declines to place foster children with same-sex couples.
The Republican Party will become The Party of Healthcare! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 26, 2019
Donald Trump: For certain areas I would, but certain areas, a wall is more appropriate. I'm very good at this, it's called construction.
JOE BIDEN: A lot of money.
We now have events that are thrown by Republican women for Republican women, Sloktin noted.
Given the speed bumps in the process related to religion during last year's confirmation process and her lack of experience on the bench, some conservatives fear her confirmation process this time around could be a challenging one.
Warren was re-elected in 2018, and announced an exploratory committee for a presidential run Dec. 31. Warren and her second husband, Bruce Mann, have been married for 38 years and have three grandchildren. They live in Cambridge, Massachusetts with their golden retriever, Bailey, who came to her first press conference as a presidential contender. Key issues Warren has built a national brand as an economic populist and an anti-Wall Street crusader. The 69-year-old senator serves on the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee and the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee in the Senate, and has also taken on her own party on issues she cares about. In one instance, she helped to derail then-President Obama's nomination of investment banker Antonio Weiss to a top position at the Treasury Department in 2015. Fixing a rigged economy figures to be central issue of her presidential campaign. I've spent my career getting to the bottom of why America's promise works for some families, but others who work just as hard slip through the cracks into disaster, Warren said in a video announcing her presidential exploratory committee. What I found is terrifying. These aren't cracks that families are falling into. They're traps. America's middle class is under attack. How do we get here? Billionaires and big corporations decided they wanted more of the pie and they enlisted politicians to cut them a fatter slice.
Two former GOP presidential hopefuls seek third term as governor
CLINTON: My vision of America is an America where everyone has a place, if you're willing to work hard, you do your part, you contribute to the community. That's what America is. That's what we want America to be for our children and our grandchildren.
Okay. Just on COVID-19. Some of the news of today. The valet at the White House has tested positive. Have you had any exposure or interaction with this valet?
Although she rebuked his administration's policies and rhetoric on climate change, political campaign spending, immigration and voting rights, Klobuchar never mentioned President Trump by name during her remarks. Her campaign is hoping her candidacy can get traction in battleground Midwestern states like Michigan, Wisconsin and Ohio that Mr. Trump carried in 2016 election.
THE FACTS: The U.S. conducted an intensive air war against the Saddam Hussein government in the 1991 war. But to call it carpet bombing misses one of the most important characteristics of that air campaign: It marked the first large-scale use of precision-guided missiles and bombs in the history of warfare.
TRUMP: I have great respect for women. Nobody has more respect for women than I do.
CLINTON: At some point, we need to do some fact-checking here.
CRUZ on Obama: He's not arming the Kurds.
President Trump celebrated the end of the Mueller investigation out on the 2020 campaign trail this week.
Such a great honor to be the Republican Nominee for President of the United States. I will work hard and never let you down! AMERICA FIRST! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 19, 2016
JOHN DICKERSON: Hold on. Hold on. But-There are-- this military question is important, though. I'm sorry to interrupt. But-- but, you know, in 2013 the president, then-candidate, Trump said, Here's the truth. The government doesn't shut down. All essential services continue. Don't believe the lies.
Donnelly doesn't oppose all of the tariffs, however. He approves of the steel tariff as a way to counter China's steel dumping. However, Donnelly added that steel tariffs are one single stove pipe, and the other tariffs the Trump administration has implemented could have been avoided.
MARGARET BRENNAN: So, you're projecting out to the spring?
CBS News campaign reporter Musadiq Bidar reports local counties have until the end of this month to provide the state with clarity on their plans for in-person voting requirements. Newsom said if those plans are not in by May 30, a second executive order might be needed to resolve issues. California already allows vote-by mail but voters have to specifically make a request for the ballot. This executive order makes it so that every voter is automatically mailed a ballot without having to make that request.
SEN. BARRASSO: I would certainly hope not. I'm working to the fact of keeping the government open. I think that's what the American people expect of the people that they elect, keep the government open. And if there's any sort of a shutdown it would certainly only be a partial shutdown. Remember, Margaret, we, through the appropriations process, already have approved 75 percent of the funding for the government for the next year. But I still think it's better to not have any sort of even a partial shutdown whether it's over Christmas or anytime. I don't think people benefit by that.
That was a pretty strong statement, Braver asked. Why'd you feel like you wanted to say that?
The following is a transcript of the interview with Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota that aired Sunday, June 30, 2019, on Face the Nation.
The House GOP-backed Congressional Leadership Fund also got on the air in California's 48th today, as well as five other competitive House seats. Their ad in California's 48th attacks Rouda for a 2008 age discrimination settlement with his real estate company. Their ad in New York's 2nd district, an open seat, draws parallels between Democrat Jackie Gordon and New York City Mayor Bill De Blasio. We wouldn't vote De Blasio for Congress, so vote against Jackie Gordon, it ends.
Moderna says it will deliver its promised 300 million doses by July, two months early. The RNA-based vaccines of Pfizer and Moderna are the first of their kind. The process to speed up the manufacture of the RNA also pushes the boundaries of bioengineering.
I believe we have to get ISIS. We have to worry about ISIS before we can get too much more involved. She had a chance to do something with Syria. They had a chance. And that was the line. And she didn't.
MARGARET BRENNAN: So you want to--
McIver took the fall for the plagiarized portions of Melania Trump's speech: This was my mistake, and I feel terrible for the chaos I have caused Melania and the Trump, as well as to Mrs. Obama. No harm was meant.
Ryan mentioned Trump only twice in his speech.
LESLEY STAHL: Do you want him to leave?
I saw people getting together and, in fairly large numbers, celebrating as the World Trade Center was coming down, Trump said at a rally in November. Kessler went on to debunk that claim.
Also on the list of their biggest Pinocchios of 2015: President Obama.
I cannot take the freedoms this country offered for granted, said Trump, who then recognized former GOP presidential nominee and Sen. Bob Dole, R-Kansas.
The following is a transcript of the interview with Republican Sen. John Barrasso of Wyoming that aired Sunday, Dec. 16, 2018, on Face the Nation.
His political career began in 2001. He won the mayor's office three times as a Republican, then once as an independent. His strategy was the one he is using right now: he massively outspent his opponents in self-funded campaigns. In 12 years, Bloomberg helped rebuild Ground Zero, helped the city survive the Great Recession. He banned smoking in restaurants, improved schools and balanced the budget. But there was controversy. Bloomberg expanded a police tactic called stop and frisk. More than 80% of those stopped were minorities. Less than 1% were carrying guns.
Pete Buttigieg's PAC, Win the Era, announced its first endorsements Wednesday. CBS News campaign reporter Jack Turman reports the endorsement list includes statewide candidates in contested races and candidates running for local office.
He is not a member of any of the major Democratic caucuses in the House, like the pro-business New Democrat Coalition or the Congressional Progressive Caucus. He once earned an A rating from the National Rife Association (NRA) and has broken with his party to support fracking measures favored by Republicans. But Ryan has also been supportive of progressive proposals like Medicare for all. Controversy Ryan's tenure in Congress has largely been scandal-free, but his repeated challenges to Pelosi's leadership are likely to alienate some Democratic primary voters. What Trump says Although Ryan has been a fierce critic of the president, Mr. Trump has not yet tweeted about the Ohio congressman.
SEN. BARRASSO: And I want to work with additional Democrats, but what we're seeing right now from the Democrats side- and you see whether it was Bernie Sanders or so many of the Democrat candidates for president in 2020, they're talking about a different step away from Obamacare as well. They agree that Obamacare hasn't worked and they're talking about a program of a complete government takeover of healthcare, with increased taxes and fewer choices and longer lines. And that to me doesn't help people in the- in the long run. I talked to people yesterday- I was in Wyoming at a wreath ceremony, at our- at our cemetery- talked to somebody on Medicare. They said, We don't want Medicare for all, we paid into Medicare our whole life. This isn't the time to put more people onto that program. We want to make sure that that is saved and strengthened and- and- and held for people that are already on the program and have paid in over their lifetime.
In the past, we have foolishly released hundreds and hundreds of dangerous terrorists, only to meet them again on the battlefield -- including the ISIS leader, al-Baghdadi, who we captured, who we had, who we released.
Donning the mantle of the prosecutor he once was, Christie made his remarks a virtual trial of Hillary Clinton, whom he noted, would not be prosecuted by the Justice Department.
Jindal and the Republican governors are not alone in bashing Washington Republicans. That's what Sen. Cruz is doing, too. But the GOP governors are making a different case. Their argument is based on results, conservative policies that are sometimes the result of hard-won compromise. Or, in some cases, they are boasting about lawmakers who have pushed for conservative legislation dealing with unions or removing regulatory barriers, but who have also decided to accept federal Medicaid money as a part of Obamacare. That kind of apostasy would not be tolerated by conservative purists in Washington, but it's also the kind of purity that governors don't have the luxury for. In 2016 the four biggest governor's races for Republicans will take place in Pennsylvania, Florida, Ohio, and Michigan. Those Republican governors all accepted Medicaid funds.
In an interview that aired on MSNBC this morning, Trump maintained his populist position on global trade, which has also garnered criticism from the Club for Growth.
I want-- when I leave, that the ceremony is at the Naval Academy. And we just have a couple of people that stand up and say, 'This guy, he served his country.'
On Thursday, President Donald Trump visited The Villages in Florida to sign an executive order protecting Medicare from socialist destruction. The executive order calls for reducing Medicare fraud and supporting privatized Medicare plans, but the president spent a large chunk of his remarks criticizing the Medicare for All plan supported by some Democratic presidential candidates, according to CBS News Political Unit associate producer Ellee Watson.
The Trump administration filed a brief Tuesday to invalidate the Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare, in a significant shift from its initial policy that only a portion of a law should be overturned.
SENATOR MARCO RUBIO (R-Florida/@marcorubio): Well, a few things obviously, Panama, I've gotten to Panama City and I've met with and seen the drone images there from the emergency operations center in Bay County and it's deep devastation. I have lived through a bunch of hurricanes myself going back to Andrew and-- and-- and here in South Florida, and what I saw in Panama City reminds me of Andrew. I mean, literally, there was-- I think the whole power grid has been shredded. But in all this conversation and that's very important, you know, Mexico Beach is-- is wiped out and all of that. But-- but I want everybody to remember one thing and that is that there are these inland areas away from Mexico Beach, away from Panama City, not on the coast, these are rural areas, a lot of them have older residents, poorer residents, people that could not evacuate even if they wanted to, many living in manufactured housing and mobile homes, large mobile homes not-- but, nonetheless, mobile homes, multi-acre properties off of dirt roads, who are completely isolated at this very moment. And I know crews are working hard to get to them. But these are the first people, these are the likeliest people to be forgotten, and I think that is where the real challenges lie ahead in the next few days in terms of saving lives and-- and getting to people quickly.
The ongoing investigation into the Russian interference in the 2016 election continues to generate headlines. Last week, the president's former campaign chairman pleaded guilty to conspiracy charges including money laundering and tax fraud and agreed to cooperate with the special counsel in order to avoid a second trial. Will there be any further developments before the midterms?
Some Democrats attacked the claim as a waste of taxpayer money. Congressman Joe Kennedy, of Massachusetts, called it a bailout for stolen goods she chose not to insure, according to USA Today.
Saudi Arabia, they make a billion dollars a day, he later added. I love the Saudis. Many are in this building. Whenever they have problems, we send over the ships...what are we doing? They got nothing but money. If the right person asks them, they'd pay a fortune. They wouldn't be there, except for us.
The Stop Trump rally also drew a small crowd and was relatively calm.
Early polling on the matter spelled trouble for the GOP. A Quinnipiac University National Poll released Tuesday morning shows that by a margin of 72 percent to 22 percent, American voters oppose a government shutdown over attempts to block the Affordable Care Act. And though voters are divided on the law itself, with 45 percent in favor and 47 percent opposed, 58 percent of those surveyed said they opposed cutting off funding a way to stop it from being implemented.
I believe that you can have a simple vote in Congress, or it's even possible, in my opinion — this is after meeting with some very talented legal scholars — that you can do it through an executive order, Mr. Trump said last week about birthright citizenship. Now, I'd rather do it through Congress, because that's permanent. But we can certainly do it through — I really believe we can do it through executive order.
JOHN DICKERSON: You mentioned leverage. Were you surprised the President said upfront that these arms sales were something that he wanted to protect? In other words, aren't those, isn't that your leverage in your-- in your argument with the Saudis and he sort of said right away those are too important to mess with.
Beto O'Rourke Beto O'Rourke joins the 2020 presidential rac... 02:39 O'Rourke was born and raised in the Texas border city of El Paso. The former congressman tried to topple Sen. Ted Cruz in 2018 and failed, but in the process shattered fundraising records and became one of the best known Democrats in the country. At age 46, he's one of the younger contenders for the Democratic nomination.
Biden also said Mr. Trump's inaction sent the economy in a tailspin and said his negligence caused the recession. It's beyond despicable. It's a dereliction of duty, it's a disgrace, Biden said. Just hours following reports of President Trump's interviews with Bob Woodward, pro-Biden super PAC American Bridge incorporated newly released audio recordings into a 30 second advertisement.
Lesley Stahl: You think he knows it himself?
SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR: We're very excited president is going to sign it into law. This is a bill that finally says to America we got rules in place that don't protect politicians, that protect victims and it's time to clean up this mess.
In the interim, Washington provided various short-term CHIP funding, and the government set up a redistribution mechanism for surplus funds in some states to be used in other states running low on money for the program. Even with these efforts, the Georgetown University Health Policy Institute projected that 24 states would run out of CHIP funding by March.
Lesley Stahl: So let's go through very quickly some of the promises you made and tell us if you're going to do what you said or you're going to change it in any way. Are you really going to build a wall?
Look at what she did in Libya with Gadhafi. Gadhafi's out. It's a mess. And, by the way, ISIS has a good chunk of their oil. I'm sure you probably have heard that. It was a disaster. Because the fact is, almost everything she's done in foreign policy has been a mistake and it's been a disaster.
Ohio Gov. John Kasich, who is trailing the other two Republican presidential candidates in the race for the nomination, will argue today that this year's presidential election offers voters two paths -- one of which could drive America down into a ditch, not make us great again.
At a breakfast with small business leaders at the White House Monday, President Trump said his pick for the Supreme Court is someone unbelievably highly respected.
MARGARET BRENNAN: You should. Whe- from what you're seeing, you talked about Facebook and them alerting you. Is that- am I understanding you correctly?
In our drive to make Washington accountable, we have eliminated more regulations in our first year than any administration in history.
Biden's newly released plan also put into writing his recent change in opinion over repealing the Hyde Amendment, which bans using taxpayer money for abortion access. His plan also outlines his call to codify Roe v. Wade, the Supreme Court decision that legalized abortion nationwide and explains the proposed public option would also cover contraception and a woman's constitutional right to choose.
JOE BIDEN: A bunch of white guys hearing, hearing this testimony in the Senate Judiciary Committee, so when Anita Hill-- Anita Hill came to testify, she faced a committee that didn't fully understand what the hell it was all about. To this day I regret I couldn't come up with a way to get her the kind of hearing she deserved, given the courage she showed by reaching out to us.
The administration issued new rules on Tuesday that expand the use of what's known as association health plans. They allow small businesses and self-employed individuals to buy health insurance collectively through what's loosely defined as an industry association. By pooling together, members can buy insurance for less expensive group rates, the way employees of large corporations do.
And just as I promised the American people from this podium 11 months ago, we enacted the biggest tax cuts and reforms in American history.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Why not declassify some of those?
MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, you do have many more. And I want to actually switch to another area--
Over that time, he became a national treasure -- occasionally ornery and profane, but a politician who placed principle over party and earned his reputation as a fighter and a maverick.

And now her campaign has to contend with a new WikiLeaks flap -- a hacked email that appears to contradict President Obama's answer to CBS' Bill Plante in March of 2015.
MARGARET BRENNAN: For some analysis on the rest of the week's news, Jamelle Bouie is back with us. Kelsey Snell covers Capitol Hill for NPR, Jonah Goldberg is a columnist for the Los Angeles Times and a senior editor at the National Review, and Anna Palmer is the senior Washington correspondent for Politico. Jonah, let me start with you. The President surprised his own party with this announcement that health care is going to be the new party identity. But then he went back to one of the-- the sort of most, I don't know, go-to line for him--
Since we passed tax cuts, roughly 3 million workers have already gotten tax cut bonuses -- many of them thousands and thousands of dollars per worker. And it's getting more every month, every week. Apple has just announced it plans to invest a total of $350 billion in America, and hire another 20,000 workers. And just a little while ago, ExxonMobil announced a $50 billion investment in the United States, just a little while ago.
MARGARET BRENNAN: And we will be tracking that.
This is not to say that every Democratic recruit from the military or intelligence services is a closet Republican. Some of them, in fact, are quite progressive. But at the same time, you are seeing Democrats tailoring themselves to their districts. They are not all running on platforms of amnesty, abortion, and assault weapon bans.
So tonight I am extending an open hand to work with members of both parties, Democrats and Republicans, to protect our citizens, of every background, color, and creed.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Can- can you just put a button on this, though?
Julián Castro Julián Castro launches 2020 campaign 08:32 Biography Julián Castro was born one minute before his identical twin brother, Joaquin, in San Antonio, Texas, in 1974. His mother, Maria, was a Chicana political activist whom Castro has credited for motivating him and his brother to choose careers in public service. Joaquin Castro is currently a congressman. Castro attended Stanford University and Harvard Law School, along with his brother. He was elected to the San Antonio City Council in 2001 at the age of 26, making him the youngest council member in San Antonio history. He unsuccessfully ran for mayor in 2005, but won when he ran again in 2009. He was re-elected twice, in 2011 and 2013. Castro's profile rose when he was chosen to give the keynote speech at the 2012 Democratic National Convention, the first Hispanic person to do so. In 2014, President Obama named Castro Housing and Urban Development secretary. During the 2016 election, he was among those considered a possible vice presidential nominee for Hillary Clinton, although Clinton eventually chose Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine. Castro laid the groundwork for a 2020 presidential bid throughout 2018, visiting New Hampshire and publishing a memoir, An Unlikely Journey: Waking Up from My American Dream, in October. He announced the creation of an exploratory committee for a presidential run Dec. 12 and officially announced his candidacy for president Jan. 12. Castro and his wife, Erica, have two children. Castro's tenure at HUD was marked by a focus on fair housing issues.
However, Republicans appear to have settled on state Attorney General Josh Hawley as their standard bearer this time around, meaning that McCaskill could be in real jeopardy in this Republican state.
With the 2020 election just 11 days away, CBS News social media producer Li Cohen has compiled a comprehensive look at where the presidential candidates stand on some of the major issues facing the nation. Their stances and plans were compiled based on information available on Mr. Trump's and Biden's respective campaign sites, as well as official documents and prior CBS News reporting. Click here to learn where the candidates stand.
Nor he said had he heard about reports of racial slurs and personal threats against African Americans, Latinos and gays by some of his supporters.
We'll be right back with our political panel. So, stay with us.
COOPER: Thank you. I want to give you — Mr. Trump, I want to give you the chance to respond. I just wanted to tell our viewers what she's referring to. In the last month, taxes were the number-one issue on Facebook for the first time in the campaign. The New York Times published three pages of your 1995 tax returns. They show you claimed a $916 million loss, which means you could have avoided paying personal federal income taxes for years. You've said you pay state taxes, employee taxes, real estate taxes, property taxes. You have not answered, though, a simple question. Did you use that $916 million loss to avoid paying personal federal income taxes for years?
For instance, HHS isn't keeping track of how many Obamacare enrollees were previously uninsured. It's an open question, given that millions Americans last year were dropped from insurance plans that are no longer Obamacare-compliant -- in other words, many Obamacare enrollees could simply be finding new plans to replace their old ones.
The 15-second ad, called Family, is running on YouTube. It is part of the campaign's six-figure advertising campaign on television and digital platforms in Iowa.
In a new television advertisement titled masks released by the pro-Biden Super PAC Priorities USA Action, the narrator claims 57 million Americans have lost their jobs, many have lost their health insurance too, but Donald Trump remains laser focused on gutting health care.
The 142-page measure, released Thursday, would end Obamacare's penalties for people who don't buy insurance, replacing them with a penalty for lapsed coverage; and it would cut back an expansion of Medicaid, but would keep more protections for people with pre-existing conditions, compared to the House-passed bill. It would provide tax credits, based on income, age and geography, which would make more money available to lower-income recipients to help them buy insurance. This differs from the House bill, which tied its tax credits only to age. Obamacare taxes would be repealed under the bill. The Senate bill would provide for expanded tax-free Health Savings Accounts, and it would also eliminate federal funding for Planned Parenthood for one year.
There's something like 14 million lines of COBOL involved in that, Cutts said, referring to the programming language. We have an issue where COBOL programmers aren't just retiring, some of them are dying.
CLINTON: Well, the situation in Syria is catastrophic. And every day that goes by, we see the results of the regime by Assad in partnership with the Iranians on the ground, the Russians in the air, bombarding places, in particular Aleppo, where there are hundreds of thousands of people, probably about 250,000 still left. And there is a determined effort by the Russian air force to destroy Aleppo in order to eliminate the last of the Syrian rebels who are really holding out against the Assad regime.
MARGARET BRENNAN: For those of us who aren't doctors, how should we understand the difference between Pfizer, Moderna and the Johnson & Johnson vaccine that seems to be headed for FDA approval?
GOVERNOR NED LAMONT: What they also pointed out, Margaret, is that people of color, black and brown, sixty, sixty-five, seventy-five, are much more likely to get infected, much more likely to suffer complications than a white person ten years their elder. So, we are making a big effort to make sure we don't just get the worried well at our big drive-through vaccination centers, but also get our mobile vans, go to the churches, go to those housing complexes where we can get people vaccinated who have to get vaccinated.
For Kate Spittlemeister, the most important issue to her right now is Obamacare: That's been a lifeline for us.
And at the same point in his presidency, George W. Bush had taken 23 visits to his Texas ranch, totaling all or part of 157 days, in addition to four visits to Kennebunkport, Maine, totaling all or part of 15 days.
JOHN DICKERSON: You also measured this question of enthusiasm but you have a more subtle crack at it. What did you find about enthusiasm?
A potential requirement for drugmakers to disclose the cost of their medicines in television advertisements.
Lesley Stahl: But you're going to do that as president?
Extravagant spending on travel and office remodeling by top officials became a running story as the Trump administration took power in Washington on a presidential promise to drain the swamp. The latest Cabinet casualty was Environmental Protection Agency head Scott Pruitt, who resigned this month amid ethics investigations.
Donald Trump: So it's a modern form of communication, between Face-- you know, Facebook and Twitter and I guess Instagram, I have 28 million people. 28 million people--
It's hard to avoid the fox-guarding-the-henhouse analogy, said Heidi Shierholz, director of policy at the liberal Economic Policy Institute and former chief economist in the Obama Labor Department, about Puzder. His anti-labor positions disqualify him from running the department.
ANTHONY SALVANTO: Yeah. He is, and he wasn't always. But this was even done before last night's big win for Sanders in Nevada. So a couple of things happened here. One is the electability argument. Voters look at what's happening in these states and say who do they think can put together a coalition that can win? We see that while Joe Biden is still widely seen as having a chance to beat President Trump. Bernie Sanders also is. And, quite frankly, when Democrats and others look at a match up against President Trump across the whole electorate, well, it's tight for all of these Democrats. For Joe Biden, for Bernie Sanders, narrow leads at best over the President really within the margin of error across all voters.
The city cut off foster care referrals to Catholic Social Services in 2018 after learning it didn't work with same-sex couples, and in May of that year, the agency and a group of foster parents sued, arguing Catholic Social Services was targeted by city officials and the decision to halt the referrals was unconstitutional.
Lesley Stahl: How would you describe President Trump?
RADDATZ: You disagree with your running mate?
Buttigieg responded to an op-ed in The Root calling the millennial mayor a lying m****r****** for his comments on education in a video interview clip that resurfaced from 2011. In the video, Buttigieg said that children need to see evidence that pursuing education will come with a reward and a stable life.
With regard to Mr. Trump's Russia controversy, she has said let's see where the facts take us but has also called the controversy noise. On health care, she's been lukewarm on the GOP effort to repeal and replace Obamacare, saying that the House bill isn't perfect. Handel is trying to sell herself as fiscally conservative and an independent while slamming Ossoff as too liberal for the district. Mr. Trump tweeted his support Handel on Monday, slamming Democrats' efforts to stop tax cuts, good health care and border security.
Syria blast kills key Assad ally, enemy of U.S. and Israel
President Trump: He's not a war hero. He's a war hero – he's a war hero because he was captured. I like people that weren't captured, OK.
Does Judge Sullivan have a say?
JOHN DICKERSON: --but doing them later--
Any military cuts GOP contenders are complaining about were approved by both Republicans and Democrats in Congress. The military budget is being squeezed by the insistence of lawmakers in both parties that money be spent on bases and equipment that the Pentagon says it doesn't need.
Wilson responded that, while he had never represented politicians with racist beliefs, he did work for candidates he feels ashamed of today.
Mike Bloomberg: Because I brought down the murder rate. I doubled the, or cut the gap between rich and poor education. I created 500,000 jobs, 175,000 units of affordable housing. We did all the things to reduce poverty that anybody could possibly do. And when I left, I think it's fair to say most people, women, minorities, they would say it was the best 12 years the city has had in modern memory.
Washington — Judge Amy Coney Barrett's nomination to the Supreme Court cleared its final procedural hurdle Sunday, setting up a final vote on her confirmation expected on Monday evening, just days before the presidential election.
She said sometimes it happens right before one of these debates or in a stressful moment in a state. And she appreciates it: According to Cruz, husband Ted never ceases to defuse a stressful moment with a moment of levity.
TRUMP: Excuse me. Because she has been a disaster as a senator. A disaster.
Deputy Attorney General Yates, I've disagreed with her about a couple of things, but, you know, here she upheld the fine tradition of the Department of Justice. She said that the new administration has to be treated just like the Obama administration, and they should go and tell the White House about their findings. They and, you know, Director Comey ran around that.
I shocked everybody. And I'll tell you how I shocked them. I, like, had normal people helping me. And they banged on doors and they walked in the snow. One guy made 10,000 phone calls. His ears really look bad, Kasich joked.
Separately, senior Republicans in Congress are wasting no time in trying to distance themselves from any effort by the administration to undermine popular protections for their constituents. Democrats are accusing Republicans of yet another effort to sabotage coverage, and plan to take the issue into the fall midterm elections.
Donald Trump is desperate to bend this -- to pin the socialist label of socialist, socialist, socialist, on our party. We can't let him do that, Biden said, adding that the Vermont senator a good man. Sanders and his campaign in the past month have regularly criticized Biden's long Senate record including his vote in favor of the Iraq War and previous openness to negotiate cuts to Social Security in order to balance the federal budget. Biden then shifted his focus to another leading contender in the race, Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend.
Multiple organizations have been forced to transition political operations to digital platforms in response to COVID-19. As many down ballot candidates make the virtual transition, CBS News campaign reporter LaCrai Mitchell reports that the political action committee EMILY's List announced Wednesday that it has added new lessons to its online training center in an effort to help women candidates adopt digital strategies in their campaigns.
CLINTON: And actually — well, that was very interesting. First of all, China is illegally dumping steel in the United States and Donald Trump is buying it to build his buildings, putting steelworkers and American steel plants out of business. That's something that I fought against as a senator and that I would have a trade prosecutor to make sure that we don't get taken advantage of by China on steel or anything else.
For this reason, I am asking Congress to end the dangerous defense sequester and fully fund our great military.
But Clinton defended what her daughter had said in a separate Face the Nation interview where she said that Sanders' position was confusing because he hadn't actually put out a health care plan yet.
This is not the first time Trump has used that 600 number, which conflates requests for help and concerns. The figure comes from a chart created by the House Select Committee on Benghazi, which adds all requests and concerns from Libya to the State Department. That combined figure does come close to 600.
We were scheduled to take a walk with the president around the White House grounds.
James Karen United Artists He was a prolific and beloved character actor, whose most popular appearances included a shady real estate developer in Poltergeist (who didn't bother removing the bodies when he displaced a cemetery's headstones), a TV news producer in The China Syndrome, and a foreman who becomes a zombie in the horror-comedy The Return of the Living Dead. James Karen (November 28, 1923-October 23, 2018) was everywhere, from stage to TV, including a long run as a commercial spokesman for the supermarket chain Pathmark. Born Jacob Karnovsky in Wilkes-Barres, Pa., he was interested in theater from an early age and, according to friend Leonard Maltin, turned down a contract with MGM because he wanted to work on the stage. His resume included Elia Kazan's 1940s stage production of A Streetcar Named Desire and Edward Albee's Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? ; appearing in Buster Keaton's Film (an experimental short written by Samuel Beckett); and being directed on screen by Alan J. Pakula (All the President's Men), Oliver Stone (Wall Street, Nixon), and David Lynch (Mulholland Drive). His TV credits ranged from Dallas and The Waltons to Seinfeld and The Larry Sanders Show. In a 2016 interview at the New York Film Academy, Karen described his displeasure when Lee Strasberg became head of the Actors' Studio [He took all the joy out of acting], and recounted his discussion with his Any Given Sunday costar Al Pacino, who idolized Strasberg: Pacino said, 'I don't understand why you didn't like him.'
I'm not initiating any new law, any new aspect of the law, Mr. Biden said in brief remarks from the Oval Office.
TRUMP STATEMENT: We are also letting drugs pour through our southern border at a record clip. At a record clip…and it shouldn't be allowed to happen. ICE just endorsed me. They have never endorsed a presidential candidate. The border patrol agents 16,500 just recently endorsed me and they endorsed me because I understand the border. She doesn't. She wants amnesty for everybody.
Likely topics include his revised travel ban, which he's expected to unveil next week. He almost certainly will talk about repealing and replacing Obamacare, passing a tax reform package and his plans to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.
8:05 p.m. ET Duck Dynasty star Willie Robertson kicked off Monday night's speech line-up.
MARGARET BRENNAN: It sounds like you and Senator Sanders agree on that.
Now, forecasts predict a quarter of the clean energy workforce or roughly 850,000 jobs could disappear by the end of the second quarter. Seven out of every ten clean energy jobs lost over the last month came from energy efficiency, the largest clean energy sector. Renewable electric power generation is also experiencing steep job declines as is clean vehicle work and the clean transmission, distribution, and storage sectors. California has been hit the hardest, losing nearly 80,000 jobs or 15% of the clean energy workforce. Florida, Georgia, Texas, and Michigan have all lost more than 20,000 clean energy jobs.
MAYOR FRANCIS SUAREZ (D-Miami/@FrancisSuarez): Good morning, Margaret. It's a pleasure to be with you this morning.
We advanced the ball for the Dreamers. We're proud of the role we played, said Schumer, and how, he said, the Senate will now likely work its will on its own. He added, The bipartisan group yesterday was a glimmer of hope that might happen.
Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions placed Trump's name into nomination; House Speaker Paul Ryan is running the show, going state by state to have each delegation announce how many delegates are supporting Trump.
On the campaign trail, Reeves is embracing President Trump, who won the southern state by 17 points in 2016. He often name-drops similar political enemies and said if elected, he would act in the same fashion as the president. He's been ignoring his two primary competitors, Waller and state representative Robert Foster, instead focusing on Hood and establishment Democrats.
To ease that process, Becky Taylor and her crew of seven other public school teachers in Montgomery County are helping people navigate the confusing network of online vaccine appointment sites.
Even if a future Speaker Pelosi wanted to MoveOn.Org, she couldn't—any more than Republicans could avoid voting on an ObamaCare repeal-and-replace plan once Trump was in the White House. A party can't spend years telling voters This [Obamacare or Trump] is so horrible, we must end it, and then, once in power, simply tell its base to put down the pitchforks, douse the torches and go home. If the Democrats elected by their Trump-hating base won't get rid of him, these primary voters will find some who will in 2020.
McGahn also brushed off criticisms that the White House and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell are rushing Barrett's confirmation and should wait until after the election to fill the vacancy.
MARGARET BRENNAN: I said it's your list. I know you like it. But so- so bigger picture, though,--
But anything much more controversial than that might not.
The issue of health care is again center stage for Democrats as their 2020 presidential primary ramps up. Most candidates have embraced some form of universal health care, and many support Sen. Bernie Sanders' Medicare for All plan. Republicans see an opportunity to exploit that support, painting Democrats as advocating for socialized medicine.
Health care was the top issue for voters in Nevada. Voters who picked health care went overwhelmingly for Rosen.
The answer, simply, Charlie, is no. You need everyone in the system. You can't just have the sick people in the system and healthy people waiting until they get sick before they buy insurance. That's just the simple fact. We're going to have to accept that fact.
RADDATZ: Yes, you can respond to that.
A source on the plane with the president en route to a rally in Michigan told CBS News White House correspondent Paula Reid the decision gives the president something to smile about on the day he is expected to be impeached. Undoing Obamacare was one of Mr. Trump's key campaign promises.
Donald Trumpadded his chief political strategist, Steve Bannon, to the National Security Council (NSC) and to the Principals Committee, a small group of the president's top national security officials that considers policy issues affecting national security.
Bill Whitaker: But hold on--did I hear you right though? You said ten to 50 times more by--
Less than two months until Election Day, President Trump unveiled a new slate of 20 potential nominees to the Supreme Court, Wednesday, in the event of a vacancy - highlighting a cornerstone of his presidency among Republicans and a major campaign issue responsible for coalescing conservative and evangelical support around him in 2016, reports CBS News campaign reporter Nicole Sganga.
Lesley Stahl: Troops on the ground?
PAULA REID (CBS News Correspondent/@PaulaReidCBS): Well, you really hit it-- hit-- hit it. You said, well, did he need to be told not to lie? And that's the common theme that we see emerging. Throughout all of these investigations of the President, his attorneys and their associates having trouble with the truth--being caught lying, having to plead guilty to lying, that has been a consistent theme. And I think you asked the perfect question was did the White House need to tell him not to lie? He could have done that of his own volition.
President Trump's tariffs are hurting the profits of farmers across the Midwest. Will this translate into a drop in political support among some of his key supporters?
Trump may have grounds to brag, the Post found, but his claim cannot be easily verified. There is no reliable metric on which to judge his claim -- or to compare him to previous presidents.
His vision is called the America First Health Care Plan. The president said the three pillars of his vision are more choice for health care options, lower costs for families and seniors and better care for American patients.
MARGARET BRENNAN: The mayor has demanded that elementary and middle schools open tomorrow. Will the teachers union go on strike?
But if gridlock reaches the levels it did in 2011, causing government shutdowns or another crisis over the debt ceiling, the opposite would likely happen. During the 2011 episode, when the U.S. Treasury came close to a technical default on its debt, the S&P 500 dropped by nearly 20 percent. A repeat of this scenario is not only possible but could actually become likely in an extreme gridlock environment, according to UBS.
He confronted the concerns just as some senators are calling for an investigation into those investments as a possible violation of the Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge Act, which makes it illegal for legislators and their staff to trade stocks on information that isn't made public.
The error due to sampling for results based on the entire sample could be plus or minus three percentage points. The error for subgroups may be higher and is available by request. The margin of error includes the effects of standard weighting procedures which enlarge sampling error slightly.
MARGARET BRENNAN: --is- is trimming away at your support?
SEN. SANDERS: --from the arms of their mothers.
Cleaver told CBS News campaign reporter Musadiq Bidar that her goal is to proactively reach out to voters and guide them through the process. We're not even looking at this point to increase turnout, we are just looking to maintain an acceptable level of turnout because it is entirely possible that if people don't navigate the vote-by-mail process that we will have midterm level turnout in a presidential election year, Cleaver said.
They could be missing out on premium assistance that's part of the law, Carey said about the uninsured who qualify for subsidies, citing a study from the Kaiser Family Foundation. The study finds that 4.2 million uninsured people could get an ACA plan for 2019 and pay no money in premiums even after factoring in tax credits.
CLINTON: Because I was a senator with a Republican president.
At the same time, all trainings are being conducted via Zoom. While there are still questions about when people will be heading out and knocking on doors, PTP is talking about ordering face masks and hand sanitizer.
Bondi, Florida's first female attorney general, fought vigorously against former President Barack Obama's agenda. She signed onto a lawsuit by a number of states challenging Obama's Deferred Action Against Childhood Arrivals program, which Mr. Trump tried to end. She also joined a lawsuit attempting to overturn the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare.
This hasn't happened, although the administration has looked for ways to do so.
JOHN DICKERSON: But you say nobody's trying to compete with them, but-- but Eric Holder, the former attorney general who was in charge of executing the laws said when, and this is a play on-- on Michelle Obama who said when they go low, we go high. Eric Holder said when they go low, we kick them. That's the new Democratic Party is all about. That is directly competing with Donald Trump.
But fear that Barrett could be a deciding vote in dismantling the nation's health care law is something he believes should be a topic of the hearings. In fact, Obamacare has been a major theme of questioning Monday — each of the Democratic senators has brought it up and highlighted constituents from their states whose lives have been changed by the law.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Republicans weren't able to repeal and replace with Republican majorities in both chambers. You're going to have to work with Democrats to get any kind of new legislation through. What are you actually- when- when does this begin? What are you actually proposing here?
Handel has raised a total of $4.56 million as of May 31, but she has had way more help from outside groups.
Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wisconsin, on Thursday said Republicans will introduce a plan to replace Obamacare next year.
Pelosi spoke to Office of Management and Budget Mick Mulvaney Tuesday night in which she reiterated that the payments must be included in the omnibus package, but at that point, Mulvaney had suggested that the administration might cut them off, according to an aide familiar with their conversation.
MARGARET BRENNAN: And I know your own campaign has had some reckoning with this as well in the past.
The pair had been sparring publicly since Biden was a member of the Senate and Warren was a Harvard law professor. In 2002, Warren called out the then-Senator from Delaware in a New York Times op-ed over bankruptcy legislation being debated in Congress. They later butted heads over the same issue at a 2005 Senate Judiciary Committee hearing.
Taken together, the components of the coronavirus bill represent the biggest expansion of federal help for health insurance since the Obama-era Affordable Care Act more than 10 years ago. Obamacare not only survived President Donald Trump's repeated attempts to tear it down but will now get a shot of new life.
In 2016, she defeated Rep. Loretta Sanchez, also a Democrat, in a landslide and became the first woman of color to represent California in the Senate. During her two years on Capitol Hill, Harris has solidified herself as a leading critic of the Trump administration, known for her fierce questioning as a member of the Judiciary and Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs committees. Harris announced her presidential candidacy on Martin Luther King Jr. Day, Jan. 21, 2019. Key issues In her short tenure in the Senate, Harris has compiled a liberal voting record and has overwhelmingly voted against President Trump's nominees for cabinet-level and other administration positions. Along with her tough, prosecutorial cross examinations during committee sessions, Harris has advocated for criminal justice and immigration reform and has contrasted her platform with Mr. Trump's agenda. Although she opposed the legalization of recreational marijuana during her law enforcement career in California, Harris announced her support for the Marijuana Justice Act crafted by Sen. Cory Booker, D-New Jersey. The bill would remove marijuana from the 1970 Controlled Substances Act, withhold federal funding for states which continue to criminalize the substance, require courts to expunge convictions for marijuana use or possession and establish a federal fund to help low-income communities affected by the so-called war on drugs. In October, Harris unveiled new tax legislation aimed at the middle class to give families up to $6,000 a year in refundable tax credits, which she will likely highlight on the 2020 campaign trail.
Lesley Stahl: But you do hear it?
The three sets of hurdles confronting Puzder present him with different challenges:
The president's stance on Russia has done a 180 also.
Now, the taxes are a very simple thing. As soon as I have — first of all, I pay hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes. Many of her friends took bigger deductions. Warren Buffett took a massive deduction. Soros, who's a friend of hers, took a massive deduction. Many of the people that are giving her all this money that she can do many more commercials than me gave her — took massive deductions.
MARGARET BRENNAN: All right. Ambassador O'Brien, thank you for joining us.
The winter of 2016 may well be remembered for a blizzard, but not of snow. Squalls of spin have socked voters across the land, reports CBS News' Mark Albert. It's been a flurry of promises and pledges, broadsides and bombast -- all delivered with the gusto of a nor'easter.
Not politically viable adds the number two Democrat in the Senate, Dick Durbin of Illinois, who opines that it's too early in the process to be using these words.
The Texas Republican blasted Boehner, who stepped down from his Congressional seat in September after a lengthy career in the House, as symptomatic of everything that is wrong and corrupt with Washington.
What Boehner is angry with is that conservatives said if we promised to repeal Obamacare, let's actually stand up and repeal Obamacare, Cruz said. What Boehner is angry with is if we said we promised to stop amnesty, let's actually honor our promises and stop amnesty. What Boehner is angry with is if we promised to stop the debt that is bankrupting our kids and grandkids, let's actually do something meaningful to honor those commitments.
These payments are made to health insurers to help low-income people enrolled under the health care law with out-of-pocket expenses. The payments are known as cost-sharing reduction (CSR) payments. Democrats wanted language included in a government-wide spending package to guarantee that the payments would continue after President Trump threatened to cut them off.
MARGARET BRENNAN: How can you stop--
Victims of gun violence Whitehouse.gov There will be one empty, but very poignant seat in first lady Michelle Obama's box during President Barack Obama's final State of Union, on January 12, 2016, for the victims of gun violence. As the White House website explains, the empty seat is to support the Americans whose lives have been forever changed by the terrible ripple effect of gun violence - survivors who've had to learn to live with a disability, or without the love of their life.
Tariffs and trade are finding their way into the elections, too. Though the White House renegotiated a trade agreement to replace the North American Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA, Congress must approve it — something that becomes less certain with a Democratic-controlled House in January. And the effects of Mr. Trump's already imposed and threatened tariffs on steel and aluminum, cars and trucks, and goods from China are seeping into corporate finances large and small. Millions of jobs are at stake, and prices are rising for consumer goods from autos to food to televisions.
MARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to Florida Republican Senator Rick Scott who joins us from Naples this morning. Senator, welcome to FACE THE NATION. You got your work cut out for you. President Trump said you are one of the senators in charge of coming up with a Republican alternative to Obamacare. When are we going to see your proposal?
Looking ahead to Tuesday's primary and beyond to the subsequent early-voting states, Biden signaled to his rivals and the national press corps that he is committed to winning the primary race. I know there are a awful lot of folks out there who…write off this campaign, Biden said at the outset of the speech, Well, I've got news for them. I'm not going anywhere.
At one point he found himself defending his opponent Barack Obama's honor, calling him a decent person after a supporter called Obama Arab.
He says he's going to the convention, unless there's some extraordinary circumstance, I believe that he'll go to the convention, Tyler said. The super PAC serves Newt so I think that, we've all said we're going to serve Newt. And if Newt wants to stay all the way to the convention, we're going to be there.
MARGARET BRENNAN: We saw this historic moment with President Trump stepping into North Korea. And I wonder, if you're commander in chief, would you continue the diplomacy that he has started?
MAYOR FRANCIS SUAREZ: Well, like I said, you know, unfortunately, that's not in our purview. That's something that the governor has decided. And certainly we're-- we're blessed that our residents, I think, are also heeding the warnings and are using masks, despite the fact that there are significantly greater concentrations of people at those establishments. Because of that, our hospitalizations have plummeted from the summer. And like I said, we're in-- in a place where we have significantly less than we had before. Obviously, for our aging population, we're focusing on vaccinating that population right now as we speak. And that's been our priority to make sure that we can protect those that are the most vulnerable, those that are at the most risk of losing their life if they contract the virus.
He singled out former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, the early GOP establishment favorite who declared his bid on Monday. He's weak on immigration, he's in favor of Common Core [state education standards], Trump said of Bush. How the hell can you vote for this guy?
V.S. Naipaul AP Photo/John McConnico Novelist and essayist V.S. Naipaul (August 17, 1932-August 11, 2018), the first writer of Indian origin to win the Booker Prize, traveled as a self-described barefoot colonial from his rural childhood in Trinidad to an Oxford education in England, and would be hailed as one of the greatest writers of the 20th century. Naipaul's books (including The Enigma of Arrival, Finding the Centre and The Enigma of Arrival) explored colonialism and decolonization, exile and the struggles of the everyman in the developing world. He was critical of colonialism (he would repeatedly reject his birthplace as little more than a plantation), but saw himself as a realist, cured of illusions. His outlook was characterized by the famous opening words of A Bend in the River: The world is what it is. After working as a writer for the BBC, he earned plaudits for a string of novels, and traveled extensively to pen journalistic essays and books on culture, politics and religion. He was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 2001 for having united perceptive narrative and incorruptible scrutiny in works that compel us to see the presence of suppressed histories. If you come from the New World, as I in large measure do, you see all the absurd fantasies people have taken there and the troubles they have wrought as a result, Naipaul told The Associated Press in 2000. We were not given a proper history of the New World itself. This was not out of wickedness.
The agreement that we have is that she'd provide a diversified portfolio, which is exactly what virtually every one of you have in your investment opportunities, and make certain that in order to protect one's assets, that there's a diversified arrangement for purchase of stocks, Price said. I knew nothing about those purchases.
We heard about Americans like firefighter David Dahlberg. He's here with us also. David faced down walls of flame to rescue almost 60 children trapped at a California summer camp threatened by those devastating wildfires.
Even if an immigrant is not in the country legally, they should be able to pay full price for health insurance, she said. If they can afford it, they should be able to go into the marketplace and buy it.
Kavanaugh is still young at 53, but has extensive experience on the bench. The Yale Law School graduate has served as a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit since 2006. Through the years, he has issued scores of opinions, dissents and concurrences. He clerked for Kennedy, the man he would be replacing. And he gained attention from his time working for former independent counsel Ken Starr during the investigation into then-President Bill Clinton. He is the only one of the top three with a law degree from an Ivy League school.
LaRose previously indicated his support to extend the vote by mail primary to June 2 in a letter on March 21 sent to Ohio's General Assembly, but Ohio's state legislature voted to extend the primary date to April 28. Voting rights groups said that Ohio's Board of Elections was not fully prepared for the transition to a vote-by-mail primary due to the lack of time it was given. Voting rights groups said the timeline did not provide voters enough time to learn about the vote-by-mail process and did not give adequate time for Ohio's Board of Elections to print more envelopes, ballots and applications. The boards of elections and the Secretary of State have been scrambling to make this work, said Catherine Turcer, the executive director of Common Cause Ohio, a nonpartisan advocacy group on protecting voting rights. Clearly more time would have made this work better for voters and certainly for the people administering our elections.
MARGARET TALEV: --the number two in command would be able to step into that job without some of that political baggage. So, yes, I do think that they are looking right now in the next few months at how many other positions they can turn over and who could step in.
Both the district court and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ruled in favor of House Democrats in March. But the Supreme Court blocked lawmakers from obtaining the grand jury documents while it considers the case.
BEN DOMENECH: I think it's very significant. I mean, the-- the fact is that there had been a real push within the Republican coalition for criminal justice reform at the state level backed by the Koch brothers and other groups that really wanted to see it as something that was part of the Republican policy portfolio. That really was short circuited by the existence of the Donald Trump 2016 candidacy running on the law and order message that sounded more familiar to those who think that we might still be living in the late '70s. And-- and frankly, the-- the nomination and approval of Jeff Sessions as attorney general was something that really short-circuited that process. Jared Kushner worked very hard within the White House to try to push this forward. And I think it's significant that this was--
Another unknown factor is former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who is also mulling a presidential bid and has already placed his name on the Democratic primary ballot in Alabama and Arkansas. A decision by the media mogul is expected soon, aides say.
Haley was quick to caution that she wasn't calling for open borders or a more lax immigration system.
Bernardo Bertolucci Neal Ulevich/AP His early ambition was to be a poet, like his father. Instead, Bernardo Bertolucci (March 16, 1941-November 26, 2018) would establish himself as a major name in international cinema, uncowed in dramatizing stories involving politics, class warfare, spirituality, eroticism and incest. Beginning his career as an assistant director for Pier Paolo Pasolini, he made his first film, The Grim Reaper, about the murder of a prostitute, in 1962. By the early 1970s, he had already directed several acclaimed features, including Before the Revolution, The Spider's Strategem, and The Conformist, a visually astonishing tale of a bureaucrat (Jean-Louis Trintignant) subsuming himself to the orders of Mussolini's secret police. It was his bold and improvisational 1973 feature Last Tango in Paris, starring Marlon Brando and Maria Schneider as a middle-aged man and younger woman engaged in a brutal sexual relationship, that earned Berlotucci both critical kudos and censorship. (The movie was banned in Italy.) He would later win two Academy Awards for writing and directing the sumptuous 1987 biopic The Last Emperor (pictured), the first Western production to be shot in Beijing's Forbidden City. Bertolucci's other films include the five-hour epic 1900, about Italy during the rise of fascism, starring Robert De Niro, Gerard Depardieu and Dominique Sanda; The Sheltering Sky, based on the Paul Bowles novel of an American couple's disintegrating relationship during a trip to Africa; Little Buddha, about Siddharta; and The Dreamers, an erotic drama set against the 1968 student riots in Paris.
Lesley Stahl: Do you want to say anything to those people?
A president who will unleash the greatness in our nation and in all of us. Who will give the hardworking men and women who built this great nation a voice once again! That president can only be my mentor, my best friend, my father, Donald Trump, he said.
In addition, the new rules allow association plans to sell insurance across state lines. States regulate health insurers, and for the most part insurers must adhere to each state's regulations for the consumers they serve in those states. But under the new rules, association plans can choose which state they want as their regulatory jurisdiction. That means they could conceivable choose a loosely regulated state as their home base.
With seemingly a hard-boiled, Obama-era sentimentality, the former vice president is more hesitant than some of his Democratic rivals for a wholesale policy shift as they support Medicare for all programs, which would move all Americans to the same government-run healthcare plan and, in most plans, eliminate private insurance entirely.
Lesley Stahl: Are you prepared, both of you, for the lack of privacy and the intense scrutiny? And you know, first ladies are really criticized if one little hair's out of place. Are you both prepared for this?
CEDRIC RICHMOND (Senior Adviser to the President/@Richmond46): Good morning.
Mr. Trump is correct in saying that Exxon recently committed to invest at least $50 billion in the U.S. over the next five years. In a post this week on the energy company's corporate blog, CEO Darren Woods said that will create thousands of jobs, strengthen the U.S. economy and enhance energy security.
According to Cal Cunningham's campaign, the lawyer and former state senator raised $1 million in his challenge against North Carolina Senator Thom Tillis, including contributions from more than 4,000 North Carolinians. The campaign also says it has $1.1 million cash on hand ending the month of September.

Congresswoman Marcia Fudge of Ohio said that at some point the Democratic Party must reward and recognize its loyal soldiers, namely, black women. Fudge also warned that if the party doesn't mobilize black women, Democrats can't win in November. The mistake I believe we have made in the last couple of races we've run is we neglect to bring out our base, Fudge said. The base of the Democratic Party clearly is black and brown, but more black than brown.
Al Baldasaro, a New Hampshire representative and delegate for Trump, said in a radio interview that Clinton needs to be held responsible for the 2012 attack in Benghazi that killed four Americans. The comments were first reported by BuzzFeed.
Ownership by a PE outfit is full of complexities when it comes to cashing out an executive. Puzder has an undisclosed amount of stock in CKE, yet he can't simply unload shares via a broker because there is no public market for them. He needs the consent of Roark principals to divest, for one thing. And buyout firms are hemmed in by many legal strictures. With Roark, little is known about the nature of Puzder's CKE assets.

When I speak, I go out and speak, the people of this country are furious. In my opinion, the people that have been long-term workers at the FBI are furious. There has never been anything like this, where e-mails — and you get a subpoena, you get a subpoena, and after getting the subpoena, you delete 33,000 e-mails, and then you acid wash them or bleach them, as you would say, very expensive process.

In Toledo, Biden addressed United Auto Workers and reminded them that the Obama administration had believed in them when the U.S. auto industry was in bankruptcy.
Mr. Trump's speech singled out foreign governments that extort unreasonably low prices from U.S. drugmakers using price controls and said U.S. trade representatives would prioritize the issue in trade deals. He accused the rest of the world of freeloading off U.S. drug companies, linking soaring prescription drug prices in the U.S. to lower prices abroad. When foreign governments extort unreasonably low prices from U.S. companies, the U.S. has to subsidize them, he said.
A new analysis from Pew Research Center of the data on official reports of COVID-19 deaths collected by Johns Hopkins University found that nearly a quarter of all deaths in the United States attributed to the coronavirus have been in just 12 congressional districts. CBS News campaign reporter Musadiq Bidar says all 12 of those congressional districts are fully or partially in New York City and are represented by Democrats in Congress. As of May 20, of the more than 92,000 Americans who lost their lives because of the coronavirus, nearly 75,000 were in Democratic congressional districts. The top 10% of congressional districts hit hardest by COVID-19 deaths account for more than half of all U.S. deaths. In terms of deaths, 41 of the top 44 hardest-hit congressional districts are represented by Democrats. These include the New York-area districts, as well as those in the Boston, Detroit and New Orleans metropolitan areas. About two-thirds, 68%, of the 44 least affected districts, the bottom 10%, are represented by Republicans in Congress. But the death rates, while highest in districts controlled by Democrats are decreasing steadily, whereas Republican-controlled districts are not experiencing the same kind of decline over time. In districts that have been hit the hardest, nearly half of the population does not identify as white. 53% of residents of these districts are white. On the flip side, districts that have the lowest coronavirus death rate, seven-in-ten residents are white. Read Pew's study here.
Keep in mind that even if your policy has a very narrow network, it shouldn't be so narrow that you can't use your insurer to find the specialized care you need in a timely manner, McAndrew said. If you have to go out of network because no provider is available within it, your treatment should be covered, she added.
SENATOR JOHN BARRASSO: Well, the-- the one part of the health care law that we took out with the tax law was the individual mandate that people had to pay a fine. The Democrats didn't even offer an amendment to-- to leave it in the bill because they know that, of the people that were paying this fine, millions have paid the fine. Most of them earned less than fifty thousand a year. So, it was very punishing, money they could have used to see a doctor for their child or their family--
In July, the high court ruled 7-2 in rejecting the president's claims he has absolute immunity from state criminal proceedings while in office, and found Vance can obtain his financial information. But the Supreme Court sent the case back to the lower courts so the president could raise additional arguments.

About 2,000 voters in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, received mail-in ballots for the incorrect party over the past week, reports CBS News campaign reporter Zak Hudak. Because the state holds a closed primary, Democrats and Republicans can only vote in their own party's races, but voters in the Eastern Pennsylvania county have been receiving ballots for the other party's primaries. The blunder was the result of a technology issue, said Teresa Harris, a spokesperson for the Montgomery County Board of Commissioners. The printer removed independent and third-party voters who can't vote in this primary, but accidentally rearranged the remaining voters and parties in its system, mixing them up, Harris said. By retracing how it happened, the printer was able to identify the voters who received the wrong ballots. Harris said county officials are working with the Postal Service to expedite the delivery of replacement ballots for those voters. The mistake comes two weeks after the same county said it sent faulty supplemental instructions to tens of thousands of voters. Pennsylvania elections offices are facing an unprecedented mail-in challenge in the state, with over 1.6 million residents applying for mail-in or absentee ballots, up from 84,000 in 2016.
Senate Democrats are meeting Thursday with White House officials, including White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough, one day after House Democrats met with members of the administration and demanded that by Friday, the president put forward a plan to address the problem of dropped plans. House Democrats are also scheduled to receive a briefing Thursday afternoon from McDonough.
The Democratic push to highlight health care in the midterm elections is evident in Elissa Slotkin's newest ad -- her second of the general election -- which was released Thursday. It tells of her mother's stage 4 ovarian cancer and promises voters Slotkin will fight to preserve health care coverage for those with pre-existing conditions. She's running to unseat incumbent Rep. Mike Bishop, R-Michigan, in Michigan's 8th Congressional District.
President Donald Trump: Oh, I didn't say that. You know, that's so misleading, the way y-- I say jokingly, Suburban women, you should love me because I'm giving you security. And I got rid of the worst regulation-- see, the way you said that--

Contrary to a lot of myths out there, this study shows that the undocumented pay a very significant share of their income to state and local taxes, Meg Wiehe, a co-author of the report told CBS MoneyWatch. They are also establishing roots here because they are committed to their communities.
BIDEN: I'm not watching this at all. I go out- I'm running for the same exact reason when I started: to restore some dignity to the office, to make sure that African-Americans and minorities get treated well, and this time when we rebuild the middle class get brought along, and to unify the country and the party. Nothing's changed why I'm running. And I'm going to continue to do that.
MARGARET BRENNAN: And I think many would agree with you, I guess it's the getting to that point that's the problem. Senator Schumer says no way, no how, no wall. Period.
JOHN DICKERSON: All right. Senator Van Hollen in twenty-three days. Thank you so much for being here.
Although he failed to secure the nomination at the state's party convention earlier this year, a recent Salt Lake Tribune poll showed Romney ahead by 42 percentage points. But Romney continues to walk a fine line. His criticism of Trump's zero tolerance immigration policy was relatively mild, retweeting agreement with former first lady Laura Bush's criticism of the practice and writing, I agree that we need a more compassionate answer.
Live audio will be provided as it was for arguments held remotely in May, which marked the first time the Supreme Court provided real-time audio to the public.

Q: How would the GOP dial back the federal role in health care?
McCain got over it by plunging into his work in the Senate where he championed causes large and small, sometimes causes his own party wanted no part of.
John McCain died in August after battling brain cancer. In the last years of his life, he became a frequent target of Mr. Trump, who said in 2015 that McCain isn't a war hero. In July 2017, McCain broke with Republicans to cast the deciding vote against the repeal of Obamacare, a vote Mr. Trump frequently mocks even months after McCain's death.
Single-payer health care has long been the objective of liberals who would like to see a single government entity, like Medicare, provide health care for everyone.
We also believe that patients with terminal conditions, and terminal illness, should have access to experimental treatment immediately that could potentially save their lives.
MARGARET BRENNAN: It's Sunday, December 16th. I'm Margaret Brennan. And this is FACE THE NATION.
The ACA pushed the number of Americans with health coverage to historic highs. But since President Trump took office, his administration and Republicans in Congress have made a series of changes that undermine the law, such as repealing the individual mandate that required people to have health insurance, limiting the amount of time people who have to sign up for health care, drastically cutting the budget for Obamacare outreach and allowing states to enact work requirements as a condition of Medicaid eligibility.
Democratic Senator Chris Coons of Delaware, who is a co-sponsor of the Wyden and Klobuchar bill, is pushing for $2 billion in the Phase 3 Coronavirus stimulus bill to expand voting by mail and early voting, his press secretary Madeline Broas told CBS News. The exact amount for elections is still being negotiated.
So I just want to congratulate you, CJ. You're a brave guy. Thank you very much.
Vice President Mike Pence: --as president of the United States, is that the American people always know where they stand.
The Department of Labor said Thursday that 6.6 million Americans filed for unemployment last week, double the number of applications reported the week before and 10 times the previous weekly record set in 1982.
In March, following the midterm elections, President Trump told reporters on the Hill and tweeted that The Republican Party would be the Party of Health Care!
JONAH GOLDBERG: Yeah. I think-- I think the end of the Mueller probe or at least this chapter of the Mueller probe is actually a very-- is a benefit to a lot of Democrats because it takes the issue of impeachment, turns down the temperature on that. It lets them talk about things like health care, which are actually benefits or advantages for Democrats and President Trump's decision to make health-- to give Democrats the talking point that we're going to debate about health care seem to me like an incredible unforced error. So it's the Mueller report is good news so far for the President, but I think it's also good news for a lot of the Democratic candidates, and the decision to-- to pivot to health care seems to me an unalloyed good for the Democrats right now.
MARGARET BRENNAN: I understand, but we're talking about justice and judges. Given the president's challenges with the law and his obligation under the Constitution to take care that the law be faithfully executed. Do you think- there's a contradiction here? Do you think he deserves four more years in office?
President Trump says he now understands the complexity of health care, after his party has repeatedly failed to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act (ACA). Now, Mr. Trump claims, the Republican Party is going to be the party of great health care.
Mike Bloomberg: I don't think I ever saw the book, but I do remember it.
As the coronavirus changes the way people think about conducting elections, CBS News campaign reporter Adam Brewster says there continues to be more polling suggesting growing support for mail voting. But there are some divisions along partisan lines, as Democrats are more likely to embrace it than Republicans, according to a new Associated Press/NORC poll. Overall, 39% of American adults said they support their state conducting elections only by mail without in-person voting, compared to 40% who oppose the measure. Democrats (47%) are more likely to favor that than Republicans (29%). In 2018, the AP/NORC poll found that only 19% of American adults supported conducting voting entirely by mail. While Americans remain divided on that issue, a majority (56%) say they support letting people vote by mail without an excuse, while 26% oppose letting people vote that way.
But that language, does it bother you at all?
President Donald Trump: No. If I mention her name about something, they go crazy.
The data have been weighted to reflect U.S. Census figures on demographic variables.
Now that polls are showing that Donald Trump could be a serious contender for the Republican presidential nomination, the real estate developer and reality television personality is getting serious blowback from conservative organizations that are questioning his Republican credentials.
ANNA PALMER: Clearly, the President thinks it does. He brought it up at a State of the Union, and has been doing it several times at all the campaign rallies. I think Democrats are concerned about it, though. I think, you know, you don't see Nancy Pelosi and others wanting to carry the banner of socialism or democratic socialism at all. You know, and I think you have this, again, I kind of brought it up earlier, but this push-pull in the Democratic Party of where you have the Bernie Sanders, the AOCs of the world and where the Democratic establishment is and where they think they can win in a lot of these more moderate districts and in some of these states that are going to be up in 2020, that running the Bernie Sanders playbook is not going to work.
See, I understand the tax code better than anybody that's ever run for president. Hillary Clinton — and it's extremely complex — Hillary Clinton has friends that want all of these provisions, including they want the carried interest provision, which is very important to Wall Street people. But they really want the carried interest provision, which I believe Hillary's leaving. Very interesting why she's leaving carried interest.
Donnelly also took a beating when the Associated Press reported how his family's business, Stewart Superior Corp., was outsourcing work to Mexico. Donnelly personally profited from the practice despite railing against the outsourcing methods of other Indiana companies, such as Carrier Corp.
Well, the good news is that if you lose your employer-provided coverage, which covers about a 180 million Americans, that is a significant life event, which makes you then eligible to sign up for the Affordable Care Act, Cornyn responded. And as you know, it has a sliding scale of subsidies up to 400% of poverty. So that's an option for people.
TRUMP: President Obama — Anderson, excuse me. President Obama, by keeping those lines, the boundary lines around each state, it was almost gone until just very toward the end of the passage of Obamacare, which, by the way, was a fraud. You know that, because Jonathan Gruber, the architect of Obamacare, was said — he said it was a great lie, it was a big lie. President Obama said you keep your doctor, you keep your plan. The whole thing was a fraud, and it doesn't work.

MARGARET BRENNAN: But you're asking for it?
The leaders confirmed details about the bill's contents.
Joe Biden called Mr. Trump a fool for mocking mask-wearing and said the president should be leading by example. Biden told CNN on Tuesday evening the president is leaning into falsely masculine language on the masks that reminded him of the boys in his childhood who played ball but don't like to get hit. Later in the interview, Biden criticized the president of having trouble controlling his own emotions. Biden called Mr. Trump erratic the more Mr. Trump feels he is behind the curve in polling. And on the current state of his search for a running mate, Biden said he is not making that commitment to choose a woman of color as some would hope. Biden confirmed CBS News' reporting last week that the deep background vetting checks are not yet happening but that the vetting committee has interviewed a lot of these people already. Simply put, Biden called the search underway.
Who at the FBI was driving this?
The businessman said he was headed to Nevada to campaign Sunday and predicted he would do terrific both there and in the SEC primary, the collection of southern states that vote on Super Tuesday.
At issue in the latest ruling are so-called association health plans, in which businesses and sole proprietors can band together to offer lower-cost coverage that doesn't provide all the benefits required under the Affordable Care Act. Bates took issue with how the Trump administration interpreted the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, which regulates how health care plans are provided to employees.
John Boehner thinks Trump can win in November
While Mr. Obama and Haley were seemingly in agreement that the nation should reject divisive rhetoric, the president on Tuesday night took aim at the entire GOP -- not just its controversial front runner.
A little over a week after Ohio's vote-by-mail primary concluded, Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose is proposing voting reforms ahead of future elections. In a fact sheet from the Secretary of State's office, some of the reforms include allowing voters to request an absentee ballot online, providing pre-paid postage envelopes in order for voters to mail in their ballots and moving the absentee ballot request deadline to the Tuesday before election day.
SENATOR RICK SCOTT: First of, it's very important to me that people get health care. I-- I will only support something where people have access to health care but it's got to be at a price they can afford.
On this issue, Clinton has the advantage.
The Federal Reserve is expected to raise interest rates again Wednesday, the fourth increase of this year. It's been raising rates since over the last three years, and investors will want to know if the Fed is scaling back its plans for further increases based on the turmoil in the stock market over the last few months and mounting evidence that world economic growth is slowing down.

Lesley Stahl: It'll be here in two weeks. It's gonna be like nothing you've ever seen before. And of course we haven't seen it. So why didn't you develop a health plan?
Manchin—a former governor—is well-liked. But he's also a Democrat who voted against Trump's signature efforts like repealing Obamacare and cutting taxes. Which is why so many Democrats were pulling for Blankenship. Or as he's known to people who don't follow politics very closely, the China People guy.
Wayne Messam Screenshot from Wayne Messam's 2020 campaign video Wayne for America Biography Born in Pahokee, Florida and raised in South Bay, Mayor Wayne Messam became the first African American mayor of the city of Miramar after unseating a 16-year incumbent in 2015. Messam's parents immigrated to South Florida from Jamaica. His father worked as a laborer in the sugar cane fields of the Florida Glades after coming to the United States, and his mother would cook to feed the migrant workers. Messam earned a full football scholarship to Florida State University, where he started at wide receiver and was a member of the 1993 National Championship Team under legendary coach Bobby Bowden. He would go on to build one of the fastest-growing, minority-owned construction businesses in the country. Wayne married his college sweetheart and business partner, Angela, more than 20 years ago. They have three children, Wayne II, and twin daughters, Kayla and Kyla. Issues While lacking name recognition outside Florida, Messam told CNN that under his leadership, the city of Miramar has passed living wage legislation and has made great strides recovering from Hurricane Irma. He has also filed a lawsuit against the state so local mayors can advocate for gun control in their cities. These are issues that have national implications and I'm looking forward to be that agent of change for the American people and I'm so excited to launch my candidacy to be the president of the United States, he said.
The Democrats need to flip 23 Republican-held districts to take control of the House of Representatives this fall, and CBS News rates 5 of the House districts facing primary elections on Tuesday as very likely or probably competitive in November (CO-6, NY-11, NY-19, NY-22, and UT-4).
SEN. KLOBUCHAR: That is correct. Yes.
The Supreme Court agreed in March to hear the case, and the decision is expected by the end of June 2021.

Pro-Biden super PAC American Bridge 21st Century has launched an 11-day, $1.6 million paid media blitz - primarily in Pennsylvania - targeting seniors, veterans, and the small-town, rural voters, report CBS News campaign reporter Nicole Sganga and political unit associate producer Sarah Ewall-Wice. The new spots include broadcast, cable, digital and radio ad buys, mail, as well as billboards and postcards. A new advertisement highlighting a former Trump supporter -- Preacher -- will begin airing on Pennsylvania TV and radio this weekend, up through Election Day. American Bridge will roll out two new Pennsylvania digital ads: Harold and Pennsylvania Lives. While the American people knew this president could not be trusted to tell the truth, the COVID-19 pandemic gave Donald Trump's dishonesty and incompetence new meaning for millions of families -- and they are ready for a change, said American Bridge 21st Century President Bradley Beychok. American Bridge 21st Century began our first ever paid media program with a clear mission to undercut Trump's support with seniors, rural communities, and the White working class voters who propelled him to narrow victories in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Michigan in 2016. In the final days of this election, it's never been more clear that the president has no path to reelection without these Blue Wall states. American Bridge 21st Century is closing out the election with a final push to ensure Pennsylvania goes blue, fighting as hard as we can up until the minute polls close to elect Joe Biden the next President of the United States.

JOHN DICKERSON: And, Susan, may-- maybe some people are arguing what led the Saudis to believe this is not a lot of scolding on what is happening in Yemen. And that there were-- there is a pattern here of, basically, saying either explicitly or implicitly, We're not going to mess with your sovereignty.
BIDEN: Not at all. Look, we went out and went to the committee, went to the Republican leadership and said, look, this is what we have. I didn't. But the intelligence community did. This is what we have. Why don't you join us in condemning what's happening? And the Republican leader of Senate said, no, I want no part of it- joining in what is happening. And everything that came up subsequently to that reinforced what we were saying was going on. Now, the question was, should the president have come along and said, by the way, this is happening and then it be viewed and accused of we were somehow--
Ends the visa lottery -- a program that randomly hands out green cards without any regard for skill, merit, or the safety of our people, Mr. Trump said.

Priebus said that Clinton has lied, which provoked delegates on the convention floor to begin chanting what they've yelled out each night this week: Lock her up, lock her up!
That's a very common device. If you want to give somebody some money but you don't want to promise it to them on a continuing basis, you frame it as a bonus, Summers said.

Two independent experts said Wednesday that the administration appears to be taking aim at provisions of the ACA that protect people in employer plans, not only the smaller pool of consumers who buy a policy directly from an insurer. The new Trump administration position was outlined last week in a legal brief filed by the Justice Department in a Texas case challenging the Obama health law.

Speaker Nancy Pelosi: It should not have taken this long for the president-- he said he was under audit. When I was in a-- I was going to a Martin Luther King breakfast in San Francisco and one of the waiters there said to me, Madame Speaker, when the president says the Mueller report's going on too long just tell him not as long as your audit. (LAUGHTER) Everybody has released their returns and we will have legislation to say that everyone should-- must, but for the moment he's been hi-- so what's he hiding?

SENATOR RICK SCOTT: I-- you know-- whatever happens with Obamacare--
The defense budget has certainly increased under Mr. Trump, although that doesn't necessarily equal a stronger military. The Pentagon failed its first-ever audit released in November 2018, although then-Deputy Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan said at the time the Pentagon never expected to pass it.
The second health insurance problem is known as adverse selection. This is an information problem that arises because people know more about their own health than their insurance companies. And that makes it difficult for insurance companies to sort people into pools with premiums that match their expected health costs. If they charge enough to cover the high-cost patients, the healthier patients tend to drop out, leaving only the most expensive and unprofitable patients in the market.
While average premiums will eventually drop, CBO said Monday that the Senate bill would lead to higher out-of-pocket spending for people and fewer covered benefits.
MARGARET BRENNAN: So you think this piece by piece approach is the best way to do it rather than a wholesale Republican alternative?
Speaker Nancy Pelosi: We just started.

Vermont's gubernatorial primary also features 14-year-old candidate Ethan Sonneborn. Vermont has no age requirement for gubernatorial candidates. Although he is taking the campaign seriously and hopes to win, Sonneborn told the Washington Post that he hopes his campaign inspires his peers: It's on us to build our own future, he said. You've got to get involved, you've got to vote, you've got to knock on doors. It's how we're going to make the changes we want to see in the state, in this country, in this world. When we get involved, we make our democracy stronger.

Donnelly touted his bipartisan record in the heavily Republican state and highlighted his independent streak in conversations with voters. He's believes his pro-Indiana stance -- meaning he's not a rubber stamp for a Trump agenda -- is one of the biggest differences between him and his opponent, businessman and former state Representative Mike Braun.
Probably minus, Trump said. It makes it exciting, it makes it nice. But when you have a very beautiful woman -- and she's a very beautiful woman -- it perhaps looks -- I don't know. You know some other people may say, 'Gee whiz I don't want you watching television because I don't want you looking at his girlfriend or his wife' or this and you know, it could be a minus.
If they are successful in striking down the Affordable Care Act, Republicans will own all of the consequences, Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer of New York said on a call Monday with reporters.
In Vermont, Republican incumbent Phil Scott is running for re-election. Scott's competitor is Keith Stern, a Springfield businessman. There are four Democratic candidates running in the primary. They include: James Ehlers, Christine Hallquist, Brenda Siegel and Ethan Sonneborn. Ehlers, the executive director of Lake Champlain International, was a former advisor to Sen. Sanders. If Hallquist, a former executive at a utility company, wins the primary, she will be a step closer towards becoming the nation's first transgender governor. Siegel is the Executive Director of the Southern Vermont Dance Festival and has been involved in her local Democratic committees. The Washington Post wrote a profile about 14-year-old candidate Sonneborn.
Sanders called it an unfortunate statement.
A number of major insurers are planning to scale back their participation in Obamacare's health exchanges. That could leave consumers facing higher insurance costs and fewer options. But all is not lost; here's what you can do if you're at risk of losing your coverage.

JOHN DICKERSON: Mr. Speaker, thanks for being here.
I'm not asking about the details, Rose replied. Did he believe the intelligence report that the CIA prepared for him?
JOE BIDEN: I've been saying this for over three years. The President denies they are involved. They've been involved. I was deeply involved in the intelligence apparatus and how it functioned before we left the vice presidency. It was clear they were involved. The President continues to deny their involvement. It's overwhelming. And the fact is that everybody knows except-- but when the President stands before the whole world, looks at Vladimir Putin, says, why would he want to interfere in our elections? Well, seventeen intelligence agencies told me-- told them he did. So this is all-- this is bizarre. This is bizarre. This is continuing. And what's happened? Why in God's name haven't we hardened the electoral process--provided billions-- hundreds of millions of dollars to the states to be able to harden their voter rolls, make sure they can't be attacked by cyber security as a consequence of cyber attacks. Why haven't we provided the capacity for them to be able to have the money to have paper ballots in addition to that? I mean this is-- this is outrageous and it's going on. Look, I joined with the leaders of Europe when the European elections took place back before I got involved. I'd be-- before I-- before I decided to run. And we set up an organization that, in fact, said every European leader running in-- in either party, in any party, would take a pledge--
MARGARET BRENNAN: Who informed you of that? Was it Facebook or have U.S. intelligence officials told you about some kind of meddling with the campaign?
CLINTON: You know, under our Constitution, presidents have something called veto power. Look, he has now said repeatedly, 30 years this and 30 years that. So let me talk about my 30 years in public service. I'm very glad to do so.
JOHN DICKERSON: All right. We're going to have to end it there. And we didn't talk about Kanye West.
MARGARET BRENNAN: But that opens a new can of worms because you have a different complexion in Congress starting in January.
The administration reported earlier in the week that nearly 3.3 million people have selected plans on the Obamacare marketplace as of Feb. 1. However, insurance companies are saying that about 20 percent of those people failed to pay their premiums on time and consequently didn't receive coverage in January, the New York Times reports. I think people are enrolling in multiple places, Aetna CEO Mark T. Bertolini reportedly said. They are shopping. And what happens is that they never really get back on HealthCare.gov to disenroll from plans they prior enrolled in.
But McConnell is not one to take slights too personally, and Mr. Trump is often looking for the next deal. Soon Republicans would pass the GOP tax plan and head toward the new year, and all sides started seeing the benefits of a unified front.
Former President Barack Obama headlined a rally in Las Vegas with Jacky Rosen, the Democratic candidate for Senate, and other Nevada Democrats. He told the roaring crowd to remember who started the current trend of economic growth and the longest streak of job creation on record.
You know, because it sounds like you're in the business or you're aware of people in the business — you know that we are now for the first time ever energy-independent. We are not dependent upon the Middle East. But the Middle East still controls a lot of the prices. So the price of oil has been way down. And that has had a damaging effect on a lot of the oil companies, right? We are, however, producing a lot of natural gas, which serves as a bridge to more renewable fuels. And I think that's an important transition.
To help ease the pain on farmers, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) began the first round of emergency aid payments through the Market Facilitation Program (MFP) on Tuesday. The program will pay nearly $4.7 billion with about $3.7 billion going to soybean farmers. The USDA announced in July that a $12 billion aid package would be available to farmers through three programs to help farmers affected by the tariffs.
In a phone interview earlier this month, South Carolina Democratic Party chair Trav Robertson told Mitchell that it will be interesting to see how Patrick and other newcomers to the Democratic primary race fare. I think that it is obvious that [Patrick]—along with Michael Bloomberg think that they have a narrative or a certain viewpoint or some type of ability to add to the field, said Robertson. This is something that we normally don't see in presidential primaries or nominating processes — people [getting] in later, rather than sooner, and so it's going to be an interesting next couple of months.
Kenton Stacy would have died if it were not for Justin's selfless love for his fellow warrior. Tonight, Kenton is recovering in Texas. Raqqa is liberated. And Justin is wearing his new Bronze Star, with a V for valor. Staff Sergeant Peck, all of America salutes you.
Will this be another good night for female and first-time candidates?
For someone with a pre-existing condition thinking about switching jobs, the answer to the question could make a life-changing difference, added Bagley.
We have to repeal it and replace it with something absolutely much less expensive and something that works, where your plan can actually be tailored. We have to get rid of the lines around the state, artificial lines, where we stop insurance companies from coming in and competing, because they want — and President Obama and whoever was working on it — they want to leave those lines, because that gives the insurance companies essentially monopolies. We want competition.
MARGARET BRENNAN: How much of a difference will it make that the Biden administration is giving three weeks' notice versus one week's notice to states about the doses they're going to receive?
Donald Trump: Sure. Everybody's a lobbyist down there--
Scott Wilson AMC Veteran character actor Scott Wilson (March 29, 1942-October 6, 2018) played a murderer in 1967's In Cold Blood and a murder suspect in In the Heat of the Night. Wilson's other film credits included 1974's The Great Gatsby, The Right Stuff, Dead Man Walking, Monster, Junebug, Pearl Harbor, and The Ninth Configuration, for which he earned a Golden Globe nomination. He also had a recurring role on the series CSI: Crime Scene Investigation. But he was best known for playing veterinarian Hershel Greene on the AMC series The Walking Dead, a character the network called the emotional core of the show. An Atlanta native who hitchhiked to L.A. as a teenager, took an acting class, liked it, and stayed, Wilson told the Journal-Constitution in 2011 that his career had always been up and down. … You have dry spells. At different times, you are starting over. If you love it, you stay with it. That's what I'm doing. And he remained a familiar face. I have people who come up to me who think we went to high school in places I've never been, Wilson said.
Jim Hood will expand Medicaid to cover 300,000 more people and fight to keep Mississippi's rural hospitals open — to raise teacher pay, and build an administration as diverse as Mississippi, the robocall script reads.
Among the more moderate Democrats, they're not going to want to increase the deficit too much. That's obviously going to be a limiting factor, he adds.
Elizabeth Warren Elizabeth Warren takes formal step toward 202... 02:18 Biography Warren was born in 1949 and raised in Oklahoma, where her father worked as a janitor and her mother took a minimum wage job at Sears. She has described growing up in a paycheck-to-paycheck family that lived on the ragged edge of the middle class. Warren first married at age 19 and became an elementary school teacher after graduating from the University of Houston. She began law school at Rutgers University when her daughter was two years old, and she gave birth to a son soon after earning her degree. Warren served as a law professor for three decades, and spent 20 of those years at Harvard Law School. Massachusetts Rep. Joe Kennedy III and Arkansas Sen. Tom Cotton were among her students there. After the 2008 financial collapse, Warren was tapped to lead the congressional oversight panel for the Troubled Asset Relief Program, known as TARP. She served as the architect of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau under the 2010 financial reform law known as Dodd-Frank. In those roles, she became a prominent figure on the national stage and a hero among progressive populists. But her views on the economy garnered plenty of critics within the Republican Party and among Wall Street bankers. Such opposition derailed Obama administration plans to nominate her to officially run the CFPB. Instead, she ran for the U.S. Senate in 2012 and defeated incumbent Massachusetts Republican Sen. Scott Brown--her first run at public office.
Democratic Senate candidate Jacky Rosen's message about never stopping the fight for health care seemed to resonate with voters in Clark County. Democratic volunteers with the state's largest union used it to sell Rosen to undecided voters.
The plan, revealed Wednesday, relies on individual tax credits to allow people to buy coverage from private insurers, and includes other largely familiar GOP ideas such as medical liability reform and expanding access to health savings accounts. It proposes putting $25 billion behind high-risk pools for people with pre-existing conditions and for others, and transforming the federal-state Medicaid program for the poor by turning it into state block grants or individual per-capita allotments to hold down spending.
CEDRIC RICHMOND: Look, I-- I can tell you one thing, and this is my time as a congressperson, I believe that we're in a different state than we've ever been before, members who do not want to face reality, members that are encouraging conspiracy theories and things like that. But the real-- the enemy that's within is the dysfunction of the Republican Party, unwilling to face facts, unwilling to put the people of America first. And, look, I have all the faith in the leadership ability of Nancy Pelosi. She's a great speaker. But the challenge is bringing people together right now. And that means Republicans ditching the division that has defined them for the last couple of years under the former President and coming to the table. All we're asking is those people that are out there busting their backs to keep food on their table and a roof over their head and clothes on their kids' back, come join us in helping them. And let's leave the conspiracy theories. Let's stop arguing about election fraud that we know never existed. And so that's the enemy within is the inability of people to acknowledge facts and come together to help the American people.
4. Will the Trump administration's immigration policies on family separation and efforts to terminate DACA increase Hispanic turnout?
Democrats need to flip 23 seats to gain the majority in the House. CBS News rates this race as competitive. Michigan's 8th congressional district, which President Donald Trump won in 2016 by almost seven points, includes Lansing and a portion of Northern Oakland County. Slotkin said her campaign has spent time with Trump voters and added that her campaign's fastest-growing volunteer category is Republican women over 50 years of age in the suburbs of Detroit.
The DCCC's hub also highlights the upcoming special election in California's 25th District, where Democrat Christy Smith is facing Republican Mike Garcia for Katie Hill's former seat. President Trump began Tweeting about the election Tuesday night, pointing out her past comments about Garcia's military service, and pushing the Republican argument that Smith voted to fire teachers. While Smith has apologized about her comments on Garcia, she pushed back against Mr. Trump's argument about her vote, saying that no teachers were fired.
I want us to be able, when we walk out this door, to say we couldn't think of anything else that we didn't try to do, the president said in this White House video posted Monday on Twitter:
MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION. We continue our 2020 political panel.
Nearly 180,000 illegal immigrants with criminal records, ordered deported from our country, are tonight roaming free to threaten peaceful citizens, Trump claimed. They are being released by the tens of thousands into our communities with no regard for the impact on public safety or resources.
The special election in Maryland's 7th district, formerly held by late Congressman Elijah Cummings, is one of the first upcoming test balloons for an all-mail ballot election. While three in-person polls will be open in the three counties of the Baltimore-area district, more than 513,000 mail ballots were sent out to registered voters across the district. St. Mary's College of Maryland political science associate professor Todd Eberly told CBS News political unit broadcast associate Aaron Navarro the special election is a perfectly-sized test case not only for the November presidential election, but for the state's June primaries. For us to get a feel for how smoothly does it go, where there are glitches, things that we have to work out – it gives us a chance to do all of that before the June primary comes, when we're talking about somewhere in the neighborhood of about 4 million ballots in the mail expected, he said. In addition to testing the logistics of an all-mail ballot, Eberly said it'll serve as a good step to educate all voters about how it works. Time with multiple elections absolutely gives us the benefit of by the time we get to a general election, you've got that real opportunity for people to know it, for the state to know what kind of communications they have to do. The ballots have to be postmarked by Tuesday, April 28.
ITEP projects that immigration reforms proposed by President Obama in 2012 and 2014 would potentially add more than $800 million of dollars in state and local tax revenue.
10:22 p.m. North Korea's reckless pursuit of nuclear missiles could very soon threaten our homeland. We are waging a campaign of maximum pressure to prevent that from happening, he said. Past experience has taught us that complacency and concessions only invite aggression and provocation. I will not repeat the mistakes of past administrations that got us into this dangerous position.
I'd say to Congress, the tone will be one of bipartisanship, a senior administration official told reporters in a background call Friday previewing the upcoming State of the Union address, three hours after President Trump tweeted Democratic Minority Leader Cryin' Chuck Schumer took such a beating in the recent government shutdown.
Patrick is a prominent African American in the Democratic Party and had been considered a viable candidate for president, given his past work as a federal prosecutor, his willingness to campaign for Democratic congressional candidates and his ties to former President Barack Obama. He had said last December that he would not run, citing the potential strain on friends and family.
And late last year, she pushed through tough international sanctions against North Korea after they tested an intercontinental ballistic missile – sanctions that may have helped lead to recent promises to roll back North Korea's nuclear program, and to an upcoming summit.
MARGARET BRENNAN: That's it for us today. Thank you for watching. Until next week, for FACE THE NATION, I'm Margaret Brennan.
JAMELLE BOUIE: I-- I think there's-- there's a flip side to that as well that could be dangerous for President Trump, which is that it's not as if Bernie Sanders is calling for like, you know, Democratic control of the means of production, right? Like, he's not calling for, you know, nationalization--
President Donald Trump: Gallup did a poll, 56% of the people said that they're better off now, during a pandemic, than they were during Obama and Biden. 56%. It was a record number.
Lesley Stahl: So are you saying she should send the kids back? Should the kids wear masks?

Federal authorities are warning campaigns to be on the lookout for foreign interference. Could we see hacked campaign emails or other foreign interference in the final weeks of the 2018 campaign?
Scott Pelley: Did you say these things?
Speaker Pelosi is now the most public face of the Democratic Party. Its most successful fundraiser and the agenda setter.
And we will be right back.
PAUL RYAN: Yes, I talk to him all the time about it. It's what I just said. He wants-- In addition to a DACA solution, he wants to secure the border including the border wall. Here's the problem. If we have an illegal immigration problem and we say we're going to give legal status to this group of people, as sympathetic as they are, and I don't want to see these kids deported, and then you don't fix the problem, you're going to have more people saying, Ah, come to the country illegally. Sooner or later, I'll get an amnesty. That's a bad incentive structure. So what you want to do is fix the root cause of the problem.
MARGARET BRENNAN: --right at the heart of American democracy.
MARGARET BRENNAN: You mentioned on spending: Steyer. You think the amount of money he is spending in South Carolina--
JONAH GOLDBERG: --all the way through and I am a Fox News contributor. But it was interesting.
Federal benefits like Social Security and Medicare will remain open, and mail will be delivered, but other operations will cease. The National Parks and Smithsonian Museums will be closed to the public, Americans will be unable to submit new applications for federal programs, and many routine food-safety inspections will be suspended, among other things.
While Democrats argue Barrett's writings indicate she would kill the health care law, the dispute before the Supreme Court in November raises different issues than the 2012 case, including whether the individual mandate is severable from the rest of Obamacare if the mandate is deemed unconstitutional.
Washington — The first deadlines to qualify for fallback coverage under the Affordable Care Act are looming for many laid-off workers who lost their health insurance in the coronavirus shutdown.
Biden's official plan was revealed shortly before the second primary Democratic debate set for the end of July. The debate presents a potential opportunity for Biden and handful of other candidates like Sen. Amy Klobuchar, former Rep. Beto O'Rourke, and Rep. John Delaney to name a few, who take issue with Medicare for all to address their healthcare policy differences more in depth.
It goes on take aim at the president over Medicare, Obamacare and pre-existing conditions. According to Priorities USA, the 30-second spot is airing on TV in Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Arizona.
A federal judge ruled against the Trump administration's highly touted small-business health insurance plan, calling it an end run around consumer protections provided by the Affordable Care Act.
In total, CBS News counts 35 states that have begun or will begin to lift some social distancing regulations. In other states with ongoing increases in COVID-19 cases, governors have extended their stay-at-home orders and are waiting for a clear break in the data to start any notable waves of reopenings.
9:45 p.m. Donald Trump claims Hillary Clinton represented a man who raped a 12-year-old girl, and laughed about the case.
Nearly a year after launching his presidential bid, Senator Cory Booker suspended his campaign this week as the Democratic Party faces renewed criticism for the lack of diversity among its presidential candidates.
Haley does sometimes put a softer focus on the president's pronouncements. Earlier this year, Mr. Trump threatened to cut off aid to Central American countries that don't do more to stop drug trafficking. They're laughing at us, so I'm not a believer in that, Mr. Trump said. I want to stop the aid.
The State Department says about 12,500 Syrian refugees will be admitted this year. Before that, 2,234 came to the United States between Oct. 2010 and Nov 2015. This is not tens of thousands.
Cops say man posing as Uber driver kidnapped, raped woman
But there are much worse images coming out of Aleppo every day now, where in the past few weeks alone, 400 people have been killed, at least 100 of them children. Just days ago, the State Department called for a war crimes investigation of the Syrian regime of Bashar al-Assad and its ally, Russia, for their bombardment of Aleppo.
After the speech, she told reporters she would be stumping in Wisconsin because there wasn't a lot of campaigning there during the 2016 presidential race. That ends with me, she said.
Donald Trump's pick to lead the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Georgia Rep. Tom Price, fielded tough questions Wednesday from the Senate's Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee.
SENATOR RICK SCOTT: --premiums went up, co-payments went up--
SEN. BARRASSO: Well the- the one part of the health care law that we took out with the tax law was the individual mandate that people had to pay a fine. The Democrats didn't even offer an amendment to- to leave it in the bill because they know that, of the people that were paying this fine, millions have paid the fine. Most of them earned less than fifty thousand a year. So it was very punishing, money they could have used to see a doctor for their child or their family--
Melania Trump: Yes, I tell him all the time.
Erika Franklin Fowler, who heads the Wesleyan Media Project at Wesleyan University in Connecticut, said, Trump has been sort of overwhelmingly focused in the summer on crime and public safety ...:
Rick Wilson, a media consultant and ad maker who worked for Republicans including Rudy Guiliani and President George H.W. Bush, feels Trump has set in motion a dark aspect of the Republican Party that had been lurking for years.
For the last year we have sought to restore the bonds of trust between our citizens and their government.
Mr. Trump originally said Mexico would pay for the wall — 100 percent, as he said.
Speaker Nancy Pelosi: As our founders said, when they declared independence and established a new nation, The times have found us. The times found Lincoln. Not to be presumptuous to put ourselves in those categories, but the times have found us, not because we're so great, but because of the urgency that-- of the-- situation that our country faces because of the situation in the White House.
The number of uninsured Americans has increased since 2016, according to the report, reversing years of decline since the ACA was passed in 2010. The number of uninsured adults between the ages of 19 and 64 rose to 15.5 percent in March 2018, up from 12.7 percent in 2016. An estimated 4 million people lost individual coverage during that period, while the number of people with employer-sponsored coverage stayed steady.
MARGARET BRENNAN: But, as you know, I mean that fight is happening right now in cities like Chicago. We'll be talking to their superintendent later on in the program. And Michael Bloomberg, former presidential rival to-- to President Biden, argued in an op-ed this week that the President could be doing more. He could use his bully pul-- pulpit, excuse me, to give political cover to fellow Democrats. He could tell the unions, yes, I understand how we need to prioritize teachers here and actually take measures to do it. Why isn't the President doing more to help out some of these fellow Democrats?
The Democrats need to flip 23 Republican-held districts to take control of the House of Representatives this fall, and CBS News rates 4 of the House districts facing primary elections on Tuesday as very likely or probably competitive in November (MN-1, MN-2, MN-3, and MN-8).
JOHN DICKERSON: John, in the old days if a President had written an op-ed that could have been fact checked, somebody would have maybe lost a job or there would have been embarrassment. There is a theory out there now that in this polarized world we're in that you, in fact, want to insert some things to get fact checked so you'll get another news cycle, and that the people you're trying to rile up are going to believe you no mountain-- if there's a mountain of fact checking. And so the second round in which there is fact checking actually ends up distributing the message through-- to a larger audience and that that's then good for you. Do you see that in play here?
Lesley Stahl: And you're out there--
[Paul Ryan: We had a fantastic, productive meeting.]
During a 2013 speech at an event organized by The Federalist Society -- a conservative legal group -- Gorsuch said, If I believed that judges and lawyers regularly acted as shills and hacks, I'd hang up the robe. I'd turn in my license.
The marquee item in Biden's healthcare pitch, officially released Monday, is to supplement ACA coverage, colloquially called Obamacare, by adding a public option for Americans to be able to buy into a Medicare-like system already available to those at least 65 years old.
Nevada expanded Medicaid, and its current Republican Gov. Brian Sandoval strongly opposes Obamacare repeal efforts. In addition, Mr. Trump's immigration rhetoric and policies may also hurt Heller in Nevada, where approximately 17 percent of eligible voters in 2016 were Hispanics. The Hill points out that Heller is distancing himself from the president on a local issue that matters to Nevadans, confronting the Trump administration over its plans to reopen the Yucca Mountain nuclear waste facility.
Attorney General William Barr, thank you very much for joining us here at CBS News.
The dispute from Pennsylvania is before the Supreme Court for a second time, though now Republicans are asking the high court to rule on the merits of the case. At issue is a Pennsylvania Supreme Court decision extending the deadline for mail-in ballots to be accepted by three days. Under the state high court's ruling, mail-in ballots postmarked by Election Day will be counted so long as they are received by November 6. Ballots received within that period that lack a postmark or have an unclear postmark are presumed to have been mailed by Election Day and therefore must be accepted, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court said.
And you look at our miners. Hillary Clinton wants to put all the miners out of business. There is a thing called clean coal. Coal will last for 1,000 years in this country. Now we have natural gas and so many other things because of technology. We have unbelievable — we have found over the last seven years, we have found tremendous wealth right under our feet. So good. Especially when you have $20 trillion in debt.
MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be right back.
The amount of U.S. treasuries on the market by next year will be double the amount in 2017, according to Deutsche Bank's calculations. All that supply is likely to push interest rates even higher, said Slok. We see interest rates going up higher, partly as result of the economy doing well, partly as results of more treasuries and partly as a result of the Federal Reserve, he said.
Bob Gates thinks highly of Clinton, but will he endorse her?
JOHN DICKERSON: Okay. Well, we're-- we're out of time. We'll have to leave it there. Senator, thanks so much for being with us.
2020 Democratic candidates pounced. Beto O'Rourke formally kicked off his campaign from his hometown of El Paso.

Everytown for Gun Safety this week announced it will spend at least $5 million on this year's race in Arizona, adding the latest infusion of campaign cash to a key battleground state already awash in spending, says CBS News campaign reporter Alex Tin.
Late Monday night, in a last ditch effort to end the ping-ponging between the House and Senate, House Republicans offered to setup a bipartisan conference committee to negotiate the differences between the House and Senate bills. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., rejected that proposal outright, repeating his mantra that the Senate isn't interested in passing anything but a clean spending bill and that they won't be forced to negotiate with a gun to our head. Senate Democrats also pointed out that they had been calling for a bipartisan conference for months, a request that had been brushed off by House Republicans.
Polls consistently show that between 60 and 80(!) percent of Democrats want their party to start impeachment as soon as Nancy Pelosi gets her hand on the gavel. A recent New York Times article on congressional races in North Carolina found that out on the campaign trail, there's a nonstop torrent of impeachment talk from voters in both parties.
Cruz, the runner-up in the Republican presidential primaries, is viewed more negatively than positively among registered voters nationwide, although Republicans are more apt to have a favorable view of him. Twenty-one percent of overall voters view Cruz favorably, while 42 percent have unfavorable opinion of him. About a third of voters are undecided or don't know enough about him.
TRUMP: Justice Scalia, great judge, died recently. And we have a vacancy. I am looking to appoint judges very much in the mold of Justice Scalia. I'm looking for judges — and I've actually picked 20 of them so that people would see, highly respected, highly thought of, and actually very beautifully reviewed by just about everybody.
President Obama announced Thursday that his administration will let health insurers extend existing health plans on the individual and small-group markets into 2014. The administrative policy change will let insurers reach out to the millions of Americans being dropped from their plans so that they can renew their insurance for another year while the market adjusts to new Obamacare regulations.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Chicago public schools are set to open tomorrow for the first time since March, but school officials and the teachers' union have been at odds over terms of the teachers returning to the classroom. Chicago Public Schools CEO Doctor Janice Jackson joins us. Good morning to you.
Our massive tax cuts provide tremendous relief for the Middle Class and small businesses.
JOHN DICKERSON: Why do-- why is it not about politics because when people think of what's tearing this country apart, politics is often the culprit.
Lesley Stahl: --with people-- a lot of people-- aren't. I'm-- I'm watching all these people jammed in together, and I'm seeing most of them without masks. And I'm wondering the message that you're sending with these pictures coming across television--
Views of the overall Obamacare law are equally mixed. Forty-six percent of those surveyed said they're in favor of the existing law, while 49 percent are opposed. And 53 percent of those surveyed said they are unhappy with the prices they pay for health care, compared with 46 percent who are happy with what they currently pay.
Both Democratic senators from Virginia -- Tim Kaine and Mark Warner -- released a joint statement Thursday saying that they oppose the CR.
On Tuesday, now-HHS Secretary Tom Price's seat is up for grabs in Georgia's 6th Congressional District. He cruised to victory with a 23-point margin in November. The race between Democrat Jon Ossoff and Republican Karen Handel could be considerably closer.
While no two speeches are completely alike, Trump has his greatest hits - and often, the crowds react as they might to Bruce Springsteen. When Trump opens speeches with a riff castigating the Iranian nuclear deal, he's just getting warmed up. When Trump says he's going to repeal and replace Obamacare - that's Trump's Born To Run - the crowd roars appreciatively. Getting rid of Common Core is Trump's Thunder Road. Over time, Trump's rallies have become more uniform - and even a bit more disciplined.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION. I want to go now to former White House counsel Don McGahn. He joins us from Owings Mills, Maryland. Thank you for joining us.
The Supreme Court said Monday it will take up a closely-watched challenge to the Affordable Care Act as Democrats work to save the health care law.
John Boehner in his remarks described Donald Trump as his texting and golfing buddy, Cruz told reporters. So if you want someone that's a texting and golfing buddy -- if you're happy with John Boehner as speaker of the House and you want a president like John Boehner, Donald Trump is your man.
Braver asked Haley, Should the president shut it down?
Behind Joe Biden's search for a running mate 02:04 More Democratic candidates jumped into the presidential race in 2019 than America has seen since the inception of the modern primary system. Here's a look at all the Democrats who campaigned for a chance to take on President Trump in November 2020.
Under the new rules, a short-term policy can be issued for a limit of 364 days and insurers are allowed to extend those policies up to 36 months, or a total of three years. Three years is not exactly short term, according to many health care advocates. Over a period of time that long, chances are higher a healthy person who signed up for a minimal plan may encounter health issues that could potentially be excluded from coverage.
He points to Vice President Mike Pence's approval of a similar expansion when he was governor of Indiana.
Americans are divided over President Obama's handling of the economy, and his overall approval rating is now at 44 percent - both measures virtually unchanged from last month.
President Obama tried a new venue to pitch the Affordable Care Act to young Americans: a web comedy show.
Lesley Stahl: What do you mean by that and what does it make you think about?
7:58 p.m. ET Florida Gov. Rick Scott said that Donald Trump is the man who can destroy the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) and who can prevent another terrorist attack in the U.S.
Moody's Analytics economists expect the Biden administration will dedicate increased funding for enhancements to social safety nets, possibly including:
Tuesday's election is a runoff, a result of the fact that no candidate won 50 percent of the vote in the April 18 jungle primary. Ossoff received 48.1 percent and Handel came in second with 19.8 percent in the 18-candidate field, including 11 Republicans, 5 Democrats, 2 independents.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Because I know you have been critical of Senator Sanders for not being strong enough in his condemnation of some of the vitriolic sentiment online. And Senator Sanders has come out with a statement saying, and he said it on the debate stage as well, that perhaps some of this may be fueled by the Russians. In other words--
Well, you know, Chris Wray has always supported and been very helpful in various investigations we've been running. He cooperated fully with Durham, cooperated fully with Jensen. But, you know, there are a lot of cases in the Department of Justice and I don't consider it the director's responsibility to make sure that all the documents are produced in each case. So I don't-- I wouldn't say that this has affected my confidence in Director Wray.
If we do that, we will pull down $6 billion from the federal government that will go into this state's health care system, so we can hire more doctors, more nurses, more nurse practitioners, Gillum said.
JOHN DICKERSON: On this question of the military, in 2013 the payments continued. So they don't continue now?
TRUMP STATEMENT: Last year, we had an almost $800 billion trade deficit.
The U.S. has become a dumping ground for everybody else's problems, he continued. And these aren't the best and the finest. When Mexico sends its people, they're not sending their best...they're sending people that have lots of problems...they're bringing drugs, they're bringing crime. They're rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.
MARGARET BRENNAN: But the candidates get a chance to throw some elbows and distinguish themselves on the debate stage on Tuesday that will be right here on CBS. Who succeeds in that arena?
Mr. Trump has made a similar claim before. If by now he means the U.S. has only now just begun exporting energy, that is false. The U.S. has been exporting coal, and it is true that the U.S. is a net exporter of coal -- that is, that it exports more coal to other countries than it imports. By the end of 2017, the U.S. had also become a net exporter of natural gas, according to the Energy Information Administration (EIA).

SEN. KLOBUCHAR: I don't think we should be doing business with them right now. And I agree with my colleagues not just Senator Rubio, but also Senator Warner, Mark Warner, who is the ranking on the Intelligence Committee, that this is a major security risk for America. You know, you look at everything from China to Russia using cyber against us. It is the modern warfare we certainly know that from our elections in 2016. They may not use tanks or missiles but they can go after our electric grid. They can go after our security in a very different way. And so I don't know why he would just give that away right now. I would think that he would put firm, firm standards in place as part of any agreement with China. And that's not what we have. We just have another promise that they're going to buy American agriculture. Okay, that's positive. But I wouldn't give it up in that short term gain for the long term where we need to protect our security and our cybersecurity.
It is the most damaging domestic policy. And that's saying something for this president who gave us Obamacare, he said.
Puzder finds himself on a Democratic target list that has included Mr. Trump's choices as Education Department secretary, businesswoman Betsy DeVos, and as Environmental Protection Agency administrator, Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt. Democrats portray these nominees as enemies of their intended agencies. On a largely partisan vote, DeVos narrowly won Senate confirmation Tuesday.
But as far as other elements of what she was saying, I don't know Putin. I think it would be great if we got along with Russia because we could fight ISIS together, as an example. But I don't know Putin.
SEN. SANDERS: They cannot afford a health care--
Insurers who have made money on the exchanges, such as Centene (CNC) and Molina Healthcare (MOH), usually offer narrow provider networks and have experience with low-income patients. The companies that are doing well may see Aetna's departure as an opportunity, said Sabrina Corlette, a research professor with the Georgetown Health Policy Institute. She believes Aetna's move is part of a natural adjustment process. The exchanges are still quite new, she said, adding that there is still a lot to learn about the best ways to do business in them.
I'm not doing that to brag, he rushed to clarify. I'm doing that to say that that's the kind of thinking our country needs. We need that thinking. We have the opposite thinking. We have losers.
Even if the GOP secures enough votes in the upper chamber for the bill, its fate in the Senate, where 60 votes are required to advance the legislation to a final vote, is much more uncertain. Republicans only have 51 members and Democrats now have 49, with the new addition of Sen. Doug Jones, D-Alabama.
On the Intelligence Committee, Swalwell has also strongly defended special counsel Robert Mueller's now-concluded investigation and voiced his concerns about the Trump campaign's contacts with people affiliated with the Russian government, including the infamous Trump Tower meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and other campaign officials and a Russian lawyer who claimed to have dirt on Hillary Clinton during the summer of 2016. Issues Swalwell will look to make gun safety reform an integral part of his presidential campaign. He has been strongly critical of the National Rifle Association's (NRA) sway in Congress and has repeatedly lambasted Republicans for not supporting gun control measures. He is hosting a town hall on gun control in Florida Tuesday alongside survivors of the Stoneman Douglas High School massacre, in which 17 students and staff members were killed by a gunman. Last week, the California Democrat shared a voicemail his office received in which an individual is heard making a death threat against him because of his stance on gun rights. We're going to war. And you're going to be the first motherf***ing casualty, the person in the voicemail posted by Swalwell on Twitter is heard saying. In his post, Swalwell wrote, I'm not afraid of this guy. I'm not afraid of the NRA. I'm not afraid. No fear. #EndGunViolence.
Take me back to my own home.
ROBERT O'BRIEN: No, no. What I-- look I-- what I have heard from the FBI, you know-- well, what I've heard is that Russia would like Bernie Sanders to-- to win the Democrat nomination. They'd probably like him to be President, understandably, because he wants to-- to spend money on social programs and probably would have to take it out of the military, so that would make sense. And-- and, look, the Russians have always tried to interfere with elections because they want to divide Americans. They want to undermine our democracy. But the idea that they want to-- they want to influence the election and somehow cause the President to win, I just don't see it. But, look, I think there are a number of countries: China, Russia, North Korea, Iran, that would like to influence our elections to-- to get the candidate that they feel would be best for their country.
Instead, Braun is a businessman outsider who likes President Trump, is an effective campaigner, and has a history of voting in Democratic primaries in his blue-ish corner of Indiana. In other words, he's just about the perfect candidate to take on an incumbent Democrat like Sen. Joe Donnelly in a state Trump carried by 19 points.

Still, Comey said there may not necessarily be direct evidence, were the server to have been hacked. We do assess that hostile actors gained access to the private commercial email accounts of people with whom Secretary Clinton was in regular contact from her personal account. We also assess that Secretary Clinton's use of a personal domain was both known by a large number of people and readily apparent.
Last week, incumbent Rep. Mike Coffman (R-CO), whose primary is this Tuesday night, tweeted that Mr. Trump should fire Stephen Miller for creating this human rights mess. Coffman represents Colorado's sixth district, which Hillary Clinton won in 2016. It encompasses Aurora and the Denver suburbs and is home to an increasing number of Hispanics.
BIDEN: I have not spoken to the intelligence community, but I think the intelligence community should inform the rest of us who are running what they told Senator Sanders.

Vermont gubernatorial race features transgender woman and a 14-year-old candidate
It's also very short-sighted and even dangerous to be engaging in the kind of demagogic rhetoric that Donald has about Muslims. We need American Muslims to be part of our eyes and ears on our front lines. I've worked with a lot of different Muslim groups around America. I've met with a lot of them, and I've heard how important it is for them to feel that they are wanted and included and part of our country, part of our homeland security, and that's what I want to see.
Donald Trump: We've spent $6 trillion in the Middle East, $6 trillion, we could have rebuilt our country twice. And you look at our roads and our bridges and our tunnels and all of the-- and our airports are, like, obsolete. And I think it was just a repudiation of what's been taking place over a longer period of time than that.
Each test has forged new American heroes to remind us who we are, and show us what we can be.
MARGARET BRENNAN: So I want to also ask you though because we have what the president is calling a crisis at the border. He's threatening to shut down portions of it this week. He has given the order to cut off aid to Central American countries. Do you think this helps? Do you think this hurts? And can Congress stop this cut off in aid?
In doing so, Biden might galvanize his moderate base and bring along reluctant progressives. It's the same approach used by conservative groups for decades.
Thousands of fetid dead fish clog New Jersey marina
The president is still trying to keep another big promise -- repealing Obamacare. He's tried new policies, courting Democrats and threatening Republicans. But no combination of presidential flexibility has produced the desired result.
Meanwhile, Americans continue to have a dim view of Congress. Three in four Americans (74 percent) disapprove of the job Congress is doing, including large majorities of Republicans, Democrats, and independents.
9:59 p.m. Over the next few weeks, the House and Senate will be voting on an immigration reform package. In recent months, my Administration has met extensively with both Democrats and Republicans to craft a bipartisan approach to immigration reform. Based on these discussions, we presented the Congress with a detailed proposal that should be supported by both parties as a fair compromise -- one where nobody gets everything they want, but where our country gets the critical reforms it needs.
It's all just ahead on FACE THE NATION.
On this issue, let's rate Clinton's and Trump's positions as a tie, although it's troubling that Trump supports repealing the ACA without a specific plan to reinstate its cost-savings features.
During the 2016 presidential election, Comstock called for Mr. Trump to step aside for the good of the party following the release of the now-infamous Access Hollywood tape. Now, she faces a primary challenge from Shak Hill. Although Comstock is the clear favorite to win the primary on Tuesday, she has faced repeated attacks from Hill that she is a Never-Trumper who is not conservative enough for Virginia.
Before McDermott could finish his question, DeSantis interrupted and said Horowitz's controversial statements had been uttered before he attended the conference. The moderator corrected him, and DeSantis interjected angrily, Well how the hell am I supposed to know every single statement somebody makes?

Most important, Democrats must convince the so-called Obama coalition to go to the polls. Former President Obama's call to action, Don't boo, vote has never applied more. Remind young people their voice matters and arm them with the information to make smart choices. Remind the communities of color that often sit out off-year elections that they should be using their power to affect the outcome of these elections.
Instead of trying to turn back the clock, Clinton said to applause, they should be joining us in saying loudly and clearly no, no to discrimination once and for all.
JOHN DICKERSON: Let me ask you about this-- this question of temperament because there-- there seems to be an argument going on in the Democratic Party about how to respond to Donald Trump. First of all, he wants this to be a referendum on Donald Trump, is that okay with Democrats this election?
JOHN DICKERSON: Still having-- what's your-- what do you--
NORAH O'DONNELL: That's it for us today. Thank you all for watching. And be sure to tune in tomorrow to CBS THIS MORNING, Gayle King will be talking to South Carolina Republican Senator Tim Scott. Gayle's in Charleston ahead of our CBS News Democratic debate along with Norah O'Donnell, Major Garrett, Bill Whitaker of 60 MINUTES. And I'm heading down there myself to join them. Our debate is Tuesday at 8:00 PM eastern time. Hope you'll join us. Until next week, for FACE THE NATION, I'm Margaret Brennan.
SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: Well, look, in the same week that we saw Hurricane Michael flatten the Florida Panhandle, we had this report from the world's leading climate scientists saying climate change is hurting us today and it's only getting worse. And the same time you have a Trump administration and a lot of Republicans who just want to put their head in the sands. They don't want to hear the information and we should start by not making things worse. This administration and Republicans on-- in Congress are actually rolling back auto emission standards, rolling back clean power plant rule. So let's stop making things worse and then we definitely need to take action to make things better.
Yes, Ryan said at a joint press conference with McConnell. We're going to support whoever our nominee is. You know why? Because it's the Republican primary voter who makes that decision.
Although Donnelly has voted with the president over 50 percent of the time according to FiveThirtyEight, Donnelly has been criticized by the president for his opposition to the tax cut passed last year and the Republican-led efforts to repeal and replace Obamacare. Donnelly has also faced criticism from Braun, who launched Tuesday his Solutions Tour around the state, to support Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh. Donnelly, who was one of three Senate Democrats to vote for Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch, was the second Senate Democrat to meet with Kavanaugh.
CBS News campaign reporter Zak Hudak reports Warren also introduced a bill with Rep. Rosa DeLauro to extend the federal deadline to file labor and employment claims until after the Secretary of Health and Human Services lifts the COVID-19 public health emergency declaration.

Same with the Latino Americans, the Hispanic Americans. The same exact thing. They talk, they don't get it done. You go into the inner cities and — you see it's 45 percent poverty. African- Americans now 45 percent poverty in the inner cities. The education is a disaster. Jobs are essentially nonexistent.
The goals of Pence's speech are to hit Hillary Clinton, advocate for Republican unity and introduce himself and his bio to American voters. He's uplifting, it's going to be Mike Pence, the Mike Pence you've seen and heard--he's a conservative but not angry about it, the adviser said.
Former Vice President Joe Biden's campaign is rolling out a new digital advertisement in Iowa focused on health care, which he continues to make a signature issue of his candidacy.
Speaker Nancy Pelosi: Oh, no, they're not.
I think a very important evidence here was that this was not a bona fide counterintelligence investigation – was that they were closing the investigation in December. They started that process. And on January 4th, they were closing it.
Mitchell spoke with South Carolina voters to get a sense of how they're reacting to Bloomberg's run. North Charleston resident Martha Welsh, a retired university professor, thinks it's very presumptuous of him. I am not sure why he believes he has something to offer that the collective wisdom of the other candidates wouldn't bring.
MARGARET BRENNAN: And a- a record number--
That did not sit well with her.
President Donald Trump's re-election campaign has spent over $54 million on Facebook and Google advertisements since the 2018 midterm elections. By comparison, the Biden campaign has spent just under $19 million on the same platforms since his 2019 launch. While the president has outspent Joe Biden digitally overall, Biden has outpaced Mr. Trump specifically in Facebook spending since the end of March. According to Bully Pulpit Interactive's 2020 Campaign Tracker, Mr. Trump has spent $7 million on Facebook and Google while Biden has spent $5.3 million from March 28 to April 25, but Biden has spent $4.3 million to Trump's $4.1 million on Facebook.
Mike Bloomberg: If I annoyed somebody or hurt somebody I apologize. I can't go rewrite history. I can only tell you now it is a different world.
Lesley Stahl: I'm wondering if when you're up here if it's like medicine for you.
At 46, Barrett is the youngest of the president's top picks — an advantage for conservatives who want a Trump appointee to serve as long as possible on the land's highest court. If selected and confirmed, Barrett would be the only conservative female justice. The current female justices on the court have been nominated by Democratic presidents and are considered liberal.

CLINTON: The question was about the Supreme Court. And I just want to quickly say, I respect the Second Amendment. But I believe there should be comprehensive background checks, and we should close the gun show loophole, and close the online loophole. COOPER: Thank you.
Donald Trump: Oh, I think some of them will be professional, yeah--
It's hard to know why Germany or France or Australia would agree to something like that, said Professor Jack Hoadley of Georgetown University's Health Policy Institute.

And he reminded them of the president's call for a boycott of Ohio-based Goodyear Tires. Don't buy Goodyear Tires, the president tweeted earlier this year after he heard that the company banned apparel with political messages, including his campaign's Make America Great Again hats.
The president has said he wants a $1.7 trillion infrastructure deal — however, the details the White House has laid out so far give no proposal on how to pay for it. The senior administration official called it a trillion-dollar plan, but could not give an exact figure.
The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee is investing $9 million for voter education programs and ads across 44 districts, reports CBS News political unit broadcast associate Aaron Navarro.
Negotiators overcame two major obstacles this week to reach an agreement on the omnibus when the White House conceded that the administration doesn't need funding for the border wall yet and dropped its threat to halt Obamacare payments.
The Trump administration has already stopped enforcing the penalty for individuals not purchasing health insurance, and Mr. Trump has claimed his administration eliminated the individual mandate.
CBS News' Jan Crawford has reported that the likely candidates Mr. Trump has considered are federal appeals court Judge Neil Gorsuch, the front-runner, Pennsylvania-based Judge Thomas Hardiman and Alabama-based appeals court Judge William Pryor.
BIDEN: Well I- I assume that's part of the reason why those numbers are down. But I don't know.
6:07 p.m. As he prepares for his first State of the Union address, Mr. Trump has been silent on Twitter. As of early Tuesday evening, the president had yet to tweet anything. The day before, the only tweet that emerged from his account was a tweet congratulating the newly confirmed Health and Human Services Secretary, Alex Azar.
Donald Trump: Everything, everything down there-- there are no people-- there are all people that work -- that's the problem with the system, the system. Right now, we're going to clean it up. We're having restrictions on foreign money coming in, we're going to put on term limits, which a lot of people aren't happy about, but we're putting on term limits. We're doing a lot of things to clean up the system. But everybody that works for government, they then leave government and they become a lobbyist, essentially. I mean, the whole place is one big lobbyist.
If it's possible to be famous and yet not really well-known, that describes the father who raised me, she said. In the same office in Trump Tower where we now work together, I remember playing on the floor by my father's desk, constructing miniature buildings with Legos and erector sets, while he did the same with concrete, steel and glass.
Troy Hudson, Bishop's campaign manager, responded to the ad in a statement saying that Slotkin is lying about Bishop's record.
SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR: Well, what that means is because you have an administration and you just heard it that basically is standing while the House is burning down and instead of going in there and putting out the fire they're throwing lighter fluid on it in terms of tweets and rhetoric and things they're saying. The ruling was absurd. Justice Roberts and a conservative court has already ruled that the Affordable Care Act is constitutional unlike what Mister Miller said. And in fact you can have part of it not exist and you can still have the rest of it protect Americans. And that is exactly where this is headed and I can say that this is about first of all throwing people off of their insurance. No protection with preexisting conditions, kids staying on their parent's insurance until they're twenty-six-years-old. A very popular and important protection. Medicaid expanded for millions of Americans. That's what we're talking about here. And for them just to throw up their hands and say, well it'd be great if we just started from scratch. That's not what the American people believe. Just look at the results from the last election.
The secretary announced Tuesday that about 4.2 million Americans had signed up for an Obamacare plan by the end of February, and she and other officials said they expect millions more to sign up before open enrollment ends on March 31. No one from HHS has acknowledged they may not get 7 million enrollees in 2014, though Vice President Joe Biden has said as much.
The information on new sign-ups for health coverage comes from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. The figures are partial because they don't include sign-ups from states that run their own health insurance marketplaces. Major states like California and New York aren't counted in the federal statistics.
As insurance rules are loosened, some consumers should be able to find more affordable coverage tailored to their own particular circumstances. For example, an older married couple might not want a plan that includes maternity coverage.
Lesley Stahl: Is he still the indestructible man to you?
In Iowa, Pence met with faith leaders to encourage churches to reopen responsibly. Pence told faith leaders in Des Moines he's grateful they are thoughtfully and carefully stepping back into the exercise of beliefs on the basis of faith and not fear. The vice president also held a roundtable on securing the food supply with Hy-Vee supermarket employees.
There's an easy case to make for the argument that Trump makes it harder for Democrats to cross the aisle and support him. Attacking Dicky Durbin and Cryin' Chuck Schumer is hardly a smart strategy for getting the two highest-ranking Senate Democrats to cooperate. However, as the VoteView website notes, Donald Trump will be the third consecutive President who is widely disliked by members of the opposite Party.
The legislation is laced with provisions reflecting divided power in Washington. Republicans maintained the status quo on several abortion-related battles and on funding for Mr. Trump's border wall. Democrats controlling the House succeeded in winning a 3.1% raise for federal civilian employees and $25 million for gun violence research after more than two decades of gun lobby opposition.
On this Face the Nation broadcast moderated by Margaret Brennan:
The good news for Donnelly is that it's not clear who his Republican challenger will be. Reps. Luke Messer and Todd Rokita are both running in the GOP primary, as is well-heeled businessman Mike Braun. That primary battle promises to be an ugly one, meaning the eventual Republican nominee may be too bloodied to defeat Donnelly come November.
But if you look at Russia, just take a look at Russia, and look at what they did this week, where I agree, she wasn't there, but possibly she's consulted. We sign a peace treaty. Everyone's all excited. Well, what Russia did with Assad and, by the way, with Iran, who you made very powerful with the dumbest deal perhaps I've ever seen in the history of deal-making, the Iran deal, with the $150 billion, with the $1.7 billion in cash, which is enough to fill up this room.
Her faith came under discussion during last year's nomination hearing process when Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-California, said You have a long history of believing that your religious beliefs should prevail, and, The dogma lives loudly within you.

Is Trump's popularity in red states enough to bring voters to the polls when he's not on the ballot? As noted last week, although Republicans benefit from an overwhelmingly favorable Senate map this year, there is growing concern that they face competitive Democratic Senate candidates in several states that voted for Mr. Trump in 2016.
Somebody in this country has got to stand up and support the police officers, Loomis said. The group's attorneys, he said, are drafting a letter to Kasich now.
Scott Hoyt, an economist at Moody's Analytics, isn't ready to hit the panic button just yet. He notes that the nation's debt service ratio, which measures debt payments as a percentage of total disposable income, is at a 35-year low.
And I have to tell you, what the Border Patrol and ICE have done -- we have sent thousands and thousands and thousands of MS-13 horrible people out of this country or into our prisons.
Mike Bloomberg: That's all of the president's appointees, have that one characteristic.
Besides the border wall, negotiators overcame another major obstacle last week when the White House dropped its threat to halt Obamacare payments.
But critics are likely to say this year's Trump plan, which promises 3 percent growth, continuing low inflation, and low interest yields on U.S. Treasury bills despite a flood of new borrowing, underestimates the mounting cost of financing the government's $20 trillion-plus debt.
When asked about his donor's ties to China, Bognet's campaign deflected and pointed to the Democrat-backed House Majority PAC.
Hyde was looking to unseat Democrat Representative Jahana Hayes, and was one of four Republicans who had filed to run for the seat. In a Wednesday Twitter post, Romano called Hyde's bid a distraction for the Democrats to raise money and falsely label all Republicans with his antics. In my view he is not helping other Republican candidates or @realDonaldTrump win.
President Donald Trump: --question, Lesley? We're outside. The rallies are bigger than they've ever been. There's more enthusiasm than we've ever had. There has never been anything like what you're witnessing now, and you'll see that soon.
And in a section of her speech that seemed to challenge the anti-immigrant strains of Donald Trump (though she did not name him), Haley recalled her own story as the daughter of Indian immigrants who didn't look like our neighbors and didn't have much.
Lesley Stahl: Did you ask Melania sort of, for permission, in a way, to run for president? Did you get her approval?
Priced out of Obamacare, some opt for short-term plans
How many more Orlandos, San Bernadinos, or Fort Hoods will happen until President Obama decides to be honest? I cried with the grieving moms and dads and brothers and sisters of the 49 people slaughtered by an ISIS-inspired terrorist. This war is real. It is here in America. And the next President must destroy this evil, Scott said. Donald Trump is the man for that job.
Wisconsin won't be fully removed from the lawsuit seeking repeal of the health care law until after the state is also dropped from an appeal. Kaul's request to do that is pending. His spokeswoman Gillian Drummond declined to comment Tuesday.
During a press conference after announcing her exploratory committee, Warren pushed for more accountability in the economy and pledged to go after drug companies. The problem is Washington works great for those with influence. Warren also came out against political action committees to fund campaigns. Democrats are the party of the people -- we join together and we fund our campaigns, she told reporters. We make our campaigns work through the people. Controversy Warren's claims of Native American ancestry, which her opponents say she used unfairly to get ahead, have been the source of controversy since her first run for the Senate. In an attempt to silence critics --namely, President Trump -- ahead of a presidential bid, Warren released the results of a DNA test in 2018 that showed a tiny portion of Native American heritage, along with a campaign-like video about her family history. The move backfired, inviting criticism from tribal leaders and Native American groups. And it raised questions about how effectively Warren will be able to compete with President Trump. What Trump says The heritage controversy put Warren high on Mr. Trump's hit list. He frequently refers to her as Pocahontas, and while campaigning over the summer, he pledged to give $1 million to charity if she would take a DNA test. He later denied making the pledge once she released the results of the test but has continued to criticize Warren over the backlash to her DNA video. She did very badly in proving that she was of Indian heritage.
As President Trump kicks off his reelection campaign in Orlando Tuesday night, he's had 29 months to bring his original campaign promises to fruition.
The suit claims that because the newly enacted tax law eliminates penalties associated with the individual mandate, the ACA requirement that most Americans carry health insurance is no longer constitutional. In addition, the suit contends that consumer insurance protections under the law also aren't valid.
Heller eventually voted to repeal Obamacare under pressure from the Trump administration, even after Nevada's Republican governor expanded Medicare. About 200,000 more residents got access to health care, including 20-year-old mom, Brooklynn Bagley.
Tens of thousands of voters in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, likely received faulty supplemental instructions for filling out their mail-in ballots, according to the official in charge of elections in the county. Although the instructions printed on the ballots themselves were correct, the ones printed on a separate sheet of paper incorrectly directed voters to fill in bubbles to the left, rather than the right, of the names of candidates for whom they wish to vote. As a result, a voter following the supplemental instructions and not the correct ones would fill in bubbles for presidential or state attorney general and auditor general candidates when trying to cast their votes for delegates. Lee Soltysiak, the chief operating officer and clerk for Montgomery County, told CBS News campaign reporter Zak Hudak in a statement that the county became aware of the mistake May 14 and corrected the supplemental instructions sent with all ballots since then. Soltysiak said he did not think voters would make mistakes on their ballots because of the incorrect directions. Since the instructions are correct on the ballot itself, and many candidates do not have an oval to their left on the ballot, we do not believe this will have an impact on how people will mark their ballots or our ability to accurately count their vote, he said. The supplemental instructions also contradicted the ones on the ballots themselves with regard to what color ink voters should use to fill in the bubbles.
Similar to last month, Americans are evenly divided over whether to allow refugees from Syria into the U.S. after a screening process or whether to keep all Syrian refugees out. Two-thirds of Democrats and just over half of independents favor allowing Syrian refugees to enter with a screening process, while three in four Republicans oppose this.
Isakson indicated his plans to hit back against Mr. Trump's words on McCain on Tuesday evening.

The 7-figure buy includes TV and radio in markets in Erie, Harrisburg, Johnstown, Pittsburgh, Wilkes Barre-Scranton,as well as statewide digital targeting.
A three-judge panel of the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals blocked nationwide enforcement of the rules, holding that the federal agencies likely lacked the authority to issue them and that the administration failed to comply with federal law governing the rulemaking process.
A solution to this problem is to force everyone to buy insurance and contribute to the care they get. That's what Obamacare does.
But both learned how to better relate to the other. The president now keeps the Kentuckian close as a needed ally in accomplishing his agenda on Capitol Hill. And McConnell talks to the president almost daily as the two chat strategy, monitor campaigns and count votes.
Blankenship's attempt to run as a Trump wannabe suffered a setback when the actual Donald Trump tweeted out Don Blankenship, currently running for Senate, can't win the General Election in your State...No way! Remember Alabama. Vote Rep. Jenkins or A.G. Morrisey!
Clinton's campaign announced the subtle platform shift in a statement Saturday, saying the proposals affirm the candidate's career-long fight to achieve universal health care coverage for Americans. It is the first time she has formally endorsed a public option health care plan since entering the White House race.
In October 2016, Mr. Trump said his plan will build the 350-ship Navy we need. But that doesn't look like it's happening any time soon.
The gubernatorial election in New Hampshire also has its November matchup set, according to CBS News political unit broadcast associate Aaron Navarro. State Senator Dan Feltes won the Democratic primary and will face Republican incumbent Governor Phil Scott, who is seeking a third two-year term. In a statement, Feltes hits Sununu on opposing paid family and medical leave, as well as being someone who is actually pro-choice, not one who just says he is around election time. Sununu has consistently held high approval ratings and popularity in New Hampshire.
RADDATZ: We're going to get to that later. Secretary Clinton, you're out of time.
I take it all back, is what Ryan wishes the president would say, fantasizing that the president would recant ObamaCare and Wall Street reform.
Potentially working against Barrett is her relatively short tenure in federal court. The Notre Dame Law School graduate has only served on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit since fall 2017. Because she has served on the bench for such a short period of time, she has few opinions to dissect that could offer insight into her judicial philosophy and predict potential future positions.
But at the last minute, the White House decided to hold off.
MARGARET BRENNAN: The campaign has said it's your--
Kavanaugh has also sided with conservatives on the issue of net neutrality, dissenting when the court upheld Obama-era net neutrality regulations, regulations requiring Internet service providers to treat websites equally. Kavanaugh argued that the regulations circumvented Congress' role. The FCC repealed net neutrality in December.
On the other hand, at least one independent survey from the management consulting firm McKinsey, suggests that most Obamacare enrollees previously had insurance. In a survey conducted in February, just 27 percent of respondents who have selected a health plan for 2014 said they were previously uninsured (that could include people who have selected a plan outside of the Obamacare marketplace, McKinsey noted). In its earlier surveys, only 11 percent of respondents were previously uninsured.

SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR: Thanks, Margaret. Hello.
The agency was founded as a solution to the Obamacare website's repeat system crashes. Though President Trump has taken issue with many things his predecessor put into action, his administration has been leaning heavily on the program.
It kind of muddies the water for me because you don't know what to believe and what not to believe, said Corey Calloway, one voter.
Other people who lose their jobs may want to keep their employer coverage. A federal law known as COBRA allows that, but the employee has to pay the full premium, often a prohibitive expense. The bill would provide a temporary 100% subsidy.
HOUSTON — If Democrats are going to retake the House, districts like the Texas 7th in Harris County could play a major role. Traditionally Republican, voters here went for Hillary Clinton in 2016. Polls show nine-term Republican Rep. John Culberson is in a dead heat with Democratic challenger Lizzie Fletcher.
Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden is making his first general election campaign trip to Ohio, while President Trump's Supreme Court nominee, Judge Amy Coney Barrett, was at the Capitol for the first of four days of confirmation hearings.
In an interview with CBS News, Slotkin said that in the time period between her mother's diagnosis and her death, it didn't occur to her to run for office. But she said that seeing Bishop smiling at the Rose Garden ceremony, celebrating legislation that would have repealed the nation's health care law motivated her to run.
MARGARET BRENNAN: So, the President said yesterday he wants repeal and replace handled a little bit differently, reference to failed attempt by Republicans in the past, and that he'll sit down with Democrats if the Supreme Court upholds the ruling. So, are you predicting that you spend the next year crafting a new law from scratch?
Number two, Michelle Obama. I've gotten to see the commercials that they did on you. And I've gotten to see some of the most vicious commercials I've ever seen of Michelle Obama talking about you, Hillary.
Chief Justice Roberts, more than any other justice on the court, believes in narrow rulings that attract broad majorities, answering no more than necessary to resolve a given case, Jonathan Adler, a professor at the Case Western Reserve University School of Law, wrote on the Volokh Conspiracy legal blog.
Vowing to make health care a centerpiece of his reelection campaign, the president tweeted, The Republican Party will become The Party of Healthcare!
MARGARET BRENNAN: Are we going to have a shutdown?
In the past, we have foolishly released hundreds and hundreds of dangerous terrorists, only to meet them again on the battlefield -- including the ISIS leader, al-Baghdadi, who we captured, who we had, who we released.
President Donald Trump: I've helped her. It was our Justice Department--
Here's what you need to know about the top contenders so far:
Most Missouri voters (68 percent) say President Trump will be a factor in their vote. For Republicans it will be to support him, and for Democrats to oppose him. Mr. Trump endorsed Republican Hawley early on in the campaign. At 50 percent, the president's job approval here is higher than it is nationally. If those voters who came out for Mr. Trump in 2016 show up in 2018, it's likely to be good for Hawley.
The Democrats need to flip 23 Republican-held districts to take control of the House of Representatives this fall, and CBS News rates 4 of the House districts facing primary elections on Tuesday as very likely or probably competitive in November (ME-2, NV-3, NV-4, and VA-10).
For all his votes on the conservative side of issues, Roberts has had his critics on the right. They include Mr. Trump, who once labeled Roberts an absolute disaster for the chief justice's critical vote to uphold the Affordable Care Act in 2012. Mr. Trump has not publicly criticized Roberts since he's been president.
Bill Whitaker: President Biden said the other day that the rollout was a mess when you took office. What was the situation you inherited?
Former President Obama, shortly after taking office in 2009, set a goal of closing the prison at Guantanamo Bay. While his administration transferred many detainees out, it was unsuccessful in closing the facility, partially because Congress blocked that action.
In Virginia's 7th district, Democrats Abigail Spanberger and Dan Ward are both hoping for the chance to unseat Republican incumbent Rep. Dave Brat. Spanberger is a former CIA officer and Ward is a former Marine Corps pilot. Virginia's 5th Congressional was left open after Republican incumbent Rep.Tom Garrett withdrew in May, citing his struggles with alcoholism.
COOPER: I want to give you a minute to respond.
Pence, speaking at Worldwide Equipment Inc., says cuts in taxes and federal regulations prompted CEO Terry Dotson to give bonuses to all the company's 1,100 employees and move ahead with a new dealership in Charleston, South Carolina.
Don't boo, he told the crowd – just vote. Booing doesn't help anyone. Voting helps.
SEN. KLOBUCHAR: As part of comprehensive immigration reform, we must move forward on making sure that people have health care. California just did that with Medicaid, and I am supportive of that but I think on the national basis, as we go forward, get immediate health care for people, yes. But as part of making this actually happen, you need comprehensive immigration reform. And one thing that was missing from the NBC debate, actually, that I hope we can discuss, is that we have a humanitarian crisis at the border right now. But we also did not talk about the other immigrants that are here. The people who are here on temporary legal status, we've got hundreds of thousands of people that are legally here that are at risk or are being deported that work in our nursing homes and our hospitals. We have got dreamers, two million of them, that came to this country through no fault of their own and are a major part of our economy. So, we need to have an economic discussion about this, as well as a border discussion--
The warning came with the stark acknowledgement that he failed to deliver on one of the core tenets of his 2008 presidential campaign: to be a leader who can finally move beyond the divisive politics of Washington.
Republicans are gathering in West Virginia this week for a GOP retreat. On the way to the retreat site, the Amtrak train many members were riding hit a truck. No members of Congress were seriously injured, but the driver of the truck was killed.
5:48 p.m. ET A GOP delegate who has called for Hillary Clinton to be shot for treason is being investigated by the Secret Service for his threat, multiple news outlets are reporting Wednesday evening.
In a news conference earlier this year, Mr. Trump admitted he won't prioritize the national debt until the military is rebuilt, essentially pushing off his promise indefinitely.
Melania Trump: Sometimes he listens, sometimes he doesn't--
But for Barrett, 48, there will be no slow transition from her seat on the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to the nation's highest court, as pending before the justices as she joins them are a slew of disputes involving politically charged — and time-sensitive — issues.
Scientists — including those working for Mr. Trump's administration — have repeatedly rebuffed him for suggesting extreme cold weather disapproves the assessment by the scientific community that the planet's changing climate is causing irreparable environmental damage.
Scott Pelley: Do you think America's ready for a Jewish president?
Donald Trump: And they gave me a lot of credit. Don't forget, I was abused four or five weeks ago, they said I was going to-- instead of having all three, we would lose all three. So that was good. But those are the three things that we really discussed.
And yet that's exactly what they were accused of.
Here are five Senate seats worth watching as the midterm election campaigns get underway.
MARGARET BRENNAN: And the governor has not responded, I assume, to your requests?
Donald Trump: And get the country straightened away.
ROBERT O'BRIEN: I think if there's intelligence that we can declassify that-- that we can get out there all the better, because, again, we weren't in office in 2016 when-- when the last election meddling took place and the administration did very little about it. And-- and they-- you know everyone admits that-- that very little was done about it. We're in office now and we're doing everything we can across the interagency and-- with our state and federal and local partners to-- to ensure that-- that American ballots are secure, that-- that are our-- our ballot machines are secure, that tabulations are secure, that-- that state, secretary of state websites are secure. We want to make sure that this is a free and fair election, that Americans select their next President, not some foreign country. And-- and we're going to do-- and the President's been deadly serious about that.
RADDATZ: But what would you do differently than President Obama is doing?
If Handel loses, the chatter about a negative Trump effect will likely rise to a fever pitch. Republican hand-wringing about how Trump's controversies and negative ratings will affect them in future elections will be in full force. Why? Again, it's mainly because this is a Republican district that has been held by Republicans for decades -- even though Trump barely squeaked by Clinton with a mere 1.5 percent margin in November.
RADDATZ: Secretary Clinton, we are moving to an audience question. We're almost out of time. We have another... TRUMP: We have the slowest growth since 1929.
Brought by a group of red states, with the backing of the Trump administration, the case, California v. Texas, questions the constitutionality of Obamacare's individual mandate. The justices were also asked to decide whether the health care law can stand on its own if the individual mandate is deemed unconstitutional.
The fact that Joe Biden even has a healthcare proposal is proof that Obamacare was a colossal failure from the beginning. Premiums went through the roof, choices dwindled, and people suffered under the twin lies that they could keep their doctors and their existing healthcare plans, said Tim Murtaugh, Trump 2020 communications director. Biden's new proposal would lead to a government takeover of the entire healthcare system and would end with the elimination of employer-provided health insurance for 180 million Americans.
SENATOR MARCO RUBIO: Well, I would phrase-- yeah, I would have phrased that differently. It's not about the money. There are plenty other countries that would want to buy arms from the U.S. and, frankly that, I would have phrased it very differently. The important thing is that when you sell arms to a country. So it's true what he said that they can buy from China, Russia or anybody else. When you sell arms to Saudi Arabia, it gives you leverage over them because they need replacement parts. They need the training. So it's-- it's the kind that, you know, you can't sanction a country by cutting them off of something if you never provided it in the first place.
There will not be a change with anyone who is with a very large employer, said James Gelfand of the ERISA Industry Committee, as the group is known. ERISA is the name of a federal law that governs employee benefits for big companies.
TRUMP: Well, you owe the president an apology, because as you know very well, your campaign, Sidney Blumenthal — he's another real winner that you have — and he's the one that got this started, along with your campaign manager, and they were on television just two weeks ago, she was, saying exactly that. So you really owe him an apology. You're the one that sent the pictures around your campaign, sent the pictures around with President Obama in a certain garb. That was long before I was ever involved, so you actually owe an apology.
JOE BIDEN: We'll see. I mean, look, you guys love this stuff. I'm not into this. Let's just see what happens.
Remote Canadian tribe declares emergency over suicides
You will see that Russian sanctions will be coming down. Secretary Mnuchin will be announcing those on Monday if he hasn't already and they will go directly to any sort of companies that were dealing with equipment related to Assad and chemical weapons use. And so I think everyone is going to feel it at this point. We wanted their friends Iran and Russia to know that we meant business and that they were going to be feeling the pain from this as well.
Lost insurance? The share of Americans without coverage reached a historic low of 9 percent last year, according to the government's National Health Interview Survey. More than 16 million people gained coverage since 2013, just before the law's big coverage expansion got underway.
When asked what could be done to correct problems with Obamacare, Emanuel three very simple things were needed:
The report is an aspirational document like the rest of Ryan's Better Way agenda, a six-topic blueprint that the speaker has been rolling out this month at carefully choreographed events that have been getting largely overshadowed by the latest Donald Trump campaign controversy. Ryan was to present his health care proposals alongside several House committee chairmen Wednesday afternoon at the American Enterprise Institute, and a tax plan was coming Friday.
Here tonight is Preston Sharp, a 12-year-old boy from Redding, California, who noticed that veterans' graves were not marked with flags on Veterans Day. He decided all by himself to change that, and started a movement that has now placed 40,000 flags at the graves of our great heroes. Preston, a job well done.
President Trump signed another executive order at the White House this morning, this one reportedly to address regulations.
Mr. Trump said he gave him the kind of funeral that he wanted, but I didn't get a thank you. The president was not invited to McCain's funeral in September.
CBSN Originals recently returned to Erie, Pennsylvania to reconnect with locals who hoped a fresh approach in Washington would bring about change in their struggling home town. Airing on May 21 at 8 p.m. EST, America | Redefining Hope looks at how that hope has evolved.
DeSantis replied, Businesses will leave the state, people will lose jobs and we'll stop people from investing in Florida. It will be a historic mistake.
It's also important I intend to defeat ISIS, to do so in a coalition with majority Muslim nations. Right now, a lot of those nations are hearing what Donald says and wondering, why should we cooperate with the Americans? And this is a gift to ISIS and the terrorists, violent jihadist terrorists.
MARGARET BRENNAN: When he says the ugly stuff, may be because of the Russians. Sounds like you're saying no.
But Obama economic adviser Larry Summers has thrown cold water on this methodology, arguing that firms are raising wages because the labor market is tight. He called it a gimmick in an interview a few days ago on CNBC's Squawk Alley.
So while Republicans shout about the #SchumerShutdown and Democrats taunt the GOP with #TrumpShutdown, to many Americans it looks like the same old story: In a city where partisanship is more important than leadership, Democrats and Republicans can't make Washington work.
We didn't turn against each other's race or religion. We turned toward God, and to the values that have long made our country the freest and greatest in the world, she said. She also noted that the South Carolina legislature opted to remove the Confederate flag from the statehouse after the shooter, Dylan Roof, appeared in photographs with it.
Gillum admitted he had taken the ticket, but said he received it from his brother and thought his brother swapped them for concert tickets.
COOPER: Thank you, Mr. Trump. The question from Patrice was about are you both modeling positive and appropriate behavior for today's youth? We received a lot of questions online, Mr. Trump, about the tape that was released on Friday, as you can imagine. You called what you said locker room banter. You described kissing women without consent, grabbing their genitals. That is sexual assault. You bragged that you have sexually assaulted women. Do you understand that?
GOVERNOR NED LAMONT: Well, I can tell you they gave us-- the previous administration gave us fifty thousand additional doses because we are doing a good job of getting people vaccinated on a timely basis. But I think what's most important right now for the Biden administration is give us some transparency, let us know what we can expect next week, what we can expect next month so we know how much to expand our infrastructure. But we're ready to get people vaccinated. You just get us the vaccines.
Republicans have two strong candidates in Rep. Evan Jenkins and state Attorney General Patrick Morrissey. They also hope to damage Manchin by bringing up his close ties to Mylan, the pharmaceutical company that was criticized for dramatically raising the price of EpiPens. Mylan's CEO, Heather Bresch, is Manchin's daughter.
The Trump administration's stance is a rare departure from the Justice Department's practice of defending federal laws in court.
McCain hoped to win the presidency by attracting independent swing voters. To do that, he toyed with making independent Democrat Joe Lieberman his running mate. Advisers talked him out of it. Instead, they recommended little-known Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin. Her gaffe-prone campaign ended whatever chance he had to win independents. Add on to that a bad economy and he lost in a landslide.
WASHINGTON -- Republican presidential contenders let fly with some inaccuracies when they badmouthed the Obama administration on health care, military readiness and pay for construction workers in their latest debate.
Is Congress a mess? Of course it is. It's Congress. That's not Trump's fault. And Americans will be free to put a new group of people in charge of that mess this November, right on schedule.
If an insurer incurs claims in excess of the aggregate premium payments, it needs to raise premiums for the current insured population. This could cause some people to drop coverage, which in turn might cause yet another premium increase as healthy people drop out of the insured pool. In the insurance business, this is called a death spiral.
I know that when people tell him it can't be done, that guarantees he's going to get it done. I know that when someone tells him that something is impossible that's what triggers him into action, he said. Rather than give up he changed the entire skyline of New York. I've seen it time and time again... That look in his eyes when someone says it can't be done.
Sanders and his campaign in the past month have regularly criticized Biden's long Senate record including his vote in favor of the Iraq War and his openness in the 1990s to negotiate cuts to Social Security to balance the federal budget.
Just as Donald Trump faces his own potential conflicts of interest, Price also underwent intense scrutiny over his own stock trades and investments involving health care companies over the last four years.
Get to know the term pre-deductible
In his exit memo from the agency, Castro said that HUD had stabilized the housing market and preserved affordable housing through public-private partnerships. Under the Obama administration, he wrote, HUD invested $18 billion in communities recovering from natural disasters and initiated a $1 billion competition for resilient housing and infrastructure projects. Views on LGBT issues and abortion rights He supports LGBT rights and was the first San Antonio mayor to serve as the grand marshal of the city's Pride Parade in 2009 and joined mayors across the country in signing the Mayors for the Freedom to Marry petition for same-sex marriage equality in 2012. Castro is also a supporter of the rights of women to have an abortion. He spoke at the annual luncheon for Planned Parenthood South Texas in May. Controversy In 2016, the Office of the Special Counsel, an independent federal investigative body, found that Castro had violated the Hatch Act by commenting on the 2016 presidential campaign during an interview about local issues. Castro apologized and ordered his team improve training on the Hatch Act in his department. What Trump says Castro has not yet been a target for President Trump. Unlike some of the other potential presidential candidates, Mr. Trump has never personally disparaged Castro on Twitter. Issues In his video announcing his exploratory committee in December, Castro said he is focused on affordable college, care for seniors, universal health care and welcoming immigrants.
McCain's comments came just days after The New York Times reported Mr. Trump talked about about her father, Sen. John McCain, during an off-the-record meeting with television anchors before the president's State of the Union address. Mr. Trump reportedly said of John McCain, By the way, he wrote a book and the book bombed.
CLINTON: I didn't in the first debate, and I'm going to try not to in this debate, because I'd like to get to the questions that the people have brought here tonight to talk to us about.
CLINTON: But the price of coal is down worldwide. So we have to look at this comprehensively.
Even as economy brightens, one worrying signal mars the view
SENATOR BEN SASSE: Yeah, so, I-- I think most of this is going to be about recognizing that when you're thirty-five and forty and forty-five and fifty, you are going to get disintermediated out of not just your job, but probably your firm in your industry. We've never prepared to become a people that are lifelong learners. That has huge policy implications. I don't think politics are the main thing. I don't think they are the first thing, but, obviously, rethinking job retraining for the age of disruption. McKinsey, a company that I used to work for, says that fifty percent of Americans are going to be primarily freelancers in three years. We're not at all prepared for that.
You saw the sort of left-leaning feminist women who were entering the workforce, you know, those working girls with their shoulder pads, Leader said. And you saw huge numbers of women on the conservative end of the scale also come out.
MARGARET BRENNAN: That's it for us today. Thank you for watching. We'll see you next Sunday morning just before CBS Sports Super Bowl LV coverage. We'll be previewing the game and the challenges the NFL has faced in our broadcast next week. For FACE THE NATION, I'm Margaret Brennan.
JANICE JACKSON: Yeah, so in Chicago and in Illinois, we are prioritizing teachers. They are included in 1b, which is currently underway. I think the issue is definitely around vaccine supply. The more vaccines we're able to get, we'll be able to vaccinate people sooner. We have started vaccinating individuals in our school system, which is important to note. We started with our health care workers and those individuals who work closely with students where they may be at more risk for exposure. But, again, in order to accelerate vaccination of our teachers, we, quite frankly, need more supply.
Today I will lay out my vision for a health care system that puts patients first, families first and perhaps most importantly for all of us, America first, the president said in North Carolina. Under the America First health care plan, we will ensure the highest standard of care anywhere in the world, cutting-edge treatment, state-of-the art medicine, groundbreaking cures and true health security for you and your loved ones. And we will do it rapidly and it's in very good order and some of it has already been implemented.
COOPER: You've said you want to end Obamacare. You've also said you want to make coverage accessible for people with pre-existing conditions. How do you force insurance companies to do that if you're no longer mandating that every American get insurance?
Lesley Stahl: And you've got both Houses?
Joe Biden waited 37 days to directly address the allegation of sexual assault lodged against him from a former Senate staffer, CBS News campaign reporter Bo Erickson and CBSNews.com political reporter Grace Segers report. Tara Reade said on a podcast in March that in 1993, Biden penetrated her with his hand while in the U.S. Capitol complex, when she was a staff assistant in his Senate office.
Although she began her career opposing LGBTQ rights, she is now a supporter of LGBTQ issues and has apologized for her previous views. Controversy Gabbard's father was an anti-gay activist whose views influenced his daughter during her early political career. When she ran for the Hawaii state legislature in 2002, Gabbard boasted about supporting her father in his effort to promote the constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage passed in 1998. After her election, she continued to espouse anti-gay views. In 2004, she opposed a bill legalizing civil unions. To try to act as if there is a difference between 'civil unions' and same-sex marriage is dishonest, cowardly and extremely disrespectful to the people of Hawaii, Gabbard said at the time, according to CNN's KFile. As Democrats we should be representing the views of the people, not a small number of homosexual extremists. Gabbard apologized to LGBTQ activists in the state when running for Congress in 2012. She apologized again after launching her presidential campaign. Gabbard has invited controversy for her iconoclastic views on foreign policy. In January 2017, she visited Syria and met with Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad. A few months later, the U.S. bombed the Syrian airfield thought to be the origin of a government-ordered deadly chemical attack. Gabbard called the U.S. bombing reckless and questioned whether Assad was behind the attack, garnering criticism from other Democratic politicians.
I want to have a tax on people who are making a million dollars. It's called the Buffett rule. Yes, Warren Buffett is the one who's gone out and said somebody like him should not be paying a lower tax rate than his secretary. I want to have a surcharge on incomes above $5 million.
Lesley Stahl: Do you think that your tweets and your name-calling are turning people off?
It all comes down to having the polling places open, where is that money going to come from? Tamika Palmer, mother of Breonna Taylor, added, It is important that people vote and that they're given this opportunity. Taylor was a 26-year-old medical worker killed in March during a police encounter at her Louisville home. The open letter sent to Senate leaders Thursday urges passage of the HEROES Act, which includes $3.6 billion in election funding.
MILLER: --wants to. If the Democrat Party wants to go down the road of continuing to preserve a model that enriches smuggling organizations, that spreads misery on both sides of the border, that kills 300 Americans a week through heroin overdoses alone. By the way, illegal heroin costs our country two hundred and thirty billion dollars--
He also does not live in the district, a fact seized upon by Republicans, including President Trump, who tweeted about it on the day before the election.
Woman in her 70s may be oldest ever to give birth
The last thing we can show is panic or excitement or fear or anything else, President Trump responded Wednesday, when probed about his administration's pandemic response. We had to take care of the situation we were given.
President-elect Donald Trump and future first lady Melania Trump CBS News
JOHN DICKERSON: Yes. Susan Page, what Jonah says is-- is amazing when you think about where Nikki Haley once was in 2016 giving a Republican response to the Democratic President, she talked about angry voices within the Republican Party, which nobody mistook for anything, but a shot at Donald Trump. Yet, then she goes into the cabinet and now is-- goes into the administration is now leaving, managed pretty nicely. Does this-- give me your thoughts on that and then also-- well, just give me your thoughts on that.
On Thursday, the White House rolled out a bare-bones legislative framework on immigration. The must-have list includes $25 billion for a trust fund for a border wall and other border security measures, a path to citizenship for 1.8 million Dreamers, an end to what the White House calls chain migration, and an end to the diversity visa lottery system.
Three people close to the transition team said Trump had been aware that Conway planned to voice her opinion, both on Twitter and in television interviews. They disputed reports that Trump was furious at her and suggested his decision to consider additional candidates instead highlighted her influence.

I think the notion refundable is going to prove to be a bridge too far for a lot of conservatives because it entails fundamentally a new entitlement, South Carolina Rep. Mark Sanford said.
It was out of ignorance, out of indifference, out of the feelings that the history of this very small island was not important. These aspects one had to learn, and writing took me there. One didn't begin with knowledge. One wrote oneself into knowledge.
TRUMP: No, there wasn't check out a sex tape. It was just take a look at the person that she built up to be this wonderful Girl Scout who was no Girl Scout.
Does he have his arms around the gravity of what happened in 2016 and 2017?
The allegation expanded on her previous claims a year ago that Biden had harassed her 27 years ago. In a television interview on MSNBC's Morning Joe, Biden was asked directly whether he had sexually assaulted Reade in 1993. No, it is not true, he said. I'm saying unequivocally, it never, never happened.
Lesley Stahl: You-- you know, you--
Let me tell you, if she's president of the United States, nothing's going to happen. It's just going to be talk. And all of her friends, the taxes we were talking about, and I would just get it by osmosis. She's not doing any me favors. But by doing all the others' favors, she's doing me favors.
Kamala Harris Sen. Kamala Harris kicks off 2020 run 05:19 Biography Harris was born in Oakland in 1964 and raised in a multicultural household. Her mother, Shyamala Gopalan Harris, was a scientist from India and her father, Donald Harris, an economics professor at Stanford University, was born in Jamaica. Harris went to high school in Canada, where her mother worked as a hospital researcher and college professor. She returned to the U.S. to go to college at Howard University, a historically black university in Washington, D.C. and then went on to attend law school at the University of California, Hastings. Upon graduation, Harris stayed in the Golden State and worked for the Alameda County district attorney's office in Oakland. In 2003, she was elected San Francisco district attorney, a position that had never been held by a woman or person of color. During her 10-year tenure as the city's chief law enforcement officer, Harris spearheaded efforts to curb high recidivism rates among released prisoners and created a nationally recognized reentry program for nonviolent, first-time drug offenders. After winning a hotly contested race in 2010, Harris became California's first female attorney general, as well as the first Indian-American and Jamaican-American to hold the post. During her two terms, Harris' office implemented implicit bias training among officers and defended several state lawyers dogged by accusations of prosecutorial misconduct. After Sen. Barbara Boxer announced her retirement, Harris launched a bid for her seat.
Shortly afterwards, dozens of countries voted in the United Nations General Assembly against America's sovereign right to make this decision. In 2016, American taxpayers generously sent those same countries more than $20 billion in aid.
Trump, who's running as a Republican, touched some traditionally conservative themes. He called Obamacare the big lie, and vowed to replace it with something better and cheaper. He argued the greatest social program is a job, vowing to be the greatest jobs president that God ever created. He promised to build a great, great wall on our southern border, and I would make Mexico pay for that wall. He pledged to fully support and back up the Second Amendment and to end Common Core.
President Donald Trump: Lesley, we hand out thousands of masks at every rally.
Once we get the president sworn in now, next week we'll open up Congress but we'll go away on a retreat to work on it, he said. McCarthy added that the president would also attend the retreat.
The president said that he had tasked Republican Sens. John Barrasso, Bill Cassidy, Rick Scott and others to take a look and form a really great plan.
In December of 1999, Trump sat down with then-CBS News correspondent Dan Rather for an interview that would air in January on 60 Minutes II and discussed his then-girlfriend.
In November, she said in a tweet that President Trump is Saudi Arabia's bitch for announcing the U.S. will stand with Saudi Arabia, regardless of any intelligence community assessment on Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's involvement in the killing of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi. What Trump says Mr. Trump has not publicly criticized Gabbard. The two met briefly shortly after Mr. Trump was elected.
Obamacare set America on a path that leads to a larger government having a greater role in how health care decisions are made. Today we are proposing a new approach, the report's authors wrote. This report is the beginning of the conversation, not the end.
MARGARET BRENNAN: I- I'm sure people will like things cheaper. They always do. In terms of what they'll actually be able to get though, can you say that the Republican alternative will do things like guarantee access to maternity care or care for newborn children? Mental health? Some of the things that are guaranteed in Obamacare.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Was one ever discussed?
Meanwhile in Wisconsin, former 2016 presidential candidate and Trump opponent Republican Gov. Scott Walker is seeking reelection to a third term in a state that Trump won by 1 point in 2016. Walker, like many others in the GOP, is walking the fine line between embracing the president and his policies and trying to hold onto more moderate voters.
On the Republican side, former Minnesota Governor Tim Pawlenty and Jeff Johnson are competing to progress to the general election. Johnson is a former member of the Minnesota House and Hennepin County Commissioner. He has previously run for governor and attorney general.
President Donald Trump: You've discredited yourself.
Even if we get the hardware and software working exactly the way it's supposed to, with relatively minor glitches, what we're also discovering is that, you know, insurance is complicated to buy, he said. And another mistake that we made, I think, was underestimating the difficulties of people purchasing insurance online and shopping for a lot of options, with a lot of costs and a lot of different benefits and plans, and somehow expecting that that would be very smooth, and then they've also got to try to apply for tax credits on the website.
CBS News associate producer Eleanor Watson notes that Republican senators Susan Collins, Mitt Romney, and Lisa Murkowski have indicated they would like a chance to vote on hearing from witnesses after hearing the arguments. They have not committed to voting for witnesses, but would like the option to once they hear the arguments.
Democrats should be pounding home the message that they're the ones who will protect health care coverage for Americans and pushing back on disingenuous claims by Republicans that they'll protect people with pre-existing conditions. The latest CBS News polling illustrates this point. In Florida, Arizona, and Indiana, where the U.S. Senate races remain hotly contested, voters say health care tops their concerns, and protections for pre-existing conditions are a specific factor in determining which party they'll support. Voters want to know they're not one illness away from bankruptcy.
In Wyoming, incumbent Republican Rep. Liz Cheney, who is the daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney, is running for re-election and faces a primary challenge from former cowboy Rod Miller.
Unfortunately, we are just not in a position to confirm any of the numbers that are coming out of China, O'Brien said, after acknowledging the relationship between Xi and Mr. Trump. There's no way to confirm any of those numbers. There's lots of public reporting on whether the numbers are too low. You've got access to those reports that are coming out of the Chinese social media and some of the few reporters that are left in China. We just have no way to confirm any of those numbers.
JOHN DICKERSON: Although the President is-- was visited yesterday by pastor Andrew Brunson who was released from Turkey based on pressure the-- the President had put. And so the President's supporters are rightly pointing out that were it not for the President he'd still be in jail.
In addition, the Trump administration recently approved Walker's plan to lower Obamacare premiums in Wisconsin, even though the president has yet to endorse Walker's gubernatorial bid. A recent NBC News/Marist College poll from July shows Wisconsin schools Superintendent Tony Evers, the Democratic frontrunner, leading Walker by 13 points in a head-to-head match-up. But Walker is the only governor to survive a recall election, and he also enjoys the support of the Koch brothers, who recently expressed dismay with Mr. Trump. This race is sure to be competitive as Walker tries to appeal to two different bases - Trump supporters and moderates.
Judge Brett Kavanaugh at an AEI event C-SPAN screengrab
Americans were shocked during the 2016 campaign when Republican candidate Donald Trump attacked him, saying McCain was a war hero because he was captured. I like people that weren't captured.
CLINTON: ... get to do pretty much whatever they want, including saying, look, I'm sorry, you've got diabetes, you had cancer, your child has asthma...
Chelsea Manning, the 30-year-old transgender woman and former Army intelligence analyst whose sentence for leaking classified military and diplomatic documents to WikiLeaks was was commuted by President Obama in 2017, is r unning in Maryland's Democratic Senate primary against incumbent Sen. Ben Cardin (D-Maryland).
You ask a lot of questions about the social issues, he accused a reporter who asked if he would speak out on those issues during a general election race. I'm going to talk about the things that I think are important to this country. I've done so throughout the course of this campaign, and I'll continue to do so.
Trump highlights the GOP tax overhaul that he signed into law in December
It is true that drugs are coming in through the southern border, though. Politifact says that even though Asia is the source of heroin for most of the rest of the world, nearly all the heroin available in the United States comes from Mexico and South America.
No. They were aware, because of the schedule, that the Department would be saying something in court. And I said that we'd make up our mind what to do and file, you know, sometime before Monday. File our responses to what was going on in court. But other than that, no.
TRUMP: She said a lot of things that were false. I mean, I think we should be allowed to maybe...
Trump warns that North Korea could very soon threaten our homeland
Donald Trump: Well, he didn't ask me, no, he told me-- you know, the merits and the difficulties. And we understand that.
MCGAHN: Well, the court ought to be above the political fray. That's the point of the court. We have three coequal branches and the court is supposed to be removed from it. It's done in a variety of ways. One is life tenure. Two is the confirmation process itself. And the president can't simply pick. It has to do with the advice and consent of the Senate. But I think if you look at the judges President Trump's put on the bench, it's going to go down in history as a- as a monumental achievement of his presidency. He has put a number of- of judges on who are mentally qualified, went to top schools, did well in the schools. They went to the clerk at the Supreme Court themselves, they're circuit judges, had a stellar careers--
We need a nominee who can help Democrats up and down the ticket, Biden argued. But if Senator Sanders is the nominee for the party, every Democrat in America…will have to carry the label Senator Sanders has chose for himself…he calls himself a democratic socialist.
In Maine, the poll shows Democrat Sara Gideon leads Collins 54 to 42% among likely voters, and 89% of likely voters say their minds are made up. Of likely voters in Maine, 21% say the economy is the most important issue in deciding who to vote for in the Senate race. That was followed by health care at 15%, law and order at 14% and the coronavirus at 13%.
WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump is proposing a $4 trillion-plus budget for next year that projects a $1 trillion or so federal deficit and — unlike the plan he released last year — never comes close to promising a balanced federal ledger even after 10 years. And that's before last week's $300 billion budget pact is added this year and next, showering both the Pentagon and domestic agencies with big increases.
What seems to work best for doing business in the exchanges is a strategy of offering smaller networks of providers, including primary care physicians and specialists, to keep costs low. While this often results in lower premiums, it can also mean consumers have trouble finding their doctors in a plan's network, or they may not have access to the specialists they need. This is especially true in areas where only one or two insurers are participating in an exchange, said Corlette.
These are very smart people who were working in the special counsel's office, and in senior levels of the FBI. So what drove them here?
The Trump campaign responded to Biden's Ohio trip with mockery. Campaign manager Bill Stepien made fun of the former vice president Monday, claiming he had traveled to Ohio to speak to a handful of people.
The president said the problems with the website weren't the only unanticipated problems.
We'll be on 24-hour call if we're back in our districts, to come back and vote on whatever the next level of support is. But we've been there all along, important to remember it was Mitch McConnell who was calling for this pause 120+ days ago, Bustos said.
Biden told reporters later they absolutely can win Minnesota this November, but added, We are not taking any vote for granted.
Lesley Stahl: You seem to be one of the very, very few people who have stood up to him and won.
When it was Pence's turn to speak, he hit back, saying Obamacare was a disaster that he and Mr. Trump have a plan to improve health care. Senator Harris, you're entitled to your own opinion but you're not entitled to your own facts, Pence said.
Warren was re-elected in 2018, and announced an exploratory committee for a presidential run Dec. 31. Warren and her second husband, Bruce Mann, have been married for 38 years and have three grandchildren. They live in Cambridge, Massachusetts with their golden retriever, Bailey, who came to her first press conference as a presidential contender. Key issues Warren has built a national brand as an economic populist and an anti-Wall Street crusader. The 69-year-old senator serves on the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee and the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee in the Senate, and has also taken on her own party on issues she cares about. In one instance, she helped to derail then-President Obama's nomination of investment banker Antonio Weiss to a top position at the Treasury Department in 2015. Fixing a rigged economy figures to be central issue of her presidential campaign. I've spent my career getting to the bottom of why America's promise works for some families, but others who work just as hard slip through the cracks into disaster, Warren said in a video announcing her presidential exploratory committee. What I found is terrifying. These aren't cracks that families are falling into. They're traps. America's middle class is under attack. How do we get here? Billionaires and big corporations decided they wanted more of the pie and they enlisted politicians to cut them a fatter slice.
In its last term, the Supreme Court declined to invalidate entire statutes despite striking down one provision, with decisions crossing ideological lines. In one case involving robocalls to cell phones, the high court invalidated a government-debt exception allowing robocalls made to collect a debt owed to the government, but left the rest of the robocall restriction in place. In another involving the structure of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the court ruled 7-2 a measure dictating the removal of the bureau's director can be struck down without invalidating the entirety of the law that created the consumer agency.
We need only look at the depraved character of the North Korean regime to understand the nature of the nuclear threat it could pose to America and to our allies.

During a daylong visit to the White House by the cast of the Broadway hit Hamilton, its star and writer-composer, Lin-Manuel Miranda, joined the president in the Rose Garden for some freestyling.
Are Democrats reading too much into Conor Lamb's upset victory in last week's special election? That's certainly the GOP spin.
Workers could face the prospect of insurance that doesn't cover their pre-existing conditions when they enroll in a plan with a new employer, said Larry Levitt of the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation.
While he didn't mention his proposed ban to block Muslims from entering the U.S., Trump said that the U.S. must immediately suspend immigration from any nation that has been compromised by terrorism until such time as proven vetting mechanisms have been put in place.
We won't let them do it, he said.
Some parts of the plan were previously proposed in the president's budget proposal sent to Congress, including providing free generic drugs to low-income seniors and sharing rebates from drugmakers with Medicare patients. Other parts could be implemented directly by the administration.
The upbeat mood ahead of the key vote comes after weeks of trying to revive their original version of the bill, which failed to win enough support in March and had to be pulled from the floor. Republicans, however, have since made several revisions to the measure -- with the latest one made on Tuesday after skeptical members met with President Trump at the White House. Rep. Fred Upton, R-Michigan, proposed an amendment to the bill that would add $8 billion over five years to cover insurance for people with pre-existing conditions. The addition appeared to sway members who previously opposed the bill, as well as those who were undecided.
For the rest of his speech, Gingrich, who ran for president in 2012 and who was vetted as a possible running mate for Trump, focused on national security. He listed all of the terror attacks around the world in the last 37 days and said that only Trump would provide the leadership necessary for strong U.S. national security.
Scott Pelley: You told everybody who would listen that you're not running for president.
President Donald Trump: I don't mind it. I don't mind it. But when I watch him walk out of a store, and he's walking with an ice cream. And the question the media asks him, What kind of ice cream? What flavor ice cream do you have? And he's in the midst of a scandal.
Donald Trump has indicated he could be on his way to one of the most surprising policy shifts of his presidential campaign. He suggested, after days of confusion over his mass-deportation intentions, that he might be open to letting at least some undocumented immigrants in the U.S. remain in the country.
A House vote is slated for Tuesday on the sprawling package, some 2,313 pages long, as lawmakers wrap up reams of unfinished work — and vote on impeaching President Trump.
Secretary Azar's and Administrator Verma's top priority is to advance the president's health care agenda through lowering drug costs, advancing competition in the marketplace, and ensuring Americans have access to high quality, affordable healthcare, an HHS spokesperson said in a statement to CBS News.
The View co-host Meghan McCain said Thursday that she hoped her pointed words during her father's funeral directed at President Trump made attendees Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump uncomfortable. On The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, McCain said, I really want it made very clear that the Trumps had beef with me then and in the words of Cardi B, they're going to have beef with me forever, and I'm not going to forget.
At our family's company, there are more female than male executives, she said. Women are paid equally for the work that we do and, when a woman becomes a mother, she is supported, not shut out. -- CBS News' Emily Schultheis.
Biden headed into the final 20 days of the election with a more than $107 million cash advantage over Mr. Trump, reports CBS News political unit associate producer Sarah Ewall-Wice. According to the latest Federal Election Commission filings of fundraising through October 14, Biden, the Democratic National Committee and their joint fundraising committees had more than $331 million cash on hand. Mr. Trump, the Republican National Committee and their joint fundraising committees had more than $223.5 million cash on hand heading into October 15. Looking at the Biden campaign committee, it brought in $130 million in 14 days, including $70 million in direct contributions and nearly $60 million transferred from other committees. That's three times what the Trump campaign committee brought in with its $43 million, though it did not transfer funds. The president's campaign now also has more than $1.2 million in debt. With his massive cash advantage, Biden's campaign has also spent much more than Trump's campaign over 14 days. It had about $143 million in operating expenditures. Meanwhile, Mr. Trump's campaign committee spent $63 million. The president's joint fundraising committee also spent around $34 million, not including money transferred to other accounts, while the Biden joint fundraising committees spent just over $29 million on operating expenses. Operating expenses for the DNC over two weeks was $45.4 million while the RNC expenditures were $21.8 million.
Issues Klobuchar is a very active senator who is often willing to work on a bipartisan basis. As of December, Klobuchar has sponsored 111 pieces of legislation which have been signed into law. However, Klobuchar is also ideologically liberal on several issues. As a member of the Senate in 2009, Klobuchar voted to pass the Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare. She is pro-choice and supports LGBT rights. She also has an F rating from the National Rifle Association. Klobuchar is a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and made a name for herself in 2018 for her calm yet incisive questioning of then-Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh during the hearings investigating claims of sexual misconduct against Kavanaugh in September. At one point, when asking if Kavanaugh had ever blacked out from drinking, he retorted: Have you? The moment quickly went viral, and Kavanaugh later apologized. Controversy Klobuchar was the sole senator from Minnesota during the resolution of the contested Senate election from January to July 2009, which Al Franken eventually won. When Franken was accused of sexual harassment in December 2017, Klobuchar did not call for Franken to step down, unlike many other senators. Franken resigned shortly after the allegations came to light.
John McCain: Oh, I got very choked up. And then, of course, you know, all of 'em coming over and giving me a hug. It was deeply moving. I had never seen anything like that.
MARGARET BRENNAN: But you could make that a separate vote.
8:30 a.m. ET Welcome to the third day of the Republican party's national convention in Cleveland. Here's a recap of last night's (marginally) better program. And here's what to watch for on this third convention night.
TRUMP STATEMENT: You really owe [Mr. Obama] an apology. You're the one that sent the pictures around your campaign, sent the pictures around with President Obama in a certain garb ... That was long before I was ever involved.
CAITLIN HUEY-BURNS (CBS News Political Reporter/@CHueyBurns): Mm-Hm.
JOHN DICKERSON: This is the scenario it's actually they do this time.
The Empire State Building was structurally complete 410 days after demolition began on the Waldorf Astoria, which previously occupied the site on which it now stands. There were 577 days between the beginning of demolition and the official opening date.
MARGARET BRENNAN: What do you think is happening?
So there was no mystery about the call. But they initially tried some theories of how they could open another investigation, which didn't fly. And then they found out that they had not technically closed the earlier investigation. And they kept it open for the express purpose of trying to catch, lay a perjury trap for General Flynn.
The economy's performance makes the large and growing deficit all the more noteworthy, said CBO Director Phillip Swagel. Changes in fiscal policy must be made to address the budget situation, because our debt is growing on an unsustainable path.
Dr. Travis Gayles: I think from a federal perspective, there has been significant improvements. They actually have a plan now.
It's no surprise that companies are adapting at different rates to a market where they compete for business on cost and quality rather than by denying coverage to people with preexisting conditions, Kevin Counihan, CEO of federal exchange operator HealthCare.gov said in an emailed statement.
The AP reported that about 56% of people in the 7th Congressional District voted by mail during that election. President Trump won the district by more than 20 points in 2016, but a University of Virginia analysis found that during the April election, the conservative supreme court nominee beat his liberal challenger by just 6 points in the district.
We must unite behind Donald Trump and Mike Pence, he said.
Congress has also repealed individual mandate, which was a financial penalty attached to the ACA for people who did not sign up for health insurance.
On Friday afternoon, Joe Biden delivered an economic address responding to the newest unemployment stats via the progressive news platform NowThis. He started by wearing a face mask, seemingly a symbolic gesture as he was inside his Delaware home, CBS News campaign reporter Bo Erickson reports. At the top of the speech, Biden proceeded to take off the mask off and criticized President Trump's handling of both the public health and economic response to the pandemic. Biden said the economy is all made worse because it didn't have to be this way. Donald Trump utterly failed to prepare us for this pandemic and delayed taking the necessary steps to safeguard us from the near worse-case economic scenario we are now living. Biden also inserted some barbs toward Mr. Trump, saying that after the pandemic, the economy will need to work for everyone and ensure everyone gets a fair shot, not just the Mar-a-Lago crowd. Biden also said Trump-onomics means no strings and no oversight during the pandemic financial assistance. The presumptive Democratic nominee said he would be releasing in a few weeks a full plan to revive the economy, and on Friday, he repeated stump speech objectives about the middle class being the backbone of America.
COOPER: Allow her to respond, please.
This is familiar territory for the president. More than a dozen women have accused him of sexual misconduct, including columnist E. Jean Carroll, who accused him of raping her in a New York City department store dressing room in the 1990s. The ongoing claims waged against Trump range from inappropriate comments to sexual assault.
Republican House candidates across the country are pushing their Democratic opponents to disavow Nancy Pelosi and attempting to make the midterm elections a referendum on returning her to the speaker's office. If Democrats do win the majority, will she continue to lead the caucus? If they lose, who would challenge her?
Kayleigh McEnany: The president's given you a lot of time.
Lesley Stahl: Have you made any decisions?
Of the recent campaign reorganization, Conway maintained that it was an expansion more than it was a shakeup.
10:32 p.m. The president's first State of the Union address has concluded and he's making his way out of the chamber.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, I think everyone wants that safety. I want to ask you about the aid package you're referencing there. This morning, as you know, a group of about ten Republican senators sent a letter to the President and they say they just want a meeting. They have a proposal that they say mirrors many of the same things the President wants, including money for vaccine and health supplies, targeted stimulus checks, slightly different from what the President's proposing, enhanced unemployment. Is the President open to these ideas? And will he meet with them?
Speaker Nancy Pelosi: Well, that was his problem. In other words I tried to say let's not have this conversation in the public domain because you're saying things that we have to contradict because they're not true. And he said, Oh, I want the public to see it. Well, you want them to see that you don't-- don't know what you're talking about? Really?
Fifty-five percent of our individual on-exchange membership is new in 2016, and in the second quarter we saw individuals in need of high-cost care represent an even larger share of our on-exchange population, Aetna CEO Mark T. Bertolini said in a statement Monday.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Bernie Sanders. Can you stop him, in terms of the momentum he has? The Bloomberg campaign, as you know, is out saying that for moderates like yourselves, he's going to basically end up with an insurmountable delegate lead because of his early success.
I'm mad at all government officials — all the incumbents — who are taking us for granted, said voter Joanie Weiner, who is supporting Fletcher.
MARGARET BRENNAN: It's time now for some political analysis from our panel. Susan Page is the Washington Bureau chief of USA Today, Lanhee Chen is a Republican policy adviser and fellow at the Hoover Institution, Dan Balz is chief correspondent at The Washington Post, and Jamelle Bouie is the CBS News political analyst and a columnist with The New York Times. Good to have you all here. Lanhee, I want to start on the fundamental basis of what is central to our democracy--
Pence is said to be among those backing Romney for State. Romney was fiercely critical of Trump throughout the campaign but is interested in the Cabinet position, and they discussed it during a lengthy meeting earlier this month.
White House communications adviser Tara McGuinness echoed Carney in a tweet:
Donald Trump: Well, look I don't want to divulge, but we talked about the Middle East, that's tough. It's a tough situation. I wanted to get his full view and I got his, you know I got a good part of his view.
The EPA is so restrictive that they are putting our energy companies out of business. And all you have to do is go to a great place like West Virginia or places like Ohio, which is phenomenal, or places like Pennsylvania and you see what they're doing to the people, miners and others in the energy business. It's a disgrace.
We begin with President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence. I spoke with the president on Tuesday in the Roosevelt Room at the White House.
The interview will be broadcast later tonight during CBS News' primetime coverage of the Republican National Convention. The full interview will air on Charlie Rose on PBS stations that air the program at 11 p.m. ET. Clips from the interview will also be featured on CBSN and on CBS This Morning 7 a.m. - 9 a.m. on Tuesday. Clips will be posted to cbsnews.com, charlierose.com and pbs.org.
It was a huge defeat for President Trump -- who had mocked McCain's Vietnam War record.
Our political enemy is not one another but is the liberal policy ideas of the party of Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi and Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton and Jim Hood, Reeves said during a Republican debate in July.
The Trump administration has also chipped away at other key components of the law to weaken it.
ED WONG (The New York Times/@ewong): I think it shows that both Republicans and Democrats want to sort of take back the narrative of American values and sort of the values that we placed behind human rights and other issues like this. And-- and push back strongly against sort of the more transactional nature of President Trump's policies. And so, I think that going into the New Year in 2019 will see more that both, they-- they can't-- both Houses will take up the Yemen war resolution again and also rebuke against MBS, and I think we'll see more debate on that. And I think that there's strong momentum in both sides to sort of push forward with that.
Mike Bloomberg: When I lived in this house my father made $6,000 the best year of his life. My parents took a mortgage out on the house, I think it was $11,000, if I remember, to help my sister and I go through school. I worked as hard as anybody. Not better. I wasn't any better or worse, I was luckier, I think than other people.
We have great respect for the institution of the Supreme Court of the United States, but Chief Justice John Roberts has been a disappointment to conservatives, whether it be the Obamacare decision or whether it be a spate of recent decisions, Pence said.
Then there's the enthusiasm gap, a fact that anxious Republicans often mention when they go off-the-record. Democratic turnout is up across the board in these recent special elections, a pretty sure sign that the party's rank-and-file are excited to vote, while a good number of Republicans have so far seen fit to stay home. As Nate Silver put it the other day, the 16- or 17-point average Democratic overperformance in special elections so far suggests a Democratic mega-tsunami come November.
A trillion of anything is hard to fathom. It's a million millions. Or a thousand billions.
Lesley Stahl: Pat you on the top of your head?
There's absolutely no reason to tie these things together right now, he said.
SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: --from the arms of their mothers.
President Donald Trump: I would say China. They're an adversary. They're a--
But in today's suburbs, one political message may not fit all.
Lesley Stahl: Yes, yes the FBI.
JOHN DICKERSON: Right. So a consolidation there. Let's switch to politics. Susan Page, the USA Today ran an op-ed from the President on the question of health care this week that was-- well, take it from there.
BEN DOMENECH (The Federalist/@bdomenech): And the President realizes that--
He adds some much-needed seriousness that has been previously lacking from the GOP field, she quipped. We look forward to hearing more about his ideas for the nation.
The trial is set for Tuesday.
After meeting during the day to discuss their options, the House put forward three measures that restore some aspects of government that seemed especially unpopular. Earlier that morning, a group of World War II honor flight veterans who were visiting Washington pushed past the barricades blocking access to the World War II memorial during the shutdown and proceeded with their visit. House Republicans who had been appointed as negotiators pointed to the veterans as a reason for the legislation. They should, as Americans, as veterans, people who served this country, have the ability to enjoy that site...the silliness that is caused by unwillingness to talk is what we're trying to avoid, and we invite the Senate Democrats to come and join us, said House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-Va.
According to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, $1.1 billion worth of Indiana exports and 812,000 Indiana jobs are threatened by the trade war. In July, the Trump administration hit Chinese imports with some $34 billion in tariffs. China retaliated with a 25 percent on U.S. agricultural products, including soybeans and corn. The second round of tariffs, totaling $16 billion, went into effect on Aug. 23.
Jeff Zients: We hit a grim milestone on Monday. 500,000 people have died from COVID in the U.S. And everyone's life has been impacted. You know, too many businesses and schools are no longer open. So this is a national emergency, a war.
Pharmaceutical investors and analysts expressed relief after the announcement, and shares of most top drugmakers rose Friday afternoon, including Pfizer, Johnson & Johnson and Eli Lilly.
This subsidy expansion largely replaces private spending with government spending. Blase said.
We have been working on coronavirus relief. Unfortunately, the speaker has not been able to agree to anything remotely reasonable, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said in an interview with Fox News on Monday.
JOHN DICKERSON: All right. Senator Sasse, thank you so much for being here.
SENATOR RICK SCOTT: Well, we don't agree on much, but I'm glad he cares about prescription drug prices. But the-- the problem the Democrats have is everything they keep doing is raising the cost of health care. Let's look at Obamacare--
Priebus suggested that Republicans care more about improving the country than Democrats do and he blasted Hillary Clinton, her policies and what her administration would mean for the nation.
Klobuchar is the fifth major woman candidate to launch a campaign for the Democratic nomination, joining fellow senators Kirsten Gillibrand, Kamala Harris and Elizabeth Warren, as well as Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard.
Democrats are also using the issue in their battle for the Senate, where Republican proposals to scrap Obama's law flopped last summer, dooming the effort.
President Donald Trump: That's right. We have turned--
Maybe we can do better than that.
What action has the Justice Department taken today in the Michael Flynn case?
MARGARET BRENNAN: Does experience become something that hurts him rather than helps him?
RADDATZ: We've sneaked in one more question, and it comes from Karl Becker.
You took on the longest-serving member of the state legislature, a man who as I recall referred to you as 'little lady,' and you won, said Braver.
Donald Trump: Well, we'll see what happens. It's got a long way to go, just so you understand. That has a long, long way to go.
In our drive to make Washington accountable, we have eliminated more regulations in our first year than any administration in the history of our country.
JOHN DICKERSON: Right. Jonah, let me switch topics here to a departure from the administration. U.N. Secretary Nikki Haley is leaving. It was extraordinary this week to see an event at the White House where she said, I've had a great time and it was all quite orderly.
CBS News political correspondent Ed O'Keefe reports that Trump also told the governors his administration will step in if needed to assist states with reopening plans but didn't specify when or how exactly federal intervention would occur. Our gradual reopening plans are moving along and they're moving along very rapidly, the president said, according to audio of the call obtained by CBS News. The governors are making their decisions, and want to make their decisions, and that's the way I want it too, and we will step in if we see something going wrong, or if we disagree, and some people say that's nice, and some people say I shouldn't be doing that, but we're going to do it if we see something wrong. Melania Trump also called on governors to focus on the physical and mental health of young children during the pandemic. Children need us in this time more than ever, the First Lady said, adding later she's especially worried about younger kids because they don't have anybody to turn to when they're, we could say, locked up at home because of no school, no kindergarten. I'm worried about them and we need to take care of them and go and check on them.
Democrats are hoping that the 2018 elections will give them control of Congress. But while they have a decent chance of winning back the House, it's going to be very difficult for them to win back the Senate.
I have been with Donald for 18 years. He never had a hidden agenda, she said. Like me, he loves this country very much.
Before the Memorial Day weekend, a northern Michigan dock company owner said Whitmer's husband inquired about installing their family's boat in the water, according to a report from the Detroit News. Retail businesses and restaurants and bars with limited seating in the Upper Peninsula and the greater Traverse City regions were allowed to reopen on May 22nd, but Whitmer encouraged Michiganders to think long and hard before traveling to the region. The Detroit News reported that Whitmer's husband, Marc Mallory, identified himself as Whitmer's husband and asked the company if that would speed up the process of getting their boat placed in the water. Whitmer addressed the report at a press conference, saying that her husband made a failed attempt at humor. Whitmer said, Knowing it wouldn't make a difference, he jokingly asked if being married to me might move him up in the queue. She continued, Obviously, with the motorized boating prohibition in our early days of COVID-19, he thought it might get a laugh. It didn't…And to be honest, I wasn't laughing either when it was relayed to me because I knew how it would be perceived. He regrets it. I wish it wouldn't have happened. In a statement, Michigan Republican Party chair Laura Cox said, Using your wife's political office to score favors is not a laughing matter. Michigan Rising Action, a conservative group, also seized on the report and sent out a fundraising email criticizing Whitmer's blatant hypocrisy.
On specific issues, Trump is relatively strongest on the economy (46 percent) and terrorism (45 percent). He gets lower marks on tax policy (38 percent), immigration (34 percent) and the situation with North Korea (34 percent). Most Republicans approve of his handling of these issues, while most Democrats don't.
The justices likely won't hear the case until its next term, which begins in October, with a decision coming by the end of June 2021.
SENATOR BEN SASSE: Well, one of the things we have to do is rediscover plural vocations, right? Work is statistically one of the most significant drivers of whether or not people are happy. And part of that's because we-- we like to do stuff together. We like to have shared projects. I was born in the 1970s. Average duration at a firm was two and a half decades for a primary breadwinner. Average duration at a firm today for an American is four point two years and getting shorter.
But the real estate mogul, who criticized Obama for taking vacations, has taken ample days on what most would consider a vacation. Of course, presidents can work from anywhere, and take their decision-making and phone calls with them.
Thursday's report from the government showed that about 487,000 people signed up with HealthCare.gov after losing their workplace coverage this year. That's an increase of 46% from the same time period last year.
Scott Pelley: So it's a blank check? You'd spend $1 billion?
In 2012, for example, McCaskill was written off for dead before she took advantage of a divided Republican electorate and skillfully assisted far-right Rep. Todd Akin in the GOP primary. Akin won that contest, quickly set off a national firestorm by questioning whether rape could lead to pregnancy, and then lost the race to McCaskill in a landslide.
U.S. District Judge Reed O'Connor sided with the GOP plaintiffs. The Court therefore finds the Individual Mandate, unmoored from a tax, is unconstitutional, his ruling read.
The poll employed a random digit dial methodology. For the landline sample, a respondent was randomly selected from all adults in the household. For the cell sample, interviews were conducted with the person who answered the phone.
But the 37-page white paper falls far short of a full-scale replacement proposal for Obamacare and leaves key questions unanswered, including the size of the tax credits, the overall price tag of the plan, and how many people would be covered. Republican aides said it's intended as an overall roadmap showing how the GOP would approach undoing and replacing Obama's health law with a Republican in the White House, and specific legislative details would be answered as the actual bills are written next year.
Clinton publicly supports the new fiduciary rule promulgated by the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL), which requires financial advisers and institutions that are making recommendations on the investment of retirement accounts to act in the best interests of clients. According to one source, Trump hasn't taken a position on the DOL's fiduciary regulation, although some believe he will stop the rule, and at least one Republican lawmaker is calling on Trump to do so.
So I think you are going to see a more Trumpian approach to the United Nations, that's also John Bolton, his very hawkish national security advisor's made an entire career of U.N. bashing. They're already talking about downgrading the United Nations' portfolio with absence of Nikki Haley is probably no longer going to be a cabinet level position.
Houston — Former Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Elizabeth Warren will go head-to-head Thursday for the first time on the debate stage in this presidential primary. The match-up will provide the clearest example yet of competing directions for the party.
There are a lot of kids, especially from the lower income minority neighborhoods, who literally haven't seen it work, Buttigieg added in the clip. There isn't somebody they know personally who testifies to the value of education. The mayor faced fierce backlash online for the comments and according to Turman, told reporters this morning that he spoke to Michael Harriott, who wrote the op-ed.
Unlike in past recessions, most of those who lose their job-based coverage will be eligible for health coverage because of the Affordable Care Act, though some may find coverage unaffordable even with subsidies, KFF Executive Vice President for Health Policy Larry Levitt said in a statement. As unemployment benefits expire, however, about two million more people in states that did not expand their Medicaid programs under the ACA will move into the Medicaid coverage gap and have no affordable option.
In 2014 Bertolucci talked with Film Comment magazine about Last Tango, his most talked-about film. (Schneider complained that Bertolucci had not properly warned her about the improvisational sex scenes.) When I started, I didn't know where I could go with Marlon Brando and Maria. Because there is something that you can't tell in the screenplays – and it's exactly what's missing from screenplays, which is the flesh and blood of the real people in front of the camera. The script describes the characters, but when you go to shoot, you try to invent life in front of the camera.
SENATOR RICK SCOTT: Well, first off I'm glad the- the president cares about health care. I've- I've- I ran the largest hospital company. I care about the cost of health care and that's what I've focused on. I know it's going to be tough. I look forward to, you know, to seeing what the president's going to put out. But with Nancy Pelosi in the House it's going to be tough to get something done. But we do know that Medicare for all which Senator Sanders is all in on, is going to just ruin our health care system.
Garcia said in a statement that he's ready to get to work right away. Smith conceded via Facebook Wednesday afternoon, and said, While it's critical that we ensure every vote is counted and recorded, we believe that the current tally shows Mike Garcia is the likely victor in the May 12 special election.
Trump announces he has signed an executive order on Gitmo
PAUL RYAN: Well, first let- let me just say this is your last show. You're going from hanging out with the likes of Ryan and Mulvaney to hanging out with O'Donnell and King. You're in for a serious upgrade. I want to say congratulations on that.
We eliminated an especially cruel tax that fell mostly on Americans making less than $50,000 a year, forcing them to pay tremendous penalties simply because they couldn't afford government-ordered health plans. We repealed the core of the disastrous Obamacare. The individual mandate is now gone. Thank heaven.
Today, I'm afraid we're losing that sense of unity and optimism, not just in towns like Tecumseh, but across this land. Our country is divided, our people are afraid, and our spirits are nearly broken. But we can't allow hopelessness to become the new normal. And we won't, she said.
MILLER: Obamacare was a disaster. Fortunately, again, the president is taking significant action to bring down the price of insurance on the exchanges. But Obamacare never worked. For example, even on the issue of preexisting conditions. An American family's that are earning 80 thousand dollars a year, with a few children, has to pay exorbitant out-of-pocket costs if they have preexisting conditions.
You know, I don't think it's swagger. I think it's passion. I am very passionate about defending the United States.
Haley said, If they get education and they get training, then we know that they're going to be productive. If they don't, we'll be dealing with resentful children that are uneducated and angry, and that's what we don't want.
Musadiq Bidar contributed to this report.
The vice president continued to attack Biden on health care, claiming that Biden's plan to add a public option to Obamacare will lead to socialism. You take Bernie Sanders' socialist idea, you put it right in the middle of Obamacare, and you're going to put America on an inevitable path to socialist medicine, Pence said. Pence, who dropped off his absentee ballot in his home state of Indiana this morning along with Second Lady Karen Pence, will continue to campaign this weekend, according to CBS News campaign reporter Musadiq Bidar. In addition to making a stop in Pennsylvania this evening, Pence holds two rallies Saturday in Florida. The vice president heads to North Carolina Sunday and then another trip to Pennsylvania on Monday.
This claim has been fact-checked in the past. The Washington Post deemed it a 4-Pinocchio whopper.
American describes nightmare conditions in Venezuelan jail
Deval Patrick, the former governor of Massachusetts, has announced he is running for president in the 2020 race. Patrick made it official in an online video posted early Thursday morning.
Good morning and welcome to FACE THE NATION. President Trump sat down on Thursday with 60 MINUTES correspondent Lesley Stahl for an interview that will air tonight. With U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley announcing her departure last week, Stahl asked if the President has any more changes in store for his administration.
In a broader view, Americans across the political spectrum say that the American way of life is disappearing, but they differ on just what constitutes that way of life. Sixty-two percent of Americans agree with the idea that the American way of life – the things that make Americans unique like its culture, values, and traditions – is in danger of disappearing. Republicans, Democrats, and independents all say this in equal proportions.
A federal appeals court has determined the individual mandate in the nation's health care law is unconstitutional. The 5th Circuit Court of Appeals announced the decision on Obamacare Wednesday, sending the case back to a lower court in Texas to determine whether other parts of the Affordable Care Act can continue to exist.
Check back here for updates throughout the debate.
Tonight, I want to talk about what kind of future we are going to have, and what kind of a nation we are going to be. All of us, together, as one team, one people, and one American family can do anything.
We need to move toward a system that provides more choice so that the cost comes down, McSally told us. The Obama experiment has failed.
As for China and its leadership overall, this was day one of the Trump campaign: China's killing us, Mr. Trump said in June 2015.
The Democrats have an offer — Medicare for All — which takes away all private insurance for individuals, said House GOP leader Kevin McCarthy, though not all Democratic candidates support eliminating private insurance. The Republicans believe in pre-existing conditions. We believe in lowering the cost and that's what we are working on.
Verma's claim has become an annoyance for many in the West Wing, but CMS considered the story to be part of a smear campaign against her.
The high court's conservative justices seemed more willing to side with the administration, with Trump appointee Justice Brett Kavanaugh suggesting the administration's changes might be considered within the bounds of reasonable.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Will you be releasing your-- your tax return? Senator Gillibrand did so this week or some of them.
Crawford said of Mr. Trump, I believe he has been the most pro-life president yet.
The Affordable Care Act, and the health coverage of millions of Americans, could face a major threat to its future. A federal appeals court in New Orleans appears ready to rule that a core provision of Obamacare is unconstitutional.
MARGARET BRENNAN: You, today, have hit this benchmark, you know, end of first quarter funding financing for the campaign. I believe you said you wanted one million donors by this time. Did you meet--

TRUMP STATEMENT: You get a subpoena and after getting the subpoena you delete 33,000 emails and then you acid wash them. Or bleach them, as you would say -- a very expensive process.

She was handily re-elected, but left to join the Trump Administration, where she's shown it's a mistake to mess with Nikki Haley.
As tax cuts create new jobs, let's invest in workforce development and let's invest in job training, which we need so badly. Let's open great vocational schools so our future workers can learn a craft and realize their full potential. And let's support working families by supporting paid family leave.
What can we do if we have a Republican president? Ryan wondered. What does 2017 look like if the election goes the way we hope it goes?
As a candidate, Mr. Trump railed against the pharmaceutical industry. But as president he has shied away from major changes and has staffed his administration with appointees who have deep ties to the industry. They include Health Secretary Alex Azar, a former top executive at Eli Lilly and Co., who joined Mr. Trump for Friday's announcement.
That combination of silk and steel has cut through to the public. A new Quinnipiac University poll found her approval rating much higher than that of the President (63% to 39%). She even scores 55% among Democrats … which has led to inescapable speculation:
Romney, he argues, doesn't speak the language of a conservative.
For nearly two years, prominent Democrats have been arguing that the Trump presidency is illegitimate. Some members of Congress even refused to show up for his inauguration, announcing to their base from the beginning that Trump wasn't really elected president.
The Democrats need to flip 23 Republican-held districts to take control of the House of Representatives this fall, and CBS News does not race either of the two House primaries on Tuesday as competitive.
Stan Lee Reed Saxon/AP Photo I saw a fly crawling on a wall, and I thought, 'Gee, what if a guy could stick to walls like an insect? recalled Stan Lee (December 28, 1922-November 12, 2018) to CBS' Sunday Morning in 2016. That sounds good. So I started trying to think of some names. Insect-man? Nah. Mosquito-man? Nah. And then I got to Spider-man. Spider-man, ooh, that sounds dramatic! And if he has spider power, he can shoot a web also. And he could swing ... oh man! And then I figured I'd make him a teenager, and I figured I would do the unthinkable: I'd give him personal problems. I ran into my publisher and I said, 'Have I got an idea for you! His name is Spider-man ...' And I couldn't get any further. He said, 'Stan, that is the worst idea I have ever heard!' The rest, of course, is the stuff of comic book lore, one of the premier characters Lee helped create at Marvel. He was the comic book company's top writer, and later its publisher. Working with artists such as Jack Kirby and Steve Ditko, Lee's wild ideas helped bring Iron Man, Hulk, Thor, the X-Men, the Avengers, Black Panther, and the Fantastic Four to life, making Lee a God of the Marvel Universe. But it wasn't just his childhood fascination with Errol Flynn that inspired his comic books' derring-do.
For over 30 years, Washington has tried and failed to solve this problem. This Congress can be the one that finally makes it happen.
Betsy McCaughey. Former Lt. Governor of New York and author of Beating Obamacare, and its sequel, Beating Obamacare 2014.
STEPHEN MILLER: Well, obviously there's no change immediately in Obamacare. There hasn't been a nationwide injunction. Obamacare was ruled to be unconstitutional. We've always known that Obamacare was unconstitutional. The more important question is whether Democrats are going to work with Republicans once Obamacare is ultimately struck down, which we believe it will be, to come up with a replacement plan that protects preexisting conditions, helps the twenty-eight million Americans who because of Obamacare still don't have access to health insurance and keeps prices low through robust competition.
Tuesday night marks the first time that Colorado's 1.2 million unaffiliated voters can cast ballots in the primary elections. But the Denver Post reports: Hundreds of unaffiliated voters' ballots that have been turned in won't be counted, however, because they didn't follow regulations for the new opportunity. Specifically, those voters didn't heed a rule requiring unaffiliated voters to send back only a Republican or Democratic primary ballot — not both.
There were three main protests in Cleveland today, reports CBS News' Jacqueline Alemany: an open carry rally for gun rights activists, a Circle of Love march, and a Stop Trump and the RNC demonstration.
As for the future of the Republican Party, perhaps blowing it up would benefit America. But it's also interesting that the GOP Establishment tried very hard to prevent Donald Trump from becoming their nominee. If anything, the Trump presidency is the result of the weakening of the GOP's party structure—a structure that was designed to help elect more mainstream candidates.
Bill Whitaker: But once you step into the office, this becomes yours.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Next couple of weeks?
We have big decisions to make. Our country is being tested. But we've been tested in the past, and our people have always risen to the challenge. We have all the guidance we need to be safe and successful, she said.
Price, who built a reputation as a budget hawk during earlier congressional service, has apologized and repaid the government nearly $60,000. The report said authorities should seek full recovery of the $341,000 deemed wasteful spending.
1978-1982: Served as a Democrat in the Ohio Senate
President Trump announced today in the Oval Office that his administration will be keeping the coronavirus task force in place indefinitely following concerns raised over reports of the group's winding down. Mr. Trump told reporters, I had no idea how popular the task force is, until actually yesterday, when I started talking about winding it down…I'd get calls from very respected people, saying, I think it would be better to keep it going, it's done such a good job. It's a respected task force.
And if you did cast a vote against the insider politics and general incompetence of Washington's political class, doesn't yet another government shutdown—particularly one as seemingly unnecessary as this one—prove your point?
Certainly not everyone has prospered. Overall, the median household income has dropped since 2009 by $1,268, to $53,657.
The group includes many other congressional members and other progressive activists, some who wrote about their initial hesitation in joining the Biden working groups. Biden also confirmed in a Snapchat interview that he has yet to be tested for COVID-19 but that his Secret Service detail has been tested. I should be tested, Biden said, So that's, that's in play. We'll see how that goes.
The 53-year-old Kavanaugh's long march through conservative legal circles was not without its setbacks. After leading the investigation into the suicide of Clinton lawyer Vince Foster, Kavanaugh lost his one and only case before the Supreme Court in 1995 in an attempt to get access to notes exchanged between Foster and his attorney.
Terrorists who do things like place bombs in civilian hospitals are evil. When possible, we have no choice but to annihilate them. When necessary, we must be able to detain and question them. But we must be clear: Terrorists are not merely criminals. They are unlawful enemy combatants. And when captured overseas, they should be treated like the terrorists they are.
We will do as well as we can here, and then we're moving on and you know I'm really looking forward to the South and I'm really looking forward to the Midwest, and I can't wait to get to Michigan, Kasich said on Wednesday.
JOHN DICKERSON: Right. And, Susan, speaking of the politics, the President came right out and said This is about jobs potentially. He says a hundred and ten billion in orders from the Saudi Arabia which is-- that's orders to come not already booked, but and that-- that's really what he said, I wouldn't want to do anything that would endanger that.
MARGARET BRENNAN: --what if they won't have a plan at all if Obamacare is struck down? Can you promise them that won't be the case?
Beto O'Rourke Beto O'Rourke joins the 2020 presidential rac... 02:39 Biography O'Rourke was born and raised in the Texas border city of El Paso. Although his legal first name is Robert, he has been known as Beto, the nickname Spanish-speaking communities give names that end in berto, like Roberto and Alberto, since childhood. He was an avid musician as a teenager and was part of various rock bands, including the El Paso-based punk group Foss after graduating from Columbia University in New York in 1995. O'Rouke's music career, however, was short-lived and he spent several years working in start-up companies and civic groups when he returned to El Paso from New York City. After working on several local political campaigns, O'Rourke ran for the El Paso City Council in 2005 and defeated a two-term incumbent. He served two terms in the council and spearheaded a controversial effort to revamp the city's downtown. In 2012, O'Rourke, who speaks fluent Spanish, announced his candidacy for the Democratic primary in the race to represent Texas 16th Congressional District, a Latino-majority district encompassing El Paso and the surrounding communities. He managed to topple eight-term incumbent Silvestre Reyes in the primary and defeated his Republican challenger in a landslide general election victory. While in Congress, the Texas Democrat compiled a moderate voting record during his three terms, where he served on the Armed Services and Veterans Affairs committees.
Franklin County Judge Richard A. Frye filed an order for Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose's counsel to clarify his position on Tuesday's ruling, in which Frye said that LaRose's directive to limit counties to one ballot drop box did not have a legal basis.
Lincoln Project co-founder Steve Schmidt was a senior campaign strategist and top adviser to McCain during his 2008 campaign. He told Stahl he, too, regrets that Palin was put on the ticket, even though he had originally encouraged McCain to select her.

Mr. Biden's memorandum also directs the Department of Health and Human Services to review potentially dismantling a similar policy in the U.S. that bars money from Title X from going to health care centers that provide abortion services.
Washington — The Supreme Court on Wednesday upheld the Trump administration's broad exemptions to employers who raise religious or moral objections to providing free birth control coverage to workers, paving the way for more employers to opt out of a provision of the Obama-era health care law that has been at the center of a long-running dispute before the courts.
PAUL RYAN: -No discussions. They blew up the negotiations that were already underway.
Sen. Joe Manchin, D-West Virginia, released a new television ad Monday that takes aim – literally – at his opponent's bid to gut the Affordable Care Act.
Based in Philadelphia, the nonpartisan, non-profit FactCheck.org has a team of six staffers, led by Eugene Kiely. On the day CBS News visited him, we found him fact checking a Ted Cruz TV ad, which he said was not true.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Republicans weren't able to repeal and replace with Republican majorities in both chambers. You're going to have to work with Democrats to get any kind of new legislation through. What are you actually-- when-- when does this begin? What are you actually proposing here?
In a press release, LaRose's office noted that absentee ballot applications did not surpass one million until 28 days before the 2016 election. In a statement, LaRose said that the high number of applications shows that Ohioans trust the state's election infrastructure.
2016 is the year America moves on, Ryan declares.
Melania Trump: No. I didn't feel it.
As the 2020 campaign season heads into the summer, the Biden campaign will likely seize on the opportunity to put former President Obama on the stump after he formally endorsed his former vice president in April. A former president throwing his support behind his past vice president is nothing new — President Andrew Jackson's vice president, Martin Van Buren, in 1836 received his predecessor's endorsement. But as Mr. Obama goes to bat for Biden, the idea that a former president plans to actively campaign for his former vice president is not always a given. And in some cases, candidates have even shied away from a predecessor's help.
Senator, the fact checkers say you're wrong, Chris Wallace said to GOP candidate Ted Cruz on Fox News Sunday in January in response to Cruz's claim that Obamacare has been the biggest job killer in the U.S.
LANHEE CHEN: --in terms of exactly what the intelligence community is seeing if they are helping Bernie Sanders. And that is an assessment that they are comfortable with, I think that's something that should be shared. And if there's any confusion, I do think that O'Brien's point was right which is the underlying intelligence ought to be declassified. So we can see that the American people--
President Donald Trump: No, I think I wouldn't be here if I didn't have social media.
You've been supporting conservative candidates, Kasich said Tuesday in comments on a Wisconsin radio talk show, first reported by BuzzFeed News. They told you in 2014 that they were going to repeal Obamacare. Do you realize, that's just--that's a big joke?
Medicaid is a very, very significant issue, said Dan Mendelson, president of the consulting firm Avalere Health. That forces states to rethink their programs in a fundamental way.
Bernie Sanders Bernie Sanders on 2020: We're going to win 04:49 Biography Although he has spent most of his adult life in Vermont, Bernie Sanders was born and raised in Brooklyn, New York, in 1941, as part of a religiously observant Jewish family. He attended one year at Brooklyn College before transferring to the University of Chicago and graduating in 1964. At the University of Chicago, Sanders began his long career of political activism as a member of the university's chapters of the Congress of Racial Equality and the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee. He was also an active member of the antiwar movement, and applied for conscientious objector status during the Vietnam War. He moved to Vermont in 1968. Sanders ran for governor of Vermont unsuccessfully in 1972 and 1976, and for senator in 1972 and 1974, as part of the independent Liberty Union Party. He was elected mayor of Burlington, Vermont, in 1980 as an independent, and served as mayor until 1989. He was elected to the House of Representatives as an independent in 1990, where he served until he was elected to the Senate in 2006. Although technically still an independent, he caucuses with Democrats in the Senate and is seen as a leader of the party's resurgent left wing. Sanders unsuccessfully ran for the Democratic nomination for president in 2016. However, he inspired a grassroots movement with his focus on economic inequality and use of primarily small-dollar donations to fund his campaign.
According to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, a U.S citizen can petition for a spouse; unmarried children under 21; sons and daughters, married and/or over 21; parents, if you are 21 and over; and siblings, if you are 21 and over. A green card holder can petition for spouses, unmarried children under 21, and an unmarried son or daughter of any age. -- Ellee Watson
Phoenix airport bag screening snafu ending, feds say
Ivanka Trump: I think it's impossible to go through this journey and not change for the better. You meet-- and in my father's case, literally millions of Americans, and they speak to you with a candor about their struggles, their challenges. They share with you their most intimate stories. So you connect with people in a different way. And you grow.
Because I think the current court has gone in the wrong direction. And so I would want to see the Supreme Court reverse Citizens United and get dark, unaccountable money out of our politics. Donald doesn't agree with that.
The relationship has really been amazing. And Biden, during his virtual event on Monday, praised the governors. He singled out Republican Governors Mike DeWine of Ohio, Larry Hogan of Maryland, Charlie Baker of Massachusetts as well as Democratic governors Gavin Newsom of California, Jay Inslee of Washington, Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan and Cuomo.
No ma'am. No ma'am. He's a decent family man, citizen, that I just happen to have disagreements with on fundamental issues and that's what this campaign is all about, he said at a town hall meeting.
Lesley Stahl: Now-- you met with Michelle Obama yesterday. Was there any awkwardness, given--
It's time for a president who understands the art of a deal and who appreciates the value of a dollar, said Trump, who said his father has revitalized run-down neighborhoods and has shaped skylines across the country.
1:05 p.m. ET Shots were heard near a police vehicle by the Republican convention early Tuesday afternoon, Reuters reports.
Barrett was confirmed by the Senate in a near party-line vote, 52-48, and took the constitutional oath of office, administered by Justice Clarence Thomas, at the White House on Monday night. On Tuesday morning, at a private ceremony at the Supreme Court, Roberts administered the judicial oath, with her six other new colleagues looking on from a safe distance and Justice Stephen Breyer listening in on the phone from his house in Cambridge, Massachusetts.
Our SUNDAY PROFILE this morning is of Nikki Haley, our outspoken Ambassador to the United Nations. She talks with Rita Braver:
Hardiman has sided with jails seeking to strip-search inmates arrested for even minor offenses, and he has also supported gun rights. He dissented in a 2013 case that upheld a New Jersey law to strengthen requirements for carrying a handgun in public.
MARGARET BRENNAN: The Miami Herald, as you know, local paper there, says that communities with higher average incomes have been getting more doses than impoverished neighborhoods. Why is that happening?
Yes, 64,000 Americans died in 2016 from opioid overdoses according to the CDC.
Clinton herself was in the crowd, and the pop star's plea to 20,000 fans comes at an ideal time for Clinton, who is trying to convince Floridians to vote early, reports CBS News' Nancy Cordes.
In the current enrollment period, plans sold through the federal exchanges are falling short of that goal. About 11.3 million people have signed up for coverage through Dec. 26, including 8.6 million people in the 38 states that use the HealthCare.gov platform, the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services said on Thursday. But out of that latter number, only 26 percent are between 18 to 34.
Of Medicare expansion, Clinton said she would also commit to allowing individuals below the Medicare age to opt in to the program -- a proposal she first cosponsored legislation on in 2001 as a senator -- by providing the option to those 55 and older.
Shortly after Mr. Trump's announcement, Graham laid out the timeline for which the Judiciary Committee will consider Barrett's nomination, with her confirmation hearing beginning October 12 and lasting three to four days. Graham expects his panel will report out Barrett's nomination October 22, setting up a final vote by the full Senate just before the November 3 election.
He has done such a lousy job as president, Trump said on stage at a Beaufort, South Carolina rally Tuesday. You look at our budgets. You look at our spending. We can't beat ISIS. Obamacare is terrible. We're going to terminate it. We're going to absolutely terminate and replace it. I mean you look at everything. Our borders are like Swiss cheese.
Many congressmen who support a clean spending bill (called a continuing resolution) think that if a clean bill were put up for a vote, more than 100 Republicans would vote yes, CBS News' Nancy Cordes reports from Capitol Hill. But unless more of them go public with that position, Boehner won't be compelled to undertake a change in strategy.
But perhaps the truest sign of her love? She doesn't mind his singing. On the campaign trail, Heidi Cruz has recounted how her husband often relaxes during tense campaign moments by calling her and belting out showtunes.
STEPHEN MILLER: One of the great tragedies that is going on in our country today is the loopholes in our immigration laws and the deficiencies in our immigration laws. And left wing, activist judicial rulings that incentivize the most vulnerable populations to come to our country. Last year--
Adrian Cronauer Adrian Cronauer, courtesy of Paul Bottoms; Thanks to AFVNvets.net During his service as a U.S. Air Force sergeant in Vietnam in 1965-66, Adrian Cronauer (September 8, 1938-July 18, 2018) opened his Armed Forces Radio show with the phrase, Goooooood morning, Vietnam! The military wanted conservative programming. American youths fighting overseas, however, were not into drab, sterile announcements with middle-of-the-road music, Cronauer told The Associated Press in 1987. The battle over the airwaves was joined: I wanted to serve the listeners. His military radio antics inspired the character played by Robin Williams in the film Good Morning, Vietnam, who drops Perry Como and Lawrence Welk from his 6 a.m. playlist in favor of the Dave Clark Five. Cronauer loved the movie but admitted much of it was Hollywood make-believe, explaining, Yes, I did try to make it sound more like a stateside station. Yes, I did have problems with news censorship. Yes, I was in a restaurant shortly before the Viet Cong hit it. And yes, I did start each program by yelling, 'Good Morning, Vietnam!' The rest was invention on the part of Hollywood scriptwriters and Williams' improvisational genius. If I did even half the things that Robin did in the movie, I'd still be in Leavenworth! Cronauer told journalist Rick Fredericksen in 2014. After the military, he worked in radio, television and advertising. He also attended the University of Pennsylvania's law school and worked in communications law. He later handled prisoner-of-war issues for the Pentagon.
10:14 p.m. Today, I am keeping another promise. I just signed an order directing Secretary Mattis to reexamine our military detention policy and to keep open the detention facilities at Guantánamo Bay, he said. I am also asking the Congress to ensure that, in the fight against ISIS and al-Qa'ida, we continue to have all necessary power to detain terrorists -- wherever we chase them down.
MARGARET BRENNAN: And that shut down could come over the Christmas holiday unless there's a compromise to continue funding the government. Plus, the revolving door in the Trump administration continues. As one position is filled temporarily another opens up. We'll talk with White House Senior Adviser Stephen Miller, Wyoming Republican Senator John Barrasso, and Minnesota Democratic Senator Amy Klobuchar.
SENATOR JOHN BARRASSO: That said if the mandate goes away then other things go away.
SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS (60 MINUTES): No. Absolutely no. Of course, I don't. You know, hopefully, it's-- it's rare as possible, but--
LANHEE CHEN: Yeah. Look, I-- I think he said that at the end. I think he made the point that regardless of who is doing this or what they might be trying to do it is the job of this administration to protect the integrity of the election process and the integrity of our Democratic process. But, you know, I think some of the confusion that's arising is because they are-- they are-- they are trying to turn things on-- on very specific indications of what did and did not happen. For example, the administration is saying that the President may not have been briefed on the underlying intelligence, but, surely, the President was provided with some interpretation perhaps of that data. And so what they are trying to say maybe is that he hasn't seen the underlying evidence. Now that may be true.
Corruption charges against Chris Collins have GOP party leaders scrambling
TREVOR POTTER: Well, I-- I think the point there is that you have the defenders of the President as well as the President himself saying that violations of law don't matter. And I don't think that's where we are as a country. We believe in the rule of law. You could make the argument, well, it's more or less important. I obviously think it's more important. But to-- to say we're just going to ignore violations of law because it's politically convenient to, we don't want to talk about it is I think a real problem for the-- the country. These are laws that were enacted after the Watergate reforms, when we learned the problems of corruption, of secret money in elections, of payments of hush money. Richard Nixon's lawyer went to jail for payments of hush money that were cash payments not disclosed. And I-- and I think the-- the point that Paula makes is an important one which is there are a lot of investigations all of a sudden. You open every door and there is potentially illegal activity behind it. The inaugural committee we now know about. Last week, the plea by the Russian woman who was working with the NRA and organizing trips to Moscow and organizing Russians to meet American politicians, all of this connected to different aspects of the Trump campaign with a number of U.S. Attorney's Offices looking at it.
8:30 p.m. ET Rep. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tennessee said Thursday that Americans have had enough of bloated budgets, un-kept promises and pointless redlines.
This claim is accurate as of Jan. 1, 2018, according to the Defense Department.
7:15 a.m. ET On CBS This Morning, Donald Trump's campaign chair Paul Manafort defended Melania Trump's Monday night speech speech -- a 58-word portion of which seemed very similar to Michelle Obama's 2008 speech at the Democratic national convention.
After the meltdown in Iowa, which led to a major delay in reporting results, New Hampshire Democratic officials have been trying to reassure voters that the primary should go off without a hitch. We have obviously a paper trail as well with paper ballots, Ray Buckley, the Democratic state party chair, told New Hampshire Public Radio.
Grief yielded to anguish, to song:
There has been some thought, Carey said, that with the economy improving, some people may be getting coverage at their new jobs.
The president plans to address his vision of America first on trade. Expect his remarks to reiterate the points he made in his address in Davos, Switzerland, on Friday. There, he promoted the notion of America first -- but not America alone. The theme of that speech was America is open for business. He invited other countries to invest in in the U.S. and said he wanted to negotiate mutually beneficial bilateral trade agreements, and expressed a willingness to revisit the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP) if it is in the interests of all.
If wishing made it so, Ryan would have Mr. Obama commit to lower tax rates, clearing out crony capitalism, and restoring the Constitution to its rightful place in American life.
Speeding up the approval process for over-the-counter medications so people can buy more drugs without prescriptions.
Still, expert opinion remains sharply divided on the impact of the undocumented on the U.S. economy.
ED WONG: I think that the trade war with China is the main sort of question that looms over all of this. And they have that sort of ninety-day grace period in which the President said he wouldn't raise tariffs. And they're-- in theory, they're supposed to negotiate during that period. But I've heard that within the White House, people like Peter Navarro are still very much entrenched in their view and that they-- they're hoping to ride out the ninety days and keep the tariffs on. So, I think that will lead to more unsteady movement in the markets and also I think the shutdown that we talked about earlier will also shake up the markets, and I think that the Republicans have to be thinking about that.
Marty Balin AP Folk musician Marty Balin (January 30, 1942-September 27, 2018), pictured far left, both founded the San Francisco rock band Jefferson Airplane and co-owned the Matrix, the Bay Area club where the group performed as house band and which served as a stage for such local artists as the Grateful Dead and Janis Joplin. Their San Francisco sound was a psychedelic blend of blues, folk, rock and jazz. Balin's yearning tenor could be heard on the songs Today, It's No Secret, and Volunteers. Excerpt: Volunteers by Jefferson Airplane I remember it was really pretty and beautiful for a year or two, Balin told Relix magazine in 1993. And then Time magazine came out and they were interviewing me. I told the guy, 'It's great that you're publicizing this beautiful-feeling scene out here,' and he looked me right in the eye and said, 'Fastest way to kill it.' The Airplane would break up, in part owing to Balin's acknowledged jealousy of Grace Slick, who'd joined the group in the fall of 1966, soon before their second album, Surrealistic Pillow. (Slick displaced Balin as lead singer on the Airplane's best-known songs, Somebody to Love and White Rabbit.) Excerpt: Somebody to Love by Jefferson Airplane In the mid-1970s, members regrouped as Jefferson Starship, and Balin sang lead on such hits as Miracles (which he co-wrote), With Your Love and Count On Me.
Donald Trump's new campaign manager Kellyanne Conway on Sunday reversed her position that the GOP presidential nominee should release his tax returns while under audit.
Earlier in the day, President Obama used a news conference at the White House to accuse House Republicans of forcing an ideologically-driven shutdown.
The new restrictions do not apply to green card holders -- or legal permanent residents -- from the seven countries covered by the order, a senior administration official said.
NASA says melting Arctic ice is the new normal
I thought we saw enough of it in last week's debate, but I this is supposed to be a debate based on fact and truth, Harris said. The truth of the matter is Joe Biden has been clear. He will not raise taxes on anyone who makes less than $400,000.
The latest federal jobs report showed their average weekly earnings have risen 2.7 percent annually since 2009 - much faster than the national average for non-management employees. Their weekly earnings jumped to $1,021 in December, compared with a weekly income of $858 seven years ago.

Arguments scheduled for the month of October will follow the same format used for telephonic arguments held in May, in which the typical free-for-all of questioning was replaced by the justices pressing attorneys one by one in order of seniority. Chief Justice John Roberts will kick off questioning, followed by Justices Clarence Thomas and Ruth Bader Ginsburg, and ending with Justice Brett Kavanaugh, the court's newest member.
A three-judge panel ruled Tuesday that the New York Democratic presidential primary may proceed as planned on June 23rd. CBS News campaign reporter Nicole Sganga says the decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit follows New York State's appeal of a federal judge's order last month that required New York State hold its election, returning all qualified candidates – including Senator Bernie Sanders – to the ballot. We have reviewed all of the remaining arguments raised by Defendants on appeal and find them to be without merit, judges wrote in a joint decision, Tuesday. New York State Board of Elections co-chair Douglas Kellner confirmed another appeal would not be filed following the opinion.
But others, such as Vicki Burch, who is running for local office in Tippecanoe County, said she plans on voting for Braun in the Senate race. Burch stated she likes that Braun is running as an outsider.

The number of people employed by the coal industry has ticked up ever so slightly under Mr. Trump — from roughly 50,800 in January 2017 to roughly 52,600 in January 2019 according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
If you look at the judges President Trump's put on the bench, it's going to go down in history as a monumental achievement of his presidency, he said.
Some people were paying more for premiums than for rent, so people couldn't afford it. Some people lost access, DeSantis said. Andrew supports a single-payer plan which will force people off Medicare, force people off their employer plans and put them on a government-run single-payer plan that is wrong.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Clearly the White House is going to have to weigh in, and the White House acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney was on other television programs this morning saying he can promise no one will be left without health care if Obamacare is struck down. But as you've just said there is no plan yet. So how can you promise that- like a state like yours where it has the most people reliant on Obamacare of any state- how can you promise them they won't be left hanging?
MARGARET BRENNAN: Stick around. We'll be right back with more analysis of the week that was and the one that's about to begin.
The initiative will be led by a newly appointed White House adviser to the group and will be supported by various faith leaders from outside the federal government. The order also aims to ensure faith based organizations have equal access to government funding and equal right to exercise their deeply held beliefs.
12:34 p.m. ET Trump's campaign releases a statement from Meredith McIver, who the Trump campaign identified as an in-house staff writer from the Trump Organization.
Today's list of contenders featured three current Republican U.S. senators -- Tom Cotton of Arkansas, Ted Cruz of Texas and Josh Hawley of Missouri. Former Solicitor General Noel Francisco, who defended the Trump administration before the Supreme Court also made the cut, along with Judge Amy Coney Barrett of the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals and Judge Thomas Hardiman of the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals - both previously considered to replace Justice Anthony Kennedy following his 2018 retirement.
Another inducement is aimed at people who have lost jobs. Those who collect unemployment this year, if even for one week, would qualify for the most generous ACA tax credits as well as its biggest reductions in copays and deductibles.
At the same time, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio is giving himself to October.
In New York, a new ad is up in the state's 15th congressional district primary in support of Democratic candidate and City Council Member Ritchie Torres. The ad, funded by a $300,000 independent expenditure by the Voter Protection Project PAC, attacks Torres' Democratic opponent Ruben Diaz Sr. for his previous pro-Trump comments and friendly relationship with the president. Diaz Senior supports the dangerous Trump agenda that hurts South Bronx families, the ad says. VPP President Matt Lieberman told CBS News political unit broadcast associate Aaron Navarro the group was drawn to Torres' record on voting rights as a city council member, and said he has the best chance of defeating Diaz Sr. to be the nominee in the safe-Democratic district. A possibility that a so-called Democrat who's friends with the president could end up representing this district, when we have a far better alternative...we see a responsibility to step up, he said. Diaz Sr. was recently endorsed by the New York Police Department's Union, and trails Torres by over $800,000 in terms of cash on hand. Ten Democratic candidates are facing off in this June 23 primary, which has switched to an all-mail format.
Attorney General William Barr joined CBS News senior investigative correspondent Catherine Herridge to discuss the reasoning behind the motion.
FACT CHECK: Partly true. Clinton did represent a man accused of raping a 12-year-old girl. The charges against the man were ultimately reduced in a plea agreement. There is an audio record (so she is not seen) of Clinton laughing in a conversation about the case, though she was laughing not at the girl, but at another aspect of the case.
BIDEN: We have to restore the integrity of this country internationally. We have to get off of this God awful effort on this president's part to divide the country. We have to bring the middle class back. We have to have a health care policy that makes sense, that is doable, which I can do by- and by building on Obamacare. And we have to have an immigration policy that, in fact, is rational and reasonable and represents who we are. They are all the reasons why I'm running, among others. But look, the next president of the United States also is gonna have to stand on the stage on day one and lead the world. They're going to have to be able to know what they're doing internationally. And the other leaders are gonna have to know who that person is and know that person knows them. And I'm the best qualified person by a long shot of anybody running to do that. That's why I'm running.
Just because this deal was signed does not mean the future is written in stone. We do have a chance still to change the trajectory. And that is what the budget will show tomorrow, he said.

The White House has said his proposal to provide a pathway to citizenship to immigrants brought to the U.S. illegally as children by their parents amounts to 1.8 million. If that figure is correct -- and it's virtually impossible to say if it is -- then Mr. Trump's claim is true.
No, you know, I don't have a view on that. I don't know about how close they were physically or what the medical advice is the president gets. But we're tested pretty regularly when we're over at the White House to visit.
Democrats are happy to be discussing health care, two days after Attorney General William Barr dealt a blow to the president's opponents by revealing that the special counsel investigation found no instance of collusion with Russia during the 2016 election. The Justice Department also determined that the president had not obstructed justice, though Mueller did not reach a conclusion in the matter. The Trump administration's newly stated policy on Obamacare allows Democrats to pivot to talking about an issue with which they stand on firmer ground.
Lamb ran as a moderate on guns and an opponent of Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi, saying that he wouldn't vote for her for speaker. Fair enough. But he also embraced Obamacare, said that congressional Republicans would go after entitlements, and argued that the GOP tax cut was a giveaway to the rich. He ran, in other words, as a liberal, if in some respects an old-school one.
SEN. SANDERS: We are going to do that within the next couple--
Elizabeth Warren in her presidential campaign called for the elimination of the Senate's 60-vote filibuster rule, which would lower the bar to pass legislation to a simple majority of 51 votes. And Pete Buttigieg detailed a whole plan to shake up the Supreme Court by adding more justices in an effort to depoliticize the court.
The interview was one of several media appearances scheduled for Romney this week. In an interview with the John Fredericks Morning Show in Virginia, scheduled to air on Tuesday, Romney called Obama's proposal to renew the Bush-era tax cuts for income-earners under $250,000 a massive tax increase on job creators and on small business.
9:08 p.m. President Trump is entering the House chamber and shaking hands with lawmakers standing in the aisle. A number of GOP lawmakers are shaking Mr. Trump's hand and greeting him as he makes his way to the front of the chamber.
MARGARET BRENNAN: --a plan that- what if they won't have a plan at all if Obamacare is struck down? Can you promise them that won't be the case?
MARGARET BRENNAN: And the Mueller report, we now have at least a four-page summary of what's in it. This has become even a fund-raising mechanism for the Trump campaign. They're raising money off of T-shirts with Adam Schiff, the House Intelligence Committee chairman, on them, sort of mocking him and saying all of this is a conspiracy against the President. What-- what does this all add up to? Does this continue as a storyline until we get the four hundred pages in mid-April?

The website also weighs in on impeachment, which is weighing over the White House this holiday season after Mr. Trump became only the third U.S. president to be impeached. It reiterates the president's claim that there was no quid pro quo with Ukraine.
Although Mr. Obama finally brought 9/11 mastermind Osama bin Laden to justice, he soon faced the lowest low of his presidency: the Sandy Hook elementary school shooting, in Newtown, Conn., which left 20 children and six educators dead.
The National Republican Congressional Committee has previously called Eastman Comrade Kara in anticipation that she would be the nominee again. Eastman is backed by the Justice Democrats progressive group, who is now going 2-2 this year on their backed House candidates, with losses in Texas and Ohio primaries and wins with Eastman and Marie Newman in Illinois' 3rd. Both were previous candidates in the 2018 primaries.

MARGARET BRENNAN: And merry Christmas to you. This federal judge and the decision to strike down Obamacare as unconstitutional. This could put at risk about 20 million Americans who rely on it for coverage including Medicare and Medicaid. That number's from the Kaiser Family Foundation. What is your reaction and how do you reassure those Americans that they're okay?
No other Democratic presidential candidates were mentioned by voters as their current top choice but these hot days of fair political pageantry is only an early snapshot of who voters may ultimately support.
As long as we are proud of who we are and what we are fighting for, there is nothing we cannot achieve. As long as we have confidence in our values, faith in our citizens, and trust in our God, we will never fail.

Dr. Jill Biden also made a foray into her first virtual campaign stops today, Erickson and political unit intern Blythe Edwards report. Dr. Biden first huddled online with Senator Debbie Stabenow and Michigan nurses and then with Representative Brenda Lawrence and the Michigan Democratic Party Black Caucus. Dr. Biden declared that she was angry how COVID-19 has disproportionately killed black Americans. Citing the lack of clinics in certain African-American communities, the struggle to pay for food, and the technological gap for some students to e-learn without the adequate resources, Dr. Biden said, We are seeing that these biases, these injustices…they are deadly. It should make us all angry.
Donald Trump: I would tell them don't be afraid, absolutely.
Lindsey Graham coming around to Donald Trump?
She complains that Donald Trump took advantage of the tax code. Well, why didn't she change it? Why didn't you change it when you were a senator? The reason you didn't is that all your friends take the same advantage that I do. And I do. You have provisions in the tax code that, frankly, we could change. But you wouldn't change it, because all of these people gave you the money so you can take negative ads on Donald Trump.
BIDEN: What's happening is you have Steyer spending hundreds of millions, tens of thousands of dollars, millions of dollars, out campaigning there. And so I think a lot is happening in terms of the amount of money being spent by the billionaires to try to cut into the African-American vote. I think that has a lot to do with it.
Democrats' takeover of the House ended two years of full GOP control in Washington, during which — theoretically speaking — President Trump had full rein to implement his conservative agenda. But as Mr. Trump learned the hard way with Republicans' failure to fully repeal Obamacare, and his inability to secure anywhere near sufficient funding for a border wall, even full Republican control of both chambers of Congress and the White House isn't always enough.
MILLER: As the president- as the president has made very clear, the new Democrat House, affords us the opportunity as a country to craft real bipartisan solutions on all the issues I just mentioned and many more.

In Wisconsin, incumbent Governor Scott Walker is running for a third term. He is the only governor to survive a recall election. The Democratic field is crowded with eight contenders vying for the Democratic nomination. In a recent debate in mid-July, eight Democratic candidates mostly agreed on policy issues and all but one vowed to support the Democratic nominee. The eight Democratic candidates who participated in the debate were: activist Mike McCabe, attorney Matt Flynn, State Superintendent of Public Instruction Tony Evers, former state Rep. Kelda Roys, Madison Mayor Paul Soglin, fire fighter Mahlon Mitchell, State Sen. Kathleen Vinehout and attorney Josh Pade.
If we want to save the country, then we need a mandate from the people. And if we want a mandate, then we need to offer ideas. And if we want to offer ideas, then we need to actually have ideas, Ryan said.
After the decision, a LaRose spokesperson said the secretary's directive to limit Ohio's county boards of elections to one ballot drop box per county will remain in place, reports CBS News campaign reporter Jack Turman. Maggie Sheehan, LaRose's spokeswoman, said in a statement that Ohioans deserve a full and immediate review of the ruling by the appellate courts.
But states were not required to adopt Common Core standards -- it's optional. Presently, 41 states and the District of Columbia have adopted the standards. States that have not adopted the standards include Alaska, Nebraska, Texas, Virginia and Puerto Rico.
And Trump's move to a free-market loan system won't help any students, either, although banks probably wouldn't mind having that business back. The student loan origination business was mostly shifted to the Department of Education in 2010, saving taxpayers some $10 billion in bank loan subsidies.
Ginsburg is an enormously popular figure in the Democratic Party, a truth that has been evident throughout the Democratic primary process — her portrait is frequently seen beaming on colorful t-shirts and tote bags. Some suggest that by tying his campaign to protecting her legacy, Biden would also highlight his previous pledge to nominate the first black woman justice if he is elected.
Incumbent Sen. Dean Heller is looking to win reelection in a state that Hillary Clinton won in 2016 and President Obama won twice before that. Plus, he's facing a challenge from perennial conservative candidate Danny Tarkanian, who has never been elected to office but has won four of the five primaries he's competed in.
Jonathan Gold Dan Steinberg/Invision/AP Images Jonathan Gold (July 28, 1960-July 21, 2018) was a classically-trained musician who played cello in punk bands. But his real talent was as a writer, and for four decades he covered the culinary landscape of Los Angeles, shifting the popular focus from Michelin-starred restaurants to the street food, diners, ethnic eateries and taco trucks that define the city's cuisine. His L.A. Times column Counter Intelligence, begun in 1986, helped introduce Angelenos to the lesser-known and tastier corners to be found in immigrant enclaves across the L.A. area. In 2007, he became the first (and to date only) food critic to receive the Pulitzer Prize for criticism. The judges noted Gold's zestful writing that expressed the delight of an erudite eater. In an interview earlier this year Gold said, I love going out to eat in the way a theater critic loves theater. I love going to farmers markets. I love sticking my hands in pots. And it turns out food is a pretty good prism through which to view humanity.

This prompted Ross Eisenbrey, vice president of the Economic Policy Institute, to opine: Puzder's violation of immigration laws make him a strange choice to be a cabinet officer in Donald Trump's administration, given the president's near-hysteria over illegal workers in the U.S.
In Mr. Trump's two previous campaign-style rallies since inauguration, which are put on by his 2020 election committee, Trump barely mentioned health care. This time, his 40-minute remarks more fully explored the subject. But Mr. Trump - and the capacity crowd in the arena - appeared more animated when he talked about other matters.
Ivanka Trump: I don't think it matters. This is so much more important. And more serious. And-- so th-- I-- I-- you know, that's the focus.
This fall, there are 10 incumbent Democratic senators up for re-election in states that Donald Trump won in 2016. In North Dakota, incumbent Democratic Senator Heidi Heitkamp is fighting to be re-elected in one of the most Trump-friendly states. Mr. Trump won North Dakota by 36 points in 2016, and his approval rating in the state is north of 50 percent, according to Gallup polling conducted earlier this year. A May 2018 CBS News poll found that Mr. Trump's national approval rating is 40 percent.
Twitter on Tuesday added new fact-check notices to Mr. Trump's tweets on mail-in voting. The president suggested Tuesday morning that mail-in ballots lead to voter fraud in multiple posts online, though he provided no evidence. Mail boxes will be robbed, ballots will be forged & even illegally printed out & fraudulently signed. The Governor of California is sending ballots to millions of people, anyone....living in the state, no matter who they are or how they got there, will get one, the president tweeted in part. Twitter inserted notices beneath each post reading, Get the facts about mail-in ballots. Notices linked to a series of fact checking items with the headline Trump makes unsubstantiated claim that mail-in ballots will lead to voter fraud. Twitter's fact check clarified that California would send mail-in ballot only to registered voters. A spokesperson for Twitter confirmed to CBS News this is the first time the company has fact checked Mr. Trump on the platform, though it has been done for other world leaders. In March, Twitter marked one of the president's retweets as manipulated media, after Mr. Trump shared an edited video of his political opponent Biden posted by White House deputy chief of communications Dan Scavino. Trump 2020 campaign manager Brad Parscale called the move a smoke screen. In a statement, Parscale said in part we always knew that Silicon Valley would pull out all the stops to obstruct and interfere with President Trump getting his message through to voters.

I continue to believe Mr. Trump will not be president, Mr. Obama said at a press conference during a summit with Southeast Asian leaders in California. And the reason is that I have a lot of faith in the American people. Being president is a serious job. It's not hosting a talk show, or a reality show.
Tuesday's announcement comes on the heels of another potentially devastating blow to the ACA. Earlier this month the Justice Department announced it would not defend the law against a lawsuit brought by the attorneys general of Texas and 19 other states.

8:02 p.m. ET Arizona's Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio said Thursday that Donald Trump is the only presidential candidate who can prevent illegal immigration, protect the nation's borders and who will protect law enforcement.
For all the sound and fury of Trump and his twitter feed, it has signified very little when it comes to our democratic institutions. Trump haters are right when they argue that he presents an unusual -- even extreme -- test of America's political institutions. Where they are wrong is conflating my team is losing with the system is failing and must be destroyed!

But McCarthy promised that an ACA substitute will be one of the first actions we start working on.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. What do you think is happening?
You know, I'm not gonna, again, get into reaching a conclusion at this point till I see everything. There's certainly more information that has come out that, you know, points in that direction. But I haven't reached a final conclusion.
Lesley Stahl: Do you think that-- that your election is a repudiation of his presidency?
I have a message for all of you: the crime and violence that today afflicts our nation will soon come to an end. Beginning on January 20th 2017, safety will be restored, Trump is expected to say.
But the Republican states and the Trump administration opposed the efforts to expedite review of the 5th Circuit's ruling, writing to the court that the decision creates no present, real-world emergency.
And I will tell you, Hillary Clinton is raising your taxes, folks. You can look at me. She's raising your taxes really high. And what that's going to do is a disaster for the country. But she is raising your taxes and I'm lowering your taxes. That in itself is a big difference. We are going to be thriving again. We have no growth in this country. There's no growth. If China has a GDP of 7 percent, it's like a national catastrophe. We're down at 1 percent. And that's, like, no growth. And we're going lower, in my opinion. And a lot of it has to do with the fact that our taxes are so high, just about the highest in the world. And I'm bringing them down to one of the lower in the world. And I think it's so important — one of the most important things we can do. But she is raising everybody's taxes massively.
Georgia Democratic hopeful Bobby Kaple, seeking the nomination for an Atlanta-area district, says Thank God for Obamacare in his spot showing his two young children, born premature but healthy after expensive medical bills.
MAYOR FRANCIS SUAREZ: Sure, yeah. I've-- I've tried to reach him on multiple occasion to tell him to give us the opportunity, not just here at the city, but in the county, to be able to institute things that we think are common sense, that we think are backed up by science and we can demonstrate are backed up by science. I have a chart that shows demonstrably that masks in public work. Thankfully, a lot of our residents are doing it regardless. I think they're, obviously, concerned about their own health. And, certainly, we've been hammering home the point in PSAs, you know, throughout, you know, the last few months. And I think that's one of the main reasons why our hospitalizations remain low. So I'm very thankful that our residents are listening, despite the fact that it's something that we can't mandate.
This is a story about my mom, but it could be about anyone's mom, Slotkin says in the ad, while looking at pictures of her mother at their family farm. She had survived breast cancer when I was very young, but her pre-existing condition hung over all of us when we lived here at the farm.

After Verma said it's premature to draw conclusions about work requirements, Kennedy noted that roughly 18,000 people lost health coverage in both Arkansas and New Hampshire, two of the states where the policy was enacted. How many more people have to lose their health care before you can make a determination? asked Kennedy.
9:45 p.m. From now on, we expect trading relationships to be fair and to be reciprocal, he said. We will work to fix bad trade deals and negotiate new ones. And we will protect American workers and American intellectual property, through strong enforcement of our trade rules.
According to Howard Silverblatt, a senior analyst for Standard & Poor's, who is known for his in-depth market data, the market value added between Election Day and the market close on Friday, Jan. 26 is $7.18 trillion. But that wealth won't affect nearly half of Americans who aren't invested in the stock market. A 2016 Federal Reserve report found that only 52 percent of Americans were invested in retirement accounts.
Americans love their country. And they deserve a government that shows them the same love and loyalty in return.
The strategy outlined in the state party memo also includes hiring four digital field representatives across the state, buying domain names of Democratic candidates to redirect people to negative hits, and rapid response to be deployed when national Democratic candidates come to Texas. It also says a goal is to showcase diversity within Republican candidates through video releases on social media.
If Mitt Romney does not arrive in Tampa with the requisite number of delegates, I suspect there will be an initial vote and if he were to fail that vote I don't think there'd be a lot of support for him on the second or subsequent votes, and therefore it would be a race between Newt Gingrich, Rick Santorum and Ron Paul, said Tyler. And in that situation I can imagine that a Newt Gingrich could emerge.

Pennsylvania's voters had to sign up to vote by mail by Tuesday in the state's June 2 primary. Vote-by-mail was the first item displayed on the state Republican Party's website, where an image of Mr. Trump looms behind the link to the ballot request form. The headline reads, Vote by Mail. Safe from Home. The vote-by-mail page itself touts the mail-in option for all registered voters and includes a message explaining why it's safe. And even while the Trump campaign has accused Democrats of trying to steal the election, it has promoted the absentee voting option ahead of the keystone state's primary.
Lesley Stahl: So part wall, part fence?
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I have a very good relationship with him. I had lunch with him two days ago. I have a very good relationship with him. It could be that he is. I think he's sort of a Democrat if you want to know the truth. But General Mattis is a good guy. We get along very well. He may leave. I mean, at some point, everybody leaves. Everybody. People leave. That's Washington.
I want to assure you my office will perform our work to the highest standards to promote transparency of this vital stimulus program and make recommendations for corrective action to ensure the funds are used efficiently, effectively and in accordance with the law, SBA Inspector General Hannibal Mike Ware wrote in a letter to Warren and Representative Nydia Velazquez.
Anonymous donors have pooled together $8 million to pay off college loans for up to 400 students who overcame personal hardships – from homelessness and extreme poverty – to become first-generation college students. The donors are longtime supporters of the Bay Area nonprofit Students Rising Above (SRA), and the money is intended to eliminate student debt for the graduates of the scholarship program. These donors are also passionate about tackling the issue of student debt. On a recent Zoom call, SRA CEO Elizabeth Devaney shared the news with the program's alumni and read a short letter from the donors. People lent us a hand and now, we are able to extend a hand to these young people. Not to change who they are but to reveal who they are, the letter reads. We believe it is important to leave the world a better place than we came into it. To that end, we have decided to pay off all student loans for the 400 Rising Star alumni to date. CBS News campaign reporter Musadiq Bidar says he is one of the 400 alumni benefiting from this generosity. Click here to read more about his story and the impact this news will have on other alumni of the scholarship program.
President Donald Trump: Because we've done a great job and it's not finished yet. And when I finish, this country will be in a position like it hasn't been maybe ever. The economy is already roaring back. And-- other people aren't gonna bring it back, certainly the person that we're dealing with is not gonna bring it back. They're gonna raise taxes.
SEN. KLOBUCHAR: That is correct. Yes.
MARGARET BRENNAN: There are new mandates requiring mask wearing when traveling, new efforts to bring order to vaccine distribution, and a third successful immunization is pending FDA approval.
So John McCain's voice is stilled, but how he lived his life will always speak volumes about service to our country, our obligation to others and most of all about having the courage — no matter the consequences — to stand up for what we believe is right.
In what would be a troubling sign for Republicans ahead of next year's elections, Democrats have a shot at seizing the governor's mansions in two Southern states President Trump won handily in 2016.
His latest volley – a racist video of a convicted cop killer who happens to be an undocumented immigrant – makes it clear where he's driving the discussion in these final days of the campaign.
CLINTON: Five million homes were lost.
I think it's been hard for Mitt Romney to close the deal because he has had such an inconsistent record compared to what he's saying today, Tyler said. I don't know that I want to say he's a phony, but I don't understand how, why he could be so inconsistent.
According to a CBS News tally of the whole debate, Pence interrupted Harris twice as many times — Pence interrupted Harris 10 times, while Harris interrupted Pence five times. Pence spoke 38 minutes to Harris' 35 minutes.
He'll enforce immigration laws to keep us safe, while allowing legal immigrants to bless this nation with their talents and their dreams. He'll take control of our borders, because we must stop the flow of cocaine and heroin coming into our country and killing our kids, she said.
The Senate bill would also reduce the federal deficit over the next 10 years by $321 billion. The largest savings would stem from Medicaid cuts, with spending on it dropping by more than a quarter in 2026.
SCOTT GOTTLIEB: I think we have the potential to turn a corner. Things are clearly improving around the country. We can't take our foot off the brake too quickly in terms of the things that people are doing, like wearing masks and being more vigilant. That's really probably what's bringing down infection rates across the country right now. The new variants create a lot of risk. I think that the risk is that what you're going to see over the summertime is whereas the summer should have been very quiet, coronavirus should have really dissipated in part because of the seasonal backstop, in part because we've infected a third of the population and in part because we're immunizing more people. So coronavirus levels should have really come down this summer. You might see higher prevalence than what you would have expected. But what's going to likely happen is that the prevalence is going to be high in certain regional hotspots. So we'll have hotspots of infection and maybe epidemics in parts of Florida, parts of Southern California, because of B117. They'll never really get out of it, but the rest of the country will see prevalence come down. Now, the risk is to the fall when, you know, these new variants are going to want to surge, B117, B1351, P1. Now, with respect to the South African and the Brazilian variants, they don't appear right now to be more fit, meaning that they're more transmissible. So, they may not spread as readily.
ED WONG: I don't-- we haven't sensed any motivation on the part of the White House to really push forward with changes or with pressing Saudi Arabia or any of its policies. So, I do think that this is an authentic rebuke by Congress against the President.
Eddie Edwards, a black conservative former law enforcement official, withdrew his nomination in a letter Tuesday, citing Volinsky's role as an executive councilor in the state to control over a majority of councilors and delay his confirmation hearing. Volinsky has opposed Edwards' nomination in the past, calling him unqualified. Earlier in June, Volinsky also had to apologize for using the term tokenism in a debate with Sununu about a nominee for the state Board of Education. On Facebook, Black Lives Matter Manchester wrote, Andru Volinsky's microaggressive comments have no place in politics. We strongly disavow his statements claiming that a black man had no experience or expertise in earning his position for the office of professional licensure and certification.
MARGARET BRENNAN: We want to go now to Connecticut. Governor Ned Lamont joins us from Stamford good morning to you.
The rule dates back to 1984, under President Ronald Reagan, but has been revoked and reinstated by Democratic and Republican administrations, respectively. Former Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama rescinded the policy, while Mr. Trump re-enacted and expanded it.
PAUL RYAN: Well, they're certainly not helping us keep the government open. They're certainly not helping us getting to a solution in immigration. When you shutdown the government you-- and stop negotiation on immigration reform, they're complicit with not getting things done.
There were parts of the GOP that we have to look at and be honest about what it was, Wilson told Stahl. We didn't, as a broad party, look at the people in parts of the base in the South and parts of the Midwest who were not motivated by free markets or limited government or individual liberty. They were motivated by racial animus. There is a part of it's out there. And we have to look at it honestly.
President George H.W. Bush George Bush Presidential Library and Museum In his Inaugural Address in 1989 he said, We live in a peaceful, prosperous time, but we can make it better. For a new breeze is blowing, and a world refreshed by freedom seems reborn. It was partially a prescient statement: President George H.W. Bush (June 12, 1924-November 30, 2018) would soon watch as the Berlin Wall crumbled and the Soviet Union dissolved, ending a decades-long Cold War. But he also spearheaded an international military strike against Saddam Hussein after the Iraqi dictator invaded neighboring Kuwait. Born in 1924, the second-oldest son of investment banker and future Connecticut Senator Prescott Bush, he served as the Navy's youngest pilot during World War II, and was shot down in the Pacific over the island of Chichi Jima. After marrying Barbara Pierce, he became an oil man in Texas before entering politics. A Congressman, RNC Chairman, United Nations Ambassador, Envoy to China and CIA Director, Bush would become Vice President under Ronald Reagan before succeeding him in office. [He would also become only the second U.S. president to see his own son become a president himself.] Following the Gulf War, in 1991, President Bush's approval rating was nearly 90%. And yet, the following year he lost his re-election bid to Bill Clinton, owing to his having broken his 1988 campaign mantra: Read my lips: no new taxes.
For example, the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation recently estimated that tax credits for health insurance in the House GOP plan would be smaller on average than what currently subsidized ACA customers are getting. (GOP credits are based on age, not income.)
Currently, around 15 million people are uninsured in the country, roughly a quarter of which qualify for subsidies to help pay for health care under the ACA.
We are all Americans, he said. We all have the same rights!
Price dodged the question, saying he believed the fulfillment of those promises should be measured in whether patient care has suffered -- not measured in the dollars funding the programs.
CLINTON STATEMENT: His plan will give the wealthy and corporations the biggest tax cuts they've ever had. More than the Bush tax cuts by at least a factor of two. Donald takes care of Donald, and people like Donald, and this would be a massive gift.
The Democratic National Committee, as CBS News reported, is counter-programming Mr. Trumps' reelection launch with the message claiming Mr. Trump has broken his key campaign promises.
Already, some signs show that Obamacare's costs are greater than expected. UnitedHealth Group, the country's biggest health insurer, said last year it was considering pulling out of the ACA because it was losing money on the plans.
SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: And if the pharmaceutical industry--
Well, as many people point out, you know, it's not unusual. In the course of a bona fide investigation, when you're doing a criminal investigation or a counterintelligence investigation, that has a basis it's not unusual to have an interview with someone and expecting that they might lie. But here's what's different here is that there was no underlying investigation that was legitimate. And the whole exercise was just about creating the lie.
Are we going to send our American forces all over the world to make sure that stops?
The recent surge in the deficit has followed passage of the 2017 Trump tax bill, which has failed to pay for itself with additional economic growth and revenues as promised by administration figures like Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. The surge in deficits also follows a final rewrite last summer of a failed 2011 budget deal to increase spending of both defense and domestic programs.
After months of virtual campaigning due to the coronavirus, in-person activity is slowly starting to creep back up depending on where states are with reopening, reports CBS News political unit associate producer Sarah Ewall-Wice. On Thursday, the Progressive Turnout Project, whose mission is to get Democrats to the polls, announced it will begin door-to-door canvassing in some metro areas Saturday. The PAC, which is investing more than $52 million this election cycle, will have upcoming activity in Georgia, Iowa, Kansas, Maine, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Wisconsin and Colorado.

In a new emotional appeal to Iowa caucus voters, former Vice President Joe Biden is putting the fight for access to adequate health care at the top of his to do list, telling supporters that safeguarding the Obama-era Affordable Care Act is personal to me.
His very first case, he started asking lots and lots of questions. And even some of the justices that have been there for years, they looked and said, we are not going to let this new guys ask all the questions, he said.
Well, I said we're gonna get to the bottom of what happened.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Which is what Senator Scott was also saying, even though the President says he's-- he and Senator Barrasso and others are going to have to come up with a solution.
Vice President Mike Pence: Lesley, we gotta get our kids back in school. And I would say to that mother, or any mother, that we're gonna continue to work our hearts out to make sure that those schools have the testing, have the PPE, have the supplies they need to get our kids back where they belong, safe and sound, in the classroom.
He will be the best president, Mrs. Trump told South Carolina supporters.
The President must change course and allow open enrollment in the Affordable Care Act, as even Republican governors have called on him to do, Biden said in a statement on Thursday.
It's only getting worse. In '17, it implodes by itself. Their method of fixing it is to go back and ask Congress for more money, more and more money. We have right now almost $20 trillion in debt.
Donald Trump: Well, I actually sat down with Melania and my whole family and we talked about it. Don, Ivanka, Eric, Tiffany. Barron to a lesser extent, but Barron too. Um, because in a way he's affected every bit as much. Maybe more.
They aren't going to be the only two people on the debate stage, a senior campaign advisor told reporters. The way we approach the debate is to use the opportunity to talk directly to the audience at home...We don't hear from voters that we are looking for someone at some point on the ideological spectrum.
JOHN DICKERSON: Let me ask you about the moral question here. The President has recently secured the release of Andrew Brunson from Turkey so working on the one hand on that account. But in this account, he said, basically, because there's a hundred and ten billion as he claims arms purchases on-- on order from Saudi Arabia that-- you know that's-- that's, essentially, more important or has to be weighed here in the response. Give me your sense of-- of your reaction to that that moral position the President took?
Here tonight are two fathers and two mothers: Evelyn Rodriguez, Freddy Cuevas, Elizabeth Alvarado, and Robert Mickens. Their two teenage daughters -- Kayla Cuevas and Nisa Mickens -- were close friends on Long Island. But in September 2016, on the eve of Nisa's 16th Birthday -- such a happy time it should have been -- neither of them came home. These two precious girls were brutally murdered while walking together in their hometown.
Mr. Biden's order would directly affect HealthCare.gov, the federal insurance marketplace currently serving 36 states. The marketplace concluded a successful annual sign-up season in December, with enrollment for 2021 growing by about 7%. Final numbers for this year that include insurance markets directly run by the states will be available soon.

Diane Hendricks. Chairwoman of ABC Supply Co., which distributes building products. A top financial contributor to Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, the billionaire was tabbed by Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus to the leadership team of a key fundraising committee to support Trump.
Trump would repeal the ACA and has no plan that would allow pre-age-65 retirees to purchase much-needed medical insurance. This is a crucial difference from Clinton. He would also allow individuals to deduct the cost of health insurance premiums, but this feature isn't worth much if you can't buy coverage at any cost due to preexisting conditions. And he would encourage the use of health savings accounts (HSAs), but this would do little to pay for potential catastrophic medical conditions.
I helped elect Rudy Giuliani, he said. And he's gone off the rails, and not in a racial sense, but he's gone off the rails completely as this, you know, sort of conspirator in chief with Trump. It's sad.
Think about it: You can't buy life insurance if you wait until you get a diagnosis of a terminal illness. You can't buy flood insurance when the forecast calls for a hurricane. And you can't buy health insurance only when you get sick or suffer an accident and think you'll need to make a claim.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Why does Joe Biden want to be President? What is the-- the key thing that's driving you that you want to achieve if you're elected?
LANHEE CHEN: Which is not unusual. And that may be true. But I think the-- what we really could benefit from here is some clarity--
Recent events in Washington have made many Americans say they are more likely to speak up about politics (53 percent), with more Democrats (68 percent) than Republicans (51 percent) saying this.

Branden Camp/AP Who gets invited to the first lady's box for the State of the Union address has helped highlight the president's agenda ever since President Ronald Reagan invited federal employee Lenny Skutnick, the hero of Flight 90 which crashed in the Potomac River in 1982, to attend his address. This year's guest list is no exception -- bringing a spotlight to key achievements such as Obamacare and gay marriage rights while promoting the need for criminal justice reform, helping veterans and improving family leave among other goals. Meet the special guests of Michelle Obama. Major Lisa Jaster is an engineer and graduate of West Point. She deployed in both Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom. Jaster left active duty in 2007, but joined the U.S. Army Reserve in 2012 and then took a leave of absence from Shell Oil to attend Ranger School after ban on women in combat was lifted.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator, thank you very much. We'll be back in one minute with a lot more FACE THE NATION. Don't go away.
While the Government Accountability Office stopped short of alleging widespread cheating in President Barack Obama's signature program, investigators found that the administration has struggled to resolve eligibility questions affecting millions of initial applications and hundreds of thousands of consumers who were actually approved for benefits.
Collins, the first House member to endorse Mr. Trump during the 2016 campaign, said that while the original CBO score showed it would reduce premiums and save money, he doubted its prediction about 24 million people losing their coverage.
Tonight, I am calling on Congress to finally close the deadly loopholes that have allowed MS-13, and other criminal gangs, to break into our country. We have proposed new legislation that will fix our immigration laws and support our ICE and Border Patrol agents -- these are great people; these are great, great people -- that work so hard in the midst of such danger so that this can never happen again.
TRUMP STATEMENT: I was against the war in Iraq, Trump said, as he did in the first debate with Clinton. It has not been debunked.
A divided American electorate, already shattering voting records for midterm elections, will decide control of the U.S. House of Representatives and the Senate on Tuesday. That's making investors more jittery than usual ahead of the final vote counts.
Gillian Lynne Martha Swope/New York Public Library, Billy Rose Theatre Division Dancer and choreographer Dame Gillian Lynne (February 20, 1926-July 1, 2018) had stopped taking piano lessons when she was a girl because a mean piano teacher smacked her for playing poorly. But her school believed the fidgety girl had a learning disorder because she couldn't stay still. Her mother took her to a specialist, who observed Gillian react to his turning on a radio. I leaped up. I leaped on his desk, I leaped off his desk. I danced all around the room. I had the most fabulous time, she recounted to writer Ken Robinson and NPR. And he said – I really owe my whole career, in a way, and I suppose my life to this man – 'There is nothing wrong with your child. She's a born dancer. Take her to a dance school.' Lynne's career began as a leading soloist with Sadler's Wells Ballet in 1944, and continued for decades as she moved into directing and choreography, on such London and New York productions as The Roar of the Greasepaint, the Smell of the Crowd, How Now, Dow Jones, Aspects of Love and Chitty Chitty Bang Bang. She collaborated with composer Andrew Lloyd Webber on his most famous works, the phenomenally successful Cats (top left, instructing dancers during rehearsal), and Phantom of the Opera.

In January 2018, former Democratic Senator Al Franken resigned amid sexual misconduct allegations. On Tuesday, Minnesotans will choose who will compete in a fall special election to complete the remainder of Franken's Senate term through 2020. Depending on Tuesday's results, this could shape up to be a race between two female candidates -- incumbent Democratic Senator Tina Smith, who Gov. Mark Dayton appointed to fill Franken's seat after he resigned, and Republican State Senator Karin Housley.
COOPER: Secretary Clinton, you have two minutes. The question was, what specific tax provisions will you change to ensure the wealthiest Americans pay their fair share of taxes?
In response to a question about economic theory and its role in the financial crisis, Nobel Prize-winning economist Joseph Stiglitz said:

The open-enrollment period doesn't end until Jan. 31, so it's possible an influx of younger people could still boost that percentage, and confusion is still widespread about when to sign up. The Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation found in December that two-thirds of uninsured Americans weren't aware of when open enrollment ends.
Ivanka Trump also spoke about Trump and his organization's treatment of women--undoubtedly an effort to help repair some of the damage he's done among female voters with his inflammatory comments.
Gun rights and open carry advocates in Michigan have sued Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson over her directive last week banning openly carrying firearms at polling places, according to CBS News campaign reporter Adam Brewster.Last Friday, Benson issued an order that said, the open carry of a firearm is prohibited in a polling place, in any hallway used by voters to enter or exit, or within 100 feet of any entrance to a building in which a polling place is located. The directive said concealed carry is not allowed at any building that already prohibits the practice. The lawsuit filed by Michigan Open Carry, Michigan Gun Owners and Michigan Coalition for Responsible Gun Owners claims that Benson's directive makes an unsupported correlation between mere possession of a firearm and voter intimidation; and, is conjured without any legal basis or authorization under Michigan law. Some local law enforcement officials in Michigan have indicated they don't plan to enforce the order. Earlier this week Benson defended the order, telling reporters, This is not a ban on firearms. This is an effort to protect our voters from intimidation, threats and harassment on Election Day itself. Benson said her understanding is Michigan State Police will help enforce the directive where local law enforcement is choosing not to.
RADDATZ: Please tune in on October 19th for the final presidential debate that will take place at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. Good night, everyone.
New York — Stocks sank sharply Monday, with the S&P 500 falling to its lowest level in more than a year and the Dow shedding 508 points amid ongoing concerns about U.S. economic growth. The S&P 500 index is down more than 2 percent in 2018 and has fallen nearly 13 percent since setting a record high in late September.
In a video address to military personnel, Mr. Obama lamented the shutdown saying, unfortunately, Congress has not fulfilled its responsibility. It has failed to pass a budget and, as a result, much of our government must now shut down until Congress funds it again.
She pointed to states that aren't competitive for the presidential race, but have some battleground House races such as California, New York and New Jersey.

And if-- and things that are probably popular with the public. And so if you're going to start defining Medicare for all or even just Medicare expansion, if you're going to start defining free college or any of these programs as socialism, then the other thing that could happen is that voters say, hey, if this is socialism, like, sign me up. Like, if this is what it means to be socialist, then I'll take that bet.
In the 2020 election, it's not really an issue of red and blue anymore – instead it comes down to pink.
Headline speakers include: Melania Trump, retired Lieutenant General Michael Flynn, Iowa Sen. Joni Ernst, Arkansas Sen. Tom Cotton, military veteran Jason Beardsley, and Rep. Ryan Zinke of Montana.
JOE BIDEN: I have not spoken to the intelligence community, but I think the intelligence community should inform the rest of us who are running what they told Senator Sanders.
What was the solution from the Obama/Clinton team? A hashtag campaign! Hillary Clinton, as an apologist for an Al-Qaeda affiliate in Nigeria resulting in the capture of innocent young women. Is she guilty or not guilty? See, she fights for the wrong people, he said, for example.
Lesley Stahl: What kind of a first lady do you think she's going to be?
Becky Taylor: You know, there was one person that reached out that said her father was 94 years old and had a litany of health issues. And she even said He's on borrowed time already. I don't wanna lose him before we're able to get a vaccine.
Arpaio said that Trump will build a border wall, which led to delegates chanting, Build that wall, build that wall!
We had problems that were in the bill that we couldn't solve before it got enacted, he said. It's been around for seven years, so some of the problems have become obvious. Any corporation that would do a massive change like this would make constant adjustments. Because of the paralysis in Congress, we haven't been able to make the adjustments.
Frustration with the president might push sporadic voters who don't typically wade into midterm elections to head to the polls and sway independents and moderates. Early vote numbers indicate turnout is already higher than previous cycles — 40 percent of ballots had already been cast as of Halloween morning. In key states like Georgia, Florida, Nevada, Michigan, and Texas, numbers are up significantly, including among young voters, which could be good news for Democrats like Stacey Abrams and Beto O'Rourke looking for upset victories.
Many health care advocates are applauding the news, but others worry that even this seemingly large increase in funding isn't nearly enough. According to some estimates, opioid abuse costs the country as much as $80 billion a year. What's more, proposed cutbacks in Medicaid funding would potentially adversely affect opioid treatment for low-income people.
Lesley Stahl: People think that you're going to be part of the administration, Ivanka.
According to a study from the Kaiser Family Foundation, if UnitedHealth pulled out of all states, 11 percent of exchange enrollees would have only one insurer choice compared to 2 percent currently. In addition, some experts predict that if Anthem's acquisition of Cigna and the merger between Aetna and Humana go through, it will mean further consolidation in the exchange business and potentially fewer choices for consumers.
Donald Trump: And he-- he couldn't have been more gracious. He said it was an amazing run. One of the most amazing he's ever seen.
I would tell China very nicely...we're going to put a 25 percent tax on all your products coming in, Trump said.
So we're going to get a special prosecutor, and we're going to look into it, because you know what? People have been — their lives have been destroyed for doing one-fifth of what you've done. And it's a disgrace. And honestly, you ought to be ashamed of yourself.
I am supporting Donald Trump because he is a leader. He produces results and is the only candidate for president ready to get tough in order to protect Americans, said Arpaio, who said he has spent 55 years in law enforcement.

If this administration has a star, it just might be Nikki Haley. From her first day on the job as United Nations Ambassador, the 46-year old laid down the law. For those who don't have our back, we're taking names, she said in January 2017.
Ripping the Electoral College out of the Constitution, packing the U.S. Supreme Court and wiping out the party of Lincoln wouldn't have sounded extreme three years ago. No, it would have sounded insane.

When government steps in to try to correct these market failures -- breaking up a monopoly, regulating financial markets, forcing firms to pay the full cost of the pollution they cause, ensuring that product information is accurate and so on -- it's not an attempt to interfere with markets or to serve political interests. It's an attempt to make these markets conform as closely as possible to the conditions required for competitive markets to flourish.
There are some House Republicans who could suffer politically if the shutdown continues -- particularly the 17 who represent districts that Mr. Obama carried in the 2012 election. Six of those congressmen are among the handful of Republicans who've said they'd support Democratic efforts to pass a spending bill without any Obamacare conditions -- they include Reps. Peter King of New York, Michael Grimm of New York, Scott Rigell of Virginia, Jon Runyan of New Jersey, Frank LoBiondo of New Jersey, and Erik Paulsen of Minnesota.
10:10 p.m. Hillary Clinton claims that Donald Trump's rhetoric is helping jihadists recruit new members.

And from his own event a few miles away in Des Moines Iowa, debate no-show Donald Trump greatly exaggerated the U.S. trade deficit with China.
Mr. Biden's expected order was first reported by The Washington Post.
If you started putting that at a normal tax rate ... that brings in a lot of money that I think is better spent on the rest of the people in this country that need help with retirement or need help to take care of a family member, she said.
At that point, the discussion turned back to some of the thornier issues Mr. Trump faces.
STEPHEN MILLER: We could do so much more--
Lesley Stahl: Tell me about the mask wearing.
A new poll from Quinnipiac University on Wednesday finds Republican Senator Susan Collins trailing in Maine, a tied match-up in South Carolina, and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell leading in Kentucky, report CBS News associate producers Sarah Ewall-Wice and Eleanor Watson.
However, the State Department also issued a worldwide safety warning to American citizens in December after Mr. Trump's announcement that the U.S. would recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital. It was the first time such a warning had been issued since the beginning of the Iraq war in 2003.
Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Amy Klobuchar are calling on the Treasury Department and Federal Reserve to prevent large companies receiving bailout funds from eating up smaller businesses crippled by the pandemic.
On the accountability issue alone, though, Trump is in danger of a failing grade. His private Trump University, the object of a class-action and ongoing investigation by the New York State Attorney General's office, was a scam to trick people into thinking they would learn Trump's personal real estate secrets according to New York AG Eric Schneiderman.
The office that monitors the Small Business Administration said it has opened dozens of investigations into fraud in the distribution of loans meant to keep small businesses afloat and paying their employees during the COVID-19 crisis, following requests from Senator Elizabeth Warren and other lawmakers for it to do so.
We had this massive fight that went on for 10 years, said blogger Robert Laszewski, who followed Obamacare for an industry audience. Over the weekend, it's like it's been erased.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION. As the Democratic race moves on to South Carolina, that primary will be held next Saturday. We have a CBS News Battleground Tracker out this morning, and it shows former Vice President Joe Biden on top of the field there with twenty-eight-percent support of likely Democratic primary voters. He is leading, but that's a seventeen-point drop since our last South Carolina poll in November. Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders is not far behind with twenty-three-percent support. Billionaire Tom Steyer who has flooded the local airwaves with ads is at eighteen. Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren is next with twelve percent followed by former South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg at ten, and Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar is at four percent. Former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg is not on the ballot. Anthony Salvanto, here to explain all these numbers. What more can you tell us about how the primary is shaping up?
Struggling communities, especially immigrant communities, will also be helped by immigration policies that focus on the best interests of American Workers and American Families.
They watched John McCain, the Democrats' favorite Republican, attacked as a racist during the 2008 campaign against Barack Obama. They saw Mitt Romney, the world's biggest Boy Scout, berated as a money-grubbing sexist who counted his money as employees' family members died of cancer.
House GOP leaders expressed confidence earlier that the bill would indeed pass.
The big question now is, will this red state stay red, or finally turn blue?
Still, the president needs the support of Congress as he looks towards for major infrastructure funding, border wall funding and other priorities Mr. Trump has placed on his agenda for 2018. Congress and the administration only have weeks to find a legislative solution to the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, and some Democrats and Republicans have already all but deemed the legislative framework the White House presented Thursday as dead on arrival.
MARGARET BRENNAN: If you enjoy FACE THE NATION, we think you'll love our new podcast, a new episode of Facing Forward drops every Friday. And in our latest edition, I spoke with the CEO of Eli Lilly. You can listen and subscribe on Apple podcast or your favorite podcast platform.
TRUMP: She's got tremendous — she's got tremendous hatred. And this country cannot take another four years of Barack Obama, and that's what you're getting with her.
Mr. Trump, who wants to pass a second wave of tax cuts and end birthright citizenship, will find it much harder to accomplish those things legislatively. Democrats can quite easily block the president's desired agenda. Mr. Trump himself admitted the 10 percent tax cuts he wanted for the middle class likely won't happen without Republicans at the helm.
FACT CHECK: Trump is correct that Clinton used a computer program called BleachBit to delete thousands of her emails. But the program can be downloaded online for free and it does not use chemicals. A footnote on an FBI investigation document noted that BleachBit is open source software that allows users to 'shred' files, clear Internet history, delete system and temporary files and wipe free space on a hard drive.
I think the press tries to make you into something a little bit different. In my case, a little bit of a wild man. I'm not. I'm actually not. I'm a very sober person. President-elect Donald Trump
I mean I'm worried about Jeb, it's all negative. How the heck can you sell negative? You know, I want to talk about what I'm for, my vision, my view, my positive, Kasich told the packed pancake house. Bush has often called himself a happy warrior on the campaign trail.
MARGARET BRENNAN: You're in Republican leadership. Senator John Cornyn, your colleague, said there's no plan right now from the White House. Did you hear a plan here today, do you know what the White House is asking you to do?
WASHINGTON—Borrowing a word from Democrats, a new White House report says changes made to the Affordable Care Act under President Trump didn't amount to sabotage.
LANNY DAVIS: This is the top law enforcement officer in our system of government calling somebody who decides to tell the government the truth, a rat. That's the language of a mobster not of the president. But Michael Cohen took ownership and personal responsibility for lying and he's going to jail as a consequence and he authorized me, several times, to say he wouldn't take a pardon from Donald Trump if it was handed to him. So, he now--
The orders are big wins for Gov. Tony Evers and Attorney General Josh Kaul, both Democrats who ran on the promise to get Wisconsin out of the lawsuit seeking repeal of the health care law. Former Republican Gov. Scott Walker, an opponent to the Affordable Care Act also known as Obamacare, approved Wisconsin joining the lawsuit.
Biden told CBS News political correspondent Ed O'Keefe at a news conference in late June that he would release a list of potential picks once they've been fully vetted. This week aides wouldn't say where the vetting of potential candidates stands.
A long-awaited Supreme Court nominee, multi-city protests over the new travel ban and Cabinet votes and hearings are just a few of the things going on in the week ahead. Mr. Trump may also roll out additional executive orders and actions.
SEN. KLOBUCHAR: --nothing. He promised them a safer world when he got out of the Iranian agreement. It is not safer. That's the case we need to make.
His sudden death will have an immediate impact on the current term, full of controversial cases: regulation of abortion clinics, another challenge to Obamacare, affirmative action in college admissions, and presidential power on immigration.
We have an increase in murder within our cities, the biggest in 45 years. We have a divided nation, because people like her — and believe me, she has tremendous hate in her heart. And when she said deplorables, she meant it. And when she said irredeemable, they're irredeemable, you didn't mention that, but when she said they're irredeemable, to me that might have been even worse.
CAITLIN HUEY-BURNS: --not to go back to their own policies, which they haven't been able to show the public that they can coalesce around a plan.
Here are the major legal battles to be heard by the Supreme Court this term.
He's conservative, but he is an institutionalist. He believes deeply in the Supreme Court, said George Washington University law professor Jonathan Turley.
Robert Venturi George Widman, AP; Carol M. Highsmith, Buyenlarge/Getty Images Often referred to as the father of postmodernism, architect Robert Venturi (June 25, 1925–September 18, 2018) shunned the title, despite having broken with the Modernist school principle that less is more … insisting to the contrary that (as he put it) less is a bore! He would reject the austere designs and spare aesthetics of modernists like Mies van der Rohe, and produce buildings that celebrated complexity and even inconsistency in design. Venturi designed buildings bursting with ornamentation and flourishes, and encouraged architects and consumers to enjoy messy vitality in architecture, whether whimsical, sarcastic, humorous or honky-tonk. His first notable building was a house he designed for his mother in Philadelphia's Chestnut Hill neighborhood in 1961. It broke from the established architectural thinking of the time, that a modern house should contain no historical elements. Architect Frederick Schwartz referred to the Vanna Venturi House (pictured) as the first postmodern anything. A while back, when it was considered very daring, we did very simple things, Venturi said in 1991. We did buildings that looked ordinary, that were not trying to be revolutionary the way modern architecture was going to go. That horrified people. We did houses that looked like houses, elemental concepts of houses. We did fire stations that looked like fire stations. In 1991, Venturi was awarded the prestigious Pritzker Prize, for expanding and redefining the limits of architecture in this century, as perhaps no other has.

And I'll tell you this morning and going forward: I don't intend to say negative things about Donald Trump.
Despite Joe Biden's win yesterday in South Carolina, Bloomberg believes Bernie Sanders is the candidate to beat. He's counting on voters to move toward a centrist who believes government should be effective and dull, not a blood sport for tv.
JOHN DICKERSON: Right, but it was something they cared. Democrats care about this, too. I guess the question is--
While business is on hold because of COVID-19, Mufson has enrolled in graduate school to learn new skills that will supplement her work as an artist. Brain Travis, who works with Mufson at Parade Guys and is also a musician, has been connecting with other artists remotely to produce songs. In July, he told CBS News that producing weekly online music events was helping him buy groceries while he was out of work. Travis said he spent several months learning new software programs to efficiently livestream a weekly show. He added that live streaming content is another way that people are going to consume media and to stay relevant he had to figure it out as well. More than five million Californians applied for traditional unemployment benefits between March and September, according to the state's Employment Development Department.

She is urging states to be proactive about vote-by-mail efforts ahead of the November presidential election and thinks it's possible that we will only be able to hold this election via vote-by-mail. Unless we have a vaccine by Election Day, Cleaver said, the majority of Americans are going to vote by mail this year.
Lesley Stahl: You said negative campaigning is wrong and a campaign ought to demonstrate the basic decency of the candidate.
Not only are their seats safe, but their support of this shutdown and the attempt to defund Obamacare is their guarantee to reelection, Sabato told CBSNews.com. The vast majority are in heavily Republican districts, so general public opinion may be completely against them, but this is actually good for them.
Edith Childs Brett Flashnick/AP Presidential hopeful Sen. Barack Obama, D-Ill., left, shares a laugh with Greenwood County, S.C., Council Woman, Edith Childs in Aiken, S.C., Oct. 6, 2007. Two people who inspired Barack Obama during his first presidential campaign are going to attend his final State of the Union address. The White House says they're Edith Childs of South Carolina, and Earl Smith, of Austin, Texas. Childs' Fired up! and Ready to go! call and response became an unofficial slogan during Obama's 2008 and 2012 election campaigns. Obama invited Childs to the White House in 2009, honoring her for enthusiasm that helped carry him to the White House in his view.
As for the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) budget, the package would cut about $80 million from the $8 billion it received in fiscal 2016, which is a 1 percent reduction, a GOP aide said. Democrats are touting that as protecting 99 percent of the EPA budget..
I think that Joe Biden will be the person to protect Anthony and those with pre-existing conditions, his father says.
Over the weekend Mr. Trump renewed his attacks on McCain over Twitter, blaming him for sending the Steele dossier to the FBI and falsely claiming that he was last in his class at Annapolis. The dossier, a collection of memos by former British spy Christopher Steele, contains unverified material detailing possible connections between Russian and Mr. Trump's presidential campaign. The president told reporters on Tuesday that he was never a fan of John McCain and never will be.

1. How will the Democratic midterm results shape the field and agenda of 2020 presidential hopefuls?
One of the most dangerous narratives being advanced by some in our own party is the notion that however dreadful a Hillary Clinton administration may be, the effects will be temporary or harmless....America may never recover from that, said Carson, who then went off-script.
Vice President Mike Pence campaigned in Ohio Friday for the second time this week. Pence said Mr. Trump took the fight straight to Joe Biden and he won that debate hands down. Laughing, Pence said, It was amazing, I saw Joe look down at this watch, I figured he was trying to figure out how soon this thing's gonna be over. Pence also picked on Biden saying he would eventually replace the oil industry. America's strength comes in part from our vast natural resources, Pence said. We are going to continue to develop all of the resources of this land and drive a boundless American future, he added.
Mike Bloomberg: it's an easy commitment for me to make because the alternative is Donald Trump, so yes, I would support the nominee--
In a statement Wednesday, Biden campaign spokesman Andrew Bates said the release of the list was an attempt at dishonest media manipulation to distract from his response to the worst public health crisis in 100 years.
MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to start on COVID. This new strain that was first detected in the U.K., B117, led that country to shut down its schools. This week Doctor Fauci said opening U.S. schools may not happen due to mitigating circumstances. Is President Biden still vowing to open American schools by April?
BIDEN: No I know. I gave you my- I gave the answer. Do I bear responsibility? Zero responsibility. The responsibility I have is to protect America's na- national self-interest and not put our women and men in harm's way to try to solve every single problem in the world by use of force. That's my responsibility as President. And that's what I'll do as president.

Jim Obergefell Alex Wong/Getty Images Plaintiff Jim Obergefell holds a photo of his late husband John Arthur as he speaks to members of the media after the U.S. Supreme Court handed down a ruling regarding same-sex marriage June 26, 2015 in Washington, D.C. Obergefell and his partner sued to force their home state of Ohio, where same-sex marriage wasn't legal, to recognize their out-of-state union. Arthur died three months after the couple married in July 2013. After the landmark ruling, Obergefell said, I felt more like an equal American than I had in a very long time. Obergefell received a congratulatory call from President Obama as he stood on the steps of the Supreme Court. Obama told him, Your leadership on this has changed the country. Obergefell wrote an open letter about the Supreme Court case.

The candidates also diverged on health care. Gillum said he would push for an expansion of Medicaid to bring 800,000 low-income Floridians into the program.
Biden has been the frontrunner in the Democratic primary since entering the race. In the most recent CBS News Battleground Tracker poll, 29% of registered Iowa voters who are Democrats said Biden is their top choice for the nomination, followed by Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders with 26% and Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren with 17%.
Obama won Nevada during his 2008 and 2012 presidential campaigns and Democrat Hillary Clinton carried Nevada in 2016, but Republicans currently hold all statewide offices and are hoping to sweep the state again this year.
MARGARET BRENNAN: All right, we'll look for you on that next debate stage. Thank you very much, Senator Klobuchar.
JAMAL SIMMONS: He's certainly trying. His campaign leadership is much more diverse than it had been in the past, like he's going places where there are people who are different. The question becomes how can he get particularly middle-aged African-American women to sign up for the Bernie bus? So many of the people who supported him were people who were younger in the last election, and I think, you know, a middle-aged African-American audience is still a little bit more conservative than kind of a northeastern socialist might think.

Lesley Stahl: What did the b=Bushes say when they called you?
Republicans are challenging Whitmer's executive authority under an emergency powers law from 1945 and the Emergency Management Act of 1976. The 1945 law does not mention that a governor needs legislative approval to issue reasonable orders, but Republicans are arguing that the law does not pertain to statewide pandemics, but instead applies only to geographically limited, civil disturbance-like emergencies.
Speaker Nancy Pelosi: But the men do that, too. That's not just the women.
MARGARET BRENNAN: We are back with more of our interview with former Vice President Joe Biden.
President Donald Trump: The way she closed churches in Michigan is a disgrace. I-- yeah, I think it's disgraceful what she's done. I do.
JOE BIDEN: Not that I'm aware of.
He engaged in a call and response exchange with delegates in the audience, similar to New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie's speech the night before.
MARGARET BRENNAN: But back in 20-- back in 2016 in October of 2016, when Russia was doing this disinformation campaign, the Obama administration did declassify information at that time. So there is a precedent. Why doesn't the Trump administration do that?

After some time away from the campaign trail to prepare for the second and final presidential debate, Biden began Friday to publicly outline plans for a potential transition into the presidency amid the COVID-19 pandemic, reports CBS News campaign reporter Alex Tin. I'll reach out to every governor in every state, red and blue, as well as mayors and local officials during transition to find out what support they need and how much of it they need. I'll ask the new Congress to put a bill on my desk by the end of January, Biden said in Delaware, as the contest enters its final stretch ahead of Election Day. Both campaigns claim the debate buoyed their prospects ahead of Election Day. However, Mr. Biden's opponents have seized on his debate stage acknowledgement that he would transition away from the oil industry, ahead of the former vice president's planned visit to Pennsylvania on Saturday. Though not much of a departure from his campaign's climate plan publicly outlined months ago, the former vice president's remark drew a firestorm from opponents. We'll get rid of the subsidies of fossil fuels, but not going to get rid of fossil fuels for a long time, Biden said late Thursday as he departed Nashville.

The president sat down with comedian and actor Zach Galifianakis on Between Two Ferns, his Funny or Die web series.
The House GOP health care plan comes six years after the Affordable Care Act became law, requiring nearly all Americans to carry health insurance and employers to offer it. The law's mandates and tax increases have stoked endless controversy and opposition from the GOP, yet the number of uninsured people has dropped by about 20 million people to historic lows.
Our expectation is for two interest rate hikes in 2019, and we think this week the Fed will open the door to less aggressive fed fund increases, which would bring the Fed in line with our expectations, analysts with Keefe, Bruyette & Woods said in a client note.
President Donald Trump: --on my campaign.
The second pillar fully secures the border. That means building a great wall on the southern border, and it means hiring more heroes, like CJ, to keep our communities safe. Crucially, our plan closes the terrible loopholes exploited by criminals and terrorists to enter our country, and it finally ends the horrible and dangerous practice of catch and release.
Trump announced the campaign promotions early Wednesday morning, after a week of plunging poll numbers and controversies surrounding campaign chair Paul Manafort and his connections to foreign firms. Manafort, according to Conway, is still there as chairman and retains his title.
Hood is also distancing himself from national politics and will not comment on impeachment.
Juan Romero Boris Yaro/Los Angeles Times When Robert F. Kennedy decided to duck through the kitchen of the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles after declaring victory in the 1968 Democratic presidential primary, an 18-year-old busboy reveled at his good fortune – he might get to shake hands with the next President of the United States. But after gunfire rang out and Kennedy fell, Juan Romero (1950-October 1, 2018) cradled the Senator's bleeding head. Is everybody OK? Kennedy asked. Romero said yes. Everything will be OK, the senator replied shortly before losing consciousness. As they talked, Romero pressed a set of Rosary beads into Kennedy's hand as photographers frantically took pictures. Because of the beads, his white busboy smock and the beatific look on his face, Romero was misidentified in some early news reports as a priest. Josefina Guerra said her father felt guilty for years about the shooting, which she said broke his heart. Visiting Kennedy's gravesite a few years ago, Romero spoke to the Senator, asking him for forgiveness for the fact that he didn't react quickly enough to possibly take the bullet for him, or push him out of the way of danger. Only recently, he said during rare interviews this year, did he finally come to terms with that struggle. He also said he still carried the example Kennedy had set as he campaigned for equality and civil rights. I still have the fire burning inside of me, Romero said.
Since then an outcry has been heard from health care advocates, insurers, congressional Republicans and most recently a group of bipartisan governors from nine states. The protest is focused on the provision in the ACA that requires insurers to provide equal coverage and the same premium rates to people with preexisting conditions as they provide to people without previous health problems.
Jeb's spending all this time being negative. Does he worry at all about his legacy? Everything is trashing people. I mean, even Trump -- I read that today -- Trump's like, you know, all this guy does is attack, Kasich said to reporters.
On Bill Maher's HBO show, top Trump critic and former CIA Director John Brennan agreed that Trump is third great crisis to hit America, behind only the Civil and Revolutionary Wars. He's worse than 9/11, worse than the Depression.
PAULA REID: Likely, yes. At least until March, I mean, that's when Manafort will be sentenced. And the special counsel continues to exist until each one of its discreet cases is completely resolved.
It comes down to what can be done with executive orders and what has to go through Congress, Deutsche Bank's Slok said. Congress will probably play a bigger role in trade policy. The majority in the House will probably start showing more interest in trade policy.

Three in four Republicans support a building a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border to try to stop illegal immigration, while most Democrats (and most independents) oppose it.
It's an ironic choice since her own husband sent out a stream of pretty nasty tweets during the campaign.
Obamacare will never work. It's very bad, very bad health insurance. Far too expensive. And not only expensive for the person that has it, unbelievably expensive for our country. It's going to be one of the biggest line items very shortly.
House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., told Republican lawmakers at a closed meeting Thursday that leaders would work through the weekend to draft repeal and replace legislation. Expect the bill to change as backers move forward and encounter pushback.
(CBS News) Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney said Monday that he would fill his Cabinet with people with private sector experience, like himself, drawing a contrast with President Obama's preference for Cabinet secretaries with government backgrounds.
SEN. KLOBUCHAR: I would first acknowledge to the American people very clearly the problem here. The surveillance, the intellectual property violations are basically stealing our blueprints, what they have done when it comes to subsidizing industries and manipulating their currency. The second thing that I would do is to work with our allies and to push them, and I wouldn't have just walk away from every negotiating table, months goes by. I think you have to keep at it methodically. And mostly, I wouldn't have used the approach they've used. Yes, targeted tariffs, but they have used basically a meat cleaver or maybe we should call it a tweet cleaver when it comes to how they're dealing with these other countries.
The third debate comes as the new CBS News Battleground Tracker poll finds Warren gaining ground, absorbing support previously given to other lower-tier candidates, while Biden maintains his lead. The survey also shows a split within the party about what the Democrats' 2020 message should be: 60% say it should be more progressive than the Obama administration while 40% say it should be about returning the country to how things were before the Trump presidency.
Still, Tyler argues that there is a path to the nomination for Gingrich.
We're at war in the Middle East that McCain pushed so hard, Trump said. Calling Bush all the time, get into the Middle East.
MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to quickly ask you about a sexual harassment bill that you have been a-- a key voice on. But to answer the criticism from the White House, don't Democrats need to show some flexibility to avoid the shutdown?
The featured speakers include Eric Trump, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, and Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, Trump's running mate.
Rep. Larry Bucshon, R-Indiana, said inside the meeting, The chairman just said that things are in a good place and we expect to have the government funded through the end of the fiscal year by the end of the week and not a CR.
But she wants to go to single payer, which means the government basically rules everything. Hillary Clinton has been after this for years. Obamacare was the first step. Obamacare is a total disaster. And not only are your rates going up by numbers that nobody's ever believed, but your deductibles are going up, so that unless you get hit by a truck, you're never going to be able to use it.
There is some good news. Medicare beneficiaries who pay the most for medicines would pay less under the Trump budget. Medicare patients who reach the maximum of $8,418 in total costs would no longer have to pay the 5 percent co-pay on prescription drugs. Other Medicare patients, however, would pay more out of pocket for medicine because manufacturer discounts would no longer be counted toward their total drug spending.
7. How will the Mueller investigation affect the elections?
In 2016, Kavanaugh authored the majority opinion in PHH Corp v. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, finding the basic structure of the consumer authority to be unconstitutional. The Trump administration has sought to lessen the CFPB's authority and decrease its budget.
MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to get to the issue of health care. The President this week said he wants the courts to strike down Obamacare, the Affordable Care Act. But to be fair, Senator, you want to replace Obamacare, too. You want to replace it with Medicare for all, this government-run, government-financed program. So if the courts strike down--
Donald Trump: Everybody said, That was so great. I have been, you know, I've been-a supporter.
You strip women of access to public health care, she added. Shame on you Rick Scott. We depend on those services. Rich people like you don't know what to do! When poorer people like us need services you cut them. Shame on you Rick Scott! You're an embarrassment to our state!
TRUMP: And yet she didn't know the word — the letter C on a document. Right? She didn't even know what that word — what that letter meant.
TRUMP STATEMENT: What President Clinton did, he was Impeached, he lost his license to practice law, he had to pay an $850,000 fine to one of the women, Paula Jones, who's also here tonight.
On this Face the Nation broadcast moderated by Margaret Brennan:
In most situations, individually purchased health insurance isn't a tax-deductible expense, so individuals can't enjoy the subsidies that are available to employers and their workers.
Gillum then went on the attack. Mr. DeSantis has spoken. First of all, he has got neo Nazis helping him out in the state, Gillum said. He has spoken at racist conferences. He has accepted a contribution and would not return it from someone who referred to the former president of the United States as a Muslim n****r. When asked to return that money, he said no. He is using that money to fund negative ads. Now I'm not calling Mr. DeSantis a racist. I'm simply saying the racists believe he is a racist.

In addition to these events, her campaign has started the Common Ground Breakfast, where Democratic, Republican and independent women voters come together to discuss issues and to practice civility when discussing these issues. Slotkin said voters approached her about the tone of politics, and she added that this type of event is her effort to bring people from both sides of the political spectrum together.
Another is supporting former Rep. John Delaney after watching his second debate performance when he criticized the idea of replacing private insurance with a taxpayer-funded alternative. And a truck driver told CBS News he was supporting Rep. Tim Ryan because of the congressman's emphasis on protecting factory jobs.
The U.S job market has been a bright spot in recent months, helping drive the unemployment rate to its lowest level in years. And, notably, it is small and midsize businesses that have led the way. We look at why the stronger hiring by smaller companies is such a good sign for the economy.
Even before officially announcing his bid, Booker had started to court voters in the Palmetto State. In 2018, he was the keynote speaker at the Betty Henderson Elected Officials and Candidates Cook-Off, a flagship event for one of the state's Democratic Party's chapters. And last year Booker participated in another staple event in the state, King Day at the Dome, a week ahead of announcing his bid for the presidency.

The package doesn't include any funding for the wall President Trump wants along the U.S.-Mexico border or a deportation force, according to a senior congressional aide. In fact, the legislation specifically states that there can't be construction of a new wall, the aide said. The White House backed off of its demand for wall funding last week after Democrats made it clear they would oppose any bill that includes it. Instead, it includes $1.5 billion for border security, which would cover technology and repairing existing infrastructure, which covers some of Mr. Trump's request.
Midterm elections tend to be bruising for the party in control of the White House. Think of the Republican Revolution in 1994, when Republicans gained 54 seats in the House and eight seats in the Senate – just two years after President Clinton was elected. Or remember the shellacking President Obama's Democrats got in the Tea Party wave 2010, when Republicans picked up 63 seats in the House and six seats in the Senate. There are exceptions to this rule, such as when the GOP gained seats in 2002, but that was due mostly to the aftermath of 9/11 and President Bush's sky-high approval ratings before the Iraq War was launched.
LANNY DAVIS: So, there's a lot in the Mueller memo that tells you how forthcoming, for seventy hours in seven meetings, Michael Cohen was with Mister Mueller.
Catherine Herridge: Attorney General Barr, thank you for speaking first to CBS News.
The president said he kept provisions protecting preexisting conditions, even though his administration has been fighting against those protections in court. The Supreme Court, which now has only eight justices, will hear arguments on the fate of the ACA a week after the election. Mr. Trump is determined to confirm his replacement for the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg before then.
Clark County, which includes Las Vegas and is by far Nevada's most populous county, announced changes to expand access to their upcoming primary. This led Democrats to declare victory and abandon their motion against the Nevada Secretary of State over the June contest. But now Republicans have accused them of a power grab and a shady deal and a GOP official told the Las Vegas Review Journal that they could sue the county into oblivion if we have to over the changes. Americans deserve to have confidence in their elections, and we will not stand idly by while Democrats try to sue their way to victory in November, GOP Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel said in a statement. The threat came as Republicans have touted doubling their litigation budget to $20 million, waging court battles over a raft of coronavirus-related election changes around the country. Republican threats will never break our commitment to fighting on behalf of Nevada voters, Molly Forgey, spokesperson for the Nevada State Democratic party, tells CBS News campaign reporter Alex Tin in a statement.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Jamelle, you've written though about Bernie Sanders in a way you said he has a defined foreign policy in a way others do not.
That uncertainty has Biden uneasy on the campaign trail as he hopes to both defend the law from Republican-led efforts to dismantle it and talk up the 2010 Obama feat to Democrats who have somewhat adopted Medicare for all as seemingly a requirement for candidates.
Trump speaks at news anchor lunch event
Democrats and the groups supporting them are leaning in once again on health care ahead of the November election - an issue that played to their advantage during the 2018 midterms says CBS News political unit associate producer Sarah Ewall-Wice.
In fact, Mr. Obama said, I was not informed correctly that the website would not be working the way it was supposed to. Had I been informed, I wouldn't be going out saying, 'Boy, this is going to be great.' You know, I'm accused of a lot of things, but I don't think I'm stupid enough to go around saying 'this is going to be like shopping on Amazon or Travelocity,' a week before the website opens if I thought that it wasn't going to work.
One day later, Mr. Trump said we are doing better than that when asked at that day's Coronavirus Task Force briefing about his decision to not expand the Obamacare special enrollment period during the pandemic. He said opening up the enrollment period doesn't help as much as getting those Americans the cash payment in the stimulus package. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the first direct deposit payments to Americans will happen in just two weeks.
Barrett will participate in oral arguments for the first time as Supreme Court justice on Monday, and just two days later, the court is slated to hear one of the bigger cases of its term: a dispute that stands at the intersection of religious liberty and LGBTQ rights.
We'll see if Democrats are able to translate the rage and anxiety in our communities into voters. Women in the suburbs, in particular, are expected to be a decisive voting bloc in dozens of congressional, Senate, and other statewide races. The #MeToo movement is likely to motivate large swaths of women to head to the ballot box.
Sadie Harper-Scott, the Lafayette and West Lafayette Branch President of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), said she appreciates Donnelly's commitment to being a voice for all communities in Indiana and appreciated his ability to reach across the political aisle and work with Republicans.
2:30 p.m. ET With the first night of primetime speakers only a few hours away, Trump's campaign has released a full program of what to expect this week. Each night will be a variation on Trump's campaign slogan, Make America Great Again. Tonight's theme is Make America Safe Again, with a focus on national security; Trump's wife, Melania Trump, will speak, as will GOP lawmakers like Arkansas Sen. Tom Cotton and Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions.
Lesley Stahl: And if they end it people with preexisting conditions will be stranded. And that's just a fact.
JOE BIDEN: But we didn't have the--
Speaker Nancy Pelosi: You have to understand. When they're only 23, men are not threatened by the women in Congress, you understand? They're not threatened by that. That's-- that's nice. That's nice, we have some women here--
MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, technically this decision wasn't possible until the tax law was put into place. But in-- in terms of what this means for the twenty million Americans, it does create some uncertainty and possible disruption--
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told reporters Tuesday that the Trump administration's shift in position on Obamacare was an opportunity for Democrats to speak to the American people with clarity.
CLINTON: I want to be the best president I can be for every American.
In fact, the Trump tax cuts are the eighth largest in history.
In 2014, Michael Grimm resigned from his 11th congressional New York district seat after pleading guilty to tax fraud. Now, after serving seven months in prison, he is calling it a witch hunt and says he wants his job back. Incumbent Republican Rep. Dan Donovan has been representing this southern Brooklyn and Staten Island district ever since, and now the two are trying to out-Trump each other, hoping to align themselves with Trump's policies and agenda to win over conservative voters. Although Trump tweeted his endorsement of Donovan in May, the NYT notes that it is Mr. Grimm who reminds voters of Mr. Trump — in terms of his brash, anti-establishment, take-no-prisoners style.
The Democratic charge on health care represents a turnaround from recent elections. In 2010, just months after passage of the Affordable Care Act, Democrats lost control of the House as Republicans tapped into fears about the government's growing role in health care. Four years later, Republicans grabbed Senate control following the botched rollout of the health law's online insurance markets and some people's loss of policies that fell short of the statute's coverage requirements.
Biden told them the Trump administration lawsuit seems to me to be close to cruel and then agreed with one of the attendees that it is also unconscionable. In 18 minutes of remarks afterward, Biden whittled into President Trump for his twin legacies of failure to protect from COVID-19 while fighting his crusade to do away with the ACA. The former vice president said the president was acting like a child in terms of his COVID-19 response, focusing more on how testing rates make him look rather than focusing on help to those impacted by the virus. Biden reiterated his support to try to implement a public option in addition to Obamacare coverage if elected, which would offer Medicare-like plans to those wanting better coverage outside of employee-based healthcare.
Also during the interview, Romney suggested that Obama's health care overhaul, which was upheld by the Supreme Court on June 28, is designed to be the first step toward a government-run system.
As chairman of the Armed Services Committee, McCain flew to battlefields and trouble spots around the world. When Ukraine became dangerous, I questioned his decision to go to Kiev.
On-the-ground reporting will be provided by CBS News Chief White House correspondent Major Garrett, CBS News Congressional Correspondent Nancy Cordes and CBS News Foreign Affairs and White House Correspondent Margaret Brennan.
But the meta-message of the Trump movement is that Washington just doesn't work, that the swamp needs to be drained, that both parties are more interested in politics than people. And every congressional failure, from the Obamacare repeal fiasco to the #DACA shutdown, feeds that overarching message.
Executive action - 2 for 1
MARGARET BRENNAN: But after a spectacular Oval Office squabble with Democrats over the President's demand for border wall funding, is agreement on anything in the New Year possible?
Plus, the most diverse caucus in history with unprecedented numbers of people of color and a record 91 women. She is given high marks, even among Republicans we spoke to, for her skills as a legislator and effective negotiator.
And there was, yet, another surprise at week's end.
Pelosi said on Thursday that she believed Congress needed to prepare for the next phase of legislation if a new administration takes office in January.
It's unclear exactly when the appeals court will rule, but whichever side loses at this stage is almost certain to appeal to the Supreme Court, setting up a potential legal showdown in the middle of the 2020 presidential race.
I miss you, too, he told the roaring crowd.
Rose attempted to clarify: You can't disclose whether he believed it or not?
Carney said that the administration can't confirm that percentage until its automated payment system is running.
Birth control is an essential part of women's health care, Murray said, adding that she was deeply concerned about the impact of your policies on women.
But before the Freedom Caucus, Weaver told Stahl, another presidential contest marked a shift in the party — the 2008 campaign. The party had begun to change before that election, Weaver said, but McCain expedited the transformation when he selected former Alaska Gov. Sara Palin as his vice presidential running mate.
Melania Trump: Well, sometimes he-- it got him in trouble. But it helped a lot as well. He had unbelievable following.
There's certainly no question that more people have jobs and more people health insurance, Wallace pointed out.
MARGARET BRENNAN: The coverage of pre-existing conditions was protected under the Affordable Care Act, so if this ruling is upheld, that goes away. Are you as-- as a Republican leader looking to craft an entirely new law from whole cloth or are you looking at amending the Affordable Care Act?
1983-2001: Elected to the House of Representatives as a Republican. Chaired the House Budget Committee, where fought with former President Clinton over the budget. He also helped oversee Mr. Clinton's impeachment proceedings.
During the primaries, many major Republican candidates embraced President Trump and his policies. Meanwhile, Democrats have been exerting pressure on Republicans by highlighting their efforts to repeal Obamacare and by hitting the president's trade policies. Now that the primaries are over, which Republicans will be welcoming him on the campaign trail?
Today a spokesperson for the presidential campaign of former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg confirmed to CBS News campaign reporter Tim Perry that the campaign will cover the cost of COBRA through November 2020 for both national and state staffers. In an email obtained by CBS News campaign reporter Adam Brewster, the Bloomberg campaign tells its staffers to sign up by April 29 for COBRA coverage to begin May 1. We all aim to keep ourselves, our families and communities safe and healthy during the COVID-19 pandemic, said the email to staff. The campaign has covered health insurance for former employees since Mike dropped out, a campaign spokesperson tells CBS News. Today's announcement makes it official that given the challenges associated with the pandemic, the campaign will continue to cover health care through November 2020 for former employees who haven't secured other coverage.
In South Carolina, Democratic Senate challenger Jaime Harrison's campaign announced a $2.1 million fundraising haul in Q3, a feat that Harrison's team has called record-breaking, in its effort to unseat incumbent Senator Lindsey Graham. Harrison raised $1.5 million in the second quarter, and Graham doubled that total, bringing in more than $3 million in the second fundraising quarter.
MARGARET BRENNAN: So, that could be a-- another compromise like Senator Susan Collins was out there talking about a two and a half billion-dollar compromise rather than the five billion that the President is asking for.
PAUL RYAN: No, their pay gets deferred. Here-- let me just say something. I believe in immigration reform. What if I persuaded my caucus to say, I'm going to shut down the government. I'm not going to pay our bills unless I get my way. It's a politics of idiocy, confrontation, and paralysis. That's Chuck Schumer in 2013.
Would you support drug price transparency? Baldwin asked, expanding on a proposal to require drug companies to make public information that goes into pricing their products.
Haley replied, What I've noticed is, if a woman does well, if a woman's good at her job, for some reason people have trouble giving her that credit for just being good at her job. What I will tell you is, I will stand up every time it happens and let people know it is not okay.
But Kate Spittlemeister, who lives in Kenosha, Wis., the site of violent protests this summer, sees the unrest in a different light: In our neighborhood there were armed people, just regular citizens, and those armed citizens stood at the entrances to our subdivisions, she said. And that was way more terrifying to me than what was happening, you know, downtown.
MARGARET BRENNAN: --the removal of that provision is what opened the court to be able to make this decision.
SEN. SANDERS: Well we're going to do everything we can to stop it. It's totally absurd. Look, you have--
And they look and they see. Can you imagine the people that are, frankly, doing so well against us with ISIS? And they look at our country and they see what's going on.
At a time when we must heal the heart of our democracy and renew our commitment to the common good, I stand before you as the granddaughter of an iron ore miner, as the daughter of a teacher and a newspaperman, as the first woman elected to the United States Senate from the state of Minnesota, to announce my candidacy for president of the United States, she told supporters braving frigid temperatures and relentless snowfall at an outdoor rally along the Mississippi River in Minneapolis.

Former Pennsylvania Governor Tom Ridge, a Republican, today called for Pennsylvania counties to be allowed to pre-canvass mail ballots ahead of Election Day. This follows a June primary where a surge in mail-in voting led to counties counting ballots over a week after Election Day, and the leading candidate in 10 down ballot races changing after election night.
Klobuchar said federal law dictates Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) tell Congress within 24 hours if someone in dies its custody. But CBP Commissioner Kevin McAleenan testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee this week and did not mention it, Klobuchar said.
I commit to working with you to making sure that happens, Price says in response, noting that there are a lot of contributions to the debt.
As the Washington Post reported in 2014, Cruz was once Boehner's lawyer -- a fact Boehner divulged during an appearance on Jay Leno's The Tonight Show.
1:24 a.m. ET That's a wrap. Will Rahn says the convention has gotten off to a shaky start.
For exchange information, stick close to the healthcare.gov site for federally run exchanges or, if your state runs your exchange, the official state exchange site. That's where you'll find comprehensive policies that meet ACA standards, Fish-Parcham advised.
Lawmakers must extend funding by Friday night or the government will shut down early Saturday.
'I just hated working with him, joyless.' He said, 'Oh, well, I like to suffer.' Which I didn't! I always thought acting in the theatre and movies should be a joyous experience!
On the Senate floor Thursday morning, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said, It's time for the Democrats to work with us to repeal this law and start over. Then, he and other Senate Republicans took turns sharing anecdotes on the Senate floor of people from their state who had been dropped from their plans.
Congress essentially eliminated the individual mandate as part of its tax cut legislation in 2017. Effective this year, the penalty now is $0. That means that this particular aspect of the ruling has no practical significance.
It might be everything from figuring out how we can enable remote work… to trying to help with procurement, he said, adding that one USDS worker who was at the CDC during the Ebola crisis was currently working on data to help understand hospital bed capacity before the pandemic's peak.
9:49 p.m. The president very briefly said: And let us support working families by supporting paid family leave. He offered no details, however, on what he would specifically support. The president very briefly said: And let us support working families by supporting paid family leave.
Roberts will be the justice who determines how far they go and how fast they go, said Washington lawyer John Elwood.
It just says that those who have pre-existing conditions should be able to buy insurance at the same rates and prices as everybody else, Hawley said.
Even out of office, Annan never completely left the U.N. orbit. He returned in special roles, including as the U.N.-Arab League's special envoy to Syria in 2012. He remained a powerful advocate for global causes through his eponymous foundation, which in 2007 helped broker peace in Kenya, where election violence had killed over 1,000 people. At the end of his Nobel Peace Prize acceptance speech, in 2001, Annan reminded the world of the importance of the U.N.: Beneath the surface of states and nations, ideas and language, lies the fate of individual human beings in need, he said.
Lower deductibles are targeted by adjusting rates to a higher category ACA plan — from the silver to the gold plan — and for low-income Americans.
President Donald Trump: And then they went much further than that and they got caught. And you will see that, Lesley. And you know that. But you just don't wanna put it on the air--
Mr. Trump's list of 50 proposals, dubbed American Patients First, includes:
At a time when the biggest financial institutions in this country were trying to put the squeeze on millions of hard working families who were in bankruptcy because of medical problems, job losses, divorce and death in the family, there was no body to stand up for them, I got in that fight because of, they just didn't have anyone, and Joe Biden was on the side of credit card companies, Warren said in April 2019 after Biden announced his presidential bid.
The city saw a declining population due to the loss of factory jobs, but it has increased since Buttigieg took office. He has focused on improving higher education and health care in the city. In the video announcing his exploratory committee, Buttigieg emphasizes the need for a fresh start in American politics. He also discusses the issues important to him as a member of the millennial generation, saying: We're the generation that lived through school shootings, that served in the wars after 9/11, and we're the generation that stands to be the first to make less than our parents. Unless we do something different. Controversy Buttigieg has very little controversy around him, other than his age and sexual orientation, which some consider to be automatic strikes against him. In his first term as mayor, he dealt with a scandal at the local police department, which led him to demote the first African American chief of police of South Bend. What Trump says President Trump has not tweeted about or insulted Buttigieg as of now.
And we want- want to move from a system of immigration based on family relations to one based on skills and merits for what the economy needs. Perfectly common sense. Here's the issue. If we simply did DACA without incumbent reforms, then you'd have a DACA problem five years down the road. We want to fix the problem and the root cause of the problem. DACA is a symptom of a broken immigration system. We want to fix the root cause of this problem while we deal with DACA so that we don't have 700,000 more DACA kids in five years. That's perfectly common sense, and that's all the president is saying.
The pro-Biden Super PAC Unite the Country launched a new ad today called Deserve. CBS News political unit associate producer Sarah Ewall-Wice says it kicked off their $10 million investment ahead of the Democratic National Convention that is scheduled to take place in Milwaukee in August. In the one-minute spot, Biden's voice can be heard under a montage of old family pictures recalling how when he was a kid, his dad had to tell him he would have to leave the family in Pennsylvania to find work in Delaware. Biden has shared many times on the campaign trail the story of his dad losing his job. For the rest of our life, my dad never failed to remind us that a job is about a lot more than a paycheck. It's about your dignity. It's about respect. It's about your place in the community. It's about being able to look your child in the eye and say, 'honey, it's going to be ok,' and know it's true, Biden can be heard saying. The ad also highlights Biden's role in leading the 2009 Recovery Act. According to Kantar Media tracking, Unite the Country has spent more than $10.5 million on ads since mid-December through late April.
Lesley Stahl: It was a pretty nasty campaign. Do you regret any of the things you said about her?
There is plenty of call and response with the audience. At an August rally in Derry, New Hampshire, a man yelled that former Florida governor and fellow presidential candidate Jeb Bush was sinking to the bottom of Lake Winnipesaukee, the largest lake in New Hampshire. Trump beamed and exclaimed, My group! These are my people! Recently, Trump has taken to yelling, Who's gonna pay for the wall? Crowds respond enthusiastically, Mexico!
John Boehner unleashed a barrage of insults at Republican presidential candidate and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz Wednesday, calling him Lucifer in the flesh and saying he had never worked with a more miserable son of a bitch.
COOPER: The question is, is that the discipline of a good leader?
QUESTION: My question is, do you believe you can be a devoted president to all the people in the United States?
Because health insurance is so complicated, consumers are going to have to do their homework to figure out if there's something in the bill for them. And health care benefits are not like stimulus checks that can be blasted out. Experts say there will be a lag as government agencies, insurers and employers unpack the bill's provisions.
Last month, New York state — the epicenter of the coronavirus pandemic — took the unprecedented step of canceling its presidential primary, citing coronavirus concerns. Tuesday's opinion followed a legal challenge filed by former Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang and a group of delegates aiming to reverse the cancellation.
SEN. SCOTT: But, Margaret, this- the president just put out a marker what he wants to accomplish. I- I think all of us want to be helpful to try to get something done. We know it's going to be difficult with Nancy Pelosi and with the Democrats proposing Medicare for all. We know that. At the same time, what I'm going to do is what I believe we can get done. Let's focus first on prescription drug prices. They're way too high. We shouldn't be paying more than what they pay in Europe. It's unfair to Americans. And let's go piece by piece to try to fix it.
TRUMP: But I will tell you, she's all talk. It doesn't get done. All you have to do is take a look at her Senate run. Take a look at upstate New York.
But Mr. Trump isn't the only Republican in the executive branch with cause for concern — Democrats are also poised to launch or continue probes into Cabinet-level secretaries and federal agencies.
MILLER: I'm not going to negotiate the details on air with you right now--
SENATOR BEN SASSE: Yeah. I mean you're right. I mean the-- the Senate should be an institution of a hundred people who get sent from their communities where they really are from and want to return to. And they go and have to build relationships and build a temporary community in the Senate of people who actually listen to one another. We don't do that very much right now because cable TV news has swallowed the Senate whole. Right now, we live this sort of frenzied media circus--that's not to beat up on the media, that's to beat up on the Senate as a place that people are more thinking about those distant tribes and the things we're screaming at each other against, rather than the things we should be for together. You should be for the place where you're from, the neighborhood in the city or the small town farming community where I am from. But when you're temporarily thrown together in a new community the Senate should be a place that actually does some empathy and we're pretty crappy at that right now.
SENATOR RICK SCOTT: I had the same issue when I ran a large hospital company. And I said-- I did the exact same thing, I said I had hospitals in Europe. I said I'm not paying more for drugs in Europe than I'm paying in the United States. It's-- it's not-- it's not fair to Americans and that's why I'm going to-- I'm going to work hard to get that passed--
As the government shutdown enters its second day with little indication that a deal is within reach, Republicans and Democrats are blaming each other for failing to reach an agreement on spending and immigration.
He believes the increased age limit for buying rifles will be found unconstitutional. Instead of adding gun restrictions, he said, the state should tighten school security and blamed the massacre, which left 17 dead, on local and federal officials who did not stop suspect Nikolas Cruz despite numerous warnings.
It's true that exchanges attract mostly low-income people who likely have health issues and can only afford the lowest premiums. According to government analysis, about half of all exchange customers chose the cheapest plans. In rural areas where you may have only a handful of people in the exchange and all of them need lots of health care, you've got a disproportionate risk, said Cynthia Cox, associate director of health reform and private insurance at the Kaiser foundation.
Pennsylvania's highest court made several rulings Thursday that have the potential to help Biden in the state, reports CBS News campaign reporter Zak Hudak. First, the state Supreme Court ruled that the Green Party's presidential candidate can't be on the general election ballot because of a failure to closely follow nomination procedures. Then, the court ruled that Pennsylvanians will have a three-day extension to return mail ballots with the Postal Service and the option to return them in drop boxes. That decision could mean many more Democratic votes are counted in Pennsylvania. In the state's June primary, over twice as many Democrats as Republicans applied to vote by mail. In that election, counties received nearly 100,000 mail-in ballots after Election Day, the majority of which came in the three days following it, the secretary of the commonwealth testified in another court case. That's over twice as many votes than Mr. Trump won the state by in 2016.
The five ads all unveiled today focus around the argument that Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are too weak and too radical to protect Americans and keep small businesses safe. In one, a man named Scott talks about businesses being burned to the ground. I'm not much for politics but Joe Biden is so weak, he'll never stand up for folks like us, he says.
When asked whether he disagreed with the president on any issue, Hawley said he would encourage him to keep a hard line on spending.
In his speech on Tuesday, Trump suggested he's aware of his popularity problem, noting that people have said, But Mr. Trump, you're not a nice person.
SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR: --I just mentioned a number of other things that would also have to be done. So, the best thing here--
2001-2008: Managing Director in Lehman Brothers' Investment Banking Division
Also in the interview, Tyler took a swipe at Santorum's conservative record, pointing specifically to Santorum's endorsement of Arlen Specter in the 2004 Senate race and suggesting it was Santorum's fault that President Obama's health care overhaul passed.
A new CBS News Battleground Tracker poll shows former the former vice president with a slight lead in a state that Mr. Trump won in 2016. The poll shows Biden two percentage points ahead of the president there. (That's within the statistical margin of error.)
SEN. SCOTT: You know I- look, I- I'm going to continue to work on- I'm- I'm a business guy. The way I got my stuff done in business is every day I said, What could I get done today?
I don't have to tell anyone how important this election is, because we see it everyday and the difference couldn't be more clear, McSally said.
What I did for New York, Donald Trump will do for America, he said. Every time New York suffered a tragedy, Donald Trump was there to help.
Gillum said he would have pushed for a stronger bill than Scott signed.
Speaker Nancy Pelosi: I have no idea. I have no idea. He may be whitewashing, but I don't know if he's covering anything up. There's no use having that discussion. All we need to do is see the Mueller report.
Behind the front lines with U.S. soldier training Iraqi troops
So I thought that what he said was extremely unwise and even dangerous. And indeed, you can look at the propaganda on a lot of the terrorists sites, and what Donald Trump says about Muslims is used to recruit fighters, because they want to create a war between us.
LANHEE CHEN: Your-- your point. I'm sorry.
That plan went haywire when the Supreme Court later ruled that states were not required to expand Medicaid coverage but could do so voluntarily. As a result, people in nonexpansion states with incomes below the ACA subsidy limits often don't qualify for Medicaid. Indeed, the survey found the steepest increases in uninsured rates occurred in states that did not expand Medicaid.
Atifa Robinson, who also lives in a Kenosha suburb, said, Those ads just encourage people to create a divide between our communities. And what I've learned is, if we sit down and talk about the situation, what we have is a common ground, is that we do want to see change.
The rallies themselves are more akin to jam band concerts than political speeches - more Jessica by the Allman Brothers than the Gettysburg Address by Abraham Lincoln. He doesn't use a teleprompter, but that's because he doesn't have a written speech. Trump talks at the audience off the top of his head usually for about an hour, meandering from topic to topic in a one-sided conversation, sometimes interrupting himself, or being interrupted by the crowd or protesters.
We're gonna be the party of great health care, President Trump said in the Oval Office on Tuesday, a day after his Justice Department sided with a district court's judgment that the Affordable Care Act should be overturned. Obamacare doesn't work, it's too expensive...It's a disaster for our people.
The case was one of 10 the Supreme Court heard remotely via teleconference due to the coronavirus pandemic, which closed the building to the public and roiled the remainder of the court's term.
Speaker Nancy Pelosi: No, I think I happen to be a manifestation of the women power that is coming forth now, but only one manifestation.
On the other hand, Trump doesn't object to Pence's support for the Iraq war, although he slams Hillary Clinton for her vote for the war.
JOHN DICKERSON: But in this is where politics gets in it, too, because you have a politician saying your job is not going away. I'm going to protect it. You're not going to have to re-learn. And-- and so that comes back-- brings me back to politics again sending the wrong messages from what you want to say.
New info on Navy officer accused of passing on intel secrets
Vice President Mike Pence's press secretary Katie Miller tested positive for the coronavirus on Friday morning, just as the vice president was getting ready to fly to Des Moines, Iowa. Air Force Two was delayed an hour, according to pool reports, and six other staffers were asked to deplane and get tested out of an abundance of caution. Miller was not initially identified as the staffer but shortly after the news broke, Mr. Trump told reporters during a meeting with Republican members of Congress that a young woman, Katie, tested positive. It is a press person, the president added. Soon after, CBS News confirmed Katie Miller, press secretary to the vice president, and wife of White House adviser Stephen Miller, as the staffer in question. CBS News campaign reporter Musadiq Bidar says this leads to the possibility that the entire West Wing of the White House has now been directly or indirectly exposed to the coronavirus. Mr. Trump said she hasn't come into contact with me, but added that she spent time with the vice president. Earlier in the day, a senior administration official told pool reporters the person was not on the plane and not scheduled to be on the trip to Des Moines. According to the print pool reports, the senior administration official said the vice president and the president have not had contact with this person recently. The official added that about 10 people in Pence's circle are tested regularly.
A few weeks later, Braver traveled to Honduras with Haley as she conferred with senior officials; witnessed a drug enforcement exercise; and also made time to visit a U.S.-funded afterschool program.
In the latest CBS News/New York Times Poll, few registered voters have an opinion of Melania Trump, the potential First Lady in a Donald Trump presidency. Sixty-nine percent are undecided or haven't heard enough about her to have an opinion. Among those with an opinion, 15 percent have a favorable view of Mrs.Trump while, 12 percent have an unfavorable view.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Can-- can you just put a button on this, though?
MARGARET BRENNAN: In the sentencing memo that the special counsel wrote that he provided useful information concerning Russia-related matters core to its investigation. Does that mean-- are you saying that Cohen actually has evidence of conspiracy with Russia.
Verma's repeated refusal to answer yes-or-no questions visibly frustrated Democrats, who frequently cut her off.
A key issue is coverage for the nearly 3 million Arizonans with preexisting conditions. In Congress, Sinema voted to keep that coverage under Obamacare. McSally voted to repeal it, but said she still wants to cover those with preexisting conditions.
The White House had no comment on Mr. Biden's expected order, but the two people familiar with the plan said the new enrollment period would not go into effect immediately. Instead, the White House wants to provide time for the Department of Health and Human Services to mount a marketing campaign, and for insurers to get ready for an influx of new customers.
I know many people at the White House, and one in particular, and the last person he wants to run against is Donald Trump, that I can tell you, he said.
CLINTON: Well, first, let me start by saying that so much of what he's just said is not right, but he gets to run his campaign any way he chooses. He gets to decide what he wants to talk about. Instead of answering people's questions, talking about our agenda, laying out the plans that we have that we think can make a better life and a better country, that's his choice.
President Donald Trump: Of course you did.
David Turner, a Democratic Governors Association spokesperson, said he was confident people would vote on local issues like health care and education, regardless of whether they support Mr. Trump.
Biden has drawn sharp contrasts with Sanders and Warren on healthcare by saying that Democrats should build on the Affordable Care Act rather than pushing for a Medicare for All system that eliminates private insurance.
No matter where we're from, we're united by the same daily needs -- a good job, a good education for our kids, good health care, an affordable place to live. The need to be acknowledged for our contributions, not for our gender or who we love. We all hope our children have clean air to breathe and clean water to drink. We all hope they can worry about their studies, not their safety, Castro said.
Because NAFTA, signed by her husband, is perhaps the greatest disaster trade deal in the history of the world. Not in this country. It stripped us of manufacturing jobs. We lost our jobs. We lost our money. We lost our plants. It is a disaster. And now she wants to sign TPP, even though she says now she's for it. She called it the gold standard. And by the way, at the last debate, she lied, because it turned out that she did say the gold standard and she said she didn't say it. They actually said that she lied. OK? And she lied. But she's lied about a lot of things.
Asked whether he would commit to funding and keeping the HHS department's Office of Minority Health Resource Center, Price refused to say.
JAMELLE BOUIE: It's-- health care is an issue where President Trump I think gets especially vulnerable, not just because the administration doesn't have any particular plans. But you look at this 2016 coalition there was more blue collar than any Republican coalition had been before. And it depends on maintaining certain margins with blue collar whites--
'May the Force be with you' came out of medieval Christianity, where 'May God go with you' was a symbol that you would be safe. We wanted something as simple as that, an everyday expression that linked to the power of the Force that wasn't overbearing.
Prayer has always been at the center of the American life. America is a nation of believers, and together we are strengthened by the power of prayer, said Mr. Trump at the Rose Garden ceremony.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we got that call this week from Mike Bloomberg, Jamelle, in that leaked memo.
Vice President Mike Pence: Thanksgiving is one of my favorite holidays.
Joachim Roenneberg Alastair Grant/AP In February 1943 World War II saboteur Joachim Roenneberg (August 30, 1919-October 21, 2018) headed a five-man team that daringly blew up a plant producing heavy water, depriving Nazi Germany of a key ingredient it could have used to make nuclear weapons. Roenneberg, then 23, was tapped by the Special Operations Executive, or SOE (Britain's wartime intelligence gathering and sabotage unit) to destroy key parts of the heavily-guarded plant in Telemark, in southern Norway. Parachuting onto snow-covered mountains, the group was joined by a handful of other commando soldiers before skiing to their destination. They then penetrated the fortress-like heavy-water plant to blow up its production line. Roenneberg said he made a last-minute decision to cut the length of his fuse from several minutes to seconds, ensuring that the explosion would take place but making it more difficult to escape. The group skied hundreds of miles across the mountains to escape, and Roenneberg (wearing a British uniform) ended up in neighboring neutral Sweden. For this and other operations as part of the resistance movement, Roenneberg received Norway's highest military decoration, and was honored by the U.S., British and French governments as well. In a 2014 Norwegian documentary about Operation Gunnerside, Roenneberg said the daring operation went like a dream – a reference to the fact that not a single shot was fired.
A Texas state court of appeals on Friday upheld a lower court's decision that blocked Governor Greg Abbott's order limiting counties to one drop-off site for mail ballots, reports CBS News campaign reporter Adam Brewster. Republicans are expected to appeal the decision to the Texas Supreme Court, so it's unclear if more drop-off sites will open. This is separate from a federal case where an appeals court ruled that Abbott's order was valid. Texas does not offer no-excuse mail voting. To vote by mail, voters have to be either 65 years or older, disabled, out of the county on Election Day and early voting period, or in jail but otherwise eligible. More than 787,000 Texans have already voted by mail, but another 5.6 million have voted early in-person. Combined, more than 37.7% of registered Texans have voted and already turnout is at 71% of the total turnout from the 2016 presidential election.
MARGARET BRENNAN: And that is Wyoming Republican Senator John Barrasso, who's also a doctor, we should note. He was a key negotiator in the efforts to come up with a Republican measure that would replace Obamacare. I do want to get to that, but picking up on where Stephen just left off, he says shut down may still happen if necessary to get this money for the border wall. It's 5 billion.
TRUMP: OK. But you were in contact — excuse me. You were...
I actually got calls from Sen. Rob Portman and Sen. Amy Klobuchar, who said that they, because of my fact checks, they were going to be much more careful in the future, Kessler said.
Pennsylvania Rep. Charlie Dent, among only 20 Republicans who voted against the House repeal bill, said GOP candidates will be vulnerable because of the bill's impact and because President Donald Trump privately labeled the GOP measure mean a month after it passed.
Kaul was able to proceed with withdrawing the state after court rulings last month struck down the law requiring legislative approval. Republicans are appealing those rulings.

Last summer, he invited us to his ranch just outside of Sedona, Arizona, 24 acres of old-growth trees, a family of hawks and a rippling creek that his dog Burma likes to swim in.
Regardless of the politically contentious nature of immigration reform, said Wiehe, the data show undocumented immigrants greatly contribute to our nation's economy, not just in labor but also with tax dollars.

In August, he promised to direct his treasury secretary to label China a currency manipulator.
She's just hit her 100th day as speaker. She recently called the president to ask for a meeting on infrastructure, but there's no sign that the gridlock that has plagued Congress for years is easing.
Bob Woodward will appear on CBS News 60 Minutesthis Sunday with audio excerpts from nine hours of on-the-record interviews with President Trump.
Throughout the pandemic, the USDS has been aiding the White House coronavirus task force in providing crucial statistics to top officials setting policy.
But her becoming speaker was in doubt last December when a group in her caucus agitated for a change to someone younger. It was the president, of all people, who rescued her, in that now famous Oval Office meeting.
10:35 p.m. ET Before moving on to his prepared remarks, former Speaker Newt Gingrich said that delegates on the convention floor misunderstood a part of Ted Cruz's speech Wednesday night.

CLINTON: Nine million people lost their jobs.
9:31 p.m. Donald Trump says the trade deficit was almost $800 billion in 2015.
Lesley Stahl: You look terrific. How is this possible?
MARGARET BRENNAN: Are Americans going to see a shutdown over Christmas?
Not graduating on time has been a prime reason why the student debt burden has ballooned. According to the nonprofit group Complete College America, less than 20 percent of students graduate on time at the nation's top, public four-year colleges and only 5 percent at community colleges. The reasons vary, but the extra time in school -- which adds to student loans -- means an extra $50,000 to $68,000 in expenses and lost wages.
MARGARET BRENNAN: --they're already trying to enact the cuts.
McCaul warned that U.S. national security is at risk because its enemies no longer fear America and are plotting against it as a result of President Obama's and Clinton's policies.
And I'll tell you what. I didn't think I'd say this, but I'm going to say it, and I hate to say it. But if I win, I am going to instruct my attorney general to get a special prosecutor to look into your situation, because there has never been so many lies, so much deception. There has never been anything like it, and we're going to have a special prosecutor.
Administration officials on Tuesday confirmed they don't keep track of that information and pointed to the McKinsey report for data on the matter.
Mr. Obama conceded to CBS' Major Garrett that we would not have rolled out something knowing very well that it wasn't going to work the way it was supposed to, given all the scrutiny that we knew was gonna be on the website.
With the shift of balance in Congress, Hall says such changes may be more likely. Plus, some of these provisions have bipartisan support, she added.
SENATOR RICK SCOTT (R-Florida/@SenRickScott): Well, first of, I'm glad the-- the President cares about health care. I've-- I've-- I ran the largest hospital company. I care about the cost of health care and that's what I've focused on. I know it's going to be tough. I look forward to, you know, to seeing what the President's going to put out. But with Nancy Pelosi in the House it's going to be tough to get something done. But we do know that Medicare for all which Senator Sanders is all in on is going to just ruin our health care system.
TRUMP: Well, I consider her statement about my children to be a very nice compliment. I don't know if it was meant to be a compliment, but it is a great — I'm very proud of my children. And they've done a wonderful job, and they've been wonderful, wonderful kids. So I consider that a compliment.
FACT CHECK: Partly true. Premiums are going up, but Trump is greatly exaggerating how much of a cost increase any given insurance plan has undergone. Nationally, premiums on average have increased from 4.4 percent to 13 percent, according to Politifact's reported estimates. Additionally, the Kaiser Foundation reported an average increase of 10 percent for their 2016-2017 insurance plans.
FACT CHECK: False. Clinton used the term in June during an interview on NBC News' Today Show. She appeared on the program on June 13, following the Pulse nightclub shooting in Orlando.

All Americans deserve accountability and respect, and that's what we are giving to our wonderful heroes, our veterans. Thank you.
The Treasury Department issued related sanctions, and the State Department made strong comments but basically did nothing. Still, this is arguably more than Obama publicly did in 2009 when protesters were shot in streets of Tehran. -- Margaret Brennan and Gaby Ake
Otto's Parents, Fred and Cindy Warmbier, are with us tonight -- along with Otto's brother and sister, Austin and Greta, the president said. You are powerful witnesses to a menace that threatens our world, and your strength inspires us all. Tonight, we pledge to honor Otto's memory with American resolve.
Meadows said the speed with which Barrett is confirmed depends on McConnell and making sure that all the senators are well-informed of the judge's credentials, which are impeccable. He said the White House will begin delivering information on Barrett to Capitol Hill on Monday.
House Republicans have scheduled a vote for Thursday on a short-term spending bill -- the fourth one Congress has had on its plate since September -- that would fund the government through Feb. 16. Democrats, however, remain largely opposed to the measure, known as a continuing resolution (CR), because they want it tied to a larger immigration deal over the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program and border security.
JOHN DICKERSON: Right. But in 2013 when there was a shutdown, they did in fact get paid, right--
The Republican National Committee (RNC) dismissed her announcement on Sunday, with a spokesman saying she has virtually no grassroots backing and referencing several news reports detailing a pattern of alleged abusive treatment toward her staff, which has reportedly hindered her efforts to recruit campaign personnel.
One of those proposals is to equalize the tax benefit of contributing to a retirement plan so that higher-income earners aren't getting more of the benefit than the lower-income workers, that it's standard across the board, said Anne Tyler Hall, founder and principal of Hall Benefits Law.
We seem to be migrating to, on the one camp, sort of nostalgia - let's just get rid, if you will, of the incumbent president and we can go back to doing what we used to do, he said. Or, you know, it's our way, our big idea, or no way. And neither of those, it seems to me, seizes the moment to pull the nation together.
SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: Well, threats against the American people to be sure. Threats against our allies. I believe in NATO. I believe that the United States everything being equal, should be working with other countries in alliance, not doing it alone.
If Max Boot wants the GOP destroyed, in one sense he's already gotten his wish. The Republican Party and its establishment were blown up by Donald Trump and his populist candidacy that overran the party itself. (Much as Bernie Sanders would have done to the Democrats without intervention from the Democratic National Committee.)
Suburban women in states like Ohio and Wisconsin could again prove pivotal in this election, especially White women without college degrees. So, neither President Trump nor former Vice President Joe Biden are taking them for granted. Both campaigns have launched an all-out assault of political advertising.
In this case, known as California v. Texas, Republican-led states and the Trump administration argue Obamacare's individual mandate is unconstitutional, as the 2017 tax reform package eliminated the financial penalty for individuals who do not have health insurance. The red states and the Justice Department also say that the full health care law should be struck down because it cannot stand without the individual mandate.
Lesley Stahl: --and people can see--
The president said, before he was elected, that it was his objective to have a single-payer system. I think that's where he would like to go, he said. My own view is that if Obamacare were allowed to stand ... you would see down the road private insurance getting squeezed out, and ultimately a call for a government insurance plan or a government insurance program of some kind. And ultimately it would take a lion's share of the health market.
Stephen Hillenburg Junko Kimura/Getty Images A former marine biology teacher with a talent for art, Stephen Hillenburg (August 21, 1961-November 26, 2018), who grew up in Oklahoma, far from an ocean, dreamed up the character SpongeBob SquarePants, a perennially-optimistic yellow sponge who lives in a pineapple under the sea in Bikini Bottom. Utterly clueless and devil-may-care, the ridiculously gleeful SpongeBob, his starfish sidekick Patrick, and a vast cast of oceanic creatures quickly became a television hit on Nickelodeon, appealing to college kids and parents as well as children. Over the course of 20 years the absurdist cartoon won four Emmys and 15 Kids Choice Awards. 2004 saw a big-screen movie (complete with singing and dancing pirates), and in 2015 a sequel, The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out of Water, was released. The characters even made their way to Broadway in a musical (look, a tap-dancing squid!) that hooked a dozen Tony nominations. In 2004 Hillenburg told David Edelstein, writing for The New York Times, The show is about watching an innocent character in this world that he lives in. And the movie is about embracing innocence. It's saying that the childlike mind is O.K. It's saying that dorks can be really important.
On The Jay Weber Show, the talk show host agreed, saying that he believed at the time that it was a Republican fallacy.
Marketing efforts for alternative policies have started in earnest, said Fish-Parcham. If you're searching on the web to find insurance information, these plans may pop up, and it isn't always clear that they aren't exchange-based plans, she explained.
Klobuchar is a member of the powerful Senate Judiciary Committee, and made a name for herself for her calm yet incisive questioning of then-Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh during the contentious hearings in September. After telling him about her father's struggles with alcoholism, she asked Kavanaugh whether he had ever experienced a blackout. He retorted, Have you? The moment quickly went viral, and Kavanaugh later apologized.

CBS News spoke to several candidates, as well as former 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Julián Castro, who is supporting district attorneys backing policing reform as part of their agenda.
The Justice Department on Thursday moved to dismiss charges against Michael Flynn, President Trump's first national security adviser. Flynn pleaded guilty in December 2017 to lying to the FBI about his contacts with the former Russian ambassador to the U.S. — but in January, Flynn asked the court to allow him to withdraw his guilty plea, citing the government's bad faith, vindictiveness and breach of the plea agreement.
Lesley Stahl: Do you take any responsibility for the country being divided against itself? Do you feel that?
Trump campaign surrogate Congressman Dr. Brad Wenstrup told CBS News campaign reporter Nicole Sganga Wednesday that he supports the CDC guidelines on mask-wearing. I think the advice that has been given throughout, from the CDC has been, has been wise, Wenstrup said. The congressman said he feels the country should be focused on physical distancing and six to eight feet of separation when we did not have masks. The president's re-election bid does not typically enforce social distancing at campaign rallies but offers optional masks to attendees upon entrance to events.
Today, in remarks in Wilmington, Delaware, he focused on the quality of the vaccine trial science: Let me be clear: I trust vaccines, I trust the scientists, but I don't trust Donald Trump. Biden also expressed more confidence in his ability to implement a national face mask mandate if he is elected, CBS News campaign reporter Bo Erickson reports. Biden told a small group of reporters gathered he would sign an executive order implementing the national mandate if deemed by administration lawyers as legal.

Tonight, you will also hear from his family about whether they'll play roles in a Trump presidency.
In Phoenix, Bloomberg touted his experience as New York mayor, as well as doubling down on his stances on Medicare for All and a wealth tax.
He added, I think it's fair to say the [Obamacare] rollout has been rough so far, and I think everybody understands I'm not happy the rollout has been wrought with a whole range problems I've been deeply concerned about.
He then engaged in a call and response exchange with delegates on the floor in which he said he would present facts about her tenure as secretary of state and they would decide if she is guilty or not guilty.
House Speaker Paul Ryan will leave Congress having achieved one of his career goals: rewriting the tax code. On his other defining aim — balancing the budget and cutting back benefit programs like Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid — Ryan has utterly failed.
Like Obamacare, the Republican plan would make the tax credits refundable, meaning low income Americans get the money even if they pay little or no taxes.
The Department of Justice has determined that the district court's judgment should be affirmed, the Justice Department wrote in a recent memo. The Democrats argue, however, that if the legal position prevails in court and the entire ACA is struck down, there would be catastrophic implications for millions of Americans and the U.S. health care system, with 21 million Americans at risk of losing their coverage.
Crowd: Lock her up! Lock her up! Lock her up!
MARGARET BRENNAN: I am Margaret Brennan in Washington. And this week on FACE THE NATION, the state of Nevada has declared Bernie Sanders the winner in its Democratic contest as the candidates move on to South Carolina for the next primary contest, the question is is there anything or anyone who can stop him?
It's heart-wrenching. I don't know the details of exactly what happened, said Ryan, who added that he had Hastert's portrait removed from the speaker's lobby outside the House floor last year.
CLINTON: ... because everything he just said is absolutely false, but I'm not surprised.
ELIZABETH PALMER: Meanwhile, a security and media circus surrounds the WHO team of experts in Wuhan wherever they go, looking for the source of the virus. Compare that to the peace movie buff Lisa Enroth is looking forward to. A Swedish COVID nurse, she won a week in a cozy lighthouse to watch all sixty entries in Göteborg Film Festival. Now, that's self-isolation.
I'd rather lose a campaign that we put it all on the field substantively... than win a campaign based on style, she said. If this is about style he can go back to 'The Apprentice.' That was really fun and successful and lucrative for him.
And on Tuesday he won the Indiana Republican primary, part of a very good night for the GOP.
We have enough problems in this country. I believe in building safe zones. I believe in having other people pay for them, as an example, the Gulf states, who are not carrying their weight, but they have nothing but money, and take care of people. But I don't want to have, with all the problems this country has and all of the problems that you see going on, hundreds of thousands of people coming in from Syria when we know nothing about them. We know nothing about their values and we know nothing about their love for our country.
Defense Secretary Mark Esper began the briefing by discussing what the White House is doing to crack down on drug cartels in the Caribbean, with the president claiming that this effort is also part of the crackdown on the coronavirus.
Twenty states and the District of Columbia and the Democratic led-House of Representatives, all of which intervened in the case, asked the Supreme Court in January to fast-track review of the legal battle over Obamacare and decide the case before the end of its current term. The questions raised by the case, they argued, cannot be left unanswered for a prolonged period of time.
And the people may be onto something. According to the Vote View project founded by Carnegie-Mellon University, party-line voting by members of Congress is at the highest level in more than a century. It's hard to believe, but as recently as the 1970s, members of Congress only voted with their party an average of 60 percent of the time. Today that number is 90 percent.
SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: Good to be here.
Ryan, who has emphatically ruled out a presidential run and accepting the nomination this year, said he's really not laying the groundwork for a White House bid in 2020.
MARGARET BRENNAN: --you're a key voice on, and that is immigration and also want to talk about the possible shut down here. One very particular case here, this seven-year-old migrant girl who passed away. She was a migrant from Guatemala named Jakelin Caal. She died some hours after passing into U.S. territory while she was under the protection of Customs and the Border Patrol. Who bears responsibility for her death?
TRUMP: Well, I'll tell you what it means. You're going to have plans that are so good, because we're going to have so much competition in the insurance industry. Once we break out — once we break out the lines and allow the competition to come...
MILLER: This is a- this is a very- if it comes to it, absolutely. This is a very fundamental issue. At stake is the question of whether or not the United States remains a sovereign country. Whether or not we can establish and enforce rules for entrance into our country. The Democrat Party has a simple choice, they can either choose to fight for America's working class or to promote illegal immigration. You can't do both.
Those close to the transition insisted on anonymity in commenting because they were not authorized to publicly discuss the private process.

Unlike Beshear in Kentucky, Hood is an opponent of gun control and abortion rights. Hood has even been borrowing Trump's drain the swamp messaging and uses it against Reeves in ads and on the trail.
His selection of Barrett delighted conservatives, as Barrett became a darling of the religious conservatives in 2017 during her confirmation hearing for her nomination to the 7th Circuit. During her appearance, Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein of California, told Barrett the dogma lives loudly within you, and that's a concern. Barrett is a devout Catholic, and many Republicans viewed the comment as a bigoted reference to her faith.
Lesley Stahl: What about Bill Clinton? Did you talk to him?
Lesley Stahl: Well, what about the governor of Michigan?
The move, made by executive memo Saturday, also removes the director of national intelligence and the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff as members who would attend all meetings, and instead will invite them only when it is deemed that issues pertaining to their responsibilities and expertise are to be discussed, according to the memo.
One last thing to consider: There's the strong possibility that no matter who is elected, the next president won't be able to get Congress to pass all or even some of his or her proposals. So it's not certain how the election will ultimately affect Americans' ability to retire.
BIDEN: I don't know. I'll let you make that judgment.
Its investigators approached the individual agencies assigned to verify personal information and found large numbers of inquiries in which the data hub could not confirm details.
PAUL RYAN: I'm saving you time--
Lesley Stahl: Yeah, but then some women won't be able to get an abortion?
The House passed a continuing resolution on Friday to keep the government open, which was rejected by the Senate. House Speaker Paul Ryan of Wisconsin told CBS News' Face the Nation on Sunday that the House would back a revised version being discussed in the Senate that would extend funding until Feb. 8. He joined us to discuss the shutdown and the possible paths forward as we head into the work week.
We dismissed or are moving to dismiss the charges against General Flynn. At any stage during a proceeding, even after indictment or a conviction or a guilty plea, the Department can move to dismiss the charges if we determine that our standards of prosecution have not been met.
Both campaigns are raising massive amounts of money, but have very different priorities about how to spend it. In addition to advertising, President Trump's campaign has invested heavily in a muscular field operation and ground game that will turn out our voters, while the Biden campaign is waging almost exclusively an air war, said Trump campaign manager Bill Stepien in a statement. We like our strategy better.
The differences are over immigration, tax reform and, of course, health care.
We passed in December funding for these natural disasters and the hurricanes, and the Senate Democrats have been filibustering these bills. So the point I'm trying to make, John, is the Senate Democrats have chosen: Filibuster CHIP, filibuster appropriations, filibuster getting these things done. And then blame the dysfunction on everybody else.
Republicans say the bill wasteful, bloated and a slush fund. None are expected to support it, which would make this the only pandemic relief package to pass without bipartisan support.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Alright, Mr. Vice President. I'm told we're wrapping here.
Later Sunday, Mr. Trump mocked his potential 2020 opponent for discussing efforts to mitigate climate change under heavy snowfall. Amy Klobuchar announced that she is running for President, talking proudly of fighting global warming while standing in a virtual blizzard of snow, ice and freezing temperatures. Bad timing. By the end of her speech she looked like a Snowman(woman)! the president tweeted.
CLINTON: Because we talked about what we wanted to do. We might have had some differences, and we had a lot of debates...
The rule comes just weeks after the administration broadened the reach of association health plans, another type of health plan that skirts coverage mandates established by the Affordable Care Act.
We need somebody who can take the brand of the United States and make it great again, he said. Ladies and gentlemen: I am officially running for president of the United States, and we are going to make our country great again.
MARGARET BRENNAN: You're in Republican leadership. Senator John Cornyn, your colleague, said there's no plan right now from the White House. Did you hear a plan here today, do you know what the White House is asking you to do?
You can expect presidential candidates to make a lot of claims during the CBS News Republican debate in South Carolina Saturday night, but some just might not be true. Reporters are supposed to make sure of their facts as a matter of course, but this campaign has seen a growing army of political fact checkers who are expected to explain how they checked what candidates say.
President Donald Trump: We understand the disease. We understand the elderly, and we are taking care of them like nobody's ever taken care of 'em. So we are taking care of our people.
Spencer Stone Kenzo Tribouillard/AFP/Getty Images French President Francois Hollande shakes hands with off-duty U.S. Air Force Staff Sergeant Spencer Stone (C), next to off-duty serviceman Alek Skarlatos and Anthony Sadler (R) and U.S. ambassador to France Jane Hartley after a reception at the Elysee Palace in Paris on August 24, 2015, during which were awarded with France's top Legion d'Honneur medal in recognition of their bravery after they overpowered the train attacker. Stone was injured while trying to subdue the suspect when he was slashed with a box cutter, nearly losing his finger. Stone was awarded the Purple Heart, the Airman's Medal and a promotion to Staff Sergeant.
SEN. SCOTT: It's going to ruin Medicare.
Included in the package is a permanent repeal of some taxes implemented in the Affordable Care Act, including the so-called Cadillac tax on high-cost employer-sponsored health insurance plans and a tax medical devices. The measure, a product of a divided Congress, also secures health care and pension benefits for roughly 100,000 retired coal miners, and increases the legal age to buy tobacco products, including e-cigarettes and vaping devices, from 18 to 21.
KELSEY SNELL: Yeah, you absolutely do. And I think it-- also a big challenge, particularly for Democrats in the House who don't want to get into this fight right at the very beginning of taking power, because there won't have to be facing off against the President, and potentially making compromises that many of these people were elected saying that they would never compromise on. So, it-- it would be more difficult for some Democrats in particular to move this conversation to January.
Kaiser Foundation analyst Levitt said $450 billion seems high to him.
Today it appears that the GOP has an advantage, but who knows what the map will look like a decade from now? As population shifts from blue states like California and Massachusetts to red states like Texas and Georgia, a future electoral map could unfold that benefits Democrats. Do they really want to blow up a system that's worked well for more than 200 years because in one election it gave us President Trump?
Tuesday's theme is Make America Work Again, with a focus on economic issues and a critique of the Obama administration's handling of the economy. Wednesday's is Make America First Again, which the program says will suggest bad policies and poor leadership have weakened our position in the world. Thursday, the night Trump gives his big speech, is Make America One Again, a nod to party and national unity.
She said it was a strange element of my life that they attended, and she was surprised that they were there and it made me uncomfortable and I hope I made them uncomfortable with everything.
While he aggressively challenged Republican viewpoints, Mr. Obama also forcefully defended his own record.

Republicans in the Michigan Legislature filed a request on Friday asking the Michigan Supreme Court to immediately hear their case challenging Governor Gretchen Whitmer's use of emergency powers during the COVID-19 pandemic, report CBS News campaign reporters Adam Brewster and Jack Turman. The request for emergency-bypass review would bring the case right to the state's highest court and skip a hearing at the appeals level after a Court of Claims judge on Thursday ruled in favor of Whitmer's extended state of emergency. If ever there were a case that warranted this Court's immediate involvement, then this would be it, the legislature said in its filing. When Whitmer extended Michigan's state of emergency at the end of April, she said that two emergency powers laws, one from 1945 and one from 1976, gave her the authority to do that. A state of emergency gives her power to issue executive orders like her stay at home order. Judge Cynthia Diane Stephens ruled on Thursday that Whitmer was allowed to extend the state of emergency under the 1945 law, but overstepped her boundaries on the 1976 law because that law requires legislative approval to extend a state of emergency after 28 days. Judge Stephens' ruling kept the state of emergency in effect, along with the executive orders related to it. The day after the ruling, Whitmer extended Michigan's state of emergency until June 19 and her safer at home order until June 12.
Collins advised consumers to keep two things in mind as they consider their health insurance options:
MARGARET BRENNAN: So you-- are you--
JOHN DICKERSON: I'm not trying to assign blame. I'm trying to get- just figure out what's going on here. This is a very familiar play. We've been here before as you say--
FACT CHECK: False. To this day, no one has said they've seen bombs in the apartment of the San Bernardino shooters' apartment. An unidentified man noted that he saw suspicious activity surrounding their apartment, but made no mention of weapons or anything actionable. As the man told CBS' Los Angeles affiliate, We noticed, one day like six Middle Eastern guys walk by across the street, kind of dressed nice, and they would walk around and go over to state street and eat there, because I saw them eating there when I went to the paint store, and we sat around thinking what're those guys doing in this neighborhood?
While he has also said that at least a dozen women are under consideration, sources have told CBS News Biden is seriously considering five to eight of these potential picks. Beyond contact with the vetting committee, top Biden staff like campaign manager Jen O'Malley Dillon and other senior advisers are in frequent contact — sometimes every day — with aides to these women. Several high-profile Democrats told CBS News they are urging Biden to pick a woman of color.
Over the next few weeks, the House and Senate will be voting on an immigration reform package. In recent months, my administration has met extensively with both Democrats and Republicans to craft a bipartisan approach to immigration reform. Based on these discussions, we presented Congress with a detailed proposal that should be supported by both parties as a fair compromise, one where nobody gets everything they want, but where our country gets the critical reforms it needs and must have.
The siphoning effect. As with association plans, health care advocates worry that inexpensive short-term plans will siphon off healthier patients who feel confident they don't need comprehensive coverage or who can't afford full policies. That will leave individual and exchange insurers covering sicker, more costly patients without the benefit of healthier patients in the insurance-risk pool. The result may be much higher premiums for ACA-compliant health plans.
President Donald Trump: That's no way to talk. That's no way to talk.
During his appearance with Mrs. Guaido, the president cited rising costs of premiums, saying people are going broke trying to pay for their health care costs. He maintained, however, that his administration had made it better by administering Obamacare very well but still slammed the policy as horrible no good, it's something that we can't live with in this country.
STEPHEN MILLER: --in the categories that correspond with these loopholes and the interventions--reckless, lawless interventions of district court judges. And this President has taken historic action to stem the tide of illegal immigration and to fight for working people in this country.
Your father wears a turban, your mother wears a sari. We looked different, everybody treated us different. But it was in that small town that I'm very grateful, because my parents reminded us that it's not about how you are different, it's about how you're similar.
Build the wall — it's the signature campaign promise that helped propel him to victory, and one of the most common chants at his rallies, even now.
So this is who Donald Trump is. And the question for us, the question our country must answer is that this is not who we are. That's why — to go back to your question — I want to send a message — we all should — to every boy and girl and, indeed, to the entire world that America already is great, but we are great because we are good, and we will respect one another, and we will work with one another, and we will celebrate our diversity.
So regardless of which way Puzder's nomination goes – and Education Secretary DeVos's example suggests he will prevail in the end – it will be a bloody victory.
MARGARET BRENNAN: And so that could be anything from a short-term continuing resolution that takes us right up to the beginning of a-- of the Democratic majority in January? Or, I-- I mean, what wiggle room is there here?
The senators up for reelection this year who have been watched closely throughout the whole process ended up voting along party lines on both articles, reports CBS News political unit associate producer Eleanor Watson. This group includes Democrats like Doug Jones of Alabama and Gary Peters of Michigan as well as Republicans like Susan Collins of Maine, Cory Gardner of Colorado, and Martha McSally of Arizona.
Based on Congressional Budget Office estimates, repeal would add $193 billion to the federal deficit from 2022-2029, by removing projected revenues off the government's books. The nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation expects that about 1 in 5 employers offering health insurance would have at least one insurance plan subject to the tax in 2022, and the share would grow quickly over time.
AP: Many Foundation donors met Clinton at State Department
The president has been talking about health care a plan for more than a year and said in July he would be signing one within two weeks. So far, the plan has not materialized. On Wednesday, Mr. Trump's chief of staff Mark Meadows said the plan is indeed ready, but it's unclear exactly when it will roll out. According to Meadows, it's more of an executive action with a legislative component.
JOHN DICKERSON: But do you accept their finding?
This week, the president has painted a bleak and sobering picture of the toll the coronavirus is expected to take on the country, with White House officials projecting 100,000 to 240,000 Americans will die from the illness even if mitigation measures are taken.
This comes after an ad from Bognet talking about making China pay for what they've done and one interview with a local radio host where he said, I think China's been stealing our jobs, stealing our intellectual property, they literally hack our factories, hack our companies to get the plans for products-- they're not our friend, they're our enemy.
MARGARET BRENNAN: it wasn't adequately equipped to deal with the record number of families coming across. Why aren't they?
The 2020 strategy for the Republican Party of Texas was recently unveiled — to Texas Democrats. The Dallas Morning News reports that a draft of the GOP plan ended up in Democratic emails Monday night, and it includes a list of 12 targeted state house districts and a preliminary digital advertising plan to attack Democrats. Their strategist memo also had a clause about potential decreased GOP turnout due to Never Trumpers, and a suggestion to prepare to target these voters to still vote for Republicans down ballot, reports Navarro.
I'm not involved in the replacement plan, Giroir told senators. I don't know what that is. I supply public health advice as much as I can for whatever that plan would be.
This is at least the third suit of its kind filed in Pennsylvania this year. One was struck down by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court earlier this month, and the other, filed by the the Priorities USA-backed Pennsylvania Alliance for Retired Americans, remains open.
Buying individual health insurance can be complicated. Collins encouraged consumers to make sure they get help to find a plan they can afford. We see that people who use a broker or navigator are more likely to enroll than those who don't, Collins said. That's why it's so important for people to get the help they need, rather than simply assuming they won't be able to afford coverage.
Here's a checklist of health care budget items and how they affect consumers:
As we rebuild America's strength and confidence at home, we are also restoring our strength and standing abroad.
The government said in March that a total of 11.4 million people signed up during open enrollment season, a dip of about 300,000 from last year.
PAUL RYAN: Exactly what they were saying in those days-well
You and your families deserve better than the dysfunction we're seeing in Congress.
Trump's campaign provided no proposals from the candidate specific to Social Security's financing or benefits design. Instead, it reiterated his campaign positions about building the wall, reforming individual and corporate income taxes, renegotiating trade agreements, reforming immigration policies, repealing Obamacare and repealing the Dodd-Frank Act, which reformed the financial industry following the recent financial crisis.

MARGARET BRENNAN: I'm Margaret Brennan in Washington. And this week on FACE THE NATION, chaos has turned to calm at the White House, but the challenges facing the newly elected President continue to grow. In the ten days since taking office, President Biden has issued a flood of executive actions dealing with COVID-19, immigration, Obamacare, climate change, overturning the travel ban, racial equity, transgender rights, the Keystone Pipeline, and abortion rights.
MARGARET BRENNAN: --they're not actually his supporters. Do you buy that?
COOPER: That first one goes to Secretary Clinton, because you started out the last one to the audience.
Eric Trump: I think very presidential. At the same time, my father, if he needs to be a fighter, he can be a fighter. And I think this country, quite frankly, needs a fighter. And I think that's what this country elected.
MARGARET BRENNAN: But on those particular instances--
Speaker Nancy Pelosi: That's like five people.
BEN DOMENECH: But keep in mind the context of this, which is just that Congress has for eighteen years really ceded its power when it comes to foreign policy issues that faced this nation, we're still operating under the same AUMF. We're still operating under the same--
MARGARET BRENNAN: But is there room for Democrats to work on those sort of issue specific things with Republicans?
Lesley Stahl: She ran last time.
STEPHEN MILLER: This is a-- this is a very-- if it comes to it, absolutely. This is a very fundamental issue. At stake is the question of whether or not the United States remains a sovereign country. Whether or not we can establish and enforce rules for entrance into our country. The Democrat Party has a simple choice. They can either choose to fight for America's working class or to promote illegal immigration. You can't do both.
Donald Trump: And yet I mentioned them at the Republican National Convention. And--
The big issues in this district include health care. Culberson opposes Obamacare while Fletcher says she wants to improve it. Immigration is another big issue, and both candidates want better security along the border. But Culberson wants to fund the border wall while Fletcher does not. There's also flood control: Hurricane Harvey was devastating, leaving thousands of homes ruined.

The failed GOP repeal effort helped turn the tables. A Wall Street Journal-NBC News poll last month showed people trust Democrats over Republicans for handling health care by 18 percentage points. A Kaiser Health Tracking Poll in February showed Obama's law with a favorable rating from 54 percent of Americans, its highest score in more than 80 Kaiser surveys since the statute's enactment.
You know, when we have a world where you have ISIS chopping off heads, where you have — and, frankly, drowning people in steel cages, where you have wars and horrible, horrible sights all over, where you have so many bad things happening, this is like medieval times. We haven't seen anything like this, the carnage all over the world.
Over the years, on too many occasions to count, I saw my father tear stories out of the newspaper about people whom he had never met who were facing some injustice or hardship, she said. He'd write a note to his assistant in his signature black felt-tip pen and request that the person be found and invited to Trump Tower to meet with him.

I will not be making decisions based on an arbitrary timeline or political or legal pressure. I'm not here to play games, she told reporters during her briefing on Friday. She accused Republicans in the legislature of engaging in political gamesmanship without substance after they refused to extend Michigan's state of emergency and authorized leaders to take legal action against Whitmer for her COVID-19 response. After the legislature did not extend the state of emergency, Whitmer signed executive orders Thursday night keeping it in place through May 28.
Put yourself in somebody else's shoes. Put yourself in the shoes of a mother and a father of an adult child that is struggling...Understand that poverty is real, he told reporters. When you die and get to the meeting with St. Peter, he's probably not going to ask you much about what you did about keeping government small. But he is going to ask you what you did for the poor. You better have a good answer.
That didn't work out too well, Trump told Fox News in an interview on New Year's Eve. We'll see how she does. I wish her well, I hope she does well. I'd love to run against her. Warren frequently taunted Mr. Trump during the 2016 campaign, and often takes to the president's favorite outlet, Twitter, to criticize him and his policies directly. Asked by Fox News whether Warren would be able to win, the president said, Well, that I don't know. You would have to ask her psychiatrist.
Price did not, however, commit to maintaining the current funding levels for Medicare and Medicaid programs, despite promises by Donald Trump during the presidential campaign not to touch those social safety nets.
Soon after making this comment, Trump revised his stance, saying it should be a state or local community decision instead.

When people apply for coverage through HealthCare.gov and state insurance exchanges, a behind-the-scenes electronic system called the data services hub pings federal agencies such as Social Security, IRS, and Homeland Security to verify their personal details. In a key finding, the GAO said that the administration does not aggregate, track and analyze the results of data hub inquiries -- instead just using the responses to process individual applications.

Look for some of the 2020 Democratic presidential contenders at the We the People summit, organized by more than a dozen national progressive organizations, in D.C. on Wednesday, June 13. Sens. Cory Booker; D-New Jersey, Kirsten Gillibrand, D-New York; Kamala Harris D-California; Bernie Sanders, D-Vermont; and Elizabeth Warren, D-Massachusetts will all address the gathering. Warren and former Planned Parenthood president Cecile Richards are also scheduled to speak at the ACLU Membership Conference in D.C. on Monday, June 11.

Bernie Sanders Bernie Sanders on 2020: We're going to win 04:49 A senator and former congressman from Vermont, Sanders, a democratic socialist, came to prominence nationally when he ran for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2016. Although he ultimately lost to Hillary Clinton, Sanders developed a devoted following among younger Democrats despite being an independent. At 78, Sanders is one of the oldest contenders for the Democratic nomination. A native of Brooklyn, he was mayor of Burlington, Vermont in the 1980s.

Higher interest rates are great for savers — but they can be a significant damper on business growth, since they make it more expensive to fund long-term investment. It also means that when interest rates shift even a little bit, there's there's a lot of treasuries behind that, said Slok. Already, the fastest-growing part of the federal budget is not new spending — it's interest payments on the public debt we've already incurred.
My goal is to get into October. We have until October 1. I'm going to do everything I know how to get into them, he said in New Hampshire. And then on October 1, depending on where things stand, I'll make a decision.
A handful of campaigns are racking up endorsements in California, from new congressional and statewide endorsements for Mike Bloomberg to 41 elected officials now backing Bernie Sanders, who has led recent polls in the state. But California Democratic Congressman Ami Bera, who helps lead his party's program to safeguard vulnerable incumbents, predicted swing district Democrats in California will not be backing Sanders.

She was the first senator to call on Sen. Al Franken to resign in 2017 after he was accused of sexual harassment by several women. A few big Democratic donors, including billionaire George Soros, have said that they will not support Gillibrand because of her position on Franken. She has also distanced herself from the Clintons. In November 2017, she said that President Bill Clinton should have resigned after his affair with White House intern Monica Lewinsky became public. What Trump says President Trump tweeted at Gillibrand in December 2017 after she called on the president to resign due to sexual misconduct allegations against him. Lightweight Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, a total flunky for Chuck Schumer and someone who would come to my office begging for campaign contributions not so long ago (and would do anything for them), is now in the ring fighting against Trump. Very disloyal to Bill & Crooked-USED! Mr. Trump tweeted. Critics interpreted the words begging and used in the tweet as having a sexual connotation. You cannot silence me or the millions of women who have gotten off the sidelines to speak out about the unfitness and shame you have brought to the Oval Office, Gillibrand wrote on Twitter in response.

Since then, Mr. Trump has repeatedly promised to roll out a new plan to replace Obamacare, though one has not yet been unveiled. Mr. Trump told Chris Wallace in an interview that aired July 19 he would sign a full and complete health care plan within two weeks, and in a town hall hosted by ABC News on Tuesday, the president claimed his alternative to Obamacare is all ready and would protect those with pre-existing conditions.
The Justice Department submitted its filing with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit in New Orleans, which has an appeal pending challenging the law's constitutionality. A federal judge in Texas ruled in December that Obamacare is unconstitutional because of the change in federal tax law passed by Republicans in Congress in 2017.

A year after President Donald Trump was sworn into office, he continues to receive historically low and highly partisan approval ratings, despite widely positive views of the economy. He gets at least some credit for the economy, but most Americans don't feel they've personally benefitted from his policies – only 22 percent think they've been directly helped.

Kavanaugh's nomination now heads to the U.S. Senate, which is controlled by a narrow, 51-to-49 seat GOP majority. Democrats are likely to take issue with a number of Kavanaugh's decisions, including ones pushing back on the government's ability to regulate commerce. They are also likely to spend time examining his views on abortion, an issue now- Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer questioned him about during his 2006 confirmation hearings.

Determined to stay in the arena, Sen. McCain resumed his duties in Washington. You'd never have know it, but he started his days with chemo and radiation. And then headed off to a full day of work, including chairing hearings of the Armed Services Committee.
I have a very, very great balance sheet, so great that when I did the Old Post Office on Pennsylvania Avenue, the United States government, because of my balance sheet, which they actually know very well, chose me to do the Old Post Office, between the White House and Congress, chose me to do the Old Post Office. One of the primary area things, in fact, perhaps the primary thing was balance sheet. But I have no loans with Russia. You could go to the United States government, and they would probably tell you that, because they know my sheet very well in order to get that development I had to have.
Speaker Nancy Pelosi: But when you get to have numbers and you wanna be-- run for leader, then that's a different story. Then they're, like, Why are they all gathering in the well? They all have the same color on today. What are they up to?
TREVOR POTTER: Well, they weren't private payments, it turns out they were by a corporation or by Mister Cohen in amounts in excess of what he could give. But I think the bigger picture here is the attempt to hide all this from the public. I mean, the Supreme Court has said the central to our campaign finance system is full disclosure of money being spent. Instead, what we have seen is this pattern of trying to deceive the public and hide the-- the sources of money and, as I've said, in some cases what apparently are illegal sources of money.
Trump's website states that he would bring more competition to prescription drug pricing. In the primary, Trump opposed cuts to Medicare, although this position conflicts with the Republicans' official platform position. Trump's support for repealing the ACA could undo some features that save costs for the Medicare system.

If Donald Trump gets rid of our health care law, my son won't be protected, his mother's voice says in the ad. We would have to be making some tough decisions about what medications we could afford, she continues.
It's amazing to me that Judge Barrett has publicly criticized the decision by Chief Justice Roberts that upheld the constitutionality of the ACA and that President Trump is making it clear a vote for Judge Barrett to be on the Supreme Court is a vote to repeal the ACA and take away health care protection from a majority of Americans during a pandemic, Coons said.
Lesley Stahl: Maybe not so much in public the way-- this was televised.
If you're going to a convention, you either support or don't go at all, Trump said.
The White House praised the court's ruling that the entire ACA, known as Obamacare, is unconstitutional due to a change in federal tax law. But the administration said nothing will change in the short-term for those covered under Obamacare while the decision goes through the appeals process.
President Trump applauded the judge's decision, saying he had predicted all along that Obamacare is unconstitutional.
The report also claims $450 billion in consumer benefits over the next 10 years based on broader availability of less costly insurance options, reduced taxpayer spending on subsidies, and the cancelled fines. But it acknowledges that premiums will go up for some middle- and upper-income consumers.

MARGARET BRENNAN: --start off because I do want to get to some of your platform issues but let's start with these allegations from Lucy Flores. She is a Nevada politician who you had endorsed and who in the past has been supportive of you. She hasn't endorsed a candidate in this particular race but she's accused Vice President Joe Biden of inappropriate touching. You know her, do you believe her? What do you make of this?
I want a Supreme Court that doesn't always side with corporate interests. I want a Supreme Court that understands because you're wealthy and you can give more money to something doesn't mean you have any more rights or should have any more rights than anybody else.
The high court has already been asked to weigh in on a number of election-related disputes, as officials in numerous states have rushed to expand vote-by-mail for the November contest and loosen voting restrictions in response to the coronavirus pandemic.
President Donald Trump: Well, then you brought up a lot of subjects that were inappropriately brought up--
The former VP wrote in his statement that any complaints by Reade — if they exist — should be released by the secretary of the Senate. Senate personnel records are managed by the secretary of the Senate, who did not respond to requests for comment. Some have questioned whether there is a mention of Reade in Biden's personal Senate papers, housed at the University of Delaware. Biden insists there is not, and said he doesn't want them released yet because they are mostly political. The papers are scheduled to become public two years after Biden leaves public office.
ITEP has conducted the same survey in 2013 and 2015, and noted that as many as 400,000 undocumented residents returned to their country of origin, which reduced slightly the amount of tax revenues collected by local and state governments.

JOHN DICKERSON: For some political analysis, we now like to welcome our panel. Susan Page is the Washington Bureau chief of USA Today, Jonah Goldberg is a senior editor of the National Review, and Susan Glasser writes about the presidency and foreign policy for The New Yorker. Susan Glasser, I want to start with you on the question of Jamal Khashoggi. Put all the pieces in-- in order for us of-- of this issue why it's a challenge for the White House and what you expect next.
But we begin with President-elect Trump, whom we interviewed Friday in his penthouse home in the Trump Tower.
But otherwise, for a lot of people, they can go back to doing many of the things that they used to. And the sooner we get there, the better. After Dr. Anthony Fauci's warning on reopening the country, Tiffany said while he provides a perspective that's important, he prefers to have a variety of opinions on the issue. When I go about my decision making, I don't entrust, I do not put all of my eggs in one basket with one person, and we shouldn't do that here either. I think Dr. Birx brings important information to the table, as well as other people, he said.
SENATOR MARCO RUBIO: Well, on the first point I think everyone's waiting to find out exactly what happened and, frankly, this is the kind of case where we may never know exactly what happened. It was a denial. But that said there is news reports out there that there is some sort of audio-video evidence of what occurred. If that were to emerge or any other facts were to emerge or, frankly, if questions here aren't answered. There's no video of him leaving that facility. There's going to be a big problem. I can just tell you that in Congress right now there is no pro-Saudi element that's going to stick with our relationship with Saudi Arabia as it's currently structured if, in fact, they lured this man into this consulate, killed him and then, you know, cut up his body and send a team to go into that country to kill him in the first place. That's just an unacceptable thing. We should never accept that from anyone in the world. It undermines our credibility and our moral authority around the planet to go after regimes like Putin's or Maduro in Venezuela or others. As far as the options that are concerned, people talk a lot about the arms sales. Our relationship with Saudi Arabia extends well beyond arms sales as well. And I would just say it's unfortunate because Saudi Arabia is an important part of our Middle Eastern strategy.
Nice try, not true. @PaulManafort, blaming Hillary Clinton isn't the answer for ever Trump campaign problem. https://t.co/RvZ5GKeDYd — Jennifer Palmieri (@jmpalmieri) July 19, 2016
JOHN DICKERSON: How is it not about politics if you have been very critical of this President saying he is driving some of these divisions. If these divisions-- wouldn't it be very powerful if somebody in a public role like the President or senators, behaved and modeled the behavior you are talking about in this book that you should see at the church or at the little league ball field.
Indeed, Gorsuch has publicly criticized the widely held notion that judges often demonstrate political partisanship in their judicial decisions.
Implement incentives, penalties or mandates for individuals to buy insurance, like the ACA does. This is necessary if you want to prohibit unpopular exclusions for preexisting conditions while offering health care coverage broadly. Implement a single-payer system that requires coverage for everybody, for example, by expanding Medicare to cover all citizens, not just those age 65 and over.
Lesley Stahl: And there's going to be a period if you repeal it and before you replace it, when millions of people could lose -– no?
That's because now that the Democrats have a simple majority in the Senate. They can pass changes to the tax code as well as implement changes in spending, Yaros said.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Our latest Battleground Tracker polling shows your lead with South Carolina black voters is thinning out. In November, you were at 54 percent support. It's now 35 percent. That's a 19 point difference.
He was met with loud cheers at the arena at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas.
Earlier this month, CBS News reported that Bloomberg apologized for his role in the New York Police Department stop and frisk policy that led to hundreds of thousands being stopped and searched without warrants and disproportionately targeted black and Latino populations. Welsh, who is also a Northeasterner, said that Bloomberg's apology won't be enough. The whole 'stop and frisk' thing, just because you apologize for it now doesn't mean that it wasn't wrong at a different time, said Welsh. It's sort of like Joe Biden apologizing for Anita Hill. It just doesn't work.
RADDATZ: Thank you very much. We're going to get on to one more question.
9:49 p.m. ET Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, on Wednesday night did not endorse Donald Trump for president and instead congratulated him on winning the GOP nomination.
JOHN DICKERSON: Because we're all just looking into our phones and we're by ourselves and then suddenly the sun's gone down and the day's over.
Now, here's what I want to do. I have said nobody who makes less than $250,000 a year — and that's the vast majority of Americans as you know — will have their taxes raised, because I think we've got to go where the money is. And the money is with people who have taken advantage of every single break in the tax code.
Controversy Although she is likely to cite her long career as a prosecutor on the campaign trail, Harris is poised to face scrutiny from some progressives for her law enforcement work. Some factions on the left have denounced aspects of her record as a district attorney and state attorney general. Critics have pointed to California's overcrowded prisons and to her defense of controversial convictions to challenge the notion that she was a progressive prosecutor. If Kamala Harris wants people who care about dismantling mass incarceration and correcting miscarriages of justice to vote for her, she needs to radically break with her past, wrote law professor Lara Bazelon in an opinion piece for The New York Times. What Trump says Although Mr. Trump has not yet tweeted about Harris, the White House has previously criticized the California senator. In the summer of 2018, the White House Twitter account wrote, @SenKamalaHarris, why are you supporting the animals of MS-13? You must not really know what ICE does. Harris has said that lawmakers need to reexamine the role of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).
Leader told Moriarty, And those votes in the battleground states, in Michigan and Wisconsin where the election was very tight, where the president won by just 11,000-12,000 votes, the votes of those women had a highly-outsized influence on the impact of the election.
But some policies go further and cover some medicines or a certain number of primary care visits before you've paid the entire deductible. If you're generally healthy, you may find that a policy with a high deductible but generous pre-deductible benefits will meet your needs.
The White House is calling it the most progressive bill ever passed because it will also provide money for Obamacare premiums, tax credits for parents, funds to fight hunger and to help boost schools for years.
Former Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg announced 28 endorsements through his Win the Era PAC, which is aimed at helping and supporting down ballot candidates who represent the next generation of leaders, reports CBS News campaign reporter Jack Turman. Some notable candidates who the PAC is endorsing include Democratic Senate candidates, such as Theresa Greenfield in Iowa, MJ Hegar in Texas and Reverend Raphael Warnock in Georgia. In addition to supporting several state House races, Buttigieg is also endorsing several congressional members who were in tough races last cycle, including Congresswoman Elissa Slotkin in Michigan and Congressman Andy Kim in New Jersey. This election, we need to replace the current President and elect leaders at every level of our government who will deliver solutions to the biggest challenges we face, Buttigieg said in a statement. I believe the voices of these twenty-eight candidates are essential to changing our politics, and I'm committed to doing everything I can to make sure they are successful on November 3rd. According to a press release, Win the Era plans to hold virtual campaign events to support these candidates over the next two months.
Here's a refresher on what to know about Gorsuch:
That's just how I function. If there's something wrong, you go and you make it right. But I think what's more important is the fact that Larry's a friend of mine. He immediately called, he immediately apologized.
And HealthCare.gov is legally permitted to approve applications with unresolved documentation issues. Consumers then get about three months to straighten out paperwork issues.
In Detroit, I halted government mandates that crippled America's great, beautiful autoworkers so that we can get Motor City revving its engines again. And that's what's happening. Many car companies are now building and expanding plants in the United States -- something we haven't seen for decades. Chrysler is moving a major plant from Mexico to Michigan. Toyota and Mazda are opening up a plant in Alabama -- a big one. And we haven't seen this in a long time. It's all coming back.
President Donald Trump: No, these are much bigger than I ever had--
10. Will Nancy Pelosi's unpopularity drag down Democratic House candidates?
In an ongoing fight to repeal the Affordable Care Act, the Trump administration filed a Supreme Court brief in June, asking the high court to invalidate it. The case will be heard by the highest court exactly one week after Election Day in November.
Donald Trump appears in his first extensive post-election with 60 Minutes' Lesley Stahl. Chris Albert
ANTHONY SALVANTO: But this year they also say that they are unsatisfied with the direction of the country and they are breaking Democratic for that reason. They also tell us that they feel like the Republican Party works against the interests of women and more for the interests of men. So on a personal level as a-- as a group identifier, group affiliation, you see them breaking more heavily Democratic right now.
Lesley Stahl: You said to me, I say that because I need to dis-- discredit you so that when you say negative things about me, no one will believe you.
Kara Eastman locked up the Democratic nomination in Nebraska's 2nd Congressional District Tuesday night, and is now set to face incumbent Republican Congressman Don Bacon in a rematch of 2018. Eastman lost to Bacon by 2 points in 2018, when she beat former Congressman Brad Ashford in the primaries. Eastman faced his wife, Ann Ashford, in last night's primary.
Kirsten Gillibrand Sen. Kirstin Gillibrand announces 2020 presid... 09:35 Biography Kirsten Gillibrand, born in 1966, is not the first woman in her family to become involved in politics. Her grandmother, Polly Noonan, was the founder of the influential Albany Democratic Club and was a major player in Albany Mayor Erastus Corning's political machine. Gillibrand, the daughter of two attorneys, was raised in Albany. She attended Dartmouth University and UCLA School of Law. Gillibrand worked at the private Manhattan-based law firm Davis Polk in the early 1990s, although she took a brief leave in 1992 to serve as a law clerk to Circuit Court Judge Roger Miner, a Ronald Reagan appointee. She served as special counsel to then-HUD Secretary Andrew Cuomo in the final year of the Clinton administration. She was a strong supporter of Hillary Clinton, and worked on her 2000 Senate campaign. Clinton became a mentor to Gillibrand, and encouraged Gillibrand to run for office in 2006 rather than in 2004, believing that running two years later would give her a greater chance of winning. Gillibrand defeated four-term Rep. John Sweeney, who represented a conservative district, in 2006. Gillibrand was a moderate congresswoman and a member of the conservative Democrat Blue Dog Caucus. She supported a bill to withhold funds from sanctuary cities, and received a 100 percent rating from the National Rifle Association. After Clinton left the Senate in 2009 to become secretary of state, Gov. David Paterson appointed Gillibrand to replace her.
I think that's one of the most troubling aspects of this whole thing. And, in fact, I said it in testimony on the Hill, I can't remember if it was my confirmation, that I said I was very concerned about the possibility that that dossier and Steele's activities were used as a vector for the Russians to inject disinformation into the political campaign.
JAMELLE BOUIE: I don't think experience per se, but I think Biden's particular position in the Democratic Party in the '70s and '80s and '90s hurts him. He was sort of a very centrist Democrat, and on crime and on drugs and on economic policy, he was with the center, even the conservative part of the Democratic Party.
Traditional retail politics don't suit Trump. Grip-and-grins in Iowa and New Hampshire diners would be untenable because of the crowd sizes.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Kelsey, what happens when the attorney general goes to Capitol Hill and actually gives testimony at the beginning of May answering questions about the Mueller report?
The president, for his part, understands that it's better to unify the party for the midterms. But theirs is more of a business partnership than a budding friendship, according to the former administration official.
Now, with Barrett taking her seat on the high court, she could be called upon to cast the pivotal vote in the case.
We'll hear also from Florida Republican Sen. Rick Scott (@SenRickScott), who introduced an amendment to protect health care coverage for people with pre-existing conditions.
9:03 p.m. ET Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus attempted to present a stark contrast between with the GOP would offer Americans and what would happen to the country if Democrats continue to occupy the White House.

CBS News' Charlie Rose interviews Hillary Clinton
The president's $210 million cash haul comes after his campaign announced in early August it and the RNC had surpassed raising a combined $1 billion since the start of the election cycle. But an examination of FEC filings show that the president, RNC and joint fundraising committees have also spent more than $830 million on re-election efforts before even reaching Labor Day, according to CBS News political unit associate producer Sarah Ewall-Wice and campaign reporter Nicole Sganga.
Democrats on the ballot have one last chance to make their closing arguments to voters in this last weekend before Election Day. In a political season that has been more geared toward national concerns than in previous elections, the campaigns have been bitter and partisan, and the challenge for Democrats is to break through -- especially with the onslaught of both legitimate crises and 11th hour political stunts from a White House anxious to shift the momentum.
At this point one of our producers interrupted to advise about the time remaining in the interview.
Lesley Stahl: --I-- I wonder if you think that masks don't work.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Five senators. Next couple of weeks?
MARGARET BRENNAN: --because we're going to run out of time--
Darlene Jordan. The former national finance co-chair for Mitt Romney's presidential campaigns.
Off the Supreme Court card, Miranda came up with, We need a new justice for the Supreme Court -- in short, this is my book report.
JANICE JACKSON: Well, the goal right now is to-- to get a resolution. CTU has made it clear that they want a deal. We share those same sentiments, but we're still far apart on a couple of key issues, such as vaccination and how we account for accommodations for individuals who maybe are just, you know, petrified to come back into schools because of COVID. We believe that we have to reopen schools. We've been closed for almost a year now. And as a school system, we're starting to see some of the effects of schools being closed. Many of our students aren't logging on. We are seeing African American and Latinx students, in particular, being especially hard hit. And our goal is to really give every parent an option. Those families who want to remain remote will have that option through the remainder of the school year. But we have thousands of families who want an in-person option because they're essential workers themselves.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Jonah, is all of this just a gift to Republicans, including the shift of the messaging back to health care? We had Senator Scott on the program. And he's kind of was throwing the ball back into the White House's court.
But if, you know, if we were to find wrongdoing, in the sense of any criminal act, you know, obviously we would, we would follow through on that. But, again, you know, just because something may even stink to high heaven and be, you know, appear everyone to be bad we still have to apply the right standard and be convinced that there's a violation of a criminal statute. And that we can prove it beyond a reasonable doubt. The same standard applies to everybody.
An estimated 27 million people may have lost job-based coverage due to layoffs, and it's unclear what — if anything — they're turning to as a fallback. People who lose employer health care are eligible for a special sign-up period for subsidized plans under the Obama-era law. Many may also qualify for Medicaid.
Democratic Senator Chris of Coons of Delaware, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, also focused on Barrett's previous comments on health care in an interview on Face the Nation.
Cleaver said another feature that her team is working on will allow voters in 15 states to give her organization permission to submit vote-by-mail request forms on their behalf. According to Cleaver, 15 states don't have an online tool for voters to submit requests for vote-by-mail and require them to fax in the form.
First lady's box Carlos Barria/Reuters Guests in first lady Michelle Obama's box, including (L-R) Ryan Reyes, the partner of one of the victims of the San Bernardino shootings, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, communiity college student Jennifer Bragdon and Air Force Staff Sgt. Spencer Stone at the State of the Union. Ryan Reyes lost his partner, Larry Daniel Kaufman in the Dec. 2 terror attack in San Bernardino, Calif. Kaufman saved four people by warning others before being shot and killed. Ryan has been vocal about tolerance writing, The twisted actions and beliefs of a few should not be used to view the majority. Jennifer Bragdon's presence highlights how community colleges are providing support for a large variety of students. Bragdon, 42, returned to school while working full-time to pursue a degree to become a middle school teacher. In 2015, Obama proposed a plan for free community college.
Donald Trump: At the appropriate time, I will release them. But right now I'm under routine audit. Nobody cares. The only one who cares is, you know, you and a few people that asked that question. Obviously, the public didn't care because I won the election very easily. So they don't care. I never thought they did care.
Marketplace insurers often keep costs down by negotiating lower reimbursements with a very limited network of providers. These contracts with providers change all the time, explained McAndrew, so it's important to check the list of providers included in any plan you're considering, even your current policy that you may like.
With no penalty, there's no tax, the plaintiffs, a coalition of Republican-led states, argued in the Texas case. A coalition of states governed by Democrats and led by California had a different interpretation -- that the individual mandate isn't unconstitutional if people aren't actually being forced to pay penalties. California also argued that the individual mandate could be severed from the rest of the health care law.
What do you mean, it's not the end of it?
The people have spoken on health care, Evers said in a statement. They believe in more access to care, not less, and they believe in the protections guaranteed under the Affordable Care Act. ... It's time for Republicans to stop blocking the will of the people and work with us to expand health care.
Ryan said that Obamacare will remain the law of the land until it is replaced.
WOMAN: We have been going by plane, and a couple of the places you go by snow machine, the little sled behind it to get you there.
The budget does bend the trajectory down, it does move us back towards balance. It does get us away from trillion-dollar deficits, Mulvaney said on Fox News Sunday.
MARGARET BRENNAN: So that could be a- another compromise like Senator Susan Collins was out there talking about a two and a half billion dollar compromise, rather than the 5 billion that the president is asking for.
A nation without borders and a nation without laws is no nation at all, he said. Now more than ever, we must respect the police. We must give them the toools and the support they need to do their jobs.
Clinton has emerged as a vocal candidate on the Democratic side for LGBT rights. She regularly mentions it on the campaign trail and, ahead of the ruling this week, her campaign released an emotional video showing the weddings and engagements of same-sex couples.
At the top of the speech, Mr. Trump celebrated the booming economy, attributing the bullish stock market of recent months to his policies. He also took time to advertise the recent tax cuts championed by his administration, arguing that it would soon pay dividends for working Americans.
To everyone still recovering in Texas, Florida, Louisiana, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands -- everywhere -- we are with you, we love you, and we always will pull through together, always.
Our major concerns in these negotiations have been about funding for the wall and uncertainty about the CSR payments crucial to the stability of the marketplaces under the Affordable Care Act. We've now made progress on both of these fronts, she said. More progress needs to be made on some of our priorities, and we continue to be concerned about poison pill riders that are still in this legislation. Our appropriators are working in good faith toward a bipartisan proposal to keep government open.
Another big sticking point: what to do about Obamacare's huge expansion of Medicaid, which now covers 11 million more people than it did before. Some Republicans say that's a vital safety net that needs to be retained. Others say it's too expensive and needs to be scaled back. If they can't reach consensus, this bill is going to be in trouble.
Mr. Trump recently held a rally here to get his base fired up. During his appearance, the president said he was surprised to be in Mississippi fighting for a Republican to win a gubernatorial race.
LANNY DAVIS: So, I can see--
As we strengthen friendships all around the world, we are also restoring clarity about our adversaries.
In response to the president's comments about potential Biden nominees, Biden spokesman T.J. Ducklo said, We look forward to Donald Trump releasing his tax returns in the spirit of his newfound appreciation for transparency. Read President Trump's full SCOTUS list here.
SEN. KLOBUCHAR: --nothing. He promised them a safer world when he got out of the Iranian agreement. It is not safer. That's the case we need to make.
Whether Trump he succeeds or not could have reverberations for election cycles to come, not so much because he can change retail politics -- most politicians don't have his kind of celebrity -- but because he could have an impact on the type of person entering presidential politics.
The ads hit Republican candidate Michelle Steel on alleged corruption from her 2013 Board of Supervisors campaign co-chairs, and her vote to eliminate a watchdog office in Orange County. Steel is in a competitive race against Democrat Congressman Harley Rouda. In numbers shared with CBS News political unit broadcast associate Aaron Navarro,Rouda's campaign and the DCCC have made over 3,000 calls and 12,000 texts to those in the Vietnamese community. According to the census, this district has more than 146,976 Asian residents, roughly a quarter of the population. Earlier this summer, the DCCC ran ads in Chinese and Hindi in Texas' 22nd district, another district with a substantial AAPI population and voter base.
As an example, in San Bernardino, many people saw the bombs all over the apartment of the two people that killed 14 and wounded many, many people. Horribly wounded. They'll never be the same. Muslims have to report the problems when they see them.
President Trump later signed off on the bill, officially funding the government through Feb. 8 and ending the weekend-long government shutdown. The measure also extends the Children's Health Insurance Program through 2023 and suspends three Obamacare-related taxes and fees.
You have blocking services like ours that are really reaching scale, and more and more carriers are rolling out tools to block the calls or at least make their customers aware of the type of call that's coming in, he said. There's higher volume because the scammers can't get through, so they have to call again.
Both Bagley and Levitt said their questions about the administration's intentions arose from language in the Justice Department brief that specifically singles out sections of the health law that apply to employer plans. The ACA strengthened previous protections already in federal law that limited the circumstances and length of time under which an employer could exclude coverage for a worker's pre-existing health problems.
Lesley Stahl: Yeah, but what about—the American people.
The future we want, all of us want -- opportunity and security for our families, a rising standard of living, and a sustainable, peaceful planet for our kids - all that is within our reach, Mr. Obama said before a joint session of Congress Tuesday night. But it will only happen if we work together. It will only happen if we can have rational, constructive debates. It will only happen if we fix our politics.
Just as I promised the American people from this podium 11 months ago, we enacted the biggest tax cuts and reforms in American history.
It worked. Blankenship came in third as West Virginia Republicans nominated Attorney General Patrick Morrisey. Like Braun, Morrisey is a cross-over figure on the Right: The first Republican elected AG in West Virginia since 1928, he's already won statewide, was endorsed in the primary by populist Steve Bannon, and yet remains popular among mainstream Republicans. Republican primary voters chose wisely.
Donald Trump: Well, what I really wanted to focus on was-- the Middle East, North Korea, Obamacare is tough. You know, healthcare is a tough situation.
And she won't even mention the word and nor will President Obama. He won't use the term radical Islamic terrorism. Now, to solve a problem, you have to be able to state what the problem is or at least say the name. She won't say the name and President Obama won't say the name. But the name is there. It's radical Islamic terror. And before you solve it, you have to say the name.
Their team has failed the American people, Romney said at the Conservative Political Action Committee (CPAC), and that's why their majority will soon be out the door.
To accelerate the process, the Biden administration, like the Trump administration, invoked the defense production act and forced suppliers to make vaccine manufacturers their top priority. Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla says his company was able to increase its production by 20%.
But no market is perfectly competitive. All fail to one degree or another to live up to their promise.
For the candidates who didn't make the third debate stage, they're focusing on boots-on-the-ground retail campaigning in an effort to get their messages out in early states.
Voters said part of that was because Republican candidate Dean Heller appeared to waffle on the Affordable Care Act.
Mr. Trump called Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to express his condolences over the shooting, according to the Associated Press.
Now that Trump's personal lawyer has implicated him in a crime, not supporting impeachment feels like a dodge, says Ben Wikler, Washington director for the liberal advocacy group MoveOn. It's not something you can bury your head in the sand and ignore.
Sanders apologized to the two women who had settled with Becker, and said that he was not aware of the settlement. What Trump says President Trump has alternated between praising Sanders and insulting him as crazy. As some of Mr. Trump and Sanders' populist ideas overlap, Mr. Trump often said during the 2016 campaign that Sanders voters would defect to him over Hillary Clinton in the general election. Mr. Trump also accused Clinton of cheating to take the nomination away from Sanders, and criticized Sanders for eventually endorsing Clinton. While Bernie has totally given up on his fight for the people, we welcome all voters who want a better future for our workers, Mr. Trump tweeted in July 2016. Wow, my campaign is hearing from more and more Bernie supporters that they will NEVER support Crooked Hillary, he wrote in another July tweet. In several subsequent tweets, Mr. Trump has called Sanders Crazy Bernie. He has often referred to the 2016 Democratic primary during his two years in office, sometimes in an effort to cast him as the face of the party's more extreme elements.
Kentucky law prevented governors from running for re-election until 1992. Since then, no Republican has gotten a second term, despite the fact that the state is dominated by Republicans at the federal level and hasn't voted for a Democratic presidential candidate since 1996.

Then throw in the fact that some irresponsible or ill-informed Republicans like Florida GOP Rep. Matt Gaetz and the American Conservative Union's Matt Schlapp have been speculating, without evidence, that the caravan might be funded by liberal activist and billionaire George Soros. And since Soros is Jewish ...
Mike Pence: I think this is a good man who's been talking about the issues the American people care about.
Our massive tax cuts provide tremendous relief for the middle class and small business. To lower tax rates for hardworking Americans, we nearly doubled the standard deduction for everyone. Now, the first $24,000 earned by a married couple is completely tax-free. We also doubled the child tax credit. A typical family of four making $75,000 will see their tax bill reduced by $2,000, slashing their tax bill in half.
Klobuchar is not alone in her struggle -- there are currently 14 million people who have someone with Alzheimer's in their family, something the Minnesota senator said the country is not really getting ready for.

Concerns about Terror and Mass Shootings
Asked about the fact that the president is a Christian, Santorum answered: He says he's a Christian, he's a Christian, and would not elaborate on how to balance competing ideas about contraception within the broader faith. But he was firm in painting the president as promulgating a new moral code that he contended was intolerant of the church.
At the heart of the legal battle, which pitted religious freedoms against access to contraception, is the Affordable Care Act's contraceptive mandate, which requires employers to provide health insurance plans that cover birth control at no cost to employees. While previous cases have focused on entities that object to complying with the mandate because of their religious beliefs, the Supreme Court was tasked in this challenge with deciding whether the Trump administration can extend exemptions from the requirement to a wider range of employers with religious or moral objections to contraceptive coverage.
At the end of his speech, he urged Americans to stand up and vote for Donald Trump.
MARGARET BRENNAN: All right. We will be watching it, and we'll have plenty of analysis then. Thanks to all of you for joining us.
Scott Pelley: One of them has you describing your Bloomberg Terminal, and the quote in the book is, quoting you, It will do everything, including give you, a euphemism for oral sex--
DAN BALZ (Washington Post/@danbalz): Well, it's not just unusual it's-- it's-- it's supposedly not allowed. I mean, the national security adviser is supposed to be an official who's dealing only in the national security realm and not involved in partisan politics. And so any-- any suggestion or anything that comes from him that puts him into that realm undermines the role that he's supposed to be playing.
The top of that list was mining executive Don Blankenship in West Virginia, the state that should give the GOP it's best chance to pick up a U.S. Senate seat this November. It's the most pro-Trump state in the country -- he won it by 42 points -- and it has a vulnerable Democratic incumbent, Sen. Joe Manchin.
Bill Whitaker: Americans watching this are wondering when am I going to be able to get my shot?
Trump-Pence talk with Lesley Stahl on 60 Minutes
With the new Johnson & Johnson vaccine granted emergency use authorization yesterday, millions more doses are being added to the national supply - about 4 million ready to ship as soon as this week. But that's just 1/3 of what the company had contracted to deliver by this point. Johnson & Johnson blamed the complexities of manufacturing a new vaccine. The company uses emergent biosolutions in Baltimore to turn its proprietary formula into doses of vaccine.
Lesley Stahl: But that's not what you're saying, I said it-
On Wednesday, two police unions in Manchester, NH that backed Pappas in 2018, endorsed Mowers. In a statement, Mowers said he won't use our police as a political punching bag like Chris Pappas, continuing his criticism of Pappas' vote to remove qualified immunity, by supporting the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act. Lieutenant Mark Brave, who serves in the Strafford County Sheriff's office and supports Pappas, pointed to past funding the congressman got for critical training efforts. He added that Pappas is the only candidate in this race working to help to bridge the gap between our police departments and the communities they serve. Brave himself is running as a Democrat in the Strafford County Sherriff race, and won his primary Tuesday.
A 17% drop in clean energy employment has essentially erased all the growth the industry experienced the last few years. BW Research previously estimated that half a million or about 15% of all clean energy jobs would be lost by the end of June.
It takes the votes of four justices for the court to agree to review a case. If Kennedy's replacement is a fourth vote for a new case about guns, then Roberts might soon have to weigh in on issues like the right carry a concealed firearm in public or bans on assault weapons, Winkler said.
JONAH GOLDBERG: I-- I think it is perfectly in keeping. And, you know, when he says I don't want to jeopardize this hundred and ten billion dollars in orders to-- I wish someone would ask him, okay, so how many journalists does Saudi Arabia get to kill before it might jeopardize it, right? I mean, this is a problem with the rhetoric. And it's also a problem with the relationship and it makes a lot of sense to me or at least it's perfectly defensible to have a better relationship with Saudi Arabia to work this out as a counter aid to Iran, all of those things are fine or at least defensible. But it has to be-- when you get into this situation, it is clear that no one communicated to Saudi Arabia that if we're going to go down this path you cannot embarrass us or put us in a situation like this. And so now we're at this stage where there are no really very good options, the White House is in a bind on this. And it's because they went down this cul-de-sac to begin with without a proper line of communication, someone led the Saudia Arabian government to believe that they could get away with this that this wouldn't be a problem. And that's why it's a mess now.
President Donald Trump: I tell people to wear masks--
GOVERNOR NED LAMONT: Well, it's a little complicated. I've got police who are going out there on the front lines. We've got manufacturing folks and defense industries. I've got daycare workers. So, I've got to be careful about how you prioritize. But I got to tell you teachers are right near the top of that list because of what we're doing to keep our schools open and our kids in the game.
LANNY DAVIS: --When Donald Trump was President.
He may not always tell you what you want to hear. You may not always agree. It may not always be politically correct. Donald Trump will always tell you the truth as he sees it, he said.
A recent Tax Foundation analysis found that Trump's plan would cost an average of $440 billion annually. That would make Trump's tax breaks larger than President Ronald Reagan's 1981 tax cut, which cost an average of $200 billion annually. The current plan is also larger than President George W. Bush's 2001 tax cut, which cost an average of $91.5 billion annually.

In the first half of May, CBS News political unit associate producer Sarah Ewall-Wice reports Priorities USA brought in about $9.3 million with an additional $8.2 million in commitments, up from about $7.6 million raised during the month of April. Overall, Priorities USA says it raised more than $145 million this cycle including $126 million already in the door and another $19 million in additional commitments, putting it well on its way to surpassing its $200 million budget for the 2020 election cycle. Donald Trump and his allies have started advertising in battleground states and it's imperative that Priorities gives Joe Biden the air cover he needs as he builds his general election campaign, said Priorities USA Chairman Guy Cecil in a statement. So far, our donors are rising to the occasion and we have seen an increase in our fundraising.
Lesley Stahl: What did they tell you about the prognosis?
ANTHONY SALVANTO: Well, one factor you want to watch is the President. And, you know, we are on pace now for the President to be a factor in people's voting, really, would be historic levels. So, typically, a majority, maybe a slight majority of people who voted midterms say that the President is a factor in their vote either for or against. But this year we've got many more voters saying that they feel like the President is a factor. Either for or against, in fact, it's relatively split. But there's no question that he is on the ballot so to speak or at least in the minds of voters when they are going to the polls this year.
As President Trump continues to insist voting should be in-person and alleges voting by mail leads to fraud, some Republican officials are moving forward with preparations for an increase in mail-in voting, especially in upcoming primaries. It's the latest sign that while Mr. Trump might be trying to discredit the mail-in process from the bully pulpit, a growing number of voters are indicating support for such options amid coronavirus concerns.
A Washington mother of three had planned to attend a baseball game with a date she met online, but it would be the night she disappeared. Her body was found over the weekend and police are holding her date as a suspect in the case, and checking to see if he's connected to other similar crimes.

Donald Trump: I respect it. But I'm not scared by it.
The soaring cost of the life-saving epinephrine-delivery devices -- no optional accessory for serious allergy sufferers -- has drawn cries of foul play from politicians and families, but not, unsurprisingly, from ex-Big Pharma exec Martin Shkreli, who yet again sees no problem with putting profits first.
Of course, you'll want to consider the candidates' positions on the other important issues that will have an impact on the health, vitality and security of the nation -- another reason that voting this November is an important part of your retirement plan.
And keep in mind if Democrats lose even one of the close races in West Virginia, Indiana, Missouri or North Dakota, taking the Senate becomes all-but-impossible.
She added in a barb about Trump's Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton.
Clinton is now under fire for her initial opacity about her pneumonia diagnosis Friday and the days-long delay before she revealed it to the public.
SEN. SCOTT: I'd have to learn more about it. The- when I went down to the border- we have a crisis. We need- we need more barriers. We have operational control, we need more people and we need more technology. I'm very disappointed that I walked into this job, what, three months ago with the government shut down and the Democrats don't want to give any money for border security, that's wrong.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Then as intelligence officials warned that at least two 2020 candidates are being helped by the Russian interference, one candidate says he won't stand for it.

And the Affordable Care Act was meant to try to fill the gap between people who were too poor and couldn't put together any resources to afford health care, namely people on Medicaid. Obviously, Medicare, which is a single-payer system, which takes care of our elderly and does a great job doing it, by the way, and then all of the people who were employed, but people who were working but didn't have the money to afford insurance and didn't have anybody, an employer or anybody else, to help them.
Mike Bloomberg: This is up to the scientists and the doctors as to whether there is a problem. And it is just ignorant and irresponsible to not stand up and be the leader and say, We don't know, but we have to prepare for the fact that, if it is, we have the medicines and the structure and the knowledge to deal with it.
He laid out plans for Congress to focus heavily at the start on reshaping the marketplace for individual policies and on changing Medicaid, which covers low-income qualifiers.
John Hickenlooper John Hickenlooper joins crowded 2020 race 04:09 Former Colorado Governor John Hickenlooper has the most executive experience in the field, having served as governor from 2011 to 2019 and as Denver mayor for two terms before that. He followed an unusual route into politics, beginning his career as a geologist then later going into the brewpub business, a pursuit which made him a millionaire. The 67-year-old is perhaps best known for overseeing the legalization of marijuana in Denver while he was mayor and in Colorado as governor, although he opposed it.
In 2000, Kavanaugh unsuccessfully attempted to prevent 6-year-old refugee Elian Gonzalez from being returned to Cuba. But later that year, he worked for then-Republican nominee George W. Bush in Bush v. Gore, which ended the Florida recount after the 2000 presidential election.
I think it is up to the judge to say what the Constitution provided, even if what it provided is not the best answer, even if you think it should be amended. If that is what it says, that's what it says, Scalia said.
SEN. KLOBUCHAR: That was a yes--
This generated an average annual fiscal deficit (benefits received minus taxes paid) of around $14,387 per household, their analysis said. This cost had to be borne by U.S. taxpayers. Amnesty would provide unlawful households with access to over 80 means-tested welfare programs, Obamacare, Social Security, and Medicare. The fiscal deficit for each household would soar.
Paul Taylor Paul Taylor Dance Foundation; AP Photos by Manish Swarup (center right), Mario Suriani (bottom right) An iconic figure in the world of dance, Paul Taylor (July 29, 1930-August 29, 2018) conjured works that reflected the heights and depths of the human condition with scintillating athleticism and humor. A year after graduating Juilliard in 1953, at age 24, Taylor founded his own company, collaborating with artist Robert Rauschenberg on his first production. A year later he became a soloist for Martha Graham, while continuing to shape his own company into one of the world's most successful contemporary troupes. The pairing of classical music (particularly 18th-century Baroque) with modern dance was one of Taylor's hallmarks. His signature work was 1975's Esplanade (center), a joyful scene of dancers hurtling themselves at each other, set to concertos by Bach. Taylor also created dances for such noted artists as Mikhail Baryshnikov (right top) and Rudolf Nureyev. Taylor kept working well into his 80s, venturing to his company's Manhattan studios from his Long Island home to choreograph two new pieces a year; he created 147 in all during his 64-year career. In the 2014 documentary Paul Taylor: Creative Domain, the choreographer said, Dance, I've always thought it's like poetry. Poems don't always spell everything out, you know. They need room between the lines.

Melania Trump: --what's going on. And, he's very proud of his dad.
MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about the debates this week. One question to many of your colleagues and competitors was whether their health care plan would cover undocumented immigrants. Would your plan do that?
Donald Trump: It's been a long time since it's happened.
Don't be afraid. We are going to bring our country back. But certainly, don't be afraid. President-elect Donald J. Trump
The first thing this budget would do is try to repeal the Affordable Care Act again, said Judy Solomon, vice president of health policy at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. It's not likely there's an appetite for that, but it says that it's still an overarching priority for this administration.
But, early in this process, the FDA approved what's called off-label use where physicians could prescribe hydroxychloroquine in terms they deemed appropriate. So my physician has not recommended that, but I wouldn't hesitate to take the counsel of my doctor. Any American should do likewise.

Challenges over the contraceptive mandate have made their way to the Supreme Court twice before in disputes brought by employers with religious objections to the requirement they offer health plans that cover contraceptives. In 2014, the high court ruled 5-4 in favor of Hobby Lobby, a family-owned corporation, and found that forcing it to comply with the contraceptive mandate violated a 1993 federal law that protects religious freedom. Then, in 2016, an eight-member Supreme Court sent another case involving faith-based groups back to the lower court to give the parties an opportunity at an approach going forward.
STEPHEN MILLER: --wants to-- if the Democrat Party wants to go down the road of continuing to preserve a model that enriches smuggling organizations, that spreads misery on both sides of the border, that kills three hundred Americans a week through heroin overdoses alone-- by the way, illegal heroin costs our country two hundred and thirty billion dollars--
As the Republicans scramble to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act (ACA), they're bumping into two unavoidable elephants in the room: basic actuarial and underwriting principles, and the high cost of medical care. Simply repealing Obamacare is relatively easy, but replacing it will be much more difficult because any new solution will need to grapple with these elephants head-on.
Lesley Stahl: Are you ready for some tough questions?
On MSNBC Tuesday, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie also downplayed the charges leveled at Mrs. Trump. When asked whether it was plagiarism, Christie said: Not when 93 percent of the speech is completely different.
COOPER: Secretary Clinton, your two minutes is up. I want to follow up on something that Donald Trump actually said to you, a comment you made last month. You said that half of Donald Trump's supporters are, quote, deplorables, racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamophobic. You later said you regretted saying half. You didn't express regret for using the term deplorables. To Mr. Carter's question, how can you unite a country if you've written off tens of millions of Americans?
Yeah, a lot of memories from 2016, Gabbard said. But, you know, I'm grateful that he's become a friend over the years. And no matter what else is going on, when we bump into each other on the campaign trail now, there's always a warm hug and a laugh and a check-in from both of us about how each other's doing.
Becky Taylor: And in a matter of three or four days, we had over 600 people that had signed up. And we were shocked and overwhelmed at the number of people that were feeling so desperate that they needed help.

MILLER: I believe that's the likeliest outcome because Obamacare has always been unconstitutional and the mandate--
SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: Well, the reality is we have had auto emission standards in place for many, many years and, in fact the auto industry has grown substantially. The reality is that there are lots of economic opportunities when it comes to investing in clean energy and energy efficiency and those are homegrown jobs. Wind. Solar. These are homegrown jobs. These aren't jobs where you are importing oil from Saudi Arabia, for example.
Do you have a view on whether the president, the vice president should self-quarantine or be separated?
One of the criticisms of the legal approach to dismantling the ACA has been that there's a sense that Republicans have not introduced a viable plan to replace the Obama-era law. Garrett asked Short whether such a plan exists. Short said that Azar could come up with a plan in the coming months, adding, But we also believe that this court decision probably wouldn't reach the courts for another--'til probably summer of 2020.
Cruz's claim that he's never spoken more than fifty words to Boehner is a dubious one, however.
Donald Trump: I'm not gonna say anything. I don't want to tell them anything. I don't want to tell anybody anything.
America could be faced with a choice this fall of either Americans being able to vote - which means voting by mail - or not voting at all, said Oregon Democratic Senator Ron Wyden on Monday. Wyden, along with Democratic Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, introduced a bill last week to expand voting access. It includes, among other measures, requiring states to have 20 days of early in-person voting and no-excuse absentee voting by mail. Americans are facing unprecedented disruptions to their daily lives and we don't want them to lose the ability to have a say over their own government, Klobuchar said on Monday. We've already seen some of the primary elections postponed and we won't want that to happen in November. And one of the things we can do to make it safer for everyone is to just get those ballots out there with postage.

CBS News/YouGov Battleground Track Poll: North Carolina
Jeff Zeleny: Santorum outburst was for cameras
This comes after the House and Senate passed a short-term spending bill late last week, extending funding for one week to buy time to strike the deal on the larger package. If Congress is able to pass the omnibus this week, the next spending showdown is expected this fall, as they'll need to pass a new package by Oct. 1. Lawmakers will likely have to strike a budget deal to lift spending caps put in place by a 2011 law and then find a way to address raising the debt ceiling.
SUSAN PAGE: So this was the editorial page ran an op-ed, not the news site. I thought it was good that we gave the President a platform, the arguments he is making in-- in rallies and as he campaigns for candidates in the midterms. There was a big furor because it was not a fact-- there wasn't a fact check article that went with it and provided context and information for readers. I thought that was a legitimate criticism. I am glad that we, eventually, posted a fact checked about it. It's does show how much-- how inflammatory President Trump is for both sides. And how much he defines this midterm election that we're going to see in just three weeks.
Echoing Harris's warning, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a Democrat from New York, said Sunday a vote by any senator for Judge Amy Coney Barrett is a vote to strike down the Affordable Care Act and eliminate protections for millions of Americans with pre-existing conditions.

Yet while echoing an assurance most judicial nominees deliver to lawmakers, Gorsuch told senators during his confirmation hearing in 2006 that he resists philosophical pigeon-holing.
Simply put, premiums for a basic health care plan are beyond the budgets of many low- and middle-income Americans. For example, according to a recent survey conducted by the Kaiser Family Foundation and the Health Research & Educational Trust, the average annual total cost of employer-provided health care for a family of four was $18,142 in 2016. On average, workers paid $5,277 toward the cost of that care, and employers subsidized the difference -- $12,865 per year.

As a lawyer, he's argued 80 cases before the court and said Scalia's lively and often sharp questions forever changed the court's dynamics on the bench.
Obamacare is something that we are to build, it was a starting point and expanding access is not enough. Access doesn't allow you to actually pay your bills, said Harris. It doesn't allow you to actually afford to go to the doctor, it just says there's a doctor available. We have to make sure that people actually receive health care and that's the next step and that's what Medicare for All will do.
We need to pass those lessons on to the many generations to follow. [Cheering] Because we want our children in these nations to know that the only limit to your achievement is the strength of your dreams and your willingness to work for them.

Since leaving City Hall, Bloomberg has been giving away his fortune. He has donated billions to reduce gun violence, smoking, and greenhouse gases. He spent more than $100 million helping Democrats in 2018 when they retook the house.
If the Trump administration is going to keep trying to take those things away from people we're going to fight back, she said.
Retirement savings suffer from a problem economists call moral hazard -- people who don't save enough, or anything, for retirement because they know a compassionate society will provide enough to serve their basic needs. The solution to this problem is to induce them to save some of their paychecks each month so that, even if that savings doesn't fully cover their retirement expenses, at least they'll contribute something.
Today and every day I miss my good friend John McCain. It was a blessing to serve alongside a rare patriot and genuine American hero in the Senate.

This nominee has said she wants to get rid of the Affordable Care Act, Biden said. This president wants to get rid of the Affordable Care Act. Let's keep our eye on the ball. This is about less than one month Americans are going to lose their health insurance.
The Supreme Court previously ruled that the Affordable Care Act was constitutional because Congress has the power to tax people. It held that if people had to pay a penalty for not buying insurance, that payment was effectively a tax.
I congratulate Donald Trump on winning the nomination last night. Conventions are times of excitement.

In his exit memo from the agency, Castro said that HUD had stabilized the housing market and preserved affordable housing through public-private partnerships. Under the Obama administration, he wrote, HUD invested $18 billion in communities recovering from natural disasters and initiated a $1 billion competition for resilient housing and infrastructure projects. Views on LGBT issues and abortion rights He supports LGBT rights and was the first San Antonio mayor to serve as the grand marshal of the city's Pride Parade in 2009 and joined mayors across the country in signing the Mayors for the Freedom to Marry petition for same-sex marriage equality in 2012.

Controversy In 2016, the Office of the Special Counsel, an independent federal investigative body, found that Castro had violated the Hatch Act by commenting on the 2016 presidential campaign during an interview about local issues. Castro apologized and ordered his team improve training on the Hatch Act in his department. What Trump says Castro has not yet been a target for President Trump.

Issues In his video announcing his exploratory committee in December, Castro said he is focused on affordable college, care for seniors, universal health care and welcoming immigrants.
Kennedy played a similar role for many years — his votes on gay rights, abortion, the death penalty, the environment, voting rights and affirmative action basically determined the outcome of cases on which the court was divided between liberals and conservatives.

SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Yeah, a lot, and the fact that they're also increasing the amount of supply that they'll flow into the states right now. You know the states need to set up vaccination sites and have a predictable flow coming through those sites. They need to book appointments two, three weeks out. And so giving the states visibility on what the supply is going to be allows them to set up systems where people can go online and book an appointment two or three weeks out. A lot of people are willing to wait to get vaccinated. They just want to know when they're going to get vaccinated. So, I think giving more certainty to more people about when their time is going to come, when they can get an appointment, is going to be very important.
KELSEY SNELL: It is very much up in the air, and it is very, very difficult to see how that gets worked out.

These briefings are an important opportunity to inform and reassure the American public they are not a place for political attacks or to lash out at the press, Biden said appearing to read from a teleprompter, They're about the American people. The former vice president asked for the unvarnished truth from the president about the current response and chided the president's self-congratulation. Trump keeps saying he's a wartime president. Well, start to act like one, Biden said. While a few kinks are still sorting out, the Biden campaign is forced to retool their almost entire approach without public events.
Netflix plans to release a documentary following former First Lady Michelle Obama through a 34-city tour for her 2018 book, Becoming. CBS News campaign reporter Zak Hudak says the film by the same name is set to debut on the streaming platform May 6. In a clip from the documentary released Monday, Obama signaled she is planning for work ahead. It's not getting back on track, but it's creating my next track, she said, asked about transitioning back to her normal life. Obama praised the film's director, Nadia Hallgren in a statement. She's a rare talent, someone whose intelligence and compassion for others comes through in every frame she shoots, she said. Most importantly, she understands the meaning of community, the power of community, and her work is magically able to depict it. The film's release comes as millions of Americans are under stay at home orders and using streaming services. During this difficult time, I hope you'll find some inspiration and joy in this film, Obama tweeted.
The report filed by the officer read that he believed that she was a danger to herself and took her to an undisclosed facility.
With Scalia, the court had a narrow conservative majority. Now, it's a court on pause. Many of those cases will end up in a 4-4 tie, keeping the lower court ruling in place and setting no nationwide precedent.
In a press conference ahead of Mr. Trump's appearance in Tupelo, Hood said, I can't do anything about the swamp that the president is trying to clean up in Washington with all that bickering and things going on. But I can drain the swamp here that Tate Reeves has created.
Few foresee that Americans will become more united politically in the next couple of years. Republicans, Democrats, and independents alike are in agreement on this.
The move to start in the southwestern state comes as Bloomberg has hinted that he will not compete in other early states like Iowa and New Hampshire. Arizona has also been a focus of Priorities USA, a Democratic super PAC, who said they would include Latinos in Arizona and Florida as part of their 2020 voter mobilization.
(Yang Min Speaking Foreign Language/January 28, 2021)
For the country, there is a lot of wealth on the coasts but it's not here, Andy Argenbright, 52, said. It's really weird here because you have a lot of people in the small towns that are making almost nothing but then you come to Des Moines and the salaries are two to three times more.
The Democratic Senate campaign arm has endorsed a candidate in Iowa to challenge Ernst, but has not focused as much attention on the Iowa race, compared with other battleground contests. Mr. Trump won Iowa by 10 points in 2016, but a recent Morning Consult poll found 55% of voters in Iowa disapprove of Mr. Trump, while 42% approve of the job he has done.
In the roiling debate among Republicans between principle and pragmatism, the governors are weighing in. Jindal was in town to start the launch of a new ad campaign touting the success of the GOP brand in the states. Republican governors are driving America's comeback is the tagline. Their intent is to highlight their solutions-oriented records and get themselves re-elected. In this cause, they are clearly using Sen. Cruz and House Republicans as a foil. When Jindal says, We are not the party of no, the first thing that comes to mind is the group that has become associated with that phrase: Republicans in Congress.
Jeff Zients: Well, we're picking up the pace of vaccinations. It's doubled in our first month. People over 75, nearly 60% of them have received at least their first shot. That was only 14% five weeks ago. People over 65, almost half have received their first shot. That was 8% six weeks ago. But there's a long way to go. And we need to make sure that as fast as possible and as equitably as possible we are able to vaccinate all Americans.
I like the Upton amendment, Rep. Lou Barletta, R-Pennsylvania, told reporters after huddling with his colleagues Thursday. Actually, it puts more money in the high-risk pools for those with pre-existing conditions, and the fact of the matter is those with pre-existing conditions would have no insurance because the Affordable Care Act is going to totally fail.
FactCheck.org doesn't have a rating system, but they call politicians out in a contextual way.
DAN BALZ: Right. And that argument is going to be amped up this week in South Carolina and ahead of Super Tuesday. But-- but to your point about the Democratic establishment needs to get together, we saw in 2016 that there is no way that an establishment quote, unquote, within a party can do that. I mean, what it requires is sacrifice on the part of candidates who are now in the race to say, you know what, for the good of the cause I'm going to step aside. Well, which among these candidates is going to do that other than people who perform so woefully in South Carolina on Super Tuesday that they're essentially driven out of the race.
But Hargan also seemed to quibble, saying the work of an audit is to review compliance with procedures, not make legal conclusions. As a matter of law, none of the travel at issue was unauthorized.
That includes Florida's Latinos, whose early votes by mail are up 90 percent from 2012.
Senators who were briefed on the new health care plan Wednesday night were instructed not to say much about what's in it.
The Republican/Trump, in contrast, sees a college degree as more of a privilege conferred through stricter accountability that will involve private banks in lending, which is unlikely to lower the total cost of a degree.
Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi with correspondent Lesley Stahl
A University of New Hampshire poll from August had his approval rating at 70%. I know the pollsters and the pundits think this a long shot, but we've proved them wrong before and I believe in the people, not the pundits, Feltes said in a statement.
Mr. Trump plans to court House Republicans during a Tuesday morning trip to Capitol Hill. The House is expected to vote on the Republican legislation on Thursday, which is the seventh anniversary of the passage of Obama's health care restructuring, the Affordable Care Act (ACA).
At the same time, the Republican Party of Florida has also pushed the use of vote-by-mail. In a recent email, the subject line read, Request to vote by mail, and it included a link to contact officials to request a mail-in ballot. In Florida, anyone can choose to vote-by-mail if they wish, the email stated.
Similar groups are popping up all over the country. For Taylor, a lightbulb went off when she had a difficult time registering for her own vaccine. It took her a week. She realized seniors might be having an even harder time. So she and a friend decided to use their teaching skills and instruct people through a Facebook page.
DeSantis defended his military career and record as a prosecutor and continued, I am not going to bow down to the alter of political correctness. I am not going to let the media smear me like they like to do with so many other people.
The Supreme Court upheld Obamacare's individual mandate in 2012, with Chief Justice John Roberts joining with the liberal wing of the bench to deliver a historic win for the Obama administration. But if Barrett is confirmed, the Supreme Court's conservative majority would widen to 6-3, leaving Democrats fearful that she and the four other conservative justices would vote to strike down the Affordable Care Act. If Barrett's nomination is not approved by the Senate in time for oral arguments in the dispute over the healthcare law, an eight-member court will decide the case.
I think it's important to make sure that internally, our structure is sound, that people have the equipment, the tools they need, Conway said Thursday, when asked what her role would be in the campaign. I'm a big believer in retail politics, I've seen it work many times.
Donald Trump: Yes. Because it happens to be one of the strongest assets.
JAMELLE BOUIE: And so in a-- a present moment where-- in otherwise liberal senator like Kamala Harris faces intense scrutiny about her criminal justice record, where the previous Democratic nominee for President, Hillary Clinton, basically had to apologize for the Democratic Party in the 1990s to make her way through the primary. Biden, I think more so than even Hillary Clinton exemplifies the Democratic Party of the '90s in its bad and good, and that is going to be his burden going forward.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Just ahead, we'll take a look at the President's legal troubles. And we will be joined by former attorney to Michael Cohen, Lanny Davis, who is here in studio with us.
Now, if you go to her own campaign website, you'll see she's touting herself as The Patron Saint of Shade.
JOHN DICKERSON: I want to get to some of those issues in a minute, but where are we right now? Is there an agreement to maybe get- get something going here before people go to work or don't on Monday--

The president has pledged to introduce a new GOP health care plan, but that has yet to come to fruition.
Then, at the State of the Union, she did her mocking clap and it went viral.
Efforts to repeal and replace Obamacare in 2017 failed, which Mr. Trump blames on the late Sen. John McCain's opposition to the repeal. Twenty million people have received health coverage under Obamacare since it was signed into law in 2010.
MARGARET BRENNAN: --things like that guaranteed.
Washington Unplugged: Sen. Jim DeMint on CPAC, Tea Party Movement

I mean it 100 percent, I understand health care now, especially very well. A lot of people don't understand it, we are going to be, the Republicans, the party of great health care, Mr. Trump said Wednesday in an Oval Office meeting with the interim first lady of Venezuela, Fabiana Rosales De Guaidó. The Democrats have, they've let you down, they came up with Obamacare. It's terrible.
In November, she said in a tweet that President Trump is Saudi Arabia's bitch for announcing the U.S. will stand with Saudi Arabia, regardless of any intelligence community assessment on Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's involvement in the killing of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi. What Trump says Mr. Trump has not publicly criticized Gabbard. The two met briefly shortly after Mr. Trump was elected.
Mr. Trump won West Virginia by some 40 points in 2016, which means incumbent Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin will have a fight on his hands this November. However, Manchin has also developed a reputation as a moderate champion of the state's white working class, meaning that he may have enough juice to earn himself another six years in office.
Ed, let's start with you. Bernie Sanders making his case, going back to one of the hits, Medicare for all, which has now become mainstream. I mean at least five candidates have signed on to his plan that was kind of out there in 2016. Should we assume that this is going to be sort of the dividing point for Democrats?
If you want to own the power of God at your waist belt, you should have a background check. If you are a domestic violence abuser, convicted, you should not have a gun where you could snuff out the lives of your loved ones, Gillum said.
When I hear something like that, I am reminded of what my friend, Michelle Obama, advised us all: When they go low, you go high.
If you want to send a message to Washington D.C. that enough is enough, and Mississippi is tired of the endless investigations and partisan impeachment. If you want to send a message to the do-nothing Democrats in Mississippi and America, support President Donald Trump — vote Tate Reeves to make the next governor of Mississippi, Pence said.
MARGARET BRENNAN: When you say not allowed, I assume you're referring to Governor DeSantis, a fellow Republican who has put in place restrictions to bar local governments from enforcing mask mandates. So you're-- are you telling him, as mayor, I need power over my own city?
MARGARET BRENNAN: Why not have the intelligence community testify in public about what they are seeing, so that the public can arm themselves, so that they can understand what is disinformation and what is fact?
Tonight, in what has become an election year tradition for 60 Minutes — conversations with the major party candidates for president and vice president of the United States.

The Republican-sponsored American Health Care Act (AHCA) passed the House 217-213 Thursday, with one vote to spare, although it will face an uncertain path in the Senate.
The $300 bonuses were paid in December when the tax bill was signed.
According to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the Trump administration is actively considering launching a special enrollment period for Americans facing the ongoing COVID-19 crisis. The special approval would allow 32 states reliant on federal healthcare exchange to re-open enrollment, permitting Americans to sign up for coverage under the Affordable Care Act although open enrollment ended on December 15th for these states. The Kaiser Family Foundation says nearly 28 million people in the United States lack health insurance. According to a Gallup poll released earlier this month, 52% of Americans surveyed approve of the Affordable Care Act and 48% of the population disapprove.
The GOP's strategy may not be popular, but it's arguably the predictable move for House Republicans interested in self-preservation.
CBS News Contributor Frank Luntz will conduct a focus group during the coverage.
Donnelly's outspoken criticism of the president's trade policy has been a focus of his Senate re-election bid. In an interview with Fox News last week, Braun said that tariffs are tricky, but defended the president's actions, justifying them as a remedy for the trade imbalance.
SENATOR BEN SASSE: Yeah, that's just not true right. So, so much of what we fight about in Washington is right versus left and a lot more of our policy should be past versus future. There aren't going to be lifelong jobs anymore and we shouldn't be lying to the American people about it. We should be thinking about what does it look like to help people get back to work, back to meaningful employment, back to shared labor with their neighbors when they are thirty-five and forty and forty-five. We can't say, I, politician, am going to protect your jobs forever. Because it's not true.
Support for a nationwide ban on assault weapons has dropped over the past five years, from 63 percent in January 2011 to 44 percent today. For the first time since 1994, more Americans oppose (50 percent) a nationwide ban on assault weapons than favor one (44 percent).
Her statement also said the attention is now on their November race, where the two are slated for a rematch. This is only one step in the process, and I look forward to having a vigorous debate about the issues in the upcoming November 2020 election, she wrote.
John Edwards was leading Democratic Iowa caucus polling at state fair time in August 2007 by five points, but would eventually lose to Barack Obama. In August 2015, Hillary Clinton's 19-point lead over Sanders crumbled into a 0.3% win for her on caucus day.

--of Jensen? Okay. All right. In addition to those records, there are handwritten notes from January 24th, 2017. This was the day of Michael Flynn's interview. And the writer states, What is our goal? Truth, admission, or to get him to lie so we can prosecute him or get him fired? Is that a routine, by-the-book conversation between senior FBI officials?
MARGARET BRENNAN: --that the administration fell short?
MARGARET BRENNAN: Stephen Miller, one of the President's closest advisers said, he's ready to go to shut down. Do you think this is--
ED O'KEEFE: --about whether or not he's actually met his goal. But everyone presumes that he could-- that he will be on top of the money race and-- and very well could be north of thirty million dollars raised, which is a pretty good start.
MARGARET BRENNAN: But Democrats, voters, and even President Trump are asking the question.
TRUMP: Because you'd be in jail.
Meanwhile, Mr. Trump said Monday he would not consider delaying the 2020 general election, CBS News campaign reporter Nicole Sganga reports. I haven't thought of changing the date of the election. Why would I do that? November 3rd. It's a good number, Trump told reporters gathered in the Rose Garden for the coronavirus briefing. Mr. Trump called suggestions that he might try to move Election Day made-up propaganda by people surrounding the presumptive Democratic nominee. Let him know I'm not thinking about it at all, Trump added. Last week, Biden said during a virtual fundraiser, Mark my words, I think he is gonna try to kick back the election somehow, come up with some rationale why it can't be held.
In 2000 she talked with PBS producer David Willcock about how she chose the American museums to feature in her series Sister Wendy's American Collection: If I had stuck just to what I myself love best, every program would have been exactly the same, because each of these museums has superb holdings in my four favorite areas – medieval art, Oriental art, ceramics, and the Old Masters. But nobly, self-sacrificingly, thinking only of the good of others, I forced myself to investigate areas of art into which perhaps I had up to now taken little interest. As always happens with self-sacrifice, I was blissfully rewarded.
Mr. Trump did see a bump in approval of handling the protests following his visit to Kenosha. Before his visit 34% approved of his handling and 38% approved after his visit, with Republican approval increasing from 65% to 87%.
STEPHEN MILLER: --a flawed law-- a flawed law would be off the books. And this President working with members of both parties would be able to replace it with something that not only expands choice, expands competition, enshrines purchasing across state lines, but also protects preexisting conditions in a much better way than the current law does.
In New York's 24th District, a similar fight is playing out to see who will challenge Republican incumbent John Katko in the fall. Party leaders in the district, along with progressive and activist groups, rallied behind Syracuse University professor Dana Balter. But the DCCC weighed in and recruited Juanita Perez Williams, a military veteran, to primary Ms. Balter.
Wisconsin, which is scheduled to hold its primary on April 7, is still planning to allow for in-person voting, but asked the state for help to supply sanitation equipment, recruit more poll workers and provide a public health expert. Wisconsin also has no-excuse absentee voting, but on Monday the state's election commission put out a letter asking for more poll workers to help staff the election to replace older poll workers who are unable to serve due to health concerns and the coronavirus COVID-19 pandemic. Meagan Wolfe, the Chief Election Official, wrote in a letter to Governor Tony Evers on Friday, As of today, local election officials do not have access to the people or supplies needed. Wolfe added that this leaves voters, clerks, and poll workers to make difficult choices. Voters should not have to choose between voting or staying healthy. Poll workers should not have to choose between serving their community or staying healthy. Our local election officials should not have to choose between facilitating democracy or staying healthy.
8:31 p.m. ET The mother of Benghazi victim, Sean Smith, delivered an emotional speech at the convention, saying she personally blames Hillary Clinton for her son's death in the 2012 attack in Libya.

PAUL RYAN: Open the government back up. And then we'll get back to negotiating.
LANNY DAVIS: Never. But he announced ahead of time, wouldn't take it even if it was handed to him. And let's remember that Michael Cohen has corroborating evidence for everything that he has said. Mister Mueller certainly does on the issue of the purpose of the money paid to Stormy Daniels the same man who called Michael Cohen a rat denied on Air Force One to the American people that he knew anything about Stormy Daniels and Mister Giuliani, who this morning was on television accusing Michael Cohen of lying, the very next day waived attorney client privilege and said no his client did pay Stormy Daniels. So, Michael Cohen is now taking ownership in his statement to the court of his personal responsibility for his behavior when he worked for Donald Trump. Now that he saw Donald Trump as President, he underwent a genuine transformation because he feared for his country and his family--
If that means in the primary on the debate stage, they need to call each other out and explain the smaller details of their plans, I think that's a fair thing to do in the primary, former Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee Executive Director Dan Sena, who advises Sen. Michael Bennet's campaign, told CBS News:
Mr. Trump praised the plan last year, saying it would allow business owners to avoid paying too much. For the first time ever, sole proprietors will be able to buy lower-cost group insurance instead of getting ripped off by this disaster we all know as Obamacare, he said.
What Tuesday's results will or won't mean
The group pointed out that in his 2000 book The America We Deserve, Trump wrote, We must have universal healthcare... and longer term... find an equivalent of the single-payer plan.
Slotkin, who served in Iraq and spent 14 years in the national security field, said voters routinely express their concerns about the rising costs of health care and prescription drug prices at her campaign events. She told CBS News that she supports allowing people the option to buy into Medicare, which would control their cost of prescription drugs and health care.
Here's a breakdown of the women joining Team Trump:
And that is Wyoming Republican Senator John Barrasso, who's also a doctor, we should note. He was a key negotiator in the efforts to come up with a Republican measure that would replace Obamacare. I do want to get to that, but picking up on where Stephen just left off, he says shutdown may still happen if necessary to get this money for the border wall. It's five billion.
SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS (I-Vermont/@SenSanders/Democratic Presidential Candidate): Good morning.
For governors in states near regional hotspots like New York and Massachusetts, the approach to reopening has them watching their neighbors for new outbreaks.
MARGARET BRENNAN: And we-- and we may not have seen all the candidates. So as we've said Biden--
Democrats pounced on Mr. Trump for not pursuing direct Medicare negotiations -- an idea he championed before reaching the White House.
MARGARET BRENNAN:What does that look like for American--?
COOPER: Are you going — are you going to have a mandate that Americans have to have health insurance?
JOHN DICKERSON: But I'm trying to get answers from you--
While slowing economic growth, Romney said, Mr. Obama also broke the promises he made for health care reform when he barred C-SPAN from covering the health care deliberations,
At the New Hampshire Democratic Party Convention, Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard said she still sees a path forward despite not appearing in Houston. Continuing to reach out to voters through every means possible, every platform possible, she said of her plans. We have a very strong volunteer driven people powered campaign. We're spending as much time as possible out on the ground and doing exactly that.
John McCain: I kept saying to them, Tell it to me straight. Well, there's always this. There's always that. You know, and-- and I said, I can take it. Just tell me. And then they were more forthcoming.
SENATOR RICK SCOTT: Well, first of, Margaret, my focus is on in how you drive down the cost of health care? That-- that's what's causing people health care-- health care issues. You talked, you know, I've been talking to a lot of people in my state about the-- like insulin costs, how-- why in world would they go up the way they have? Now, the other thing--
Kirkpatrick, a Democrat, represents a slightly competitive district in Southeastern Arizona, and won by five points in 2018 after previously serving in another district from 2012 to 2014. The Cook Political Report rates the race as likely Democratic. One of her Republican challengers, Shay Stautz, tweeted out his support to Kirkpatrick earlier Wednesday. We should all recognize it takes guts to ask for help when you need it, Stautz said.
We are about 40 or 50 years behind the conservatives on realizing that a lot of excitement actually happens at the courts, Indivisible Project's director of democracy policy Meagan Hatcher-Mays told CBS News. She cited the Supreme Court's recent decision regarding Wisconsin's primary, which effectively forced voters to brave the polls during the COVID-19 pandemic, as a clear example of how the high court's decisions can directly impact lives.
SEN. KLOBUCHAR: --and that's why I want to move forward, as president, with comprehensive immigration reform.
Experts are also skeptical the U.S. could pressure foreign governments to pay more for drugs.
Seeking to alleviate those concerns, Barr sent a letter Friday to lawmakers saying the Justice Department will deliver the special counsel's report by mid-April, with parts redacted. He also offered to testify before the Senate and House Judiciary Committees on May 1 and 2.
One faction of one party in one house of Congress in one branch of government shut down major parts of the government all because they didn't like one law, Mr. Obama said. This Republican shut down did not have to happen, but I want every American to understand why it did happen. Republicans in the House of Representatives refused to fund the government unless we defunded or dismantled the Affordable Care Act. They've shut down the government over an ideological crusade to deny affordable health insurance to millions of Americans. In other words, they demanded ransom just for doing their job.
MARGARET BRENNAN: You said there, North Korea would denuc- denuclearize or at least need to reduce their arsenal. Would you accept them as a nuclear power?
Any effective replacement plan for the ACA will need to include features of one of these solutions.
THE FACTS: Trump should re-check his numbers before conducting a trade negotiation. He could be referring to the total U.S. trade deficit with every country in the world. That totaled about $508 billion in 2014, which actually represents an improvement from the $762 billion deficit reached in 2006, according to the Census Bureau.
Over a Third of Voters Plan to Vote by Mail in 2020
The ad is a sequel to a similar 30-second spot Manchin aired during his first run for the late Robert C. Byrd's Senate seat in 2010. Eight years ago, Manchin was a popular moderate governor looking to put significant political distance between himself, Barack Obama and congressional Democrats in order to win. Obama and Democrats were struggling to shore up support in states like West Virginia in the midst of debate over passing the Affordable Care Act. Obama was particularly unpopular in West Virginia because of his administration's push for cap-and-trade legislation and regulations on coal-burning power plants in the state. Over the course of the 30-second ad, Manchin was able to tout his endorsement from the NRA – a rarity for a Democratic Senate candidate – highlight his concerns with the cap-and-trade bill, and draw national attention to his attempts to stand apart from Democrats.
Republican strategists offer mixed views on the issue's impact, with the most optimistic hoping to damage Democrats by accusing them of favoring government-financed health care. About a third of Senate Democrats and two-thirds of House Democrats have backed such legislation, a favorite with the party's most liberal voters, which Republicans say will prompt government decision-making about care and tax increases to finance the proposal's huge costs.
Three-quarters of GOP primary voters said they support Trump's proposal to block Muslims from entering the United States. Twenty-three percent, on the other hand, said they oppose the proposed ban.
There are two steps here, the Democratic presidential front-runner said in a televised town hall on CNN. If someone can afford to pay for an insurance policy off the exchanges that were set up under the Affordable Care Act, I support that.
SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: Well, we're going to do everything we can to stop it. It's totally absurd. Look, you have--
BIDEN: That if you got any negative information about someone else from another- from a foreign source, you would not use it. And if you got any information that they were trying to interfere, you'd report it. I took-
The government reported a $984 billion deficit for the 2019 budget year. The CBO projects that deficits will rise from 4.6% of U.S. gross domestic product in 2020 to 5.4% in 2030. Because of those accumulating deficits, the agency forecasts that the federal debt held by the public will rise from 81% of GDP this year to 98% in 2030 — that would be the highest level since 1946 immediately after the heavy government spending that followed World War II.
Workers are sick and tired of being exploited, Sanders told workers Monday. What you're doing is right. And all over the country, people are doing what you're doing.
In an unusual moment, she also told Republicans that Democrats are not solely responsible for the problems facing America, an acknowledgement of the frustration felt in the American electorate with all of its political leaders.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Got it and quickly, do you support the president's call to cut off aid to Central American countries who are sending migrants into the United States?
Trump's comments were responding to a claim the president made about the GOP front-runner earlier that day.
MARGARET BRENNAN: --they're already trying to enact the cuts.
TRUMP: Am I allowed to respond to that? I assume I am.
When Pence interjected by saying Biden would repeal the Trump tax cuts, Harris stopped him. Mr. Vice President, I'm speaking, she said, shaking her head and laughing as Pence continued to speak over her. If you don't mind letting me finish, we can both have a conversation, she said.
Burt Reynolds Warner Brothers Actor Burt Reynolds (February 11, 1936-September 6, 2018) rose to stardom with action films and raucous comedies like Deliverance, The Longest Yard, Smokey and the Bandit and The Cannonball Run. He reveled in his persona as a 1970s sex symbol (and even winked at it with a nude photo shoot for Cosmopolitan magazine), and later found a new generation of fame with Boogie Nights in the late '90s, earning an Oscar nomination and a Golden Globe. He also won an Emmy Award for the CBS sitcom Evening Shade. My career is not like a regular chart; mine looks like a heart attack, he told The Associated Press in 2001. I've done over 100 films, and I'm the only actor who has been canned by all three networks. I epitomize longevity.
Support the Affordable Care Act (ACA), which allows anybody to purchase health insurance without being subject to exclusions for preexisting conditions. Prior to the ACA, many retirees under age 65 were unable to purchase health care at any cost due to such exclusions.
Acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney summoned the administration's two top health policy officials to meet with him at the White House in an effort to cool down a months-long feud that is reaching a boiling point. Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services administrator Seema Verma could met with Mulvaney Wednesday, several senior administration officials confirm to CBS News.
Donald Trump: Very much try and keep that. Adds cost, but it's very much something we're going to try and keep.
Lesley Stahl: But do you think that when you hold rallies and encourage people to say, Lock her up, the way you---
Aiming squarely at the president's 2012 election record, Trump had this message for Mr. Obama: You're lucky I didn't run last time when Romney ran because you would have been a one-term president.
SCOTT GOTTLIEB: I think Miami is at the highest risk right now, Miami and southern California. If you look at where B117 is right now in the country, about half the cases that we're turning over in Southern California and in Florida and the cities are the hot spots, San Diego, Miami. So I think that the possibility is that we're not going to see a national epidemic with B117, at least in the spring and the summertime. It's a risk to the fall. But what we're likely to see is regionalized epidemics with this new variant. And the two places in the country right now that are the biggest hotspots are southern Cali-- California and southern Florida, Miami. So those cities need to be very mindful of the spread of these variants. Now we know it works. Prior immunity and the vaccines do appear to be as effective against this new variant. So as we immunize more of the population and if people continue to wear masks and be vigilant in these parts of the country, we can keep this at bay. It's not too late, but it's a real risk to those regions of the country right now.
After he commended the two senators, however, Trump's audience booed. But then he promised, We go back to war tomorrow morning.
The non-partisan think tank, which works on tax policy issues, also takes issue with Mr. Trump's suggestion that tax cuts enacted by Congress in December are a driver for Exxon's expenditures, finding the price of oil to be a more likely factor. -- Kate Gibson
LANNY DAVIS: What did Mister Cohen mean by evidence or Mister Mueller mean by evidence? I can't tell you anything about what Mister Mueller meant, let's wait. But I can tell you that when he used the words core issues, those words are about the Russian investigation. And Mister Mueller is careful with his words. And he also mentioned that Mister Cohen provided information regarding the Moscow Trump Tower and that he was contacted by a senior government official and the press secretary to Vla-- Vladimir Putin.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Which is not unusual.
MARGARET BRENNAN: So, to be clear there, you're predicting that this goes to the Supreme Court and that the Supreme Court ultimately strikes down?
RADDATZ: We begin with your two minutes, Secretary Clinton.
Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dave Camp, R-Mich., told Sebelius Wednesday that it's absolutely critical that the committee get that information. Unless they pay their first month's premium, they can't get a premium tax credit, Camp pointed out. That's in the committee's jurisdiction.
MARGARET BRENNAN: I-- I'm sure people will like things cheaper. They always do. In terms of what they'll actually be able to get though, can you say that the Republican alternative will do things like guarantee access to maternity care or care for newborn children? Mental health? Some of the things that are guaranteed in Obamacare.
CLINTON STATEMENT: You can look at the propaganda on a lot of the terrorists' sites and what Donald Trump says about Muslims is used to recruit fighters.
Becky Taylor: Right. To eight teachers to solve their problem because, you know, teachers, we get things done.
Democracy grinds to a halt without a willingness to compromise; or when even basic facts are contested, and we listen only to those who agree with us, the president said, in a clear repudiation of the Republican Party's 2016 front runner, Donald Trump. Our public life withers when only the most extreme voices get attention.
[T]o every citizen watching at home tonight -- no matter where you have been, or where you come from, this is your time, Mr. Trump said. If you work hard, if you believe in yourself, if you believe in America, then you can dream anything, you can be anything, and together, we can achieve anything.
Louisiana and Kentucky also have gubernatorial elections this November.
Suburban women will you please like me? Please, please. I saved your damn neighborhood, okay?
Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham said Saturday that Barrett's confirmation hearings will begin on October 12. Mr. Trump's chief of staff, Mark Meadows, said on Face the Nation on Sunday that he expects the Senate to pursue a pretty aggressive timeline for her confirmation.
TRUMP: I'd like to know, Anderson, why aren't you bringing up the e-mails? I'd like to know. Why aren't you bringing...
Mr. Trump's Rose Garden announcement of Barrett as his Supreme Court nominee set into motion what is likely to be a swift and bruising confirmation battle.
We're going to make America safe again. We're going to make America great again, but we're going to make America safe again. And we're going to make America wealthy again, because if you don't do that, it just — it sounds harsh to say, but we have to build up the wealth of our nation.
LAS VEGAS — House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said Wednesday health care was on the ballot and health care won. The CBS News exit poll showed the majority of voters said it was the most important issue and a major factor in the Senate race in Nevada.
The head of a California company that helps people find ACA coverage says most of the new sign-ups they're seeing are people who qualify for Medicaid, and there's been only a modest uptick for subsidized private plans.
SEN. BARRASSO: There- there are a number of different options. That's one, another is a longer term. I would like to get actually all the appropriations bills passed. I think we do much better governing for our country if we do the whole thing through the appropriations process. We were able to do 75 percent of the funding. We still have a ways to go but border security is critical to this country. It- it is part, to me, of national security along with our economic security, our energy security. Border security is key to us as a nation.
Republican governors, GOP lawmakers in Congress, and the Trump administration are negotiating over Medicaid, with governors who expanded the program trying to keep more federal dollars for low-income people.
MARGARET BRENNAN: So would you keep--
Lesley Stahl: He's always been the indestructible man?
Last year, Trump's budget projected a slight surplus after a decade, but critics said it relied on an enormous accounting gimmick — double counting a 10-year, $2 trillion surge in revenues from the economic benefits of tax reform. Now that tax reform has passed, the math trick can't be used, and the Trump plan doesn't come close to balancing.
Smaller insurers that have traditionally operated in the Medicaid market have done well in the exchanges, said Sabrina Corlette, senior research professor at the Georgetown University Center on Health Insurance reforms. Centene (CNC) is one example. During a conference call Tuesday announcing Centene's better-than-expected earnings, CEO Michael Neidorff said, Centene's exchange experience continues to be favorable. While he didn't break down numbers, he added: We are achieving margins at the higher end of our targeted range.
MCGHAN: Well I certainly think that there's an imminent election and obviously everyone's talking about the election, but I think when the president makes a nomination, he's obligated to do so under the Constitution. This has happened 29 times in our history where there's been an election year nomination, and it's happened before. It'll probably happen again. And even Justice Kennedy, who many hold up as a- as a model justice was, was confirmed and appointed in an election year in 1988 when President Reagan wasn't even on the ballot. So this idea that somehow this is out of the norm simply doesn't ring true.
Mr. Trump said on Wednesday that the lawsuit is just phase one of terminating the ACA. He said he expects the case could reach the steps of the Supreme Court, which has already upheld the ACA twice before.
Trump says U.S. will work to fix bad trade deals
MARGARET BRENNAN: We saw this historic moment with President Trump stepping into North Korea. And I wonder, if you're commander in chief, would you continue the diplomacy that he has started?
In Alaska, the Republican gubernatorial primary is very competitive. It's a crowded field, with seven candidates in the race. The frontrunners are former state Sen. Mike Dunleavy and former Lt. Gov. Mead Treadwell. According to polls, Dunleavy is leading. Mark Begich, the former Democratic senator and former Anchorage mayor, is also challenging incumbent Gov. Bill Walker, who is running as an independent.
I can't disclose that, she responded. I can tell you he took it very seriously and very much appreciated being there.
TO STAY OR NOT TO STAY
More people in Michigan have had their health care plans cancelled than have enrolled nationwide, House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dave Camp, R-Mich., said in a statement. Given that these early enrollment numbers are inflated to include those just 'shopping' for a plan, it is clear that the real truth is even worse than we are being told.
Earlier in the day, Clinton made an unscripted visit to a popular Univision show, where she danced with the hosts and was presented with tequila and a birthday cake.
Nine Democrats said they favor Sen. Bernie Sanders because they say he led the way on several progressive policies. Emmanuel Hidalgo-Wohelen, 20, credited the senator for popularizing Medicare for All, the Green New Deal, and opposition to the U.S.-backed, Saudi-led war in Yemen. Sanders' supporters were also adamant that he has the guts to see through his agenda despite opposition from corporate interests.
SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR: I just want to get it investigated and figure out exactly what happened. But what I do believe is that if we just keep playing games with people's lives-- that's what they're doing. They're playing games with people's lives. They're playing games with a shut down which last time cost twenty billion--the Ted Cruz shut down for our economy. They are playing games with members of Congress, they take the leaders of Congress into the White House and create a media circus instead of just sitting down and negotiating. Do I think that we can avoid a shutdown? Of course, I do. Because there's people on both sides of the aisle that want to find common ground. I think that's possible. But the way that they're acting is not furthering the attempt to make sure that our government is steady at a time when the stock market is careening and we've got a judge throwing out the healthcare bill.

Even worse, those who have pointed out the markets' limitations have often been attacked as anti-market, against capitalism or favoring large government. That' a mischaracterization of this point of view.
Now the court has several big arguments on the horizon, including those abortion and immigration cases. Some of the cases could be rescheduled for next term, but it's unclear whether there will even be a new justice on the court at that point.
In the 60-second ad, Slotkin makes a personal plea to voters, reminding them that health care is on the ballot this election cycle. Her mother was diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2009 and passed away in 2011.
Lesley Stahl: So you are contending with a group in Congress: Over here on the left flank are these self-described socialists, on the right, these moderates. And you yourself said that you're the only one who can unify everybody. And the question is can you?
CLINTON: Well, Martha, first, let me say — and I've said before, but I'll repeat it, because I want everyone to hear it — that was a mistake, and I take responsibility for using a personal e-mail account. Obviously, if I were to do it over again, I would not. I'm not making any excuses. It was a mistake. And I am very sorry about that.
The Senate is doing the right thing. We're moving this nomination forward, and colleagues, by tomorrow night, we'll have a new member of the United States Supreme Court, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said on the Senate floor Sunday.

Repealing Common Core in Congress, it should suffice to say, hasn't happened, and Mr. Trump hasn't made a point of reviving that particular debate.
Will immigration controversy spark more Republicans to stand up to Trump?
A: According to a draft that leaked, the House plan would tax part of the value of the most generous employer health plans, as if it were income. Affected workers would face higher payroll and income taxes, and their employers would see their share of payroll taxes increase.

Earlier this week the Commonwealth Fund released its annual Affordable Care Act Tracking Survey, and the news isn't good for consumers struggling to afford individual health insurance coverage.

RADDATZ: Secretary Clinton, we have to...
And for all the talk about Trump destroying our democracy, it should be noted that the most democratic institution of all, the Congress, is working largely as designed. While the GOP-controlled Senate has backed Trump's judicial choices, it has not rubber-stamped the rest of his agenda. Republicans stopped the Trump-backed ObamaCare repeal and forced serious modifications of his original tax-cut proposals. Congress has yet to appropriate money for his border wall with Mexico, and Trump's policy proposals on immigration can't get a congressional majority from his own party, much less the Congress as a whole.
Since the election, Mr. Trump claimed, The stock market has smashed one record after another, gaining $8 trillion in value. That is great news for Americans' 401k, retirement, pension, and college savings accounts.
House minority leader Nancy Pelosi, in an interview last month with CNN and in a tweet, emphasized infrastructure as a priority for the Democrats. By and large, infrastructure has always been a bipartisan issue. We can create jobs by investing in new infrastructure projects like our water systems & broadband internet, she said in the tweet.
This public option would also cover the full scope of Medicaid benefits for nearly 5 million low-income Americans in states that did not accept the ACA's expansion of Medicaid, the government program used by more than 70 million people under the age of 65 who cannot afford coverage, a senior campaign official said.
SEN. SANDERS: --pharmaceutical industry- if the pharmaceutical industry which made 50-- the five major companies made 50 billion dollars in profits last year. They pay their CEOs outrageous compensation packages. If they don't like that then we'll take a look at their patents.
No, not at all. And, you know, I made clear during my confirmation hearing that I was gonna look into what happened in 2016 and '17. I made that crystal clear. I was very concerned about what happened. I was gonna get to the bottom of it. And that included the treatment of General Flynn.
It would be a mistake for any Democrats to make their final pitch to voters exclusively about Trump. Even in this hyper-national landscape, Democrats can't forget that local elections require a local frame – and voters need to believe a candidate understands their needs and has a vision for making their lives better. Voters are still worried about how they're going to pay the bills, what kind of education their children will have, and whether they can afford to visit the doctor.
A new poll from Monmouth University on Monday shows governors are exceeding Mr. Trump in handling the coronavirus outbreak, reports CBS News political unit associate producer Eleanor Watson. According to the poll, 72% of those surveyed said their state's governor has done a good job and 18% said their governor has done a bad job in handling the pandemic. The reviews are bipartisan, with 76% of Democrats, 73% of Republicans and 67% of independents saying their governor has done a good job in dealing with the outbreak. The positive reviews even come from residents of the four states with the highest number of coronavirus cases: California, New Jersey, New York, and Washington. In these four states, 74% say their governor has done a good job. More Americans said Mr. Trump has done a good job (50%) than a bad job (45%), but the reviews of how Mr. Trump has dealt with the crisis are more partisan. About 89% of Republicans say he is handling it well while only 48% of independents and 19% of Democrats approve of his administration's handling of the situation. The poll shows how governors across the country have taken charge during the outbreak. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo has received praise across the country for his daily briefings that include Powerpoint presentations about the outbreak in the state. During the Sunday White House COVID Task Force briefing, Mr. Trump said he spoke with Cuomo. He's working hard, Mr. Trump said. We're all working hard together.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Our latest Battleground Tracker polling shows your lead with South Carolina black voters is thinning out. In November, you were at fifty-four percent support. It's now thirty-five percent. That's a nineteen-point difference.

Vice President Mike Pence chaired the 7th National Space Council Meeting at NASA headquarters in Washington, D.C. on Tuesday afternoon. The VP, joined by various cabinet officials, discussed the upcoming and historic launch of two American astronauts next week into space on American rockets from American soil. CBS News campaign reporter Musadiq Bidar reports astronauts Robert Behnken and Douglas Hurley, who also joined the meeting, will be the first to fly in SpaceX's Crew Dragon capsule. Since the last space shuttle flight from Kennedy Space Center in July of 2011, NASA astronauts have flown to the International Space Station on rockets managed by Russia. The Vice President called the astronauts trailblazers of a new era, adding, the launch next week comes at an important time in the life of our nation as the country recovers from the coronavirus pandemic. We are one week and one day away from when America will return, American astronauts on American rockets from American soil to space, Pence said. It is a time of great hope and encouragement. Towards the end of the meeting, a pool reporter asked Pence if he is also taking hydroxychloroquine. Pence smiled and simply said thank you. In an interview following the Space Council Meeting, Fox News' Kristin Fisher asked the vice president if he is taking hydroxychloroquine. I'm not. But I would never begrudge any American taking the advice of their physician, Pence replied. Hydroxychloroquine is a drug that's been around for more than 40 years for treatment of malaria.
President Obama wasn't the only person South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley sought to rebut in the Republican response to the State of the Union Tuesday evening.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back. We are now joined by Minnesota senator and 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Amy Klobuchar. She joins us from Minneapolis. Good morning, senator.
Small-business confidence is at an all-time high. The stock market has smashed one record after another, gaining $8 trillion, and more, in value in just this short period of time. The great news -- (applause) -- the great news for Americans' 401(k), retirement, pension, and college savings accounts have gone through the roof.
Trump signed the continuing resolution in private Friday night after he returned to the White House from a daytrip to Atlanta.
JOHN DICKERSON: But I want to know why a president who came-- just what's gone wrong? Why has he not been able to apply? He came in as the great negotiator. What is it that has made it impossible for a person who ran on fixing the system
Other top Trump allies, notably campaign manager Kellyanne Conway, have launched a highly unusual public campaign to warn the president-elect that nominating Romney would be seen as a betrayal by his supporters. Conway's comments stirred speculation that she is seeking to either force Trump's hand or give him cover for ultimately passing over Romney.
We've gone from caring about character, rule of law, defending the constitution, a cogent national security policy, free trade. Where are all those issues? said co-founder John Weaver, a strategist who previously worked with McCain and John Kasich. Imagine if you had traveled the country for 30 years, fighting for Republican principles, and you learn it was all a lie. No one cares about all the issues that we fought for.
Lesley Stahl: I want to ask you all about something that's going on right now around the country. A lot of people are afraid. They're really afraid. African Americans think there's a target on their back. Muslims are terrified.
It's kind of hard to figure out who I want to support because there's so many candidates, Alicia Elliott, a 40-year-old Des Moines server, said. One of the reasons I'm at the fair today is actually because there's a lot of Democratic candidates and I want to hear what they're saying.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Did you meet the goal?
Well, history is written by the winner. So it largely depends on who's writing the history. But I think a fair history would say that it was a good decision because it upheld the rule of law. It helped, it upheld the standards of the Department of Justice, and it undid what was an injustice.
Vice President Mike Pence: Hello, Lesley.
Earlier in the day, the president also responded to comments made by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi after he said he was taking the drug. I don't respond to her. I think she's a waste of time, Mr. Trump told reporters. He later called the California lawmaker a sick woman who has a lot of mental problems. Pelosi said Monday night Mr. Trump should not be taking hydroxychloroquine due to his age and weight. As far as the president is concerned, he's our president and I would rather he not be taking something that has not been approved by the scientists, especially in his age group and in his, shall we say, weight group, morbidly obese, they say, Pelosi said during an interview with CNN on Monday night. So I think it's not a good idea.
The events are also the first glimpse at Biden's Florida operations, which have yet to be tested in a big way. Staffers and volunteers are calling, texting and emailing potential supporters urging them to tune into the two events, and aides said the campaign is also spending some money to advertise the event. And we should expect that Biden will also be conducting local television interviews.
ROBERT O'BRIEN: I-- I have not seen that. And-- and again, why would they have a preference for President Trump, who is rebuilding our military, who is giving the Ukrainians lethal aid to fight Russian troops? So that doesn't make sense. Now, look, we want good relations with Russia. We'd like to have great relations with Russia. I haven't seen any intelligence that there's any active measures by the Russians to try and get the President re-elected. And-- and we've got a simple message for the Russians or any other country that wants to-- to meddle in our elections, whoever they are behind: stay out of our democratic elections. And-- and we're doing everything we can. We're working with state and local officials. We're going, in many cases--
Collins predicted the rising uninsured trend is likely to continue. One reason: The repeal of the individual mandate, which required people to buy insurance or face penalties. The new tax law did away with that provision and eliminated penalties starting in 2019. Commonwealth found that 5 percent of people with insurance are planning to drop coverage once the mandate becomes obsolete. That's not a huge number, but it is something, said Collins.
You say who's making these deals? We're going the make great deals. We're going to have a strong border. We're going to bring back law and order. Just today, policemen was shot, two killed. And this is happening on a weekly basis. We have to bring back respect to law enforcement. At the same time, we have to take care of people on all sides. We need justice.
A Quinnipiac poll released this week did show that American voters favor a generic Democrat on the 2014 ballot over a generic Republican by nine points -- the widest Democratic margin so far in this cycle. That said, a generic ballot like that should be taken with a large grain of salt. In 2012, House Democrats actually won 1.36 million more votes than Republicans, but it didn't matter because of the way districts are gerrymandered.
ANNA PALMER: Republicans do not want to be talking about this.
Lesley Stahl: He went quiet is what I heard.
What we'd love to hear from the president is a real plan to defeat ISIL, said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on Sunday.
This, in fact, is our new American moment. There has never been a better time to start living the American Dream.
At the time of Kennedy's retirement, Barrett had been a federal judge on the 7th U.S. Circuit Court Appeals for just a few months. Prior to her selection by Mr. Trump to the federal bench in 2017, Barrett clerked for Justice Antonin Scalia on the Supreme Court and was a law professor at Notre Dame Law School for 15 years.
In 2013, analysts at the Social Security Administration calculated that in 2010 undocumented immigrants had paid $13 billion into the system and were making on average $34,000 a year at the time. From 1996 to 2003, undocumented workers paid a combined $90 billion into both Social Security and Medicare.
MARGARET BRENNAN: And don't expect a wholesale plan until after 2020?
Check the provider directories of all the plans available on your exchange to see if your doctors are still included. If you can't find your providers on the policy you want, simply call your doctors to double-check if they're still part of the network.
In a statement Daren Griffin, president and CEO of the Reno-Tahoe Airport Authority, said, We would hold our tenants to the same standard whether it was a Democratic or Republican rally or any other type of gathering. We are complying with the Governor's directive and Washoe County's recommendation during a pandemic. The president's campaign says Mr. Trump still plans to visit Nevada, with additional details to be announced soon.
SUSAN GLASSER: Absolutely. I think this is going to emerge as a case study of why words do matter in the Trump presidency. And Jonah's point is a very important one. What have we seen that's different from President Trump from his predecessors, Democrat and Republican? I would say that it's so much more of a transactional view of America's position in the world. And that is something that's-- that's quite different. Certainly, you've had criticism of even Barack Obama for not emphasizing human rights as much as others. But you've never had a President before who called journalist the enemy of the people. Now if you are the crown prince of Saudi Arabia, do you think you might factor that in to your calculation about what you could do with this particular dissident journalist when you have your good friend and ally, the President, say The journalists are enemies of the people. I think it's-- it's a really interesting example. Also, you know, values no longer figures in American foreign policy in the way that it has in the past.
The case, known as Fulton v. City of Philadelphia, involves the city's decision to exclude a religious foster care agency, Catholic Social Services, from its foster care system because the agency declines to place foster children with same-sex couples because of its religious objections to gay marriage.
Since then, however, the ex-wife, Lisa Fierstein, has recanted the abuse charge, which she said she'd made at her lawyer's urging. Puzder's spokesman said the nominee, who denied he had abused his former wife, and Fierstein have spent the last two Thanksgivings together with family.
Jeff Zients: Right. This is absolutely ours. And President Biden, within the first couple of weeks, secured enough vaccines that by July 31st, there's enough to vaccinate 300 million Americans.
There is less worry about the possibility of a local mass shooting. While over half of all Americans are at least somewhat concerned about a mass shooting in the area where they live, just 23 percent are very concerned, and 47 percent are not very or not at all concerned.
The tail end of the speech, which lasted over an hour, was devoted to military issues, with Mr. Trump calling for an end to spending caps for the military and the modernization of the U.S. nuclear arsenal. He also promised the final defeat of ISIS.
Lesley Stahl: You know that-- you know--
What to know about Tuesday's primaries
Many Twitter users glommed on to the line, tweeting it within seconds of it leaving Harris' lips.
JOHN DICKERSON: And is he going to stay in one place?
Over 225,000 Americans have died from the virus, and millions have lost their jobs due to the economic fallout caused by the pandemic.
Young patriots, like Preston, teach all of us about our civic duty as Americans. And I met Preston a little while ago, and he is something very special -- that I can tell you. Great future. Thank you very much for all you've done, Preston. Thank you very much.
The president has been making versions of this statement since his campaign. On the claim about illegal immigrants causing the loss of many innocent lives, PolitiFact has pointed out that the statement is so vague that sure, it's bound to be true, but it doesn't really say much. University of California, Irvine criminology professor Charis Kubrin points out that it's about as accurate as saying thousands of Americans have been killed by men.
As expected, the president asked the justices to block the release of his financial information.
What I do want to see is that we have more options for undocumented people to be able to get the health care they need, she explained. It's not only the right and moral thing to do for them. It's also important that we keep ourselves healthy, and public health requires that. So I see this as a two-step process.
In 2018, more new manufacturing jobs were added —284,000 — than in any year in decades.
And Barack and I set out to build lives guided by these values, and pass them on to the next generation. Because we want our children -- and all children in this nation -- to know that the only limit to the height of your achievements is the reach of your dreams and your willingness to work for them.
The number of manufacturing jobs in the U.S. was already making a comeback from the steep drop-off of the Great Recession when Mr. Trump took office, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. But the total number of manufacturing jobs still hasn't reached pre-Great Recession levels.
8:25 p.m. ET South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley has been spotted on the convention floor. She had previously said she wouldn't attend. Haley never formally endorsed Donald Trump for president. She campaigned for Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Florida, during the GOP primaries and then endorsed Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, for president.
SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: --contributions. One million--
In 2017, Republican efforts to repeal Obamacare failed in Congress. President Trump has said on several occasions since that Republicans would unveil their own health care plan, but it has not yet materialized. Now, as the coronavirus strains health care systems across the country, some question whether the entire system needs to be examined, including progressives who've long pushed for Medicare for All.
MILLER: You also have to think about the 28 million Americans who still don't have health insurance because Obamacare didn't work. Fortunately because of the dramatic action this administration has taken. We've increased choice. We've increased competition and, for the first time in a long time, premiums on the exchanges are going down not up.
Most newcomers are registering as unaffiliated with either party, a block that could sway the election. One-third of the state's voters are independent, like Kathy Martin, who's going to mail in her ballot.

Meanwhile, in Northern Virginia's competitive 10th District, incumbent Republican Rep. Barbara Comstock managed to hold onto her seat in a district that Hillary Clinton carried in 2016. Mr. Trump's approval rating in Virginia is below the national 40 percent, according to Gallup polling conducted earlier this year.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. So, are you confident, bottom line, that you will have a hundred percent of schools open by the spring?
Dr. Travis Gayles: It's going to take all of us working together to ensure that those disparities that we saw pre-COVID and those disparities that we saw in terms of COVID cases don't play out yet again in the vaccine distribution process.
You may want to consider many other details and nuances regarding the candidates' positions on these issues. And neither has yet taken positions on other issues that could improve the overall security of Americans' retirement, such as expanding retirement plan coverage to the half of the workforce that doesn't now have it. However, overall, Clinton's policies and positions appear to be much more favorable for the retirement of working Americans than Trump's.
ANTHONY SALVANTO: Well, enthusiasm is one of those factors. It's mixed in to what you just described. People who really mean to vote but maybe something gets in the way. Maybe enthusiasm helps you get over that hurdle. But, really, I want to say that enthusiasm is not the same thing as voting which you want to look at is that intent to vote. Look, you can only push that lever so hard. You can push it enthusiastically or you can just kind of give it a click, it's still one vote. But what you want to look at is whether that enthusiasm then drives people across that finish line, actually gets them there.
A CBS News poll conducted in May 2018, six months ahead of the midterm elections, found that health care tops the list of most important issue for voters, ahead of the economy -- and by two-to-one voters say they've been hurt, not helped, by the GOP's changes to the health care laws.
And I have worked and I admire President Obama. He inherited the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. That was a terrible time for our country.
MARGARET BRENNAN: It sounds like you and Senator Sanders agree on that.
Polling supports the strategy. Almost two-thirds of Democrats said the court was too conservative, leaving the left's approval rating for the Supreme Court at 38% according to Gallup, the lowest it has been since the end of the Bush administration.
In an Economist/YouGov survey also released on Wednesday, 42 percent of registered voters said they approve of the job Mr. Trump is doing as president, while 53 percent said they disapprove.
Both houses of Congress passed the weeklong measure with hours to spare before Friday's midnight deadline for some government operations to begin shutting down.
Lesley Stahl: There are some people who think that part of your no was to get back at the president and that the thumbs down was kind of more like a middle finger to him.
Just so you know, you said this in your opening, tomorrow people don't get paid. People get furloughed. The-- We have soldiers fighting for us, troops overseas fighting for us who will not be getting paid. This is ridiculous.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Does your sexual harassment bill become law? Do you have any idea?
We'll be back in a moment.
No matter which Supreme Court seat was vacated, from Anthony Kennedy to Elena Kagan, Team Trump was going to pick a Brett Kavanaugh or Raymond Kethledge or Amy Coney Barrett -- just as if Hillary had won, she'd want another Ruth Bader Ginsburg or Sonia Sotomayor.
Hillary Clinton attacked those same women and attacked them viciously. Four of them here tonight. One of the women, who is a wonderful woman, at 12 years old, was raped at 12. Her client she represented got him off, and she's seen laughing on two separate occasions, laughing at the girl who was raped. Kathy Shelton, that young woman is here with us tonight.
President Donald Trump: Lesley, we just picked up--
In February, we expect that there's going to be a COVID-specific relief package, Yaros said. That measure will likely once again extend unemployment insurance benefits, with enough support for another round of checks issued to Americans, whether it's 2K or slightly lower, he said.
Why would somebody change a doctor when they are in good shape or they have been healthy for so long? I think that is being lost in the conversation, she said.
COOPER: We have a question here from Ken Karpowicz. He has a question about health care. Ken?
Donald Trump: I just don't think they know me.

Generally speaking, historically, the infection rates roughly, from what I've seen, are comparable inside the institution (SIC) as they are in society at large. And we've been able to prevent our prisons from becoming Petri dishes where they sweep through with the same lethality that they have in, you know, nursing homes and so forth. It takes a lotta work, and the Bureau of Prisons has been working hard on that.
Still, Republicans seem unlikely to change their position - at least not yet. Members concluded their business in the early evening and headed home, sending the government into a second day of shutdown.
Following the release of the now-infamous Access Hollywood tape, Pawlenty rescinded his endorsement and called Donald Trump unsound, uninformed, unhinged and unfit to be president of the United States.
While hitting the campaign trail, Trump has made a habit of criticizing presidents past and present, regardless of their party.
Other GOP lawmakers said that their plan was a much more sustainable alternative to Obamacare.
Vice President Mike Pence is expected to preside over the confirmation vote, a move that left Democrats outraged since five people close to the vice president, including his chief of staff Marc Short, have recently tested positive for COVID-19.
Mr. Trump will focus on opportunities lifting up all Americans, and review his accomplishments in the first year, the official told reporters. Specifically, Trump's State of the Union address will focus on five major policy areas:
The two are set to appear on CBS News' 60 Minutes for their first joint interview with Lesley Stahl on Sunday, July 17, at 7 p.m. ET.
But the Republican National Committee issued a statement highlighting what it described as voter fraud that could result from vote-by-mail. While we have always supported absentee voting, California is a case study in why automatically sending this many ballots is a problem, the RNC statement said. Just last year, a court found that L.A. county had 1.5 million ineligible voters on their registration lists, meaning there were 112% more registered voters than adults living in the county. We are weighing our legal options to ensure the integrity of the election. Trump campaign communications director Tim Murtaugh made a similar argument, calling it a thinly-veiled political tactic by Newsom to undermine election security. There's a vast difference between people voting absentee by mail because they can't be at the polls on Election Day versus mailing everyone a ballot, Murtaugh said. Sending everyone a ballot - even those who didn't request one - is a wide open opportunity for fraud.
You see them marching and you see them on occasion, at least, I have seen it, where they are essentially calling death to the police. and that's not acceptable whether you like them or don't like them. That, Bill, is not acceptable. But I have seen it and you have seen it, Trump told O'Reilly.
Meanwhile, many young and healthy people, especially those that do not qualify for the government subsidies, continue to forgo coverage, despite the tax penalties imposed by the ACA for people who do not have health insurance. It is this group of healthy individuals that insurers and exchange designers were hoping would offset the cost of sick patients. Currently about 11 million people are covered by the exchanges, about half of the number originally expected to sign on.
Earlier in the day, the former Pennsylvania senator charged that Obama's agenda is not about you ... It's about some phony ideal. Some phony theology. Not a theology based on the Bible. That prompted Obama campaign spokesman Ben LaBolt to call Santorum's comment the latest low in a Republican primary campaign that has been fueled by distortions, ugliness and searing pessimism and negativity. LaBolt said it was a stark contrast with the President who is focused every day on creating jobs and restoring economic security for the middle class.
This will pass, House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-California, told reporters as he left a closed-door meeting with the House Republican Conference. House Majority Whip Steve Scalise, R-Louisiana, also seemed confident that the bill would pass.
TRUMP: I've said things that, frankly, you hear these things I said. And I was embarrassed by it. But I have tremendous respect for women.
That was just one of Kasich's six Palmetto state events over the past few days, where he is running his self-described sunny side of the street campaign. On this bright Thursday morning, however, Kasich used his pedestal on the carpet of Applewood House of Pancakes in Pawleys Island to offer a new criticism of Jeb Bush.

The percentage of Americans who disapprove of Mr. Trump's job performance has risen ten points since February of last year, suggesting that many who were undecided at the start of his presidency now disapprove of him.
Personal issues. Press reports on Monday disclosed that Puzder had employed an undocumented immigrant as a housekeeper. Two of President Bill Clinton's nominees in 1993, Zoe Baird and Kimba Wood, were forced to drop their bids for attorney general for using nannies who were illegally in the U.S. But the Trump administration, unlike Clinton's, has shrugged off the incident.
The Trump administration's plan unreasonably expands the definition of 'employers' to include groups without any real commonality of interest and to bring working owners without employees within ERISA's scope despite Congress's clear intent that ERISA cover benefits arising out of employment relationships, Bates wrote.
MARGARET BRENNAN: With new accusations and threats on top of increasing fears over the safety and security of members of Congress bipartisanship is in short supply on Capitol Hill.

PAUL RYAN: We're waiting to see. We're basically waiting to see today whether the Senate will vote on this or not and have the votes for it. So as you know, the House passed a bill keeping the government funded--
Monday's vote by the full Senate to confirm Barrett will come weeks after the death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, whose seat Barrett will fill, and one month to the day since President Trump announced her as his pick to the high court. Democrats urged the White House and their GOP colleagues to allow the winner of the November presidential election to fill the vacancy, citing the proximity to the electoral contest and Republicans' own opposition to taking up a Supreme Court nominee months before an election after Justice Antonin Scalia died in 2016.
Although the number of uninsured Americans has grown because of job losses due to the massive economic hit from COVID-19, the Trump administration resisted calls to authorize a special enrollment period for people uninsured in the pandemic.
SENATOR MARCO RUBIO: Look, if you don't sell arms, they're going to buy them anyways. And then in the future when you want to influence Saudi behavior on another topic, you're not going to have anything to threaten them with or anything to hold over their head. But to me, it isn't about the money. I don't know if the President had just been briefed and that's kind of how he used it or expressed it. But the bottom line is I mean, there-- the money, there's no way-- there's not-- there's not enough money in the world for us to buy back our credibility on human rights if-- if we do not move forward and-- and take swift action on this if, in fact, if and when it's-- it's proven to be true.
During his speech, delegates began chanting lock her up, lock her up to which Trump replied, Let's defeat her in November.
Monday night, House Republican leaders unveiled changes to the bill that would help older Americans with expenses, and would immediately prohibit additional states from opting into the Obamacare Medicaid program. They would also, however, allow states to opt into traditional Medicaid block grants.
But when asked whether she'd had contact with the Biden campaign during the virtual press conference, a FLDP moderator said they wouldn't be taking questions on that subject at the moment.
TRUMP: You could have done it, if you were an effective — if you were an effective senator, you could have done it. If you were an effective senator, you could have done it. But you were not an effective senator.
MARGARET BRENNAN: So will the president instruct Republican governors to continue to implement the law until there is a replacement?

Around the world, we face rogue regimes, terrorist groups, and rivals like China and Russia that challenge our interests, our economy, and our values. In confronting these horrible dangers, we know that weakness is the surest path to conflict, and unmatched power is the surest means to our true and great defense.
MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to switch to health care. This ruling on Friday, it seemed the timing caught some people by surprise, but the decision was that Obamacare according to this federal judge in Texas was deemed unconstitutional. What do you make of that?
President Donald Trump: Of course he is, Lesley.
But Republicans argue the situation this year differs from that of four years ago, as the same party controls the White House and the Senate. Mr. Trump has also said nine justices are needed if the Supreme Court is tasked with deciding the outcome of the presidential election, which it did in 2000.

THE FACTS: Lost jobs? Since the time Obama signed the health care law in March 2010, the nation's jobless rate has fallen from 9.9 percent to 5 percent. The economy has added more than 13 million jobs over that period.
Both officials dismissed the idea that President Trump hasn't shown leadership in trying to get a deal on immigration and government funding. Short said that he was very active on Thursday and has continued to make calls to lawmakers of both parties Friday morning.
CAITLIN HUEY-BURNS: He was the vice president to a very popular President for Democrats. So, that's why you're seeing him lead the polls, and there certainly is time for him to make a real campaign. But I think the response to this shows that he doesn't have a campaign operation ready to go and operating to respond to these kinds of attacks. So that's what leaves open those questions.

Mr. Obama conceded to CBS News chief White House correspondent Major Garrett, My expectation was that for 98 percent of the American people, either it genuinely wouldn't change at all or they'd be pleasantly surprised with the options in the marketplace and that the grandfather clause would cover the rest. That proved not to be the case. And that's on me. And the American people -- those who got cancellation notices do deserve and have received an apology from me.
With any type of insurance, you have to buy it before you need to make a claim. Any insured population faces the risk that sometime in the future, they may incur an event that would cause them significant financial stress, but they don't know when that event may occur. So they buy insurance to protect themselves and their family.
The committee will be contacting voters through phone banks, mailers, radio and digital ads to inform them of their ballot options. The DCCC said it would also be sending about 3.4 million text messages to ballot holders, as well as to sign people up for mail voting.

A USA TODAY/Suffolk University survey out Monday shows Biden leading Mr. Trump by 6 percentage points nationwide, 44% to 38%. That is a considerable shift from Trump's 3-point lead in the December poll, during House impeachment proceedings and a crowded Democratic primary, reports CBS News campaign reporter Nicole Sganga. The poll comes six months ahead of the 2020 Presidential election, as the Trump administration tackles questions surrounding ongoing testing capacity and economic reopening. States face record-breaking unemployment numbers with millions of new claims are anticipated in the weeks to come. Thus far, the pandemic has cost more than 55,000 lives in the United States alone.
The president enters the House chamber
The second one is, are they on some performance measurement plan? Do they have something like patient-centered medical home (PCMH) so that they're measuring their performance and trying to improve it? That is key, because we want doctors who are going to do better and know how well they're doing.
Last year, I also pledged that we would work with our allies to extinguish ISIS from the face of the Earth. One year later, I am proud to report that the coalition to defeat ISIS has liberated very close to 100 percent of the territory just recently held by these killers in Iraq and in Syria and in other locations, as well. But there is much more work to be done. We will continue our fight until ISIS is defeated.
We want every American to know the dignity of a hard day's work; we want every child to be safe in their home at night, and we want every citizen to be proud of this land that we love.
The Affordable Care Act is moving forward, Mr. Obama said Monday afternoon. You can't shut it down. This is a law that passed both Houses of Congress, a law that bears my signature, a law that the Supreme Court upheld as constitutional, a law that voters chose not to repeal last November, a law that is already providing benefits to millions of Americans.
As to Hillary Clinton, the charge of putting herself ahead of America guilty or not guilty? Hillary Clinton, lying to the American people about her selfish, awful judgment in making our secrets vulnerable. What's your verdict? Guilty or not guilty? Christie said. In Libya and Nigeria guilty. In China and Syria guilty. In Iran and Russia and Cuba guilty.

Kamala Harris Sen. Kamala Harris kicks off 2020 run 05:19 Biography Harris was born in Oakland in 1964 and raised in a multicultural household. Her mother, Shyamala Gopalan Harris, was a scientist from India and her father, Donald Harris, an economics professor at Stanford University, was born in Jamaica. Harris went to high school in Canada, where her mother worked as a hospital researcher and college professor. She returned to the U.S. to go to college at Howard University, a historically black university in Washington, D.C. and then went on to attend law school at the University of California, Hastings. Upon graduation, Harris stayed in the Golden State and worked for the Alameda County district attorney's office in Oakland. In 2003, she was elected San Francisco district attorney, a position that had never been held by a woman or person of color. During her 10-year tenure as the city's chief law enforcement officer, Harris spearheaded efforts to curb high recidivism rates among released prisoners and created a nationally recognized reentry program for nonviolent, first-time drug offenders. After winning a hotly contested race in 2010, Harris became California's first female attorney general, as well as the first Indian-American and Jamaican-American to hold the post. During her two terms, Harris' office implemented implicit bias training among officers and defended several state lawyers dogged by accusations of prosecutorial misconduct. After Sen. Barbara Boxer announced her retirement, Harris launched a bid for her seat.
Republican Sen. Susan Collins, who voted against her party's repeal effort in 2017, said that if the administration is opposed to Obamacare, the answer is for the administration to work with Congress and present a plan to replace and fix the law, not to, through the courts, seek to invalidate it altogether.
Will Vinton Vinton Entertainment Animator Will Vinton (November 17, 1947-October 4, 2018) invented Claymation, a style of stop-motion animation using putty or clay instead of models. The technique was featured in his Oscar-winning 1974 short, Closed Mondays. His animation studio would become best-known for a series of TV commercials for the California Raisin Advisory Board, starting in 1986, that starred the California Raisins. His Claymation fruit danced and sang the Motown hit, I Heard It Through the Grapevine. Vinton's Raisins would also appear (as cel animation) in a 1989 series, The California Raisin Show, which ran for 13 episodes on CBS, which later sparked a sequel. Vinton also created Claymation TV specials, including the Emmy-winning A Claymation Christmas Celebration (1988). In addition to other commercials (including those starring Domino's Pizza Zoid), Vinton created animation effects for the Michael Jackson music video Speed Demon, and the film Return to Oz. He also directed a feature-length Claymation film, The Adventures of Tom Sawyer. Vinton once described the quality of bringing clay to life, one frame at a time, to CBS' 48 Hours: You see the material move, you see the stuff kind of come to life the way flesh comes to life. But even an animator's hands-on touch can't guarantee popularity like that of the Raisins: You can't create a phenomenon, he said. It just sort of happens.
An unauthorised use at the Republican Convention against our wishes - Queen — Queen (@QueenWillRock) July 19, 2016
As we moved from subject to subject, our conversation grew more tense. President Trump brought up what he calls the unfairness of the fake media. Most prominently: a lack of coverage of his unproven and unverified charges that former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter, have received millions of dollars in corrupt payments from a Russian oligarch and a Chinese billionaire.
On Tuesday, the president defended his campaign spending, claiming they had to put up a lot of money to combat stories about the coronavirus. He said would put up his own cash for his re-election bid if he has to, but said they are doing very well. Neither Trump nor Biden's campaigns have announced how much cash on hand they had at the end of August, but earlier last month Biden's campaign revealed it had nearly closed the gap over the summer after facing a nearly $200 million cash disadvantage earlier this year. So where has some of the president's campaign cash all gone?
McConnell and Mr. Trump were always unusual allies. They talked regularly as Mr. Trump campaigned as the party's presidential nominee, according to the senator's office. But it had been a decade since McConnell had an active relationship with the White House. He and Obama rarely spoke.
On this issue, Clinton has the advantage.
JAMELLE BOUIE: --but hasn't taken any sort of step which kind of encourages migrants, right, that-- there-- there isn't as bad at the border as Trump says it is, so maybe I could take my chance.
South Carolina is one of 14 states that hasn't expanded Medicaid.
JONAH GOLDBERG: Well, I mean, I know it's shocking that message discipline isn't the word of the day for-- for the Trump White House. I think that part of the pro-- you can't shut down the border without hurting the economy, even though President Trump tweeted or said yesterday that because of our trade deficit with Mexico we would make money by shutting the border, which doesn't scan. I think part of the problem is the White House has been trying to-- President Trump has been wanting to message the crises at the border as basically a scene from a Chuck Norris movie where the people are coming in to, you know, rape and pillage the country, and that's how he's wanted to describe the crisis. Democrats have not wanted to give him any credit for the fact that there actually is--and the media, too, I have to say--credit for the fact that there actually is a crisis at the border. But it's not the crisis of the drugs and the guns and all of that. It's a humanitarian crisis.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Kellyanne Conway, counselor to President, called it the worst non-rollout of the 2020 campaign when she was on television today. I want to play one sound bite from the vice president as he tried to gesture towards something in his legacy that may become a problem in 2020.
Donald Trump: No, I'm not gonna take the salary. I'm not taking it.
As part of our defense, we must modernize and rebuild our nuclear arsenal, hopefully never having to use it, but making it so strong and powerful that it will deter any acts of aggression. Perhaps someday in the future there will be a magical moment when the countries of the world will get together to eliminate their nuclear weapons. Unfortunately, we are not there yet.
CBS News political unit broadcast associate Aaron Navarro reports that the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee immediately showed their support for Eastman, and released an internal poll showing her beating Bacon by 1% (48% Eastman vs. 47% Bacon). The poll also shows Biden with a double digit lead over Trump in the Omaha metro-suburban district, Biden 52% vs. Trump 41%.
Seong-ho traveled thousands of miles on crutches across China and Southeast Asia to freedom. Most of his family followed. His father was caught trying to escape, and was tortured to death. Today he lives in Seoul, where he rescues other defectors, and broadcasts into North Korea what the regime fears the most ‑- the truth, the president said. Today he has a new leg, but Seong-ho, I understand you still keep those crutches as a reminder of how far you have come. Your great sacrifice is an inspiration to us all. Seong-ho's story is a testament to the yearning of every human soul to live in freedom.
Two-term Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty launched an unsuccessful presidential bid during the 2012 cycle, running as a self-professed commonsense Sam's Club Republican. He later endorsed Gov. Mitt Romney, was on the top of his vice presidential shortlist, and was a frequent surrogate on the campaign trail. Although Pawlenty was in the private sector during the 2016 cycle, he was a vocal critic of then-candidate Trump.
MARGARET BRENNAN: So to be clear there, you're predicting that this goes to the Supreme Court and that the Supreme Court ultimately strikes down?
Conway emphasized her own focus on issues, rather than the tone and style of the campaign, promoting Trump's past few days as a tremendous messaging week with a very muscular anti-terror speech earlier.
That's what Social Security does. It provides a mechanism that forces people to pay for their own retirement instead of relying on the goodwill of society to bail them out when they can't afford the basic necessities they need to survive.

Let me say that, at that point, he was the designated national security adviser for President-Elect Trump, and was part of the transition, which is recognized by the government and funded by the government as an important function to bring in a new administration. And it is very typical, very common for the national security team of the incoming president to communicate with foreign leaders.
The race for the GOP nomination for Mississippi governor is going into a runoff, after Mississippi Lieutenant Governor Tate Reeves fell short of the 50 percent majority needed in Tuesday's primary to advance to the general election.

The Obama-era health care law covers more than 23 million people through a mix of subsidized private insurance sold in all states, and expanded Medicaid adopted by 38 states, with Southern states being the major exception. Coverage is available to people who don't have job-based health insurance, with the Medicaid expansion geared to those with low incomes.
The fact of the matter is health care is personal to me. Obamacare is personal to me. When I see the president try to tear it down — and others propose to replace it and start over — that's personal to me too, Biden says in the ad.
He became a federal district judge at 37 years of age and was appointed to the 3rd Circuit in 2007. And Hardiman just celebrated his 53rd birthday on July 8.

Biden said that while women who make accusations like this deserve to be treated with dignity and respect, and when they step forward they should be heard, their stories should be subject to appropriate inquiry and scrutiny.
Biden has vowed to build upon the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act — one of the central pillars to the Obama administration. He is proposing the addition of a public option to the health care law to allow Americans to buy into a Medicare-like system that resembles what is available to those who are at least 65 years old. The fate of the law, however, faces legal jeopardy as the Trump administration wages a legal battle to dismantle it in the courts.
In the ad, Manchin uses a shotgun to blow a hole in a copy of a lawsuit that his opponent, West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey, is backing that challenges the legality of the health-care law. Manchin warns in the ad that the lawsuit would take away health care from people with pre-existing conditions. Pausing to reload his weapon, Manchin says, He is just dead wrong, and that ain't going to happen.

Well, this particular episode, it looks like the impetus came from the seventh floor.
Despite his involvement in the Starr investigation, Kavanaugh has written that Congress should pass a law protecting a sitting president from being subjected to civil suit. In that same paper, Kavanaugh argued that the indictment and trial of a sitting president…would cripple the federal government, rendering it unable to function with credibility in either the international or domestic arena and that even the lesser burdens of a criminal investigation…are time consuming and distracting.

The GOP's official platform devotes all of three paragraphs, out of 62 pages, to college costs. In the past, Trump has favored abolishing all or part of the U.S. Department of Education, although that statement is neither on his website nor in the GOP platform statements. To date, Trump hasn't elaborated on which parts of the Education Department he would cut.
Lesley Stahl: Okay. Kayleigh, thank you.
On ABC, Trump said of his support for universal health care, It's a long time ago. It's 11 or 12 years ago. And frankly, a lot of people agreed with it. A lot of conservative Republicans agreed with it, at that time. We have a different country today. We can't afford things that we could have afforded or that we thought we could afford many years ago.
TRUMP: Oh, yeah. What about the other 15,000?
Bill Whitaker: So that's-- that's, like, ten or 50 more plants that don't have to be built.
By midday Monday, the congressional debate had fallen into a predictable pattern and a shutdown seemed inevitable. The House would pass a version of the spending bill that delayed or chipped away at the Affordable Care Act. The Senate would proceed to strip the bill of its amendments, pass it, and send it back to the House, and the cycle would start again.
ANNA PALMER (Politico/@apalmerdc): Yeah. I anticipate this is going to be a storyline for the next several months. There's going to be jockeying between DOJ and Congress and Democrats want more information. They want the full report. They are not backing down from that. And I also think you see the President using this clearly as a political ploy that he thinks works for him. He-- he's been mentioning it on the campaign trail. I think that's going to continue. And this is a storyline that he's very comfortable with because he feels like he was vindicated.
THE FACTS: About the only thing that was clear in this exchange is that both are squirming over their past immigration positions in a primary season dominated by conservative voters.
Each day since, we have gone forward with a clear vision and a righteous mission -- to make America great again for all Americans.
Now, tweeting happens to be a modern day form of communication. I mean, you can like it or not like it. I have, between Facebook and Twitter, I have almost 25 million people. It's a very effective way of communication. So you can put it down, but it is a very effective form of communication. I'm not un-proud of it, to be honest with you.
Every candidate on this side, pro-life, pro-second amendment, pro-president, pro-America, pro-working class individual. On the other side, the same is just not true, Bevin said at the event in Clark County. Vote your values and not your party.

A new Marquette University Law School poll shows Joe Biden with a four point lead over President Trump, 47% to 43%, among likely voters in Wisconsin, according to CBS News campaign reporter Adam Brewster.
Alongside Bevin in coal country was state Representative Rocky Adkins, a former primary opponent of Beshear who won a lot of these Eastern Kentucky counties when Democrats chose their nominee in May. In a similar move, Vice President Mike Pence was deployed to the state on Friday to rally voters in heavily Republican areas Bevin lost in the primaries.
Today she's a more self-assured Nancy Pelosi, more willing to promote herself.
If we set those goals and we go together to try to achieve them, there's nothing in my opinion that America can't do. So that's why I hope that we will come together in this campaign. Obviously, I'm hoping to earn your vote, I'm hoping to be elected in November, and I can promise you, I will work with every American.
Since we passed tax cuts, roughly 3 million workers have already gotten tax cut bonuses -- many of them thousands and thousands of dollars per worker. And it's getting more every month, every week.
Despite his corporate work, Patrick has remained engaged in Democratic politics and helped campaign nationwide for congressional and gubernatorial candidates. Since leaving the statehouse, Patrick has remained tight with a small cadre of consultants who advised him during his deliberations last year over whether to mount a campaign.
I am asking Congress to ensure that, in the fight against ISIS and al Qaeda, we continue to have all necessary power to detain terrorists, wherever we chase them down, wherever we find them. And in many cases, for them, it will now be Guantanamo Bay.
TRUMP: ... 600 — wait a minute, Anderson, 600 times. Well, she said she was awake at 3 o'clock in the morning, and she also sent a tweet out at 3 o'clock in the morning, but I won't even mention that. But she said she'll be awake. Who's going — the famous thing, we're going to answer our call at 3 o'clock in the morning. Guess what happened? Ambassador Stevens — Ambassador Stevens sent 600 requests for help. And the only one she talked to was Sidney Blumenthal, who's her friend and not a good guy, by the way. So, you know, she shouldn't be talking about that.

The coronavirus pandemic roiled the final weeks of the Supreme Court's term, causing the high court to cancel in-person arguments scheduled for March and April. Some of the cases that were set to be heard in its last term were rescheduled and will be argued next month, when the justices convene the new term. But the high court heard arguments in 10 legal battles by telephone in a rare May session, including three involving subpoenas for President Trump's tax returns and a pair of cases involving so-called faithless electors.
A CBS poll conducted in the immediate aftermath of the speech indicated that it was a hit with viewers. Three in four Americans who watched the speech said they approved of it, with just a quarter saying they did not.
According to Priorities USA, it has been outspending the president online and on TV in key states since July 2019, including more than $12 million on ads addressing Trump's response to the coronavirus. On Tuesday, the Super PAC announced it was launching a new TV and digital ad campaign focused on the president downplaying the pandemic. One ad titled Way Down will run in Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania as part of the PAC's $65 million TV buy through Election Day. The 30 second spot uses clips of the president saying we have it totally under control and it's going to go away about the coronavirus. In another ad Mission Accomplished, the president states we have met the moment and we have prevailed before a narrator goes through the number of deaths and unemployment figures as the pandemic continues.
Senator Kamala Harris and Vice President Mike Pence faced off Wednesday in the only vice presidential debate of this election. Each were given two, uninterrupted minutes to answer each question, and early on in the evening, Harris uttered the first meme-worthy sentence of the debate: Mr. Vice President, I'm speaking.
So, what will make these stops distinctly Florida even though Biden will be beaming in from Delaware? Expect a slate of local leaders or political figures to appear before Biden speaks, and there may be some Florida-specific items in Biden's graphics or backdrop, said the aides, who weren't authorized to speak publicly about the matter.
Hillary Clinton, the eventual Democratic nominee, did not release a list, since President Barack Obama had already nominated Merrick Garland, whose confirmation the Republican-controlled Senate blocked.
But it is important for us as a policy, you know, not to say, as Donald has said, we're going to ban people based on a religion. How do you do that? We are a country founded on religious freedom and liberty. How do we do what he has advocated without causing great distress within our own county? Are we going to have religious tests when people fly into our country? And how do we expect to be able to implement those?
Late last night, Biden commented on the killing of 25-year-old Ahmaud Arbery, whose death was captured on video, CBS News campaign reporter Bo Erickson reports. On Twitter, Biden called for an investigation into Arbery's death, noting it was clear that he was killed in cold blood.

Leading up to the South Carolina GOP primary next week Kasich will not spend every day in the state, but he plans to return for a final push right before South Carolinians go to the polls. Over the last few days, he has said that his success lies in their hands.
After two decisions from this court and multiple failed regulatory attempts, the federal government has arrived at a solution that exempts the Little Sisters from the source of their complicity-based concerns — the administratively imposed contraceptive mandate, Justice Clarence Thomas wrote for the majority, referencing Little Sisters of the Poor, the Catholic nonprofit involved in the case. We hold today that the departments had the statutory authority to craft that exemption, as well as the contemporaneously issued moral exemption.
Lesley Stahl: So you'll stay up here?
We've really seen the collapsing of political discourse, Gillum said.
Complicating matters, the New York Times reported Thursday night that Mr. Trump ordered the firing of special counsel Robert Mueller in June but backed off after White House counsel Don McGahn threatened to resign — something that isn't likely to help win support from Democrats, even if the president has shown no sign recently that he still intends to get rid of Mueller.
Issues Klobuchar is a very active senator who is often willing to work on a bipartisan basis. As of December, Klobuchar has sponsored 111 pieces of legislation which have been signed into law. However, Klobuchar is also ideologically liberal on several issues. As a member of the Senate in 2009, Klobuchar voted to pass the Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare. She is pro-choice and supports LGBT rights. She also has an F rating from the National Rifle Association. Klobuchar is a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and made a name for herself in 2018 for her calm yet incisive questioning of then-Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh during the hearings investigating claims of sexual misconduct against Kavanaugh in September. At one point, when asking if Kavanaugh had ever blacked out from drinking, he retorted: Have you? The moment quickly went viral, and Kavanaugh later apologized. Controversy Klobuchar was the sole senator from Minnesota during the resolution of the contested Senate election from January to July 2009, which Al Franken eventually won. When Franken was accused of sexual harassment in December 2017, Klobuchar did not call for Franken to step down, unlike many other senators. Franken resigned shortly after the allegations came to light.

And it's worked. Multiple polls since the 2016 election have found that a majority of Democrats believe the Russians actually tampered with vote totals (there's zero evidence that they did) and 74 percent of Democrats believe the alleged Russian meddling is likely to have cost Clinton the election.
In a press conference on Tuesday, Gingrich alluded to his recent financial difficulties, telling reporters that I think we can get to Tampa despite the fact that clearly we're going to have to go on a fairly tight budget.
The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee launched a new Virtual Action Center on Friday, serving as a one-stop shop for volunteers to get connected with House campaigns. Since the pandemic has transformed any sense of traditional campaigning, the center aims to get volunteers involved through virtual events like phone and text banks, registration drives or Zoom conference meetings. Most of these volunteer events begin with a Zoom training session.
Manchin had been floated as a potential pick for Mr. Trump's cabinet. But Mr. Trump doesn't seem that interested in helping Manchin, who he recently said doesn't do anything.
Meanwhile, the chairman of the Freedom Caucus, Rep. Mark Meadows, R-North Carolina, said he's looking forward to what the Senate will produce.
I've only been spending my entire life making sure that as many people as possible get health insurance, he said on CBS' Face the Nation Sunday. The Affordable Care Act, which I helped write, which I voted for, supported, has done some good things. No question. But we have got to go beyond that. We've got to join the rest of the industrialized world. Healthcare for all as a right.
Democrats have seized on the health care issue, making it a major focus of their messaging in an election year after it played a central role in the 2018 midterm elections. Both Alexander and Cornyn have voted to repeal and replace Obamacare in the past.
In Minnesota, State Representative Erin Murphy, Rep. Tim Walz, and state Attorney General Lori Swanson are vying for the Democratic nomination. Murphy has been endorsed by the Minnesota DFL, EMILY's List, National Nurses United, Our Revolution Minnesota, and the Sierra Club, among others.

Cory Booker Cory Booker launches 2020 campaign 02:57 Biography Cory Booker was born in Washington in 1964 and raised in the affluent suburbs of northern New Jersey. He received a bachelor's degree in political science and a master's degree in sociology from Stanford University, where he also played tight end for the football team. After graduation, Booker was awarded a Rhodes scholarship to study at the University of Oxford, earning a master's degree in modern history. He returned to the U.S. for a law degree at Yale. After working as a public-interest attorney and housing advocate in Newark, Booker decided to run for the city's municipal council in 1998. He managed to topple a long-time incumbent and, at age 29, become the youngest-ever member of the council, where he gained notoriety for fasting outside a housing project to denounce the intensifying crime and drug use in some of Newark's neighborhoods. After launching an unsuccessful bid in 2002 against incumbent mayor Sharpe James, Booker ran again in 2006 and defeated deputy mayor Ronald Rice. During his seven-year tenure as mayor, Booker was praised for attracting large companies to Newark and revamping the city's downtown. But he was also criticized by local residents and officials for appearing out-of-touch and focusing on his national image. The only way you can see the mayor is if you turn on 'Meet the Press,' Newark's current mayor, Ras Baraka, said when he was a councilman during Booker's mayoral administration.
SEN. SCOTT: Well, of course. I mean--
JOHN DICKERSON: But let me go back to this. You said the ad is not productive. Here's the-- here's the concern people have. This is a fight over this moment, okay? But it's opening up this larger, pretty ugly debate. That ad suggests basically, The Democrats are for the dangerous people. We're for the good Americans. When it gets into that kind of a debate, it gets very elemental, and you start doing-- saying things and creating wounds that can't be healed.

MARGARET BRENNAN: So you have prioritized, as the federal government has suggested, based on age. And-- and there is a correlation, of course, between mortality and age when it comes to COVID. But one of your local papers, The Connecticut Mirror, had analysis pointing out that the sixty-five and older group in Connecticut is about eighty-four-percent white. Given how hard hit people of color are, should race be a factor?
COOPER: You've said you want to end Obamacare...
The president suggested more accusers could come out against the former vice president in the future. He'll probably have others come out. He might, Trump said. At this point, Reade is the only woman who has ever alleged that Biden sexually assaulted her.
At the same time, Democrats can speak to the broader phenomenon increasingly described as a kind of Trump Anxiety Disorder. Effective democracy requires faith in our institutions, experienced leadership, and a steady hand in both peace and in crisis. In the era of Trump, we have none of these. Americans have seen the most contentious Supreme Court confirmation hearings in decades, a White House and Cabinet that's constantly turning over, and a president who stokes fears, snubs traditional U.S. allies while embracing strongmen, and peddles falsehoods daily. It's no surprise that they want a check on Donald Trump – in some surveys by as much as a 2 to 1 margin.
Mr. Trump, who galvanized supporters by pledging to build a wall on the southern border — and make Mexico pay for it — eliminate Obamacare, and bring back manufacturing, among other things, has had two years of a unified Congress to carry out those ideas.
SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: Yeah. I mean I have criticized Trump for everything under the world-- under the sun, but meeting with people who are antagonistic is-- is to me not a bad thing to do. I think, unfortunately, Trump went into that meeting unprepared. I think it was a photo opportunity, and did not have the kind of the diplomatic work necessary to make it a success. But I do not have a problem with sitting down with adversaries all over the world.
A committee vote for another Cabinet nominee, treasury secretary pick Steven Mnuchin, was postponed until Tuesday morning.
We're not worrying about something that is out of our control: who becomes the nominee, he said. We're worrying about - are we taking our principles, applying it to problems so we can offer people real solutions.
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-New York, also called it a positive development.
In touting a $50 billion investment in the U.S. by ExxonMobil (XOM), President Donald Trump in his State of the Union address cast the oil company's announcement as one of many positive results of recently enacted tax legislation. While the assertion regarding Exxon's five-year spending plan is true, it's less impressive than it may initially appear.
This morning, Biden's campaign unveiled two new ads as part of what his team said would be a $65 million ad buy this week across multiple platforms. The first ad Little Brother is airing on broadcast and digital in Michigan, Minnesota, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. It focuses on a little boy named Beckett who was diagnosed with leukemia when he was two years old.
MARGARET BRENNAN: We're also seeing the financial market show some nervousness right now about the trade dispute with China, about slowdown in Europe, about Brexit, where do we start the New Year on the foreign policy front, Ed?
JOE BIDEN: What I meant was there is a thousand places we can go to deal with injustice. I can think of ten countries where women and or children and/or people are being-- are being persecuted or being hurt. But the idea of us going to be able to use our Armed Forces to solve every single internal problem that exists throughout the world is not within our capacity. The question is is America's vital self-interest at stake or the vital self-interest of one of our allies at stake? And the fact that they have a system in Afghanistan, as they do in parts of Pakistan, as they do in parts of other countries, that we're going to send troops to-- because there is not a-- a-- human rights are not being valued to the same degree that we are, that's a different story about sending combat troops. We should call it out. We should go to the United Nations. We should be saying this is what's happening. We should try to shame and get the world to put pressure on, an economic pressure, on people who engage-- countries who engage in that but not send troops. That's what I meant. It is not sufficient. That was my point. And the idea was and I think Richard had said something like, well, women are being abused there. I said they are being abused in a lot of places around the world.
Not to be deterred, he turned around and drove to Franklin, Tennessee - eleven hours from Virginia Beach - to see a Trump rally there. He even flew out his 12-year-old son Robbie from Buffalo for some father-son bonding over Trump.
SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR: Yeah, I just went back and looked at that testimony. I look at the face of that sweet little girl seven-year-old Jakelin Caal. She looks like the faces of the kids that were in my daughter's second grade class. And he came and testified before us and I asked him if he regretted any of the Trump immigration policies and he said he did, but he didn't even mention that this had happened. Under law they're supposed to tell Congress within twenty-four hours if someone dies. So, we clearly have to get to the bottom of that. But the second thing is comprehensive immigration reform, so that we can have some order at the border and that we can have a smart plan that works for our country, including a path to citizenship and doing something about states like mine where we don't have enough workers in our fields and in our factories. Making sure that we have smart policies that work with fencing and other things. And that's not what they're talking about. What they're talking about is chaos.
9:15 p.m. Over the last year, we have made incredible progress and achieved extraordinary success. We have faced challenges we expected, and others we could never have imagined. We have shared in the heights of victory and the pains of hardship. We have endured floods and fires and storms. But through it all, we have seen the beauty of America's soul, and the steel in America's spine.
3:01 p.m. ET With speeches coming up tonight from Newt Gingrich and Ted Cruz, the CBS News Election Unit's Jennifer De Pinto looks at recent polling to see how both men are viewed:
Of course, Mr. Trump's presidency has barely begun. Narrowing the range to what he suggests-- in our first year -- his claim adds up:
MARGARET BRENNAN: But the White House was briefed on February 14th. Were you not in that briefing when the President was informed?
In a letter to Mnuchin, who has been leading negotiations for the White House, Pelosi placed the blame for the ongoing stalemate squarely on the Trump administration, arguing Democrats still have not received word on compromise language for a strategic testing, tracing and treatment plan, vaccines, and Obamacare coverage for Americans who are out of work.
That is why, tonight, I am asking Congress to pass legislation to help ensure American foreign-assistance dollars always serve American interests, and only go to friends of America, not enemies of America.
The lawmakers say that all agencies, including the White House, owe Congress and the public an explanation as to why it refuses to enforce the law. The Democrats have also requested that certain individuals be made available for congressional questioning on the issue at hand.
In a proclamation released before the event, Mr. Trump said on Thursday we join together to offer gratitude for our many blessings and to acknowledge our need for divine wisdom, guidance, and protection.
BEN DOMENECH: --is something that's finally seeing the light of day at the Senate level.
(CBS News) Just hours before Newt Gingrich confirmed to reporters that he is so low on funds that he will be laying off a third of his staff, Rick Tyler, a senior adviser at the pro-Gingrich super PAC Winning Our Future, said he thinks the candidate will go all the way to the convention - and that the super PAC will be there for him when he does.
Otto's Parents, Fred and Cindy Warmbier, are with us tonight -- along with Otto's brother and sister, Austin and Greta, the president said.

The vice president told CBN that while some voters believed the Supreme Court wouldn't be as big of an issue in the 2020 election as it was in 2016, that's all changed.
SEN. SANDERS: Because we will look at the average costs of prescription drugs in Canada, the UK, Germany, Japan and France.
At the same time, as of a few months ago, our warriors in Afghanistan have new rules of engagement.
But in the 1980s, he won new fans by appearing in cult movies with Divine, the 300-pound transvestite, most notably John Waters' 1981 Polyester and Paul Bartel's 1985 Lust in the Dust. In his 2005 memoir, Tab Hunter Confidential: The Making of a Movie Star, Hunter recounted the stresses of being a love object to millions of young women when he was, in reality, a gay man. I believed, wholeheartedly - still do - that a person's happiness depends on being true to themselves, he wrote. The dilemma, of course, was that being true to myself - and I'm talking sexually now - was impossible in 1953.
Workers at New Hampshire's Rockingham County Nursing Home have seen three presidential candidates in the past week alone. Bernie Sanders, Tulsi Gabbard and Andrew Yang have all rallied alongside nursing home employees in support of their effort to unionize.
It's hard to know exactly how much the government has spent implementing the Affordable Care Act so far, given the nature of government contracting. However, the nonpartisan Government Accountability Office said back in June that from 2010 through March 2013, the government spent around $394 million to implement the federal marketplace. Additionally, by March 2013, HHS had awarded around $3.8 billion in grants to states for their own state-run Obamacare marketplaces.
But Congress eliminated the penalty in 2017. Now, the court will decide if the rest of the Affordable Care Act is still constitutional without it.
And as the number of cases continues to rise Florida, a spokesperson for Florida Governor Ron DeSantis told CBS News campaign reporter LaCrai Mitchell that he is continuing to monitor COVID-19. The governor is not planning any rollback of Phase II reopening at this time, said the spokesperson, who added that he never announced a timetable for a Phase III.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay. Governor Lamont, thank you for your time today.
MARGARET BRENNAN: We spoke to the national security adviser to the President, who is denying that the White House was informed of the preference for Trump. But- but you and I both know that in 2016, that was the intelligence community's clear--
The two events are a first for the Biden campaign as they begin targeting specific swing states ahead of November's election. Recent polls give Biden a single-digit edge over President Trump in Florida and the stops – or whatever we're calling them – are designed to shore up support in two corners of the state where a Democratic presidential candidate can do well: Jacksonville, which has a large African-American population, and Tampa, which sits at the western edge of the famed I-4 corridor that White House campaigns always target in pursuit of swing voters.
As we rebuild our industries, it is also time to rebuild our crumbling infrastructure.
8:19 p.m. ET Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, announces that Indiana Gov. Mike Pence has been selected as the vice presidential nominee.
At issue is Attorney General Jeff Sessions' recent decision that the Justice Department will no longer defend key parts of the Obama-era Affordable Care Act in court. That includes the law's unpopular requirement to carry health insurance, but also widely supported provisions that protect people with pre-existing medical conditions and limit what insurers can charge older, sicker customers.
Manchin, however, is betting that this public embrace will backfire. He and his campaign are hoping to convince West Virginia voters that a vote for Morrisey is a vote against coverage for pre-existing conditions.
MILLER: --sides of the aisle on your show today.
Lesley Stahl: Well, they listened to you in the campaign and that's--
Looking back to the spouses of other first time Republican presidential nominees, Melania Trump is viewed similarly to Sen. John McCain's wife, Cindy McCain, before the 2008 Republican convention - seven in 10 of voters were undecided or didn't know enough about Mrs. McCain at that time.
Sanders attacks Clinton over fracking, calls for national ban
Well, I think one of the things you have to guard against, both as a prosecutor and I think as an investigator, is that if you get too wedded to a particular outcome and you're pursuing a particular agenda, you close your eyes to anything that sort of doesn't fit with your preconception. And I think that's probably the phenomenon we're looking at here.
A federal judge in Florida ruled on Sunday that a state law that prevented formerly incarcerated people with prior felony convictions from voting due to an inability to pay fees and fines was unconstitutional. U.S. District Judge Robert Hinkle of the Northern District of Florida called the law a pay-to-vote system, adding in part that the requirement to pay fines and fees that are unknown and cannot be determined with diligence as a condition of voting is not constitutional. CBS News campaign reporter LaCrai Mitchell reports that in 2018, Florida voted to pass the Voting Rights Restoration for Felons initiative — also called Amendment 4 — so that most people with prior felony convictions who had served their sentences could vote. But the inability to pay unknown court fines and fees could still prevent some from enjoying their restored voting right. Florida Congresswoman and vice presidential contender Val Demings weighed in on the decision in a tweet on Tuesday. Florida voters overwhelmingly supported Amendment 4, declaring that voting is a right, not a privilege, tweeted Demings. Glad to see Judge Hinkle uphold this cherished ideal and take us one step closer to true enfranchisement. Florida Democratic Party chair Terrie Rizzo called the ruling a victory for American Democracy and Floridians in an emailed statement. The United States Constitution once again proved stronger than Trump, DeSantis and the Florida GOP's efforts to shred it.
9:41 p.m. One of my greatest priorities is to reduce the price of prescription drugs, he said. In many other countries, these drugs cost far less than what we pay in the United States. That is why I have directed my Administration to make fixing the injustice of high drug prices one of my top priorities for the year. Prices will come down -- watch.
Geoffrey Wellum Cecil Beaton/Imperial War Museums Squadron Leader Geoffrey Wellum (August 4, 1921-July 18, 2018) was just 18 years old when he joined the RAF in August 1939. Somebody said: 'Here's a Spitfire – fly it, and if you break it, there will be bloody hell to pay,' he recalled in 2013. Serving with 92 Squadron, Boy (pictured at RAF Biggin Hill in Kent) was the youngest Spitfire pilot to defend Britain against the Luftwaffe. Surpassing the average four-week life expectancy of RAF pilots during the war, he flew between 50 and 60 sorties during the Battle of Britain, shooting down or damaging several German planes. Wellum was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross, and was later promoted to flight commander. Years later, as he faced divorce and the loss of his house, he told the Independent, I just wanted to sit quietly and convince myself that at some point in my life I had been of use. Wellum penned a memoir, which would later be published as the bestseller First Light, hailed as a remarkably emotional tale of a young man coming of age inside the cockpit of a fighter plane. It was later turned into a BBC film, which Wellum himself judged to be the most authentic rendering of the Battle of Britain, surpassing even the 1969 epic with all the big chaps in it, he told Forces TV.
MARGARET BRENNAN: All that and more, is just ahead on FACE THE NATION.
Lesley Stahl: On your own transition team.
It'll come back even better, and that we'll get it passed and finally lower premiums for the American people, he said. I've talked to over 14 different senators on this subject and I'm very optimistic that we'll find some common ground.
Also, while the Office of Management of Budget claims that debt under Mr. Trump's budget would fall from 78% of GDP by 2029 to 71%, the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimates that using more realistic assumptions on economic growth, that debt would, in fact, go up to 87% of GDP. The group, a budget watchdog, praised the Trump budget's proposals on slowing the growth of health care costs and reforming some spending programs but said that the budget is riddled with gimmicks, like hiding the cost of increased defense spending and depending on overly optimistic economic growth assumptions.
BIDEN: We'll see. I mean, look, you guys love this stuff. I'm not into this. Let's just see what happens.
Lesley Stahl: Some of them told us that they're afraid of you.
But that was before Donald Trump became president.
Mr. Trump has not been clear on the specifics of what he wants in an immigration deal, though he's participated in several discussions on the issue over the past week. He has endorsed protecting so-called Dreamers, making permanent the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, but he also reportedly has demanded $20 billion in funding for construction of his proposed wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.
(CBS News) FRANKSVILLE, Wis. - In directing what appeared to be a new level of vitriol toward Mitt Romney, Rick Santorum on Sunday described his rival as the worst Republican in the country to put up against Barack Obama. Santorum later, however, bristled at the notion that he was referring to anything other than Romney's position on health care.
During his eight years as governor, Patrick implemented a health care reform plan launched by his predecessor, Republican Mitt Romney, that later served as a model for Obamacare. He also raised the state's minimum wage to $11 per hour.
House Democrats said Monday they were willing to pass a six-week spending bill that would keep operations funded at sequester levels, giving Congress more time to negotiate.
President Trump announced Monday evening that he is nominating Judge Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court seat being vacated by retiring Justice Anthony Kennedy. He said of Kavanaugh that he has impeccable credentials and unsurpassed qualifications, and a proven commitment to equal justice under the law and referred to him as a judge's judge.
I think we want to get the pain over with, he said.
I always feel safe, Bob. I've told you in the past, I know that I'm going to die but it's only going to be in bed, said McCain in 2013.
Early this summer in response to a request from AARP, the Clinton and Trump campaigns both prepared statements regarding their positions on reforming Social Security, and their answers were strikingly different. Clinton offered specific, detailed proposals that would strengthen the funding of the financially strained system and that would better meet the needs of a changing older population. Many of her proposals agreed with recommendations from a recent comprehensive study conducted by the Bipartisan Policy Center.

Lesley Stahl: Well, what about the--
In an interview on MSNBC's Andrea Mitchell Reports, Conway was asked if the physician who released the very brief letter describing the state of Trump's health last year was the same doctor who performed his latest physical last week.
SUSAN GLASSER: Well, just a quick thing. I-- I do think nimble is a very charitable word, you know, for somebody who has really-- Donald Trump hasn't changed but many of his critics have changed in how they approach and-- and frame him. She did leave the Oval Office saying that Jared Kushner was a hidden genius in the administration the same week that this-- this Saudi controversy has arisen. And this goes to the point of, you know, what is the administration's foreign policy increasingly these days? I think we see a situation where it's less and less true that there's a Trump administration foreign policy and a Trump foreign policy. Since President Trump got rid of Rex Tillerson, his first secretary of state, got rid of H. R. McMaster, replaced them with Mike Pompeo and John Bolton. Both of them come out of certainly much more of a classic, very conservative, very hard line Republican foreign policy establishment. They differ on their own policy positions from President Trump. But he's made it very clear that he doesn't want to have any more public disagreements and it appears that they have not challenged him as much, even privately as their predecessors did. Nikki Haley is someone who did speak up repeatedly at various points in time where she disagreed on Russia, for example, and on other aspects of foreign policy.
BIDEN: Which we know nothing about. Look, I opposed the surge in the first place. Number one, I didn't think we should have even the troops we sent there. Now, it's all been made public now that we should have the troops in the first place that we sent there. And I didn't think we should have had the number of troops, which is considerably less than the present- this- this president added. I think we should only have troops there to make sure that it's impossible for the Taliban and excuse me- for ISIS or al-Qaeda to reestablish a foothold there, to be able to go from Afghanistan to the United States to attack the United States. That requires a much smaller footprint. But as I understand it, we're not drawing down to a level that was even as low as it was when we left Afghanistan.
While thousands of protesters took to the streets in Iran a few weeks ago, Mr. Trump tweeted, and the White House released a paper statement. There was, however, not an on-camera statement.
John McCain: Oh, yeah. I think about Ted a lot. Ted stayed at his job, kept working. Kept going even when he was in a wheelchair. And he never gave up because he loved the engagement.
We have seen that the Funny or Die is at least ... the number one referral to healthcare.gov referral source late this morning, White House spokesman Jay Carney said Tuesday afternoon.
At the same time, a lot of other women, like Kate Spittlemeister, living in suburban Wisconsin, couldn't bring themselves to vote for either major candidate in 2016. A lot of us, myself included, thought, 'There's no way Trump is going to win,' so we voted third party, which I did myself, she said.
MARGARET BRENNAN: --as you predicted, strikes down the law, then those preexisting condition protections are also gone. So are you--
Lesley Stahl: But personal. I'm talking about man to man--
Sebelius on Tuesday said the Gallup survey wasn't a coincidence or something that just happened on its own.
The candidate has only won two primary contests so far - one in his home state of Georgia - and faces plummeting poll numbers, dwindling financial resources and a loss of momentum as rivals Rick Santorum and Mitt Romney continue to rack up victories.
John McCain: Oh yeah, oh yeah. It puts everything in perspective.
Of Price's House vote last week easing the passage of legislation in the future that could completely nix Obamacare, Murray said people in her home state have tears in their eyes at the possibility of losing their heath care coverage.
I completely get how upsetting this could be for a lot of Americans, particularly after assurances they heard from me, Mr. Obama said from the White House briefing room. To those Americans, I hear you loud and clear.
They respect each other, said Kennedy, who talks with both. Mr. Trump has learned that the slow-moving Senate operates differently from the executive branch. And McConnell has demonstrated patience, and he's very good at holding his tongue.
JOHN DICKERSON: I want to get to solutions in a minute, but let's stick with the diagnosis for a moment. You are, in fact, able to make this case because you're a politician and so what I want to ask you about is the power of example in politics. There is no more famous person probably in America than the President.
COOPER: We have to move along.
Lesley Stahl: --stalled a little bit.
Geoff Emerick Courtesy paulmccartney.com Recording engineer Geoff Emerick (December 5, 1945-October 2, 2018) worked with innumerable artists during his career, from Judy Garland to Cheap Trick, Supertramp, Elvis Costello and Jeff Beck. But his greatest success came through his monumental work with The Beatles on such landmark albums as Revolver and Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. A London native fascinated by music and technology from an early age, Emerick was an invaluable part of the Beatles' legacy as they became increasingly ambitious and experimental in the studio (including the embrace of effects like backward tape loops and double tracking). He was on hand as an assistant during the Beatles' early EMI sessions in 1962, and was promoted in the mid-1960s. Producer George Martin recalled in a 1990s documentary that Emerick was unconventional: He used to do really weird things [with microphones] that were slightly illegitimate, with our support and approval. His innovations on Sgt. Pepper included enhancing the sound of Ringo Starr's drums on A Day in the Life by loosening the skins and wrapping a microphone in a tea cloth and placing it in a glass container. McCartney also recorded bass lines after the rest of a given track was done – an unusual practice at the time. Emerick became frustrated during the recording of the White Album and briefly quit, but returned for Abbey Road, and worked with Paul McCartney on his solo Band On the Run album.
President Donald Trump: –we're rounding the corner. We're doing well. We're doing well. We understand the disease. We've done a good job. We've done maybe a great job. What we haven't done a good job on is convincing people like you because you're really quite impossible to convince, but that's okay. And the economy now is coming back and it's coming back very strongly, and people see that, Lesley.

Democratic congressional candidate Jamaal Bowman was endorsed by the New York State Nurses Association Tuesday, adding to his list of support in his challenge against Congressman Eliot Engel, reports CBS News political unit broadcast associate Aaron Navarro. Their June 23 primary has turned into a vote-by-mail election, with ballots expected to be mailed out soon. Bowman's campaign has been drawing contrasts with Engel over who is present and active in the Bronx and Westchester area district, an epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic. NY-16's nurses and essential workers are grateful for Jamaal Bowman's partnership throughout the ongoing crisis, including joining nurses rallying at St. Joseph's Hospital to demand an increased production of PPE, and repeatedly calling out the corrupt price gouging of this life-saving equipment, NYSNA President Judy Sheridan-Gonzalez said in a statement.
The federal government may not completely finish the automated payment system for Obamacare for several months, White House spokesman Jay Carney said Friday.
To paraphrase that great political philosopher Syndrome from the movie The Incredibles, it's because when everything is Trump's fault, nothing is. And from his first day on the campaign trail until the anti-Semitic massacre on Saturday, the media appear to have the same news story logged into their computers, one in which the details change, but the ending is always the same: …and that's why it's all Trump's fault.
The first pillar of our framework generously offers a path to citizenship for 1.8 million illegal immigrants who were brought here by their parents at a young age. That covers almost three times more people than the previous administration covered. Under our plan, those who meet education and work requirements, and show good moral character, will be able to become full citizens of the United States over a 12-year period.
I went without health insurance for part of my own childhood while my family was struggling with poverty, and so I understand how important it is, Sinema said. Right now Arizonans are paying, and they're paying too much.
And Americans are more pessimistic about the fight against ISIS than they were before the San Bernardino attacks. While 62 percent of Americans thought the fight against ISIS was going badly after the Paris attacks last month, this percentage has increased to 71 percent now. Just one in four Americans thinks the fight against ISIS is going even somewhat well.
Given that Kavanaugh's jurisdiction entails D.C., he's heard a number of cases related to agencies and administrative law, typically siding against agencies that create significant policy through regulation.
An executive in a PE-held entity like CKE usually must give the owning firm first right of refusal to purchase the person's stake, said Timothy Gregg, a partner with Bradley Arant Boult Cummings, a Birmingham, Alabama-based law firm, who advises privately and publicly held companies. But perhaps Roark does not have enough cash on hand to buy all of Puzder's stake. Then Puzder could approach outside investors. But Roark must approve them – it surely doesn't want a swashbuckler like activist investor Carl Icahn charging through the door.
Mike Bloomberg: I find it incomprehensible that the president would do something as inane as calling it a hoax, which he did [Friday] night in South Carolina.
COOPER: Secretary Clinton, does Mr. Trump have the discipline to be a good leader?
SEN. SANDERS: Well you can stop it by overriding what he is doing and making sure that we fund these programs. Look here is the story. You have a terrible humanitarian crisis. You have women and children traveling a thousand miles or more, often by foot, in order to escape the violence and poverty in their countries. So what we need to do of course is A, comprehensive immigration reform but B, we need to make sure that our borders are secure but also we need a humane policy at the border in which we are not yanking tiny children--
PAUL RYAN: Which didn't work and didn't-- and-- and I can-- look--
CLINTON: Well, first of all, I will not let anyone into our country that I think poses a risk to us. But there are a lot of refugees, women and children — think of that picture we all saw of that 4-year-old boy with the blood on his forehead because he'd been bombed by the Russian and Syrian air forces.
MARGARET BRENNAN: That came as a shock to Republicans who've struggled for years to eliminate Obamacare. We'll talk to Florida's Rick Scott, one senator that President Trump has assigned to come up with a plan to replace it.
Comstock has largely voted in favor of Mr. Trump's policies since he took office, and as the Washington Post points out, her campaign mailers remind voters that she is pro-border wall, pro-life, and pro-2nd Amendment. But Comstock's campaign is not just focused on red-meat issues. Comstock is a leading voice in the charge to reform sexual harassment reporting on Capitol Hill, and she has also bucked the Republican party on some key issues. Comstock voted against a Republican effort to repeal Obamacare because it didn't protect people with preexisting conditions. She also sided with House Democrats and voted against an amendment that would have blocked an Obama-era practice requiring the Pentagon to pay for gender transition surgeries and hormone therapy.
Democrat Congressman Chris Pappas, who flipped New Hampshire's 1st district in 2018, now has a general election opponent. CBS News political unit broadcast associate Aaron Navarro says Republican Matt Mowers, a former Senior Advisor in the State Department, won about 60 percent of the vote in a crowded primary field. In June, Mowers was endorsed by Mr. Trump, who narrowly won this district by about 2 points. Mowers beat Republican Matt Mayberry, who got the second most votes and was endorsed by former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee.
One of the criticisms of the legal approach to dismantling the ACA has been that there's a sense that Republicans have not introduced a viable plan to replace the Obama-era law. Garrett asked Short whether such a plan exists. Short said that Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar could come up with a plan in the coming months, adding, But we also believe that this court decision probably wouldn't reach the courts for another--'til probably summer of 2020.
Let's bring a clean [spending bill] to the floor, pass it with the few weeks that it gives us to come to the table to eliminate the sequester, Pelosi said.
Republicans acknowledge that last summer was not the party's finest hour, as former McConnell adviser Josh Holmes put it.
I should have asked more questions to make sure that everything that transpired was above board, Gillum said, before quickly trying to switch topics. In the state of Florida, we've got a lot of issues. In fact, we've got 99 issues and Hamilton ain't one of them.
MARGARET BRENNAN: --are we going to have a shutdown over Christmas?
Another problematic aspect of Puzder's nomination is the allegation of his first wife, during their divorce proceedings in the 1980s, that he had abused her physically. Back then, she appeared in disguise on The Oprah Winfrey Show to detail the purported assaults.
It was an easy decision, yes. I think easy because once I saw all the facts and some of the tactics used by the FBI in this instance and also the legal problems with the case, it was an easy decision. You know, one thing people will see when they look at the documents is how Director Comey purposely went around the Justice Department and ignored Deputy Attorney General Yates.
Kasich implied that this negative energy -- which has been primarily directed at Donald Trump -- could smear the Bush family name.
Lesley Stahl: Here's what you've said. You've said, If someone's ripping your face off. You rip their face off. (LAUGH)
Democrats are hoping for record-breaking support from Hispanic voters to win back the House and maybe even the Senate.
Senator Elizabeth Warren on Tuesday pressured Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to require that all large and mid-sized businesses getting pandemic aid from a $500 billion Federal Reserve fund keep their workers on payroll. Mnuchin declined to make such a commitment, citing payroll requirements for airline bailouts and the Main Street Lending Program. And the rest was left up to you and what you're saying is that you won't do it…You're boosting your Wall Street buddies and you are leaving the American people behind, Warren said in a Senate Banking Committee hearing, according to CBS News campaign reporter Zak Hudak. Mnuchin, who has the authority under the CARES Act to set the terms of pandemic relief bonds purchased by the Federal Reserve, said he had set the terms based on bipartisan discussions. I think that's a very unfair characterization, he said. And these issues were discussed with both Republicans and Democrats at the time. You were not necessarily part of those discussions but these were completely discussed. The Federal Reserve has set some restrictions on companies from whom it will buy bonds, including that a majority of their employees are in the United States and that they are not already receiving other CARES Act support. Ahead of the hearing, Warren sent a letter to the Federal Reserve in Boston and New York, requesting that executives of companies receiving that aid be subject to criminal and civil penalties, including disgorgement, if they provide fraudulent or misleading information or misuse funds.
ANTHONY SALVANTO: Well, the enthusiasm is up with the Democrats and Republicans are equally up on intention of turning out.
The inspector general's report raised questions about how Price's travel was authorized. For example, investigators found that on five of 12 charter flights, legal approval came only during or after the trip.
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-New York, Mulvaney said, is in a position to force this on the American people.

Sanders' campaign released the details of the plan just three hours before the next Democratic debate, where he and Clinton are expected to clash on several policy issues.
Gorsuch has spent much of his time since his nomination meeting the senators who will be voting on his confirmation -- he's met 72. Twenty senators sit on the Judiciary Committee, and will be questioning him.
Although President Trump has railed against Obamacare for years and has frequently called for its repeal and replacement, he and other Republicans have insisted that they support protecting coverage for pre-existing conditions. If Obamacare were to be invalidated, insurers would not be required to cover pre-existing conditions.
This poll was conducted by telephone January 13-16, 2018 among a random sample of 1,225 adults nationwide. Data collection was conducted on behalf of CBS News by SSRS of Glen Mills, PA. Phone numbers were dialed from samples of both standard land-line and cell phones.
The government last shut down in October 2013 for 16 days after Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, led an unsuccessful effort to defund Obamacare. Republicans went on to retake control of the Senate in the 2014 midterm elections. It's unclear how a government shutdown would affect either party in this year's midterm elections in November.
Parents are not going to send their 14-year-old daughters into the shower or bathroom with 14-year-old boys. It's not going to happen, said Patrick, who added that Mr. Obama is probably paying back the lesbian, gay and transgender community that helped him defeat Hillary Clinton in 2008 or he believes in this policy.
The GOP's failed attempt to repeal Obamacare in 2017 had a galvanizing effect among Democrats. CBS News exit polling from the 2018 midterms found health care to be the top issue for voters in an election where Democrats picked up 40 House seats. And 54 percent of midterm voters disapproved of the president.
Meanwhile, the Democratic House Campaign arm has made it clear that in the 167 days until Election Day, they will be focused on health care. In a joint memo with virtually all campaign arms up and down the ballot, Democrats say they'll continue to bring up the ongoing legal efforts to eliminate Obamacare and the votes of Congressional Republicans to repeal the Affordable Care Act. It is the worst possible time to try to dismantle our health care system. But Republicans at every level of the ballot are fighting in court to take away people's health care – or blocking millions of working families from life-saving Medicaid coverage, a joint statement by the committee chairs reads.
Trump has repeatedly defended his long-shuttered real estate education program, even publicly deriding the judge overseeing the litigation. But in court records released to The Washington Post, Trump University officials reportedly used aggressive tactics to recruit students and get them to spend more on courses, some of which cost more than $30,000.
It is putting a Band-Aid on a huge problem that we have, Donnelly explained. We are grateful that those funds are there, but if this trade war or tariff war had never started, we wouldn't be in this position.
When Roberts asked how people can find insurance before any mitigation efforts are put in place, before they get sick, Pence struggled to answer. Pence pointed out that the administration has extended waivers to states to expand coverage for coronavirus testing and treatment, and extended waivers for Medicare, and said Medicaid can serve lower-income populations.
Those people would leave his office, as people so often do after having been with Donald Trump, feeling that life could be great again, she continued.
LANHEE CHEN: Well, you know, the President puts people around him who he's comfortable with, who he believes will be loyal to him. The President has that prerogative, by the way, you know, it's not clear to me that this is going to be the permanent appointment. I would say that there are a number of people who probably would be a better permanent appointment than-- than Rick Grenell. But, look, he has national security experience, it's not like he doesn't have any at all. You're right, he doesn't any intelligence community experience. So I think at this point in time, the President might be better served with someone who has that experience. But to me, this is a reflection of how the President has staffed his administration all along.
The 5th Circuit's decision poses a severe, immediate and ongoing threat to the orderly operation of healthcare markets throughout the country, casts doubt over whether millions of individuals will continue to be able to afford vitally important care, and leaves a critical sector of the nation's economy in unacceptable limbo, lawyers for the House wrote in their request to the Supreme Court.
Clinton's website states that as president, she will:
Goe is an adamant Bevin supporter, in part due to the state's strong economy and shrinking unemployment rate. But like many voters in Kentucky, he also likes Bevin's conservative stances on guns and abortion.
Lesley Stahl: And if they vote against you, if they don't toe the line, that they run out the back--
If not, we will be reluctantly forced to find, with all of the jobs and economic development it brings, another Republican National Convention site… In a press conference on Tuesday, Cooper said he's really not surprised at anything that happens on Twitter and added that while its OK for political conventions to be political, the pandemic response cannot be. We're continuing our discussions with the RNC and [are] going to continue to put health and safety at the forefront, said Cooper, who added that his team has asked the RNC to present a plan laying out various options. …We have to have options regarding how this convention is going to be run depending on where we are with the virus in August…I hope that we can find some kind of reasonable accommodations but we're not going to sacrifice the health and safety of North Carolinian and that's the bottom line. CBS News has previously spoken to party officials as they wrestle with the economic and image implications of hosting traditional gatherings, as well as local business owners and leaders on their take of hosting conventions amid the pandemic. Democratic party officials have also told CBS News that they've been forced to dramatically re-think their convention which has already been pushed back to August.
GOVERNOR NED LAMONT: Well, first of all, we have about ninety-five percent of our kids have the opportunity to go to school, to go to the classroom either full time or hybrid. Almost all of them are full time. Our teachers have been extraordinary heroes showing up, being at school, giving these kids an opportunity. I can't afford a lost year. So, yes, teachers are going to be in an early group when it comes to people getting vaccinated. And right now, they are a priority group in terms of testing. We're doing testing at the schools or nearby --
He's broken with his party on key issues Ohio Gov. John Kasich speaks at the First in the Nation Republican Leadership Summit April 18, 2015 in Nashua, New Hampshire. Darren McCollester, Getty Images Although many Republican governors refused to expand Medicaid in their states, lest it be seen as supporting Obamacare, Kasich took the opposite tack. He expanded the low-income health care program, which required him to bypass the Republican-led legislature in Ohio. But Kasich has defended the move. When a donor questioned the decision at a retreat sponsored by billionaire conservatives Charles and David Koch, Kasich angrily responded, The governor's response was fiery. I don't know about you, lady, he said as he pointed at the donor, according to Politico. But when I get to the pearly gates, I'm going to have an answer for what I've done for the poor. He's also refused to abandon his support for Common Core educational standards, and has gone so far as to suggest his fellow Republicans' opposition is motivated by potential political gain rather than facts. He's kind of a maverick - not in the [Arizona Sen.] John McCain sense, perhaps, but he is somebody who really operates on what I would call conservative principles, but defines conservative principles sometimes differently than other conservatives do, Beck said.
10:42 p.m. ET Indiana Gov. Mike Pence officially accepts the GOP nomination for vice president of the United States.
Speaker Nancy Pelosi: Nothing died. Nothing's died. We already put together 100 days, the fact that we even passed them in the House is a victory. Let's figure out the places-- figure out where we can find common ground. There's always been bipartisan support for Dreamers, bipartisan support for gun safety, bipartisan support for infrastructure.
Tuesday, June 12 will be primary day in five states: Maine, Nevada, North Dakota, South Carolina and Virginia. There is not really a marquee primary race on Tuesday that should dramatically affect the outcome of the midterms, but many of these seats will be critical in the fight for control of the House and Senate in November's general election.
SUSAN PAGE: --election that we can trust. And they are succeeding on that front.
After the deaths of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery and Rayshard Brooks, a drumbeat of protesters has been demanding to defund the police. In Minneapolis, the city council voted to disband the police force and replace it with a community-led system. But in general, the term does not mean that police should be given zero funding or that police departments should be abolished, but rather that some portion of their funding should be diverted to community programs.
In other cases, it's less well understood that failure is the reason for the government to regulate a market, or even provide the goods and services itself. Social security and health care come to mind. But once again, the private sector's failure to deliver these goods at the lowest possible price, or to deliver them at all, is at the heart of the government's involvement in these markets.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Who informed you of that? Was it Facebook or have U.S. intelligence officials told you about some kind of meddling with the campaign?
Shortly after Cruz graduated college, she worked in New York with J.P. Morgan's emerging markets division -- an area which, according to a Washington Post profile, piqued her interest because she had spent summers in Africa doing missionary work with her Seventh Day Adventist parents when she was younger. Cruz also learned to speak Spanish while at the banking firm, where she worked on Latin American markets.
The White House said that Health and Human Services is using its enforcement discretion to enact the change -- similar to the way Mr. Obama exercised his executive authority to defer deportations of young undocumented immigrants.
Since we passed tax cuts, roughly 3 million workers have already gotten tax cut bonuses – many of them thousands of dollars per worker.
Trump Victory Spokesperson Samantha Zager said the GOP's path to winning back the House runs through California. Zager added that despite the best attempts of Gov. Gavin Newsom and California Democrats to rig the election in favor of their failed candidate, Californians rejected their tired socialist policies in favor of Mike Garcia. Eight House seats, including the one California's 25th congressional district will be up for re-election this November.
Working with the Senate, we are appointing judges who will interpret the Constitution as written, including a great new Supreme Court justice, and more circuit court judges than any new administration in the history of our country.

Amy Klobuchar Klobuchar announces 2020 presidential bid 25:20 Biography Amy Klobuchar was born in Plymouth, Minnesota, in 1960. Klobuchar has written about her troubled family life as a child in her book, The Senator Next Door: A Memoir from the Heartland. Her father, Jim, was an alcoholic who frequently spent time away from family and was arrested for drunk driving. He and Klobuchar's mother, Rose, divorced when Klobuchar was 15. The divorce took a toll on her family, causing her younger sister, Beth, to drop out of high school. Although Klobuchar's parents reconciled a few years later, she has written that her relationship with her father was not repaired until he quit drinking in the 1990s. Klobuchar attended Yale University and University of Chicago Law School. She returned to Minnesota after graduating and worked for a private law firm. Her experience of being forced to return to work one day after giving birth inspired her to become politically active and advocate for a maternity leave bill in the state legislature. Klobuchar was elected Hennepin County attorney in 1998. She was first elected to the Senate in 2006, and won re-election in 2012 and 2018. Klobuchar and her husband, John Bessler, have one daughter. Bessler is a private practice attorney and a professor at the University of Baltimore School of Law. The three-term Minnesota senator launched her presidential campaign on Feb. 10 under frigid temperatures and relentless snowfall in Minneapolis.
MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll talk with Senator Bernie Sanders about his campaign. Plus, allegations from a former Nevada lawmaker that former Vice President Joe Biden touched and kissed her without consent.
In an interview on Good Morning America on Tuesday, Biden acknowledged he was aware that they asked for an investigation into Flynn while he was vice president, but said renewed discussion over the matter is all about diverting attention from the Trump administration's handling of the coronavirus pandemic.

I've heard them where Hillary is constantly talking about the inner cities of our country, which are a disaster education-wise, jobwise, safety-wise, in every way possible. I'm going to help the African-Americans. I'm going to help the Latinos, Hispanics. I am going to help the inner cities.
Lesley Stahl: You ready? Everybody ready? So we have the pandemic. On your watch, we've had racial strife, we've had looting. Why do you want this job? Why do you wanna be president again?
Prenatal tests are a standard part of modern medical care. The Department of Health and Human Services says such tests help keep you and your baby healthy during pregnancy. It also involves education and counseling about how to handle different aspects of your pregnancy.
Trump had a choice today: to seek disruptive fundamental reform or to embrace more incremental steps, wrote Terry Haines, a financial analyst, in an investment note. Trump chose the incremental over the disruptive.
MARGARET BRENNAN: All right. Doctor Gottlieb, thank you for your analysis.
Are we going to send our American forces all over the world to make sure that stops?
Ivanka Trump is the fourth of Trump's five children to speak on his behalf this week, and her speech Thursday night is perhaps the best evidence that Trump's family members are the ones who are best at revealing a different side of the GOP businessman. (Barron, his youngest son and the only of his children not to speak at the convention, is only 10.) She and her husband, Jared Kushner, are among Trump's most trusted advisers.
Shares of health insurers and hospitals slumped after a federal judge in Texas ruled that the 2010 Affordable Care Act is unconstitutional. Hospital operator HCA dropped 2.5, while health insurer UnitedHealth lost 1.9 percent. Centene, a health insurer that focuses on Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act's individual health insurance exchanges, also lost ground.
His superheroes had super powers, but also flaws, arguing amongst themselves and dealing with hang-ups – all key ingredients that went into his most famous character of all: Spider-man. His characters could also offer social commentary, refusing to shy away from the issues of the day, like war, race relations and drug abuse. Lee's genius for vivid characters and stories left a mark on the popular imagination of generations of comic book fans, which translated to theatergoers when Marvel movies (in which he habitually appeared in cameos, with a nod and a wink) became box office powerhouses. In a 2006 Associated Press interview Lee said of his comic book stories, I think everybody loves things that are bigger than life. ... I think of them as fairy tales for grown-ups.

Jay Inslee Jay Inslee announces 2020 presidential bid 00:36 The governor of Washington served two stints in Congress, a single term in the 1990s and then six Born and raised in Seattle, Inslee received a bachelor's degree in economics from the University of Washington in 1973 and a J.D. from Willamette University College of Law in Oregon three years later. After working in private law for more than a decade, he successfully ran for a seat in the Washington House of Representatives, where he served for four years until his successful bid for Congress in 1992. Inslee represented the state's 4th Congressional district for one term until his reelection bid was thwarted during the so-called Republican Revolution of 1994. During the following years, he unsuccessfully ran for governor and served as a regional Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) director under President Clinton. Inslee ran for Congress again in 1998 and defeated a Republican incumbent in Washington's 1st Congressional district, which he went on to represent for nearly 12 years. During his congressional tenure, the Washington lawmaker was a vocal critic of the war in Iraq and an early proponent of federal initiatives to reduce greenhouse gases and the American economy's reliance on fossil fuels. Inslee left Congress in 2012 to launch his ultimately successful bid to be governor in Washington, defeating the state's Republican attorney general in the general election.
I'm not a liberal, I assure you. I am a conservative who understands prevention saves us a lot more money in the long run.
The annual CBO update of the government's economic and fiscal health estimates a $1 trillion deficit for the ongoing fiscal year, which would bring the red ink above $1 trillion for the first time since 2012, when former President Barack Obama capped four consecutive years of $1 trillion-plus budget deficits.
Kerri Evelyn Harris, Movement Director for the group, tells CBS News campaign reporter LaCrai Mitchell that the team strategically chose South Carolina to focus on voters of color in large part because it's one of the states that will choose the Democratic nominee. When asked, Harris added that although former Vice President Joe Biden has remained popular in the state throughout this primary cycle—and is not a proponent of Medicare for All—she thinks this message will still resonate with South Carolina voters.
STEPHEN MILLER: The only way to--
The president announced he asked a small group of Republican senators to take a look, form a really great plan, including Florida Republican Sen. Rick Scott.
But I notice, anytime anything wrong happens, they like to say the Russians are — she doesn't know if it's the Russians doing the hacking. Maybe there is no hacking. But they always blame Russia. And the reason they blame Russia because they think they're trying to tarnish me with Russia. I know nothing about Russia. I know — I know about Russia, but I know nothing about the inner workings of Russia. I don't deal there. I have no businesses there. I have no loans from Russia.
John Delaney Rep. John Delaney, D-Maryland AP The little-known former congressman from Maryland was the first to announce his candidacy for president, declaring in July 2017. Delaney, 55, was raised in New Jersey and attended Columbia University and Georgetown University Law Center. Delaney co-founded two profitable companies, both of which are publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange. He was elected to Congress in 2012, and served three terms in the House of Representatives.
We had prepared to talk about the many issues and questions facing the president, but in what has become an all-too-public dust-up, the conversation was cut short. It began politely, but ended regrettably, contentiously.

They have more than a rollout problem, Manchin said on MSNBC Thursday morning. There is a product problem. We have to make sure the products are there. And the market will determine that product.
In his first address to a joint session of Congress, President Trump called for a $1 trillion investment in the United States' crumbling infrastructure.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Obamacare coverage will continue during the appeals process but millions of Americans could be left without health insurance.
But Barrasso has his toughest opponent in a Republican primary in a long time. Businessman Dave Dodson, who does not have much in common with President Trump, has attacked Barrasso for his ties to corporations and Washington, D.C. In an interview with the AP, Dodson said he never thought he'd be involved in politics, but he is mad with its current state. Barrasso also has refused to debate Dodson.
Hillary Clinton served as secretary of State until 2013.
CBS News campaign reporter Nicole Sganga says Perez also touted the party's digital operations, adding that the DNC is in the process of hiring more personnel. And needless to say, the lion's share of the people that we're hiring, in our battleground build up, are going to be people who are very fluent in digital organizing, he told reporters. Perez added that the party has trained over 900 digital organizers in remote sessions last week, and plans to conduct more trainings in the days to come.
We believe that it's absolutely imperative that individuals that have health coverage be able to keep health coverage and move, hopefully, to greater choices and opportunities for them to gain the kind of coverage that they want for themselves and for their families, he said.
ROBERT O'BRIEN: Well, there's no briefing that I have received, that the President has received, that says that President Putin is doing anything to try and influence the elections in favor of President Trump. We just haven't seen that intelligence. If it's out there, I haven't seen it. I'd be surprised if I haven't seen it. The leaders of our-- the IC have not seen it. So I-- again, I don't know where this is coming from. I've heard these rumors and these leaks from Adam Schiff's committee, but I-- I have not seen them myself and I've seen no intelligence along those lines.
The Black Lives Matter movement also still had a 49% favorable rating, compared to a 37% unfavorable view, the same numbers as August. There was a slight increase in approval over President Trump's handling of protests (36%) compared to early August (32%). A majority of voters (54%) still disapproved of his handling.
9:04 p.m. The president's Cabinet is entering the House of Representatives along with Supreme Court justices. Agriculture Secretary Perdue is absent -- he is the designated survivor.
You know, I can't believe this is a competitive race. It's like embarrassing. I'm talking Mississippi. I'm talking Mississippi. I can't believe it. I don't think that [Hood] should be the right guy. I think the guy you want is Tate Reeves.

President Trump has spoken with candidates to replace retiring Justice Anthony Kennedy, and whoever he ultimately chooses Monday night, it will be a relatively young and conservative nominee.
Donald Trump: Well, I'll be honest with you, I probably do because look at the job they've done. OK, look at the job they've done. They haven't done the job. Now, maybe it's leadership, maybe it's something else. Who knows? All I can tell you is we're going to get rid of ISIS.
The House of Representatives delivered the articles of impeachment to the Senate on Wednesday afternoon. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, in remarks on the Senate floor, invited the House managers to the Senate at noon on Thursday to exhibit the articles.
MARGARET BRENNAN: You're watching all of this.
He suggested cost-control measures could be implemented. One of the things I would tell you is the Republican bill has zero cost-control measures in it. They're not going to address affordability. I totally agree with you, affordability is one of the things people care about. And quality — they want to make sure they get good quality. My book is about how can we improve the quality of the system and lower the cost.
Kavanaugh was finally confirmed in 2006 and has since made his name as a reliably conservative judge, although he does have his detractors on the right who have questioned his rulings involving contraception and Obamacare. But he has a resume and background that would make it hard for anyone to argue that he is unqualified for the Supreme Court.
U.S. Rep. Nancy Pelosi, who will become the Speaker of the House in January, said the ruling exposes the monstrous endgame of Republicans' all-out assault on people with pre-existing conditions and Americans' access to affordable health care.
Morgan emphasized the group is also keeping a close eye on stay-at-home orders and will not be going door-to-door until it gets the local go-ahead.
And while Vice President Kamala Harris holds the deciding vote in the event of a Senate tie, the 50-50 split between Democrats and Republicans doesn't constitute filibuster-proof power.
We saw the volunteers of the Cajun Navy, racing to the rescue with their fishing boats to save people in the aftermath of a totally devastating hurricane.
Ricky Jay Charles Sykes/Invision/AP Introduced to magic by his grandfather, Ricky Jay (June 26, 1946-November 24, 2018), a true master of the craft, became both a student and guru of prestidigitation and memory tricks. Performing magic on TV as early as age 7, he would eventually open for rock bands in New York, and became a familiar presence on late night TV, when jaws would drop and minds would reel from his performances. His deftness with cards would earn him the honor, in the eyes of The New Yorker magazine, of the most gifted sleight-of-hand artist alive. Praised for his closeup magic that flouts reality, Jay told expansive, entertaining stories while dealing cards, plucking the one card out of 52 that you just knew couldn't have possibly been plucked. How'd he do it? Magic! He collected and researched the history and lore of magicians and illusionists, and was author of such books as Cards as Weapons, Learned Pigs & Fireproof Women and Celebrations of Curious Characters. His expertise at illusions was also enlisted for the production of movies like The Escape Artist, The Prestige and Forrest Gump. He also acted in films and TV shows, including Boogie Nights, The Spanish Prisoner, House of Games, Deadwood (as card sharp Eddie Sawyer), and the James Bond film Tomorrow Never Dies, as a terrorist. Magic, Jay told The New Yorker, gives me more pleasure and more pain than anything else I've ever dealt with.

Joe Biden and Democrats are leaning in on health care messaging with less than 50 days to go until the election, reports CBS News associate producer Sarah Ewall-Wice.
America has also finally turned the page on decades of unfair trade deals that sacrificed our prosperity and shipped away our companies, our jobs and our nation's wealth.
Santorum's high-profile role on such issues ensures that questions about his social positions will follow him across the country and through a general election campaign, should he win the nomination. Despite the firestorm they ignite at times - and the fact that it can produce lower poll numbers among women voters - the former Pennsylvania senator said he doesn't intend to let up.
One of the things you realize when you have someone in your family -- for me, my dad is 91, thankfully it didn't hit him till later -- but you see them growing more and more distant, not in the heart but in the mind, and you realize sometimes they may not even quite know who you are, and that's a hard moment when that happens, Klobuchar said.
Notable political figures have reacted to the death of George Floyd, a black man who was killed Monday afternoon by a Minneapolis police officer who pressed his knee on Floyd's neck, reports CBS News political unit broadcast associate Aaron Navarro. My stomach hurts. My neck hurts. Everything hurts. … (I need) water or something. Please. Please. I can't breathe, officer. … I cannot breathe. I cannot breathe, Floyd is heard saying in the video, a scene that echoes the police killing of Eric Garner in 2012 and is reminiscent of memories from the police shooting death of Philando Castile in 2016, which took place in nearby Falcon Heights, Minnesota. Police say that Floyd was not armed, and was involved in a forgery in progress. Congresswoman Ilhan Omar, who represents Minneapolis, tweeted, We can't excuse summary executions in America. We just can't! Minnesota Governor Tim Walz said, The lack of humanity in this disturbing video is sickening. We will get answers and seek justice. Minneapolis Police Chief Medaria Arradondo Tuesday said at a press conference that the FBI will lead the investigation into the incident due to the possible civil rights violation. Arradondo and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey also announced that the four officers involved have been terminated following Floyd's death. In a statement, Minnesota's Senator Amy Klobuchar said Floyd's death was yet another horrifying and gutwrenching instance of an African American man dying and called for a complete and thorough investigation.
TRUMP STATEMENT: When there's a problem, you have to state what the problem is or at least say the name. She won't say the name and President Obama won't say the name.
But the rapid rate of generic drug and medical device approvals is not new and has on the rise for a couple of years, going back to at least 2015, during the Obama administration. -- Allyson Ross Taylor
White House officials claim that the situation has unraveled to a point where the two sides are now spilling or leaking unfavorable stories about each other to news outlets.
So, tonight, I am extending an open hand to work with members of both parties, Democrats and Republicans, to protect our citizens of every background, color, religion, and creed. My duty, and the sacred duty of every elected official in this chamber, is to defend Americans, to protect their safety, their families, their communities, and their right to the American Dream. Because Americans are dreamers too.
CLINTON: He never apologized to Mr. and Mrs. Khan, the Gold Star family whose son, Captain Khan, died in the line of duty in Iraq. And Donald insulted and attacked them for weeks over their religion.
The strange thing about the economics profession over the last 35 year is that there has been two strands: One very strongly focusing on the limitations of the market, and then another saying how wonderful markets were. Unfortunately too much attention was being paid to that second strand.
As President Trump and Congress get ready to tackle a series of major fiscal issues facing the country, will the tumultuous political climate in Washington hurt any attempts at fiscal reform? The head of a group fighting for improved fiscal policy thinks so.
Republican lawmakers in Pennsylvania and North Carolina have each asked the justices to move up the deadlines for mail-in ballots in the two battleground states, yet the Supreme Court has not yet acted on the requests.
Despite being the right-hand man to current Governor Phil Bryant, who is very popular in the state, Reeves struggled to win the Republican nomination. He was unable to win the GOP nod outright in May, and only secured the nomination after a run-off in August.
Donald Trump: This was just going to be a quick little chat and it lasted close to an hour and a half. And it could have gone on for four hours. I mean it was-- just-- in fact, it was almost hard breaking it up because we had so many things to say. And he told me-- the good things and the bad things, there are things that are tough right now--
After 226 years, he said, with Clinton standing by his side, It is time for a woman president of the United States!
McCain's Senate speech: We're getting nothing done my friends. We're getting nothing done because we keep trying to find a way to win without help from across the aisle.
Dozens of people have been killed and others are still missing after a large earthquake that jolted people out of bed in the middle of the night in central Italy. The mayor of one of the hardest-hit towns in the Umbrian mountains says there is virtually nothing left standing.
John McCain: I was driving up here, and I got about two-thirds of the way up. And my doctor called and said, You've got to come back. And I said, Hey, today's Friday. I'll just come in on Monday. And she said, No, you have to come now. It's very serious.
RADDATZ: We have — we have one more question, Mrs. Clinton.
Mick Mulvaney, the former tea party congressman who runs the White House budget office, said Sunday that Trump's new budget, if implemented, would tame the deficit over time.
Kavanaugh has a track record of siding with religious organizations over governments and other groups that challenge them, a particularly attractive trait to conservatives. In Priests for Life v. HHS, Kavanaugh declared the Obamacare contraceptive mandate violated constitutional rights to religious liberty.
The New York Board of Elections originally voted to remove candidates who have suspended their campaigns from the primary ballot under an obscure provision entered into the state budget signed by Governor Andrew Cuomo in April. That decision said Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee, would receive all the 274 pledged delegates. That is no longer the case.
4:20 p.m. ET Accusations of plagiarism in Melania Trump's GOP convention speech may be dominating the headlines Tuesday, but she's far from the first political figure to lift lines from someone else's work. Your CBS Politics team has put together a quick guide to some of the other famous cases of plagiarism in American politics.
At his weekly press conference, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer slammed Barrett's past comments on the Affordable Care Act, saying that if Barrett is confirmed, it will be virtually impossible to get insurance.
One of them, a lifelong Republican who by his own admission would be a Ted Cruz or Marco Rubio man explained his support for Trump over the rest of the GOP field by listing a litany of letdowns from the Republican party (immigration, foreign interventions) and instances of gross incompetence by the government in general—they can't pay the bills, can't balance the budget, can't fix Obamacare, and so on.
As for the idea that our democratic institutions are in disarray, that's demonstrably nonsense. Starting with the Supreme Court.
Stephen Miller, White House senior adviser
I would not have any coverage at all, Bagley told CBS News. I would be hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt.
Those ideas avoid a direct confrontation with the powerful pharmaceutical lobby, but they may also underwhelm Americans seeking relief from escalating prescription costs.
While Mr. Trump said in a tweet Monday that he would like to keep the convention in North Carolina — and has zero interest in moving the convention to Doral, Florida, the home of Mar-a-Lago, in particular — Florida Governor Ron DeSantis said during a press conference Tuesday that he welcomes the idea of hosting the convention in the Sunshine State. Florida would love to have the RNC. Heck, I'm a Republican, it'd be good for us to have the DNC in terms of the economic impact when you talk about major events like that, said DeSantis during a press conference in Miami earlier. DeSantis went on to name Miami, Orlando, Tampa and Jacksonville as some of the cities with the capacity to host the gathering. I have not spoken with the president specifically on that but I have, we've let the folks at the White House know that we want to work with them…so he knows that and I know the key people in his administration and in his campaign know that.
10:27 p.m. ET Donald Trump, Jr. said that his father can take on the impossible.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Mister Mayor, thank you for your time this morning.
So how will Democratic senators fare in states where Mr. Trump won and remains more popular than the national average? Will they hold their punches against the president, or stand up to him when they disagree? The AP points out that in North Dakota, Heitkamp has chosen a mix of both as she seeks to relay to North Dakotans that she is fighting for their best interests. She has championed Mr. Trump's de-regulation policies that benefit North Dakota's farmers and mining industry and has voted to confirm the majority of his Cabinet and judicial nominees. But at the same time, she has criticized Mr. Trump for his trade policies that could hurt North Dakota's farmers and ranchers. Will Heitkamp's efforts be enough to win re-election, or will these red state voters reject any Democrat that Trump opposes?
We repealed the core of the disastrous Obamacare. The individual mandate is now gone. Thank heaven.
SEN. KLOBUCHAR: You always have to talk to everyone when it is American security and the world's security at stake. But he keeps having these summits and meetings that really don't produce anything. There's been a number of them now, and this time, you know, you just can't look at this as going over and talking to your dictator next door and bringing them a hot dish over the fence. There is a lot more. And what this is about, is making sure that there are measurable results, that we have a plan when we go in there and we just haven't seen that. In fact, just in May you saw North Korea launch another missile into the sea in violation of the U.N. resolution and to me, you need to have a plan to denuclearize that peninsula or at least reduce those weapons immediately, and I just don't see that happening, yes.
During the annual National Day of Prayer commemoration at the White House on Thursday, President Trump signed the latest executive order of his presidency, to establish a faith-based office, the White House Faith and Opportunity Initiative. He said it would focus on protecting religious freedom and ensuring that the faith-based and community organizations that form the bedrock of our society have strong advocates in the White House and throughout the federal government.
The deficit tab for the package grew as well — almost $400 billion over 10 years to repeal the three so-called Obamacare taxes alone — with a companion package to extend several business-friendly tax breaks still under negotiation. The Obama-era taxes have previously been suspended on a piecemeal basis.
The Trump presidency isn't some strange, extra-democratic phenomenon. It's precisely what happens when the American people give a guy like Donald Trump and his political party in Congress the power to govern. It's no more perilous than when they did the same with Barack Obama and the Democrats a decade ago, or Bill Clinton and his party in 1992.
The argument provided a light moment of the day when Justice Stephen Breyer got cut off when someone tried calling him. Breyer said after he rejoined the court's arguments: The telephone started to ring, and it cut me off the call, and I don't think it was a robocall.
SEN. SANDERS: So where we are right now- I'm sorry go ahead.
Fed set to hike interest rates?
We lost the trust of the American people when some Republicans gave into the temptations of corruption, McCain said when accepting his party's nomination at that year's convention. He said his party had lost its way and was part of the country's problem. We came to power to change Washington and Washington changed us, he told Face the Nation in September 2008.
Meanwhile, Ryan's plans to cut benefit programs faced the acid test last year as well, during last year's health care debacle. He succeeded in passing a repeal of Obama's health care law through the House last year that would have capped the Medicaid health program for the poor and disabled, cutting more than $800 billion from the program over 10 years. Ryan called it the most fundamental entitlement reform in a generation.
CLINTON: Well, right. As I recall, that was something I said about Abraham Lincoln after having seen the wonderful Steven Spielberg movie called Lincoln. It was a master class watching President Lincoln get the Congress to approve the 13th Amendment. It was principled, and it was strategic.
JOHN DICKERSON: Okay. Now, let's go to the-- to the-- the groups within these-- the polling. What are we-- what are you learning and seeing in-- about women and-- and men and the so-called gender gap?
It's this simple: Data determines dates. When we see our benchmarks on key factors, like testing or hospitalizations, we can begin considering a specific timetable, New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy Tweeted Friday.
Health care stocks are leading major U.S. indexes lower in early trading on Wall Street after a federal judge ruled that the 2010 Affordable Care Act is unconstitutional.
Even though he's not running in South Carolina, he should also come here and talk to South Carolinians, find out what our issues are, what we're concerned about, said Donna Brown Newton, a Charleston County school district employee and chair of the East Cooper Democratic Party.
PAUL RYAN: That bill- Well, what- what Leader McConnell is going to be offering is one that has a different date on it. We passed a bill keeping things funded to February 16th. He is going to bring up a bill keeping things funded to February 8th. We have agreed that we would accept that in the House. And so we will see sometime today whether or not they have the votes for that. And that's really where we are right now.
On this issue, Clinton has the advantage.
Patrick took a pass, saying he was humbled by encouragement from across the country to seek the presidency, but he knew that the cruelty of our elections process would ultimately splash back on people whom Diane and I love, but who hadn't signed up for the journey.
My parents impressed on me the value of that you work hard for what you want in life, Trump said at the Republican convention Monday night. That your word is your bond and you do what you say and keep your promise. That you treat people with respect. Show the values and morals in in the daily life. That is the lesson that we continue to pass on to our son.
President Donald Trump's second weekend in office saw huge nationwide protests over his order that all travelers from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen be denied entry to the U.S. for 90 days. What started out Saturday as a spontaneous demonstration at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York quickly spread to airports from coast to coast.
MARGARET BRENNAN: We're going to have to leave it here for now, but pick it up with Caitlin after this commercial break. So, stay with us. We'll have more 2020 insights.
Together, we are rediscovering the American way. In America, we know that faith and family, not government and bureaucracy, are the center of American life. The motto is, In God We Trust.
It's unclear how long Mr. Trump will take to select a new permanent attorney general. Counselor to the president Kellyanne Conway told reporters Wednesday she's not aware of the timeline.
Trump has gone on record as advising Americans to avoid stocks when investing their 401(k) accounts. Having a presidential candidate make a public statement advising against participating in our nation's primary investing and capital financing system is unprecedented in political history, and it may not bode well for stock markets if he's elected.
With the state's political leanings becoming more conservative, some voters may see McCaskill as out of step with Missouri now. Fifty-five percent of Missouri voters say she is about liberal as most congressional Democrats. Just a quarter see her as more moderate. McCaskill's re-election prospects hang in part on her ability to on to these moderate and independent voters that helped boost her in the past.
McCain admitted she is a strange person among Republicans, though she still votes locally for Republicans. But she said she is very curious to see if former Vice President Joe Biden, a close friend of her father's, decides to run for president. I love him on a personal level, she said.
Republican legislative leaders in Michigan announced a lawsuit challenging Democratic Governor Gretchen Whitmer's emergency powers after she extended Michigan's state of emergency through May 28th last week, according to CBS News campaign reporters Jack Turman and Adam Brewster.
Donald Trump: Well, I can't tell you that, but I have made--
The Biden campaign also continued its battleground state rollout Thursday, announcing new leadership in North Carolina and Nevada. CBS News campaign reporter LaCrai Mitchell reports that L.T. McCrimmon, a staffer from Governor Roy Cooper's office, will serve as the state director and the former North Carolina state director for Elizabeth Warren presidential campaign, Maggie Thompson, will take on the roles of State Advisor and Chief of Staff. Scott Falmlen, a partner at Nexus Strategies political consulting firm in North Carolina, will also serve as a strategic adviser.
ANTHONY SALVANTO (CBS News Director of Elections and Surveys/@SalvantoCBS/Where Did You Get This Number): Well, at the moment, we've got the House with the Democrats getting over the two hundred and eighteen seats that they would need to take it if the election were today. Right now we've got them at two hundred and twenty-six seats in our model. That number has been creeping up slowly over the course of the summer as long as we've been doing these Battleground Trackers, but it is still very heavily dependent on at least two things for the Democrats. And I just-- I can't emphasize this enough. It's dependent on turnout among people who don't typically vote in midterms and it's dependent on a few meaningful crossover voters coming from having voted for Donald Trump to voting Democrat now.
Donald Trump:–we are trying to clean up Washington. Look--
SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: Well, you just--
JOHN DICKERSON: What does that mean then, Susan Glasser, for the foreign policy? Does this tell us anything about the current makeup of the foreign policy team and then what does it mean going forward?
Lesley Stahl: Are you going to ask for a special prosecutor to investigate Hillary Clinton over her emails? And are you, as you had said to her face, going to try and put her in jail?
While we waited to see if the president was coming back, his press secretary, Kayleigh McEnany, came in with a hand delivery.
Last, let the other party go on and on with its constant dividing up of people ... always playing one group against the other, as if group identity were everything, he said. In America, aren't we all supposed to see beyond class, or ethnicity, or all those other lines drawn to set us apart and lock us in groups?
Ray Emory Marco Garcia/AP Ray Emory (c. 1921-May 13, 2018) lived through the early morning Japanese aerial bombing at Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, firing rounds at attacking airplanes, but he never forgot those who didn't survive. He spent the past few decades doggedly pushing to identify unknown remains and have them returned to their families. In 2003, the military agreed to dig up a casket that Emory (who'd meticulously studied records) was convinced included the remains of multiple servicemen who'd died on the USS Oklahoma. Emory was right, and five sailors were identified. It helped lay the foundation for the Pentagon's decision more than a decade later to exhume and attempt to identify all 388 sailors and Marines from the ship, who had been buried as unknowns in a national cemetery in Honolulu. Since those exhumations, 138 sailors have been identified, though DNA testing and other methods. About 77 have been reburied, many in their hometowns, bringing closure to families across the country. These guys got killed in battle for their country and they should be so recognized, period, Emory told Luke Burbank for NPR's Morning Edition in 2005. Emory, who recently moved to Boise, Idaho, to live with his son, visited Pearl Harbor one last time in June (pictured), where more than 500 sailors stood side-by-side on ships and piers to surprise him, greeting him with salutes and cheers.
Thus far, Mr. Trump has failed to comprehensively repeal Obama's signature health care law, a reality he oftentimes still blames on the late Sen. John McCain. The Affordable Care Act is still the law of the land.
In 2019, GM closed its transmission plant in Warren. He now hopes we don't notice what he said or won't remember, Biden said. He's hoping we just have poor memories. He doesn't give us much credit. But the American people are smart, honest, decent and they're hard working.
I never use the word 'lie.' I can't get into a politician's head, Kessler said.
Lesley Stahl: Well, I guess the issue for them is marriage equality. Do you support marriage equality?
Biden's favorability (45%) was a slight increase from August (43%). 47% of Wisconsinites had an unfavorable opinion of Biden. Finally, the poll showed 68% of Biden voters are still planning to vote absentee by mail, while 58% of Trump supporters are planning to vote in-person on Election Day.
The Emergency Management Act of 1976 does note an extension to a state of emergency requires legislative approval. Because the legislature did not extend the state of emergency at the end of April, Republican legislators argue that Whitmer does not have emergency powers under the 1976 law.
CBS News interviewed 100 Democratic voters here who say they are likely to participate in the February 2020 caucus to find out whose candidacy is connecting with Iowans as of now. And the most popular answer was TBD.
Democrats greeted Trump's declaration with glee, having won their House majority largely by campaigning on the issue of health care. Republicans, meanwhile, were left scratching their heads, wondering why the president would bring up a sore subject when he had better news to tout.
Lesley Stahl: One of the groups that's expressing fear are the LGBTQ group. You--
Dr. Travis Gayles: There you are.
There has been an explosion of health- and health insurance-related scams that use a variety of pretenses to collect personal information or payments for insurance that's never delivered, said YouMail CEO Alex Quilici. Crooks see what's in the news, and they try to leverage it. They're consummate marketers -- they're just in the wrong business.
Donald Trump: So Hillary called and it was a lovely call and it was a tough call for her, I mean, I can imagine. Tougher for her than it would have been for me. And for me, it would have been very, very difficult. She couldn't have been nicer. She just said, Congratulations, Donald, well done. And I said, I want to thank you very much, you were a great competitor. She is very strong and very smart.
I haven't had extensive conversations with Mr. Trump about social security cuts, Price told Sanders. But the Georgia Republican said I have no reason to believe that that position has been changed.
In addition, for the first time since 2015, the number of insurers participating in the exchanges will increase, according to HHS. In years past, insurers who had trouble making the exchange business profitable, and others, uncertain of the future of the health care law under President Donald Trump, pulled out of the exchange business, leaving consumers in some areas of the country with limited choices.
CBS News and other news outlets have, on multiple occasions, fact-checked Trump's claims that he opposed the war and found them to be false.
Past experience has taught us that complacency and concessions only invite aggression and provocation. I will not repeat the mistakes of the past administrations that got us into this dangerous position.
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: If I needed the votes for the wall in the House, I would have them in one session, it would be done.
The two nations have been embroiled in a dispute over technology policy and other issues for most of this year. With no end to the conflict in sight, investors are growing more concerned that the tensions will drag down the already-slowing global economy.
The poll, which was taken after the unrest in Kenosha and both conventions, showed little movement among likely voters compared to the August Marquette poll when Biden was leading 49% to 44%. The poll found 47% of Wisconsinites approve of the protests against police shootings, while 48% disapprove. That's nearly identical to the numbers in August when there was a tie at 48% among those who approve and disapprove.
The Supreme Court's four liberal justices seemed troubled by the changes, which the government has estimated would cause about 70,000 women — and at most 126,000 women — to lose contraception coverage in one year.
During the March 3, 2020, presidential primary, more than 75% of California voters received a vote-by-mail ballot. Under this executive order every registered voter who is currently living in California will receive a ballot 29 days prior to Election Day. Military and voters living abroad will be mailed their ballots 45 days before Election Day. Padilla is now urging voters to make sure their registration information is up to date.
Lesley Stahl: So what just happened with the president?
New Jersey and Pennsylvania challenged the rules in court, and a judge blocked them from going into effect. The judge found the Trump administration did not follow proper procedures for issuing the rules. An appeals court agreed, and the administration appealed to the Supreme Court to step in, as did the Little Sisters of the Poor. The order of Roman Catholic nuns was instrumental in challenging the Obama administration rules.
McCaskill got strong backing from women in her 2012 reelection bid when her Republican opponent, Todd Akin, made his infamous legitimate rape remark. She won women by 22 points, up from 6 points in 2006. But with Trump's decisive victory here, he won the support of both women (+10 points) and men (+30 points). Hawley will need to peel off some women voters from McCaskill, and keep his margins up among men. McCaskill will look to continue her strong performance with women. In the latest Battleground Tracker, 13 percent of women who say they voted for Trump are backing McCaskill. McCaskill hopes to persuade more Trump supporters to back her and turn out some new voters who don't typically vote in midterms.
Melania Trump: We are used to it.

But I do love the idea of Medicare for all, she added.
TRUMP: I was against — I was against the war in Iraq. Has not been debunked. And you voted for it. And you shouldn't have. Well, I just want to say...
MARGARET BRENNAN: As Commander-in-chief what would you do differently with China? What leverage would you use to get them to capitulate on trade?
Lesley Stahl: Dr. Fauci. You know the president said that he's a disaster, and he and the-- other public health officials around him are idiots. Do you care to comment on that?
GOVERNOR NED LAMONT: Somebody I talked to a lot about this is one of your next guests, Scott Gottlieb, who's been advising us. And, fortunately, in Connecticut, compared to, say, a couple of the other states, our hit rate in terms of those particularly infectious variants is very, very low. So, I'm quite confident that if we keep the vaccinations going, we're going to be able to stay ahead of that curve. But we are watching it carefully. And if something changes so will we.
She said elements of the plan have already been released, including action on telemedicine and drug importation, and there's more that will be forthcoming.
The president, who was vice president when Obamacare was enacted, vowed during his presidential campaign to protect and expand the 2010 health care law, as a group of Republican states and the Trump administration fought to kill Obamacare in a case pending before the Supreme Court. Mr. Biden has stressed that the coronavirus pandemic underscores the need for access to health care.
Donald Trump: They spent $1 billion against me on the word Temperament. It was given by Madison Avenue. And they thought that, by temperament, they could maybe, you know, win the election. Obviously, it didn't work because we're here and they're not. And I think my strongest asset is my temperament because I have a temperament where we win and we're going to start winning again. We're going to win on trade, we're going to win at the borders, we're going to knock out ISIS.
UnitedHealth's higher premium plans may have failed to attract enough healthy consumers to make them profitable. At the same time, higher-cost patients with many health needs may have gravitated to UnitedHealth's broader networks.
So I'm putting in more than — by the time it's finished, I'll have more than $100 million invested. Pretty much self-funding money. We're raising money for the Republican Party, and we're doing tremendously on the small donations, $61 average or so.
JOE BIDEN: --that if you got any negative information about someone else from another-- from a foreign source, you would not use it. And if you got any information that they were trying to interfere, you'd report it. I took--
And Republicans feel this way, believe it or not, and strongly this way. We're going to block grant into the states. We're going to block grant into Medicaid into the states...
At that same point during the 2016 election, the state's county boards of elections had received over 524,000 absentee ballot applications.
Washington — The nomination of Judge Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court last week set into motion a fast-paced and fiercely political battle over the future of the high court, with Senate Democrats, who have few tools to block her confirmation by the GOP-controlled Senate, charging that a vote in favor of Barrett is a vote to kill the Affordable Care Act.
The new ads are similar to the messaging by congressional candidates and what was a leading issue for Democrats when they took back the House in 2018. In a call Wednesday with reporters, DCCC Chairwoman Cheri Bustos called health care the number one issue.
Mr. Trump repeatedly pledged to bring back manufacturing, and manufacturing jobs, to the U.S.
JAMELLE BOUIE: I think where-- where the danger comes in is if-- if President Trump is setting-- is setting himself up with sort of un-- unrestrained capitalism, that is actually unpopular, as well, right?
In addition to voting to strike down Louisiana's abortion restriction, Roberts joined the Supreme Court's liberal bloc in blocking the Trump administration's efforts to wind down the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, ruling its attempt to do so was unlawful. Roberts and Justice Neil Gorsuch, who was appointed to the high court by President Trump, helped form a 6-3 majority in extending federal workplace protections to LGBTQ workers.
While local election boards have been scanning incoming ballots the past couple of weeks, the full count of votes will come after May 8, the deadline for mail ballots to come in. Democratic candidate Kweisi Mfume, who previously held the seat from 1987 to 1996, is expected to win the historically Democratic district against Republican Kimberly Klacik. As of Friday morning, 56,019 Democratic ballots have been returned, compared to 19,097 Republican ballots.
Weighing in on some of the prominent Republicans skipping the convention, Manafort added: Well, the party is unified.
Last week, Buttigieg criticized Biden as a D.C. insider, an attack Biden attempted to rebut on Wednesday. The former vice president ticked off a list of accomplishments from his decades in the federal government, including his working passing both Obamacare and the Recovery Act as vice president. Is he really saying the Obama-Biden administration was a failure? Biden asked. Pete, just say it out loud. The former vice president then seemed to compare his long political resume to Buttigieg's. I have great respect for Mayor Pete and his service to this nation. But I do believe it's a risk – to be just straight up with you – for this party and to nominate someone who's never held an office higher than mayor of a town of 100,000 people in Indiana.
When liberals can both demand when are you Republicans going to end the hate and cheer comedian Kathy Griffin for waving around a severed Trump head, you can't blame conservatives for doubting their sincerity.
After the president nodded to the Marine band drummer and told him to drop the beat, Mr. Obama held up cards with a few words for Manuel to riff on -- Constitution, Obamacare, The Federalist Papers.
MARGARET BRENNAN: There is a plan in place for a deal to be signed at the end of the month after this pause in violence or reduction in violence. I remember when the Obama administration sought a deal with the Taliban. The Trump administration is now on the verge of signing one.
President Trump is trying to give the teetering Republican plan to repeal and replace Obamacare a new sense of urgency by saying he'd like to get it over with and move on to the agenda items he cares about.
The inspector general estimated that the government spent nearly $1.2 million on Price's travel during his seven months in office. That included more than $700,000 in military flights on two foreign and two domestic trips, as well as more than $480,000 for various domestic trips by private chartered aircraft.
We're giving those Americans a way to change the channel on Washington Republicans – and they can do it from their sofa, DCCC Chairwoman Cheri Bustos said in a statement.
The Trump Victory campaign also declared a win Wednesday morning, saying in a statement that Garcia flipping a district that Hillary Clinton won by 7 points in 2016 is a devastating blow to California Democrats.
And why is the base talking impeachment? In part because of the way their elected Democrats have been talking about President Trump.
Q: What could happen if the federal government pulls back funding and cuts down requirements for health insurers?
MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll talk with Chicago Schools Superintendent Janice Jackson, former FDA Commissioner Doctor Scott Gottlieb, and look-- at-- going back to Wuhan, one year after the virus was discovered.
In addition, the provision may encourage a new batch of healthier people who can get by with skimpier coverage to sign up for association plans instead of the ACA exchange plans. That could leave more sick people in the exchanges without the benefit of younger, healthier people balancing the risk pool. According to the Congressional Budget Office, 6 million people are expected to enroll in expanded association health plans.
We slashed the business tax rate from 35 percent all the way down to 21 percent, so American companies can compete and win against anyone else anywhere in the world. These changes alone are estimated to increase average family income by more than $4,000. A lot of money.
She continued by saying most Americans are upset that many of them had to change doctors after many years with their doctors under Obamacare.
Donald Trump: No, I think it's a moment in time where politicians for a long period of time have let people down. They've let 'em down on the job front. They've even let 'em down in terms of the war front. You know, we've been fighting this war for 15 years--
While these issues will gin up the base and aid Heller's quest to shore up Trump supporters' votes in November, they could also hurt him in a state with a large population of Hispanic and union voters.
COBRA, also known as the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act, is a federal law that allows individuals to continue with the health insurance they had while employed before a qualifying event. According to the U.S. Department of Labor, COBRA continuation coverage is often more expensive than the amount that employees have previously paid.
CLINTON: And $13 trillion in family wealth was wiped out. We are back on the right track. He would send us back into recession with his tax plans that benefit the wealthiest of Americans.
Barbara Harris Paramount Pictures Tony Award-winning actress Barbara Harris (July 25, 1935-August 21, 2018) lent her considerable comic-neurotic charms to the Broadway stage and to movies, including Robert Altman's Nashville, Alfred Hitchcock's Family Plot, ''Freaky Friday and A Thousand Clowns. Born in the Chicago suburb of Evanston, Harris was a member of Playwrights Theatre Club (which she joined while still in high school) and the Compass Players, before forming the inaugural lineup of the improvisation group Second City, in 1959. The improvisations were the thing, Harris told the Los Angeles Times. It gave you a chance to try. If you died, you really died, but it was a great way to learn. She made her screen debut in 1965 with A Thousand Clowns, then got back-to-back Tony nominations in 1966 and 1967 for two hit Broadway musicals: On a Clear Day You Can See Forever and The Apple Tree, for which she won. Harris also earned an Academy Award nomination as Best Supporting Actress in the 1971 film Who Is Harry Kellerman and Why Is He Saying Those Terrible Things About Me? Other film credits included The Seduction of Joe Tynan, Peggy Sue Got Married, Dirty Rotten Scoundrels and Grosse Point Blank. In later years she decamped for Arizona where she taught acting, telling the Phoenix New Times in 2002, I used to try to get through one film a year, but I always chose movies that I thought would fail, so that I wouldn't have to deal with the fame thing.
MARGARET BRENNAN: --it wasn't adequately equipped to deal with the record number of families coming across. Why aren't they?

And we celebrate our police, our military, and our amazing veterans as heroes who deserve our total and unwavering support.
Other healthcare issues like mental health funding and high prescription drug prices were also overwhelmingly mentioned as a problem affecting the lives of the Democrats interviewed. Jackie Osam, 39, complained that there were too many candidates in the race, but that she's leaning toward Sanders for his tough talk against pharmaceutical companies.
There were reports that several top administration officials had been at odds over the Justice Department's brief. However, when Vice President Mike Pence's chief of staff, Marc Short, who was present for the conversation about the challenge to ACA, was asked about this by CBS News' Major Garrett, he denied that there had been much chaos, and characterized the discussion as a healthful conversation.

First of all, he has his communication style, but you're not hearing me defend that, Haley said. What I will tell you is, if there is anything that he communicates in a way that I'm uncomfortable with, I pick up the phone and call him. I don't need to be public about that. I think that's a private conversation that should happen when I feel it, and I think it's one that he's receptive to when I do.
SEN. SANDERS: Well I don't know that that's--
MARGARET BRENNAN: If it's described as a Nordic country and not Venezuela.
Apple announced on Jan. 17 that it will build a second corporate campus and hire 20,000 workers in a $350 billion, five-year commitment. -- Kate Rydell
But people that will respect the Constitution of the United States. And I think that this is so important. Also, the Second Amendment, which is totally under siege by people like Hillary Clinton. They'll respect the Second Amendment and what it stands for, what it represents. So important to me.
If a high-deductible plan is all you can afford or otherwise makes the most sense for you, compare options carefully to find what each policy covers before your deductible is met. Under the law, annual physicals and some preventive care screening such as mammograms are covered 100 percent before the deductible.
MARGARET BRENNAN: All right. Thanks to all of you. We'll be right back.
Despite the hiccup, Ryan expressed confidence that Congress would still reach an agreement in time.
JOHN DICKERSON: Let me ask you about a red state Tennessee. I know of a voter there who is-- who voted for Donald Trump but was going to vote for Phil Bredesen the-- the Democrat because he had an experience with Bredesen in the state and then Hillary Clinton came out and-- and quoted-- was quoted this week saying you cannot be civil with a political party that wants to destroy what you stand for, what you care about. This voter, of course, it's an example of one and let's not go too far, John. But there were a lot of people who felt like that was not helpful to Democrats to have Hillary Clinton say that.
EMILY's List Training Center was launched in 2018 and has since provided tools to teach pro-Democratic women who are running for office how to run a successful campaign. As pro-choice Democratic women push for progress and protection in some of our most vulnerable communities, we are committed to helping them run up and down the ballot, said EMILY's List president Stephanie Schriock in a press release statement.

A day after officially taking on the mantle of Donald Trump's campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, a longtime Republican operative, joined CBS This Morning to discuss the direction of the troubled campaign with less than 12 weeks to go until the general election.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we know Michael Bloomberg is still not on the ballot, but he is going to be in South Carolina on the debate stage Tuesday. How does he need to prepare for that?
Lesley Stahl: With that in mind, what do you think about your running mate's campaign and the tone and the negativity of it?
MARGARET BRENNAN: --are we going to have a shutdown over Christmas?
In the second case the justices heard Wednesday, political consultants and pollsters were among those asking the Supreme Court to strike down a federal law from 1991 that bars them from making robocalls to cellphones. The case only arose after Congress in 2015 created an exception in the law that allows the automated calls for collection of government debt.
JANICE JACKSON: Right now we're anticipating seventy-seven thousand students, which is roughly a third of the students here in CPS that are eligible for in-person instruction. That's twice the size of the second largest school district here in Illinois. And so reopening Chicago Public Schools is extremely important. We should also note that private and parochial schools in the city have been open since August, and we learned a lot from their implementation plans and look to guidance from public health officials, as well as the CDC to make sure we had a solid plan for reopening.
Obama - he had to know that Hillary was using an illegal server, but he claimed otherwise, Trump said. So that means Obama is now into the act.
Vice President Mike Pence: Lesley, President Trump is a man who speaks his mind. I think it's one of the great strengths that he's had--
For somebody who wants to be commander-in-chief of our armed forces, she's literally reading from something somebody else wrote and said, 'well they can get him to read different words from a teleprompter,' Conway said. There's not a single job that gets created, not a single uninsured American who gets health care from that kind of nastiness.
John McCain: Listen, the joy of my life was the bonds that were forged between me and my fellow POWs. They were wonderful. We fought together. We loved each other. We would tap on the walls to each other. I look back on that experience with a great deal of pride.
Delegates on the floor began booing Cruz loudly at the end of his speech.
On CBS' The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, liberal celebrity and activist Michael Moore says it's time to get rid of the Electoral College.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Good morning and welcome to Face the Nation. We begin today with White House senior adviser Stephen Miller. He is the president's point person on policy. Good to have you here in studio.
The House, meanwhile, is planning to adjourn after their lone vote this morning, which will take place around 10:45 a.m. It'll wrap up around 11:45 a.m. and then House lawmakers leave town – so they are telling the Senate they have to pass the CR the House passed last night if they want to keep the government open.
The Republican Party has yet to come up with a comprehensive health care plan, but the president has addressed some individual health issues. He has approved Congress' opioid legislation and banned flavored cigarettes. He has also made lowering drug prices part of his agenda. He indicated support for Speaker Nancy Pelosi's bill to lower drug prices, but Leader Mitch McConnell reportedly said the measure is dead on arrival, according to CBS News Political Unit associate producer Sarah Ewall Wice.
I had to get out there and make sure I did my part to save [my health care], she said. That is not something that needs to be taken away from anybody.
I am proud to be a Republican, he continued. But most of all I am proud to be an American.

Trump adviser Newt Gingrich has tweeted his approval, calling Price the right leader to help Congress replace Obamacare.
There are children suffering in this catastrophic war, largely, I believe, because of Russian aggression. And we need to do our part. We by no means are carrying anywhere near the load that Europe and others are. But we will have vetting that is as tough as it needs to be from our professionals, our intelligence experts and others.
On Thursday, Biden is taking his presidential campaign to Florida, reports CBS News political correspondent Ed O'Keefe. Well, kind of. He's making virtual stops in Jacksonville and Tampa, where he plans to hold discussions with local leaders and a rally, respectively.
A bill that passed the state House last week would give counties three days to do so, but Wolf's spokesperson said he would veto it in current form because it would ban drop boxes. On a press call held by VoteSafe Pennsylvania, Ridge said he doesn't have a preference on drop boxes but that early pre-canvassing should be supported by both sides. I just don't see this as being a partisan issue, he said. We've got Republicans and Democrats at the local level who are asking the governor and the legislature, Republicans and Democrats, to ease these restrictions and let them give them adequate time to do their job.
Well, as I said, this is a particular episode. And it has some troubling features to it, as we've discussed. But I think, you know, that's a question that really has to wait an analysis of all the different episodes that occurred through the summer of 2016 and the first several months of President Trump's administration.
The White House held a hastily-arranged conference call with reporters Sunday evening to explain the president's extreme vetting executive order issued Friday, after visa holders from countries included in the order were detained at U.S. airports this weekend.

All the last few weeks, I sat in that chamber, knowing I was doing my constitutional duty, knowing how important it was, Klobuchar told voters in Portsmouth on Tuesday. And then seeing some of my opponents out there doing hundreds of events. Now at least, with the exception of tomorrow when I'm going back for the vote, I will be at an even playing field.
Biden is going to need to have a strategy to deal with the courts in order to get anything done on his agenda, Demand Justice executive director Brian Fallon told CBS News.
Among other findings from the report:
Both sides regularly say they want infrastructure progress. Vice President Mike Pence told The Hill this week the administration wants to push ahead with infrastructure during the lame-duck session following the election. While Mr. Trump's approach may be different from House Democrats' vision, the shared goal may leave room for a joint effort, Rep. Steny Hoyer, a Maryland Democrat, told the New York Times.

Donald Trump: But I think it's a very small amount. Again, I think it's--
Arizona, as you know, is a crucial battleground state, but you don't often see presidential candidates around here. And the fact is, President Trump is about the only one who's spending any money here and in some of the other swing states around the country. And that's a big problem for our party and I am determined to change exactly that, he told reporters in Phoenix.
With just about a week to go before the New York primaries, a pro-Ted Cruz super PAC is investing $500,000 in television, radio and digital ads in the state.
TRUMP: It's called extreme vetting. We are going to areas like Syria where they're coming in by the tens of thousands because of Barack Obama. And Hillary Clinton wants to allow a 550 percent increase over Obama. People are coming into our country like we have no idea who they are, where they are from, what their feelings about our country is, and she wants 550 percent more. This is going to be the great Trojan horse of all time.
JOHN DICKERSON: So, you say politics--this isn't about politics.
These documents simply indicate the breadth and depth of concern across the American government — including among career officials — over intelligence reports of Michael Flynn's attempts to undermine ongoing American national security policy through discussions with Russian officials or other foreign representatives, Bates said. The only people with questions to answer are Grenell, Sen. Grassley, and Sen. Johnson for their gross politicization of the intelligence process.
MARGARET BRENNAN: So that was a yes? That your health care plan would cover--
To me, radical jihadism, radical Islamism, I think they mean the same thing, Clinton said. I'm happy to say either. But that's not the point.
TRUMP: Hillary Clinton, in terms of having people come into our country, we have many criminal illegal aliens. When we want to send them back to their country, their country says we don't want them. In some cases, they're murderers, drug lords, drug problems. And they don't want them.
The White House is putting focus this year on Trump's long-overdue plan to boost spending on the nation's crumbling infrastructure. The plan would put up $200 billion in federal money over the next 10 years to leverage $1.5 trillion in infrastructure spending, relying on state and local governments and the private sector to contribute the bulk of the funding.
Donald Trump: You know what, it was a very-- it was a very interesting thing because-- I mean, few people have asked me from my family, what was that first period of time like?
TRUMP: We have a divided nation. We have a very divided nation. You look at Charlotte. You look at Baltimore. You look at the violence that's taking place in the inner cities, Chicago, you take a look at Washington, D.C.
We have a place to go because we can come together and talk about things we have in common, Slotkin said. That is important for people to believe that we can get to a place where we can have civil, reasonable, responsible discussion again among people with very different views.
The president mentioned Otto Warmbier, a student from the University of Virginia, who was arrested in North Korea, sentenced to 15 years of hard labor and who was ultimately returned to the U.S. last June horribly injured and on the verge of death. He passed away just days after his return.
Democrats attack Republican millionaires and billionaire for allegedly buying elections all the time. Nobody asks if liberal criticism of, say, Sheldon Adelson, is based on bigotry. And yet standard-issue partisan rhetoric from the Right is immediately declared racist dog-whistling and used to condemn the entire party.
BETO O'ROURKE: For more than a hundred years this community has welcomed generations of immigrants trying to escape brutality, violence, and crushing poverty to find a better life in this country for themselves and for their kids, that's for sure.
Lancaster, Pennsylvania, was the backdrop for Joe Biden's rebuttal to the rebirth of the Obamacare lawsuit today, CBS News campaign reporter Bo Erickson reports. The presumptive Democratic nominee first joined in on a socially-distanced discussion with families who said they benefitted from the expanded Obamacare protections.
The candidates for Florida governor began their second and final debate by decrying political divisiveness on a day when Democratic leaders had been sent pipe bombs. But it wasn't long before they lapsed into attacks on each other. Republican former U.S. Rep. Ron DeSantis and Democratic Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum agreed that some people are being pushed over the edge by extreme political rhetoric.
MARGARET BRENNAN: In Connecticut you have detected some of this new mutant virus, the B117 that originated or was-- excuse me, detected first in the U.K. The prime minister, as you know, of the United Kingdom, shut down schools there. At what point will you reverse course or have to reverse course and shut down your schools if this particular strain becomes more of a problem?
Sean Kirk: Well, it's not like flipping a switch. You know, we build safety into our manufacturing processes from the beginning. We have controls, we have procedures, we have testing. All of that is very complicated, very complex. We're not manufacturing simple items here, we're manufacturing complex biologics. And the concerted effort, the choreography if-- if you will, and the time it takes to ramp that up, it just simply takes time.

TRUMP STATEMENT: We have to be sure that Muslims come in and report when they see something going on. When they see hatred going on, they have to report it. As an example: San Bernardino, many people saw the bombs all over the apartment of the two people that killed 14 and wounded many, many people.
But the debt under Mr. Trump has continued to soar, and it's unclear whether he's willing to take the unpopular steps to change that trajectory. Most fiscal experts say non-discretionary spending — programs like Medicaid, Medicare and Social Security, the largest drivers of the debt — must be slashed in order to reverse the trend. The national debt, which was just shy of $20 trillion when Mr. Trump took office in January 2019, surpassed $22 trillion for the first time ever in February of this year.
In contrast, Clinton recently agreed to campaign on a Bernie Sanders-crafted plan to cover tuition at four-year state schools for families making under $125,000 annually. She has also advocated cutting student loan rates, refinancing existing loans, cracking down on predatory loans and for-profit schools, and deferring loans for social entrepreneurs. Of the two candidates, Clinton's college plan is the most detailed and pro-student.
Trump today also kept up his call for Mr. Obama to release his birth certificate (even though the president has already provided his certificate of live birth, and there is ample evidence to show the president was born in the U.S.).
Mr. Trump tweeted Tuesday morning that the November presidential contest will be a Rigged Election, and singled out California Governor Gavin Newsom as part of his ongoing feud with the state's vote-by-mail initiative. There is NO WAY (ZERO!) that Mail-in-Ballots will be anything less than substantially fraudulent, Mr. Trump said on Twitter. CBS News campaign reporter Musadiq Bidar reports the president has long been a critic of vote-by-mail, an issue that Democrats have been pushing for aggressively since the coronavirus outbreak. Earlier today, at a press briefing, Newsom said there is no evidence of fraudulent activities as it relates to vote-by-mail and referenced several studies, including one from the George W. Bush administration to prove his point. The California governor spent several minutes at the end of press briefing, saying vote-by-mail is not a Republican or Democratic issue. He warned that we are not even through phase one of this pandemic. Newsom said when the next potential COVID-19 season hits it will be around election time. The last thing we want to do is deny you your fundamental right, hard fought right. We just had Memorial Day weekend, people literally living and dying to protect your freedom, freedom to vote, Newsom said. He added that there are no benefits to politicizing this issue, saying, I hope we can temper our comments on the other side, though I recognize we are in a political season.
Nearly 160 million workers and family members have coverage through employers, although the number covered by small employers is much smaller.
MARGARET BRENNAN: The President saw the Mueller report as a victory for him on the campaign trail. Are Democrats pretending it didn't happen?
MARGARET BRENNAN: He didn't give a-- didn't give a lot of details.
So, instead of saying no to open up a new enrollment period, he [president] should be saying no to his case before the Supreme Court, which is very, very harmful in normal times and in these extraordinary times, very destructive, Pelosi said.
CBS This Morning host Charlie Rose asked Conway Thursday: Did [Trump] believe it?
The following is a transcript of an interview with former White House Counsel Don McGahn that aired Sunday, September 27, 2020, on Face the Nation.
Still, rising levels of debt could make millions of Americans more vulnerable if the economy stutters. Economsts say inflationary pressures are building, even as wage growth remains muted. For instance, the national average price for a gallon of unleaded gas is about $2.30 per gallon, a 45 cent increase over last year, though still well under the high of $4.10 seen in 2008, according to GasBuddy.
It's amazing to me that Judge Barrett has publicly criticized the decision by Chief Justice Roberts that upheld the constitutionality of the ACA and that President Trump is making it clear a vote for Judge Barrett to be on the Supreme Court is a vote to repeal the ACA and take away health care protection from a majority of Americans during a pandemic, Senator Chris Coons of Delaware, a Democrat who serves on the Judiciary Committee, said on Face the Nation.
Infrastructure — the catch-all phrase for big construction projects from highways and subways to water systems to the electric grid — may get a boost no matter what the election's outcome, according to UBS. That could come in the form of a $1 trillion infrastructure bill discussed by both sides in the 2016 Presidential contest, even as the deficit balloons over the next few years pay for the Republican-led tax cuts of 2017.
Asked whether there are enough votes in Congress for an infrastructure spending program, Republican Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida said it depends. He said it would be very difficult if all of the $1 trillion were to be funded by taxpayer money.
When answering questions about health care, Harris again was on the defense when Pence tried to interrupt her. He interrupted me, and I'd like to just finish, please, Harris said after Page told her that her allotted time was ending.
The Trump administration has opted against reopening the marketplaces on healthcare.gov for a special enrollment period to accommodate those who have lost employer-sponsored healthcare amid the coronavirus pandemic, a senior administration official confirmed to CBS News. Millions of Americans who filed for unemployment benefits last week can still apply for insurance under the Affordable Care Act, but freelancers or part-time employees who have had sources of income disappear will not be eligible to file under a qualifying life event.
Later in the day, Pence visited the Youngstown Police Department. The Vice President's press secretary Devin O'Malley said in a statement that Pence's visit to the police department is to highlight their recent innovative police reform effort. Youngstown PD recently opened their use of force training to the community in order to promote transparency, open up communication, and build trust, O'Malley said. The Vice President delivered brief remarks at the police station, saying we don't have to choose between supporting law enforcement and support for our African-American community. Pence, who's been referring to George Floyd's death as a tragedy and promising justice, continues to also couch the remark with lines like there is also no excuse for the rioting, and the violence, and the looting and the attacks on law enforcement that followed. Pence said every American can support law enforcement and the African-American community at the same time while coming together around better public safety.
For his part, Puzder remains publicly steadfast in his desire to head the Department of Labor, despite a news report that he is losing heart. He's all-in, said Michael Lotito, a friend and lawyer who represents employers on workplace matters. No one is more frustrated that hearings can't take place than Andy.
While CBP provided extensive figures on border wall funding and construction — it estimates it has secured enough to fund 201-205 miles of border wall since January 2017 — CBP could not answer straightforward questions about how many miles of wall have been constructed since January 2017 in places where no wall previously existed.
(APPLAUSE) And, look, if this were just about one video, maybe what he's saying tonight would be understandable, but everyone can draw their own conclusions at this point about whether or not the man in the video or the man on the stage respects women. But he never apologizes for anything to anyone.
Small businesses are likely to receive more grants and forgivable loans, as well.
Lesley Stahl: Yeah, but what can --
Vice President-elect Mike Pence, who is heading the transition effort, teased a number of very important announcements tomorrow as he exited Trump Tower Monday night.
President Donald Trump: So why don't you get back to your interview, and let's go.
On the Bureau of Prisons-- currently 2,100 inmates and over 360 Bureau prison staff have tested positive for COVID-19. Will you make universal testing available to the inmates and the staff?
In letters obtained by CBS News, Oversight Chairman Elijah Cummings (D-MD), Energy and Commerce Chairman Frank Pallone (D-NJ), Ways and Means Chairman Richard Neal (D-MA), Education and Labor Chairman Bobby Scott (D-VA) and Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler (D-NY) are asking for any documents related to the court filing. They have issued a deadline of April 22 for turning over the information.
MARGARET BRENNAN: --is-- is trimming away at your support?
Annoying or not, the administration touted the segment's success with officials saying how many people went straight to healthcare.gov from the Funny or Die site.
In their letter to Attorney General William Barr, the lawmakers called the DOJ's decision to strike down the ACA troubling, warning that the the move will have a significant negative impact on the accessibility of health care for Americans. The Democrats also suggest that the decision largely appears be politically motivated, rather than a substantial legal argument.
SEN. SCOTT: Look, I- I want to listen to everybody's ideas. I've sat down with the pharmaceutical companies, the PBMs, the insurance companies, the hospital industry, the pharmacies to ask them their ideas. I- I think the best way of doing this is discuss everybody's ideas and see what we can do.
After unveiling an all-male economic advisory council last week stocked with billionaires and business acquaintances, Donald Trump is adding another nine members. This time around, eight of them are female.
Lesley Stahl: Oh my god. This is his health care plan?
The most robust response came from Sanders most trusted advisor, his wife Jane O'Meara Sanders, who spoke to the AP Wednesday afternoon. We remain committed to continuing a progressive movement made up of women and men, black and white, gay and straight, she said.
Primary Overview: What to know before Tuesday, June 26
SEN. SCOTT: I- you know- whatever happens with Obamacare--
While the Colorado judge is conservative, he also has a sterling reputation. The White House believed he was unlikely to elicit a massive Senate Democratic uprising. This week, that belief will be put to the test. Democrats must decide whether this is the time to oppose a qualified conservative nominee. As a conservative replacing Scalia, Gorsuch wouldn't change the balance of the court. If enough Democrats oppose him, it would force Sen. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to invoke the nuclear option to get Gorsuch confirmed with a simple majority.
Some on the left, predictably enough, aren't happy about the slew of centrist vets the Democrats are running. If the Democrats capture a majority in the House of Representatives on November 6…candidates drawn from the military-intelligence apparatus will comprise as many as half of the new Democratic members of Congress, read an article on a socialist website that quickly made the rounds on progressive social media earlier this month.
Trump and Pence will both attend the Republican National Convention in Cleveland, which kicks off Monday.
MARGARET BRENNAN: So the Biden administration projected this week that another ninety thousand people will die in the U.S. over the next four weeks, but the curve seemed to be coming down on hospitalizations and infections. Are we getting ahead of ourselves by saying we're turning a corner here? Are you warning us that these new variants are going to dramatically change this trajectory?
If Congress is able to pass a bill to keep the government funded through the end of the fiscal year, there likely will be another showdown in the fall. Lawmakers will likely have to strike a budget deal to lift spending caps put in place by a 2011 law and then find a way to address raising the debt ceiling.
Lesley Stahl: What about Thanksgiving? Should people feel safe to get together with their family? With their grandparents? With their aunts and uncles?
You can expect the president will be speaking from the heart, the senior administration official said.
It wouldn't be surprising, the official added, to see Trump dash off criticism of the Senate again, even if the tweets don't mention McConnell.
Mike Bloomberg: I don't remember saying it. I can tell you that years ago on the trading room floors, things were different. I apologize for that, I'm sorry if somebody was hurt.
But it would be virtually impossible to reach that number by 2020, or even 2024, should he win reelection.
At issue in the case brought by a group of Republican-led states — who are backed by the Trump administration — is whether the health care law's individual mandate is unconstitutional, since Congress abolished the financial penalty for individuals who do not purchase health insurance in its overhaul of the tax code in 2017. The justices are also tasked with deciding whether the rest of Obamacare can survive if the individual mandate is invalidated.
Consider an Atlantic article published the day after the Tree of Life mass shooting entitled Trump's Caravan Hysteria Led to This. How does opposing a caravan of migrants who have announced they're coming to America whether the American people like it or not cause an anti-Semitic attack in Pittsburgh?
CLINTON: No, I mean, he clarified what he meant. And it's very clear. Look, we are in a situation in our country where if we were to start all over again, we might come up with a different system. But we have an employer-based system. That's where the vast majority of people get their health care.
As millions of people file for unemployment each week in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic, a new study finds more than 20 million people who had job-based health coverage will become eligible for Affordable Care Act coverage.
With much of the USDS working remotely, the coronavirus pandemic has highlighted the need to modernize the government and the program is needed now more than ever.
MARGARET BRENNAN: But what gave pause last time? I mean, sometimes it's hard to predict how judges will actually rule on individual cases. But is there something that we should be scrutinizing here in terms of her stance? I mean Democrats are assuming she's against Affordable Care and against Roe versus Wade? Are those fair assumptions?
It is of course about getting a cure and treatment, that's a lot in this plan, about getting us there by 2025 and investing, but it's also about the caregivers, said Klobuchar.
Trump interjected to say: I think I am, actually, humble. I think I'm much more humble than you would understand.
MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to get to the issue of health care. The president this week said he wants the courts to strike down Obamacare, the Affordable Care Act. But to be fair senator, you want to replace Obamacare, too. You want to replace it with Medicare for all, this government run, government financed program.
Lawmakers are now expected to get back to work on legislation on Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) to help the undocumented immigrants known as Dreamers, with the possibility of another shutdown may be just weeks away.
Tiffany told Navarro that he spoke briefly with President Trump after his Tuesday-night win. Trump endorsed Tiffany and also joined one of his tele-town halls on Monday night with RNC Chair Ronna McDaniel. Now a Congressman-elect, Tiffany said his priority is helping Congress with the country's reopening. We know who is most affected by this... we need to make sure that we protect those people. We need to make sure that our frontline health care providers are protected, Tiffany said Tuesday night.
8. Will the Russians, Chinese, or some other foreign government try to interfere in the 2018 election cycle?
Kirsten Gillibrand Sen. Kirstin Gillibrand announces 2020 presid... 09:35 Biography Kirsten Gillibrand, born in 1966, is not the first woman in her family to become involved in politics. Her grandmother, Polly Noonan, was the founder of the influential Albany Democratic Club and was a major player in Albany Mayor Erastus Corning's political machine. Gillibrand, the daughter of two attorneys, was raised in Albany. She attended Dartmouth University and UCLA School of Law. Gillibrand worked at the private Manhattan-based law firm Davis Polk in the early 1990s, although she took a brief leave in 1992 to serve as a law clerk to Circuit Court Judge Roger Miner, a Ronald Reagan appointee. She served as special counsel to then-HUD Secretary Andrew Cuomo in the final year of the Clinton administration. She was a strong supporter of Hillary Clinton, and worked on her 2000 Senate campaign. Clinton became a mentor to Gillibrand, and encouraged Gillibrand to run for office in 2006 rather than in 2004, believing that running two years later would give her a greater chance of winning. Gillibrand defeated four-term Rep. John Sweeney, who represented a conservative district, in 2006. Gillibrand was a moderate congresswoman and a member of the conservative Democrat Blue Dog Caucus. She supported a bill to withhold funds from sanctuary cities, and received a 100 percent rating from the National Rifle Association. After Clinton left the Senate in 2009 to become secretary of state, Gov. David Paterson appointed Gillibrand to replace her.
Lesley Stahl: Do you think that the attorney general is covering anything up?
SEN. SANDERS: --contributions. I'm not quite sure. But I am enormously impressed by the many, many, hundreds of thousands of Americans who are making contributions. Many of them are very small contributions. I am also impressed by the fact that we have over one million people from every state in this country who have volunteered to work on what will be an unprecedented grassroots campaign. Look, Margaret, the way we win the Democratic nomination, the way we beat Trump- who in my mind is the most dangerous president in modern American history- is through a massive grassroots effort, which demands that we have an economy and a government which works for all of us and not just the one percent. That we end this massive level of income and wealth inequality where three of the wealthiest people own more wealth than the bottom half of Americans, while at the same time over half the people in this country are working paycheck to paycheck.
She told us that our Democratic values are being threatened, and says unabashedly, that she is the right person to stand up for them.
The justices did not comment on their order. They will consider the appeal on their normal timetable and could decide in the coming months whether to take up the case.
Mr. Trump said Friday he has seen the tape of Ahmaud Arbery, a 25-year-old black man who was shot while jogging in Brunswick, Georgia. The Georgia Bureau of Investigation arrested a father and son on Thursday, charging them with Arbery's murder and aggravated assault. Mr. Trump called the tape heartbreaking, adding that he has seen pictures of Arbery. You know, my heart goes out to the parents and the family and friends, Mr. Trump said. Yet we have to take it – law enforcement is going to look at it and they have a good governor in the state. The president did not indicate federal law enforcement are involved in the case at this time.
Later, under questioning from Tennessee Sen. Lamar Alexander, Price suggests that the Affordable Care Act will be replaced piecemeal.
When precinct results started coming in, Price said our accuracy and quality check programs found inconsistencies - prompting a full-scale investigation. He said IDP staff activated pre-planned backup operations and began entering data manually. Price's memo said that IDP staff found and resolved a coding issue in the app's reporting system, but found that the underlying data collected in the app was sound. He said there has been cross-checking paper documentation with data recorded in the app to ensure State Delegate Equivalents were valid and accurate.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Did you meet the goal?
But I think we can do it and I think we will do it, Gingrich said.
I would not be a president who took vacations. I would not be a president that takes time off, Mr. Trump said in a 2015 interview.
We actually want to solve this problem. So it's not as if we were saying, No way, no how...
A bigger government is not something they want to run on, GOP pollster Jon McHenry said of Democrats.
Meanwhile in Utah, Mitt Romney, another long-time critic of Mr. Trump who once called him a phony and a fraud, has been notably more silent in his condemnations since starting his campaign to fill retiring Republican Senator Orrin Hatch's seat in Utah. He faces a conservative primary challenge on Tuesday from state Rep. Mike Kennedy.
Vermont's Democratic gubernatorial ballot features a transgender woman hoping to make history & a 14-year-old hoping to change minds
6:37 p.m. The White House released the following from Trump's speech, as prepared for delivery:
SENATOR BEN SASSE: It's one of my callings. I am also a dad and a neighbor and a Husker football addict, so.
Woodward interviewed the president for a total of nine hours for his new book, Rage. Recorded audio clips of the conversations appeared on CNN and The Washington Post, Wednesday.
I'm winning with the smart people, Trump said earlier this month. I'm winning with the not-so-smart people too. We're winning everything!
CEDRIC RICHMOND: Look, we're not going to negotiate on TV, but what I will say about the minimum wage is the minimum wage has been expanded or increased during times of crisis before. It's been increased under Republican Presidents and Democratic Presidents. And it's a great way to lift people out of poverty. And if you think of all the frontline workers that are out there risking their lives every day, who probably have not been vaccinated, yet. So, you're talking about grocery store clerks and everyone else.
JOE BIDEN (Democratic Presidential Candidate/@JoeBiden): Yes.
9:14 p.m. ET Homeland Security Committee Chairman Michael McCaul, R-Texas, said that Hillary Clinton is promising more of the same: executive orders, amnesty and the surge of Syrian refugees.
There has been no movement so far by the federal government on any major funding for drug treatment. -- Laura Strickler
Donald Trump: And so we all had a dinner and I said, I would like to do this. I think I can do a great job. And I wanted to get, number one, a consensus and number two, ideally, their permission. And they all agreed.
Controversy Inslee's tenures in Congress and as Washington's governor have largely been scandal-free. However, some of his decisions as governor, including his backing of a controversial union legislation, have garnered opposition in Washington. What Trump says Mr. Trump has yet to tweet about Inslee or his presidential aspirations. In February 2018, however, the Washington governor confronted the president in the White House about his idea to arm teachers in the wake of multiple deadly school shootings. I just suggest we need a little less tweeting here and a little more listening. And let's just take that off the table and move forward, Inslee told the president during a meeting with other governors in the East Room. Although he initially pushed back by saying he supported arming certain teachers, Mr. Trump listened with his arms crossed while Inslee pleaded for him to drop the idea and embrace other gun control measure
While the ballots directed voters to fill in the bubbles with a black pen, the supplemental instructions said they could also use blue. Soltysiak said this will not be an issue because scanners read both colors of ink accurately, and If there was ever an issue with the type of pen used by a voter, the scanner would recognize the issue and the ballot would instead be counted by hand at tabulation. The blunder comes as Pennsylvania election boards cope with issuing well over 10 times the number of mail-in and absentee ballots they've sent in past years. Late last year, the state legislature passed a bill to allow no-excuse mail-in voting across the state. As the spread of COVID-19 shut down the state and the legislature moved the primary back a month, Pennsylvanians applied in droves to vote by mail. They can apply to vote by mail until May 26, a week before the election.
Even with his record fundraising, Harrison's campaign warned it needed to raise $10 million in the 12 days before the election to beat Graham. In a memo Wednesday, his campaign manager Zack Carroll wrote our campaign woke up the Republican giant. Carroll pointed out Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's super PAC raised $92 million in September and is already spending to try and stop Harrison. Too many pundits don't understand what we are up against and have said the Senate campaigns like ours don't need to keep fundraising, it read. But the fact is that unless our fundraising surges in the final 12 days, we will not be able to match Mitch McConnell jeopardizing our path to victory. On Tuesday, Republican super PAC the Senate Leadership Fund reported it had more than $113 million cash on hand heading into October, even as Republican candidates were being outraised by Democratic challengers. It still had nearly $70 million to burn as of October 14. Democrats' Senate Majority PAC had less than $20 million October 14 and had raised more than $100 million less than what the Senate Leadership Fund brought in across 2020. Other Senate Democrats are also now at a cash disadvantage in the final stretch despite outraising GOP incumbents by millions.
Maybe I'm going to do the tax returns when Obama does his birth certificate, he said. I'd love to give my tax returns. I may tie my tax returns into Obama's birth certificate.
Well, I think initially, you know, at the very beginning of the crisis, before we knew very much — and while, in some places, the infection rates were skyrocketing and threatening to overwhelm our health care system, you know, the initial limitations may have been defensible. But as time goes by, it's harder to justify those kinds of blanket restrictions on religious practice.
Lesley Stahl: (LAUGH) You're not okay with tough questions?
In a tweet Tuesday morning, Queen said the convention's use was unauthorised and against our wishes.
JOHN DICKERSON: For more of that interview tune in tonight to 60 MINUTES. In their conversation President Trump told Lesley Stahl that he plans severe punishment if Saudi Arabia is proven responsible for the death of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, though, he's reluctant to cut off arms sales to the Saudi kingdom.
Instead he cast himself as a a Kasich Republican who would be able to get the wheels turning on real change in Washington. He said he wouldn't change his identity for South Carolina, even though people had warned him that the conservative state would require it.
Late Monday, the House followed the Senate in passing legislation to reopen the government after the shutdown 266-150. The Senate vote was 81-18.
According to ITEP data, undocumented taxpayers paid 8 percent of their income on state and local taxes, compared to 5 percent for the top 1 percent. Our study estimates that the undocumented households are also remitting 10 percent of what they make here in the U.S. back to their country of origin, said Wiehe.
Lesley Stahl: $400,000 you're giving up.
TRUMP: Because you have nothing to say.
Trump then made his entrance, stepping onto an escalator landing above the stage. He waved to the crowd and rode the escalator down to begin his speech.
Next year, in the run-up to the 2016 presidential election, Ryan said Republicans in Congress will focus on putting together a complete alternative to the left's agenda.
6:00 p.m. ET Delegates are gathered on the convention floor for the roll call vote that will formally nominate Donald Trump as the GOP's candidate for president.
My administration is committed to fighting the drug epidemic and helping get treatment for those in need, for those who have been so terribly hurt. The struggle will be long and it will be difficult, but as Americans always do -- in the end, we will succeed. We will prevail.
Also this week, Democratic lawmakers are calling for the full release of the Mueller report, which is more than 300 pages long.
JOHN DICKERSON: And, yet, Susan Glasser, we have in our Battleground Tracker poll, when people are asked what issue will affect your-- your vote, what is the most important issue to you in your vote in 2018, health care comes in number one ahead of the economy and ahead of the-- so at seventy percent, economy sixty-seven percent, and the Supreme Court at fifty-seven percent. So the President is at least talking about an issue that people really seem to care about.
And later this year, do you expect a report from U.S. Attorney John Durham? Or do you expect indictments?
Although the White House says not to expect a lengthy laundry list of proposals and objectives, expect Mr. Obama to make the case for his priorities, including reforms in the criminal justice system and Congressional approval of the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement, two examples cited Tuesday by Earnest.
That same morning, he met us for a flight to his boyhood home.
House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy of California isn't putting a date on when Republican legislators will have an Obamacare replacement ready.
Having health insurance has never been more important, she said. We need a national commitment to make these newly uninsured people aware of their options.
So, folks, I'm against anybody who wants to do away with it and start over, he summed up in a separate speech in Londonderry, New Hampshire.
A poll released Thursday by the Cook Political Report and Kaiser Family Foundation found a majority of voters in Sun Belt political battleground state trust Democratic nominee Joe Biden over Mr. Trump to better handle the nation's health care - Arizona (53% - 44%), North Carolina (53% - 45%) and Florida (52% - 45%).
I think there's been a lot of talk about individuals losing health coverage, Price continued. That is not our goal nor is it our desire nor is it our plan.
Democrats in Ohio's Appalachian region are approaching the 2020 general election with a mix of optimism and concern, reports CBS News campaign reporter Jack Turman. It is unlikely that Biden will win Ohio's Appalachian region, but Democrats are hoping to diminish Republican strength in this heavily conservative area. I'm terrified. I have said a hundred times I don't think that there has ever been an election in which I was old enough to vote that I was actually afraid of who might win, said Mary Jane Tullius, a 71-year-old Democrat living in Beverly, Ohio. Democrats in the region are enthusiastic about their party in 2020, citing Mr. Trump's response to the COVID-19 pandemic and their disdain for the president. Republican enthusiasm is evident in the region with lawn signs supporting the president and opposing abortion. The Trump campaign has touted its field operation in the state, recently noting that its operation has made 12 million voter contacts. Ohio's Appalachian region has been plagued by poverty and opioid addiction, but the manufacturing industry saw some growth in the state since the Great Recession. That growth slowed at the end of 2019 and job losses ensued early on in the COVID-19 pandemic. Local mayors along the Ohio River who spoke with CBS News attributed job growth in their towns to local and state efforts. If we are going to do something, we need to raise the money or find the funding on our own, said Belpre, Ohio, Mayor Michael Lorentz.
In 2016, she defeated Rep. Loretta Sanchez, also a Democrat, in a landslide and became the first woman of color to represent California in the Senate. During her two years on Capitol Hill, Harris has solidified herself as a leading critic of the Trump administration, known for her fierce questioning as a member of the Judiciary and Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs committees. Harris announced her presidential candidacy on Martin Luther King Jr. Day, Jan. 21, 2019. Key issues In her short tenure in the Senate, Harris has compiled a liberal voting record and has overwhelmingly voted against President Trump's nominees for cabinet-level and other administration positions. Along with her tough, prosecutorial cross examinations during committee sessions, Harris has advocated for criminal justice and immigration reform and has contrasted her platform with Mr. Trump's agenda. Although she opposed the legalization of recreational marijuana during her law enforcement career in California, Harris announced her support for the Marijuana Justice Act crafted by Sen. Cory Booker, D-New Jersey. The bill would remove marijuana from the 1970 Controlled Substances Act, withhold federal funding for states which continue to criminalize the substance, require courts to expunge convictions for marijuana use or possession and establish a federal fund to help low-income communities affected by the so-called war on drugs. In October, Harris unveiled new tax legislation aimed at the middle class to give families up to $6,000 a year in refundable tax credits, which she will likely highlight on the 2020 campaign trail.
Play excerpt: Guess Who I Saw Today How Glad I Am brought her a Grammy in 1965 for best R&B performance, and she later won Grammys for Best Jazz Vocal Album in 2005 for the intimate R.S.V.P (Rare Songs, Very Personal), and in 2007 for Turned to Blue, a showcase for the relaxed, confident swing she mastered later in life. She performed worldwide at nightclubs, concert halls and jazz festivals. Wilson also had a busy career on television, film and radio, including years hosting NPR's Jazz Profiles series. Active in the civil rights movement, including the Selma march of 1965, she received an NAACP Image Award in 1998. She resisted being identified with a single category, especially jazz, and referred to herself as a song stylist, covering songs by Stevie Wonder, the Beatles and Aretha Franklin. The music that I sing today was the pop music of the 1960s, she told the San Francisco Chronicle in 2010. I just never considered myself a jazz singer. … I take a lyric and make it mine. I consider myself an interpreter of the lyric.
CLINTON: Thank you. Well, you're right. This is one of the most important issues in this election. I want to appoint Supreme Court justices who understand the way the world really works, who have real-life experience, who have not just been in a big law firm and maybe clerked for a judge and then gotten on the bench, but, you know, maybe they tried some more cases, they actually understand what people are up against.
NANCY PELOSI: Well, then go do it. Go do it.
The new rule will allow groups of businesses to band together to buy insurance across state lines, which will be bad for small firms and their employees because it will lead to higher premiums, unbalanced risk pools and lower-quality insurance, said John Arensmeyer, founder and CEO of Small Business Majority.
Harris said the line again when responding to Pence's false claim that Biden will raise taxes on day one of his presidency.
But I also want to be sure that we don't leave people behind. That's why I'm the only candidate from the very beginning of this campaign who had a plan to help us revitalize coal country, because those coal miners and their fathers and their grandfathers, they dug that coal out. A lot of them lost their lives. They were injured, but they turned the lights on and they powered their factories. I don't want to walk away from them. So we've got to do something for them.
9:31 p.m. The president said, In America, we know that faith and family, not government and bureaucracy, are the center of the American life. Our motto is in God we trust. And we celebrate our police, our military, and our amazing veterans as heroes who deserve our total and unwavering support.
Refaai Hamo - Refugee Carlos Osorio/AP A Syrian government anti-personnel missile tore through the complex Refaai Hamo designed and lived in with his family. He subsequently fled to Turkey struggling without a residence permit and diagnosed with stomach cancer. He finally received refugee status and was able to move to Troy, Michigan. President Obama saw his story on the website Humans of New York and responded by writing, Welcome to your new home. You're part of what makes America great.
Maybe people sometimes misremember things that happened, she added. But I know without a doubt that it is not anything Bernie would ever say. It is inconceivable because it's not what he believes. And there's proof of that going back many, many years.
Elizabeth Warren Elizabeth Warren takes formal step toward 202... 02:18 Biography Warren was born in 1949 and raised in Oklahoma, where her father worked as a janitor and her mother took a minimum wage job at Sears. She has described growing up in a paycheck-to-paycheck family that lived on the ragged edge of the middle class. Warren first married at age 19 and became an elementary school teacher after graduating from the University of Houston. She began law school at Rutgers University when her daughter was two years old, and she gave birth to a son soon after earning her degree. Warren served as a law professor for three decades, and spent 20 of those years at Harvard Law School. Massachusetts Rep. Joe Kennedy III and Arkansas Sen. Tom Cotton were among her students there. After the 2008 financial collapse, Warren was tapped to lead the congressional oversight panel for the Troubled Asset Relief Program, known as TARP. She served as the architect of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau under the 2010 financial reform law known as Dodd-Frank. In those roles, she became a prominent figure on the national stage and a hero among progressive populists. But her views on the economy garnered plenty of critics within the Republican Party and among Wall Street bankers. Such opposition derailed Obama administration plans to nominate her to officially run the CFPB. Instead, she ran for the U.S. Senate in 2012 and defeated incumbent Massachusetts Republican Sen. Scott Brown--her first run at public office.
It was typical of the courage that marked his long political life. Through two presidential campaigns and decades in the Senate, he became one of the best-known politicians in America and was never afraid to cross party lines.
China and the United States clashed again over their respective trade policies Monday, as China criticized what it calls a unilateralist and protectionist approach to trade. The U.S. ambassador to the World Trade Organization said those critiques were unwarranted.
Biden then shifted his focus to Buttigieg, the 38-year-old former mayor of South Bend whose strength in Iowa exceeded expectations.
Rep. Ann McLane Kuster: There were times early on where we had to take difficult votes. (LAUGH) I'm kind of embarrassed. We would run to the ladies room after the vote.
There are now calls for Biden to copy the playbook of then-candidate Donald Trump, who in May 2016 released a list of 11 people he would pick from to nominate to take the late Justice Antonin Scalia's seat.
MARGARET BRENNAN: But then, don't you bear some responsibility for the outcome if the Taliban ends up back in control and women end up losing the rights?
In New Jersey, Gov. Chris Christie was selling the same message. After leaving a meeting with Jindal, I received a press release from Christie's office touting his cooperation with the Democratic Senate leader Steve Sweeney. A tale of two cities, it read. On day three of the government shutdown, folks in Washington are reading headlines like 'W.H. Meeting With Lawmakers Goes Nowhere.' ... Meanwhile here in New Jersey, it's a much different story.
8:11 p.m. The first lady's office says: Mrs. Trump is honoring her guests for the true heroes they are. In addition to holding a White House reception and photo opportunity for them, along with their friends and family, she accompanied them to the Capitol. The First Lady and Mrs. Pence are now hosting a more intimate meet-and-greet to engage with them on a personal level before the speech.
And just as I promised the American people from this podium 11 months ago, we enacted the biggest tax cuts and reforms in American history, Mr. Trump said. Our massive tax cuts provide tremendous relief for the middle class and small businesses. A typical family of four making $75,000 will see their tax bill reduced by $2,000 -- slashing their tax bill in half. This April will be the last time you ever file under the old broken system -- and millions of Americans will have more take-home pay starting next month.
And as always, we'll turn to our panel for some perspective on the week that was:
He often called for improvements to the Affordable Care Act, President Obama's signature domestic policy achievement. During and after his senate campaign, O'Rourke made immigration a central issue. He has routinely denounced the White House for its hardline immigration agenda, including the discontinued zero tolerance policy that led to the separation of thousands of migrant families near the U.S.-Mexico border. He also strongly supports legislation to put young undocumented immigrants, known as DREAMers, on a pathway to U.S. citizenship. During a fiery speech in El Paso last month where he drew sharp contrasts with President Trump's stringent policies and tough rhetoric on immigration, O'Rourke condemned Mr. Turmp's long-promised wall along the southwestern border. We know that walls do not save lives. Walls end lives, he said in a border rally that competed with one of Mr. Trump's nearby rallies. In the last 10 years, more than 4,000 children women and men have died trying to come to this country to work jobs that no one will take, to be with a family member, to flee horrific violence, brutality and death. Controversy In addition to the scrutiny O'Rourke will likely face for launching a presidential campaign a few months after losing a Senate race, the Texas Democrat can expect to be questioned by political rivals about his tenure in Congress and personal life. Although he had a generally liberal voting record in Congress, O'Rourke's progressive bona fides may come under scrutiny from the left.
President Trump told reporters today he continues to keep his distance from the Vice President after his press secretary, Katie Miller, tested positive for the virus last week. I haven't seen Mike Pence and I miss him, Trump quipped, adding that the two speak on the phone often. I guess we said for a little while we'll stay apart because you don't know what happens with this crazy, horrible disease, the president added, referring to the COVID-19 outbreak.
The four pillars of the plan:
Rep. Steven Cohen, D-Tenn., characterized Wednesday's meeting as a pretty frank and forthright discussion of the political fallout of the 'if you like your health care, you can keep it' statement.'
Lesley Stahl: But you're, but you're basically saying you have to rely on them, even though you want to get rid of them?
If governors continue to limit the size of gatherings, including religious services, what further action is the Justice Department prepared to take?
Despite building anticipation, neither candidate has hinted whether they'll throw the first political punch.
Interviews were conducted in English and Spanish using live interviewers. The data have been weighted to reflect U.S. Census figures on demographic variables.
SUSAN PAGE: You know when President Obama was very unpopular to midterm he started to stay out of the news. When President George W. Bush was unpopular to midterm, he tried to stay away. President Trump is as unpopular as they were and he is pushing himself out there in a way we've never seen a President for a midterm election. For a President who's been four or five days a week doing rallies around the country it makes it impossible for this election not to be about him.
Tuesday night could have gone very differently, and Republicans knew it. In the past few days, names like Christine O'Donnell (Not a witch), Todd Akin (legitimate rape) and Sharron Angle (Second Amendment remedies) have been popping up in conservative conversations. They're all Republican candidates who won primaries in 2010 but, due to their weaknesses or perceived extremism, lost otherwise winnable Senate seats in Delaware, Missouri and Nevada.
SENATOR BEN SASSE: That's a huge part of it. It turns out if you go from two hundred to five hundred social media friends or five hundred to a thousand, you don't get happier. But if you know the neighbor who lives two doors away from you, statistically you're more likely to be happy. We need to attend to those kind of things. It's a big deal.
Maryland, New York and Utah each have one Senate primary election on Tuesday. In Maryland, incumbent Sen. Ben Cardin faces a primary challenge from seven Democrats, including Chelsea Manning, the transgender soldier who was convicted of giving classified information to WikiLeaks. In New York, incumbent Democratic Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, a potential 2020 presidential hopeful, has no primary challenge and is expected to easily win re-election in the fall. In Utah, Mitt Romney is expected to win the Republican nomination.
We also have to recognize that states like Massachusetts, Connecticut, New Jersey and New York – states right on our borders and just a few hours away – are still confronting massive outbreaks and it only takes one spark, or one unhelpful decision, to reignite this fire. We all need to continue to be smart, cautious and disciplined to preserve our hard-earned gains, Vermont Governor Phil Scott said Friday, reports CBS News political unit broadcast associate Aaron Navarro.
We're going to take a quick break. Stay with us. And we'll be back with more.
Despite being the right-hand man to current Governor Phil Bryant, who is very popular in the state, Reeves struggled to win the Republican nomination. He was unable to get the GOP nod outright in May, and only secured the nomination after a run-off in August.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, let me ask you about those essential workers. You have about fifty percent of your schools already in person, face-to-face instruction. Should teachers be pushed to the front of the line as essential workers? I asked the-- Cedric Richmond from the White House that he didn't want to stipulate that they should be prioritized. Will you prioritize teachers in your state?
Barrett's appointment to the high court will widen its conservative majority to 6-3. Before she was appointed to the 7th Circuit by Mr. Trump in 2017, she served as a law professor at Notre Dame Law School for 15 years.
Other short-term plans may limit coverage even more. Some may not cover hospitalization, for example, or if they do, they may only pay $100 per day for 10 days, far less than an actual hospitalization would likely cost. Or, buried in the policy may be exemptions for other coverage, such as any injury sustained while the policy holder is intoxicated or injuries sustained while playing organized sports, according to health advocacy group Families USA. Deductibles and other out-of-pocket costs can also be higher in short-term plans than policies found on the individual market.
What are the consequences for these individuals?
9:55 p.m. Donald Trump says Hillary Clinton deleted 33,000 emails after receiving a subpoena from Congress.
We all share the same home, the same heart, the same destiny, and the same great American flag.
10:06 p.m. Donald Trump claims that many people saw bombs at the apartment of the San Bernardino shooters.
JOE BIDEN: Not at all. Look, we went out and went to the committee, went to the Republican leadership and said, look, this is what we have. I didn't. But the intelligence community did. This is what we have. Why don't you join us in condemning what's happening? And the Republican leader of Senate said, no, I want no part of it--joining in what is happening. And everything that came up subsequently to that reinforced what we were saying was going on. Now, the question was, should the President have come along and said, by the way, this is happening and then it be viewed and accused of we were somehow--
President Donald Trump: No, I'm not. I mean--
I would say, as for, on the issue of health care, yes, that's what I was talking about - Obamacare, as you heard me say, he said. That's what I said. I didn't say anything different than that. That's exactly what I said.
But before that, @POTUS tried to stump me with some words in a Rose Garden freestyle--beats by the Marine band! https://t.co/92CV8LiEWG — Lin-Manuel Miranda (@Lin_Manuel) March 15, 2016
TRUMP: It's nice to — one on three.
President Donald Trump: I don't have to discredit you.
SENATOR RICK SCOTT: Look, I-- I want to listen to everybody's ideas. I have sat down with the pharmaceutical companies, the PBMs, the insurance companies, the hospital industry, the pharmacies to ask them their ideas. I-- I think the best way of doing this is discuss everybody's ideas and see what we can do.
The GOP's failure to repeal Obamacare, however, isn't due to lack of trying: Congressional Republicans have held over 50 votes in an attempt to roll back the president's healthcare law.
The problem has also seriously alarmed Democrats in Congress. In recent days, six Democrats in the Senate -- five of whom are up for re-election next year -- joined onto a bill that would have made the same policy changes to Obamacare that Mr. Obama announced Thursday. One of those Democrats, however -- Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va. -- said the problems with Obamacare extend beyond enrollment issues.
His campaign exceeded expectations and won a number of major contests against eventual Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. Since the 2016 campaign, some of Sanders' more radical ideas have been embraced by many in the mainstream of the Democratic Party, such as his Medicare-for-All proposal. Issues Sanders describes himself as a democratic socialist, and his defining issue is economic inequality. Sanders spent much of his presidential campaign railing against millionaires and billionaires who continue to profit as the inequality gap increases. Sanders is a longtime supporter of a universal health care system, and introduced the Medicare-for-All bill with 15 other senators in 2017. He also supports raising the minimum wage and making public colleges and universities tuition-free. Sanders is a longtime opponent of trade deals, claiming that they hurt they American worker. He opposed NAFTA and the Trans Pacific Partnership, trade deals which President Trump renegotiated or withdrew from. Sanders opposed the U.S. war in Iraq, and remains a critic of American military interventionism. Controversy More than two dozen of Sanders' 2016 campaign staffers wrote a letter to the senator at the end of December seeking a meeting to discuss problems of sexual harassment during the campaign. A New York Times story in early January reported several incidences of sexual misconduct by staffers during the campaign, for which Sanders apologized. Politico also reported in early January that his former Iowa campaign manager, Robert Becker, had been named in a $30,000 federal discrimination settlement with two former employees.
The plaintiffs contend that the whole law was made unconstitutional by congressional repeal of the fines on the uninsured. A federal district court judge agreed, and that ruling is on appeal. The Justice Department has said in connection with the case that it will no longer defend the law's protections for people with pre-existing conditions.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION. Last week, President Trump's former personal attorney Michael Cohen was sentenced to three years in prison. Joining us now is his former attorney Lanny Davis who now because of the sentencing is no longer serving as attorney but as a friend as a spokesperson and counselor.
There's no point in pushing a panic button, he said. The court system takes a long time to resolve these issues.
RADDATZ: I'm going to let you talk about e-mails.
MARGARET BRENNAN: --said this morning you're not getting the border wall in any form.
With no tax penalty now in effect, the Texas lawsuit argues, the individual mandate is unconstitutional and the entire law must fall without it.
SUSAN PAGE: You know, we obsess about the 2020 Democratic presidential lineup, but if you want to look a little farther down the road for Republicans, I think you'd have to include Nikki Haley on that list, which is a-- a remarkable thing for a minority woman to win election as governor in South Carolina and then win re-election and then criticized President Trump as a candidate and then turn around and become one of his most prominent spokespersons on foreign policy is-- shows a remarkable nimbleness and political skill. And she emerges from this, as you say, enhanced and can you think of another example of someone who has come into the administration, served the President, had the President praise her and emerge without criticism really even from those predecessors.
As healthcare continues to surface as one of the top issues on voters' minds in South Carolina, non-profit organization Medicare for ALL NOW! has launched five new digital ads promoting M4A. The ads are the first phase of a planned six-figure campaign aimed at pitching South Carolina voters on Medicare for All, while advocating for a single-payer health care system across the country. The Philadelphia-based group has hired 20 South Carolinians to begin mobilizing volunteers on the ground in five counties throughout the state.
Bill Whitaker: How do you feel about that?
The administration's decision angered top Democrats, including 2020 Democratic frontrunner Joe Biden and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who say there is a need to create a special sign-up window for Americans during the global coronavirus pandemic.
One featured a picture of a baby and promoted Bevin as America's Most Pro-Life Governor. The other featured a picture of the governor and Mr. Trump on the staircase of Air Force One and a caption, A terrific man. And a terrific Governor. - President Donald Trump.
The Supreme Court rejected the fast-track request last month, reducing the chances that the justices will decide the case before the 2020 presidential election.
As part of its mission to get people to the polls, PTP is investing more than $52 million to knock on more than 10 million doors and get out the vote in 17 presidential and Senate battleground states. And despite the coronavirus' has people homebound for now, that plan has not changed.
Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez introduces 2020 policy test with Green New Deal Some candidness may also follow the lead of O'Rourke previous political opponents and raise the issue of his arrest in the 1990s. In 1998, he was arrested for driving while intoxicated, but the charges were dismissed after he participated in a DWI program the following year. O'Rourke has apologized for the incident, but he was criticized last year for claiming he did not try to leave the scene after hitting a truck and the Houston Chronicle reporting that witnesses told police he had attempted to leave the scene. What Trump says Mr. Trump has repeatedly mocked the speculation around an O'Rourke presidential campaign to challenge him in 2020, pointing to the Texas Democrat's unsuccessful Senate bid. I thought you were supposed to win before you run for president, Mr. Trump told reporters in December. When the two men held dueling rallies to tout completely different immigration agendas last month, the president bragged his event drew a larger crowd and ridiculed O'Rourke's great defeat in November.
Health care is polling as one of the main issues concerning voters this election cycle, and Senate and House Democrats running for re-election are emphasizing their commitment to supporting coverage of patients with pre-existing conditions in their ads. Earlier this week, Sen. Joe Manchin, D-West Virginia, released an ad that depicts him firing a shotgun at the GOP attorneys' general lawsuit signed by his opponent, West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey. Their lawsuit aims to dismantle the ACA.
Similarly, other Senate Democrats are hoping this will be a winning message for them this fall. North Dakota's incumbent Democratic Sen. Heidi Heitkamp, who is also up for re-election in a state that Trump won in 2016, released her own television ad on pre-existing conditions last week as well, reminding voters that as a breast cancer survivor, she also has a pre-existing condition.
Unfortunately, the way the judge ruled prevents an immediate appeal of his ruling, Sheehan added in her statement. In response, Secretary LaRose has called upon the judge to allow his ruling to be appealed today. He should immediately rule on the pending injunction of the Secretary's Directive and conclude the entire case to allow an appeal. Doing so will best serve Ohio's voters this fall.
While we're making sure voters will be able to safely vote in-person, this incredible demand for absentee voting speaks to the confidence Ohioans have in the system, LaRose said in a statement. It's strong. It's secure. And our county boards of elections are prepared.
Trump touts incredible progress in first year
ROBERT O'BRIEN: --to paper ballots to make sure that-- that, you know, governments with ill intent can't hack secretary of state websites, can't get involved in our elections, change results.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. How many children do you expect to be in the classroom tomorrow?
Teaching is more than a job to me. Like all of you, it is a calling, Biden said. CBS News campaign reporter Jack Turman says Biden added that if elected, educators will have a president who will listen to input from local officials and educators. Joe knows that the best policies don't come from politics, Biden said. They come from educators, parents and students and Joe is going to listen.
Dozens of Trump campaign staffers who worked the president's rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, Saturday will quarantine this week after interacting with at least 8 advanced staff testing positive for COVID-19. As a precaution staff who made the trip to Tulsa are working remotely, and they will be tested and return working to the office after that, said Tim Murtaugh, communications director for the Trump campaign, in a call with reporters. CBS News has learned the Trump campaign chartered a plane for lawmakers, campaign advisors and surrogates ahead of Saturday's rally. Not every surrogate or lawmaker wore a mask on the plane, though they were made available, according to multiple Republican officials. Campaign officials received a COVID test before entering the arena in Tulsa.

Fallin said that Trump will bring an end to divided communities across the U.S. and improve the economy.
Wisconsin Governor Tony Evers announced loosened restrictions on nonessential businesses in the state to allow for curbside drop-off of goods and animals. CBS News campaign reporter Adam Brewster says that would allow businesses such as dog groomers and small engine repair shops to reopen. Those businesses need to ensure staffing can be limited to one person in a room or confined space at a time and services need to be paid for ahead of time online or over the phone. The order also allows people to rent recreational outdoor equipment such as boats, kayaks and canoes. The same staffing and payment restrictions are in place and rented equipment must be cleaned after each use. Automatic and self-service car washes are also able to open. The new order takes effect on Wednesday and builds upon an order last week that allowed nonessential businesses to offer curbside pick-up. This order means that every business across our state can do things like deliveries, mailings, curbside pick-up and drop-off, and it's an important step in making sure that while folks are staying safer at home, they can also continue to support small businesses across our state, Evers said in a statement.
By that point, the line Mr. Vice President, I'm speaking, was being turned into memes and gifs and I'm speaking was trending on Twitter.
TRUMP: OK. He and I haven't spoken, and I disagree. I disagree.
Now, Democrats are trying to make good on their taunts. They're trying to use the vote as campaign weapon, hammering Republicans for voting to replace a popular statute with a bill Congress' own budget experts said would have driven up premiums and the ranks of the uninsured.
In Nevada, CBS News campaign reporter Alex Tin reports the former vice president has tapped two top staffers from the state Democratic party to head his general election campaign. Alana Mounce, formerly the party's executive director, will serve the campaign as state director. Shelby Wiltz, who helmed the last-minute shift over the first in the West caucus plans in February, will return to head Democrats' coordinated campaign in the state. Much of Biden's organizing team in Nevada, where the former vice president lost to Bernie Sanders by more than 20 points, have since parted ways with the presidential bid. The campaign declined to identify how many of their former Nevada staffers would be offered an opportunity to return to Biden's general election team, if any.
I can't do anything about the swamp that the president is trying to clean up in Washington with all that bickering and things going on. But I can drain the swamp here that Tate Reeves has created, he said at a Tupelo press conference ahead of the president's visit.

In Minnesota's very competitive 2nd District in the suburbs of Minneapolis and St. Paul, incumbent Republican Rep. Jason Lewis is facing a slew of controversy over comments he made on a radio show he hosted prior to serving in Congress, including complaining that women could no longer be called sluts and equating gay marriage to rape. Lewis also wrote a book in which he calls for any state to be able to peaceably leave the union, and equated slavery with taxing rich people. Lewis won the district in 2016 with 47 percent, beating Democrat Angie Craig by less than two percent. They will face off again in the fall. Some, but not all, of his controversial comments were public during the last race and Democrats attempted to use them against him at the time.
Today, we live in a time of threats like few others in recent memory. During anxious times, it can be tempting to follow the siren call of the angriest voices. We must resist that temptation, Haley said. No one who is willing to work hard, abide by our laws, and love our traditions should ever feel unwelcome in this country.
I have a very positive and optimistic view about what we can do together. That's why the slogan of my campaign is Stronger Together, because I think if we work together, if we overcome the divisiveness that sometimes sets Americans against one another, and instead we make some big goals — and I've set forth some big goals, getting the economy to work for everyone, not just those at the top, making sure that we have the best education system from preschool through college and making it affordable, and so much else.

Just the same, the Campaign for Accountability, which bills itself as an ethics watchdog group, has asked a federal court to unseal Puzder's divorce records.
However, as he discussed last night – and I think a lot of people missed this point – he talked about a public-private partnership, and if they're talking about leveraging private funds as a significant portion of that trillion dollars over a 10- or five-year period, I think that is very doable within the context of everything else, Rubio said.
I would defund it because of the abortion factor, which they say is 3 percent. I don't know what percentage it is. They say it's 3 percent. But I would defund it, because I'm pro-life, Mr. Trump said in a February 2016 GOP debate in Houston.

Mr. Trump nominated Barrett, a judge on the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, to replace the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg on the Supreme Court on Saturday, just over a week after the pioneering justice died from complications of metastatic pancreatic cancer. Immediately following news of Ginsburg's death, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell pledged the president's yet-to-be-named nominee would receive a vote on the Senate floor, and the president urged the upper chamber to take up the confirmation before the November 3 general election.

Randy Weston Cheung Ming/Verve Records Growing up, Randy Weston (April 6, 1926-September 1, 2018) was exposed to all genres of music by his parents – everything from jazz, gospel and calypso to classical and opera. Returning home from World War II, the Army vet worked at his father's Caribbean-style restaurant, Trios, in Brooklyn. There he befriended such music greats as Louis Armstrong, Ella Fitzgerald, Dizzy Gillespie, and Igor Stravinsky. He would eventually become a musician and composer whose work fused American jazz and blues with African rhythms, melding such influences as Max Roach, Count Basie, Art Tatum, Thelonious Monk and Duke Ellington. His first album, in 1954, reinterpreted Cole Porter standards, and he would collaborate with poet Langston Hughes on Uhuru Afrika. His subsequent releases showed an increasing reliance on the music of Africa, and he traveled extensively on the continent, exploring his musical roots. A tour for the State Department in the 1960s landed him in Morocco, where he settled for five years, running the African Rhythms Club in Tangiers. Over the years Weston would record 50 albums, including 1992's The Spirit of Our Ancestors. Play Excerpt: African Village Bedford Stuyvesant 1 by Randy Weston In 2014 Weston told the Telegraph newspaper, The great thing about African music is it's not music for the young, or the old, it's music for everybody.

Tommy McDonald AP Photo NFL Hall of Famer Tommy McDonald (July 26, 1934-September 24, 2018) was a two-time All-American from Oklahoma who played 12 NFL seasons for five teams and was a six-time Pro Bowl selection. Amid rumblings that the 5-foot-7, 175-pound McDonald was too small to play in the NFL, the Eagles drafted him in the third round in 1957. The small, speedy and sure-handed receiver teamed with quarterback Norm Van Brocklin to help the Philadelphia Eagles win the NFL championship three years later. When he retired in 1968, he ranked second in league history in touchdown catches, fourth in yards receiving, and sixth in receptions. But McDonald had to wait 30 years before becoming the smallest player inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame. Oh, baby! McDonald shouted in Canton, Ohio on Aug. 1, 1998. His induction speech was equal parts hysterics and histrionics, as McDonald told jokes and tossed his 25-pound bronze bust in the air. He even pulled out a radio and danced to disco music, all on the steps of the hallowed hall. Do I look excited, like I just won the lottery or the jackpot? Yes! I'm in the Hall of Fame!
Lesley Stahl: I know, but a special prosecutor? You think you might…
In recent months, protesters have become a mainstay of Trump rallies and how the campaign handles them has evolved. At a rally in Raleigh, North Carolina - when Trump's speech was interrupted at least ten times, he expressed irritation with his staff for not removing them quickly enough. Sometimes he is aggressive with protesters - pointing at the exit and yelling Get 'em out! In Burlington, Vermont, Trump said that one protester's coat should be confiscated. Audience members can be aggressive with protesters as well, sometimes caught on video kicking and spitting on them.
SEN. SANDERS: We are going to do-- yes.

At the statewide level, the former Democratic presidential candidate endorsed candidates running for seats that Democrats hope to flip. They include: South Carolina Democratic Senate candidate Jaime Harrison, North Carolina Democratic Senate candidate Cal Cunningham and Gina Ortiz Jones, who is running in Texas' 23rd Congressional District. Buttigieg also endorsed former supporters of his presidential campaign, including Maryland Congressman Anthony Brown, Virginia Congressman Don Beyer and New Hampshire Congresswoman Annie Kuster.
Hood was seen as a formidable Democratic candidate for the state. The four-term attorney general won every county in the state in the primary and won by wide margins in previous state elections despite Mississippi's pronounced conservative lean. He even borrowed Mr. Trump's drain the swamp messaging to use against Reeves.
PAUL RYAN: You can ask the OMB director that in a minute because I know you have him coming on. But--
ANTHONY SALVANTO: Yeah. The Republicans have become more enthusiastic over the last couple of weeks. That's important for them, right? They want to get that base turnout and we think that helps move that. But, at the same time, the vote intention of both parties is up and it is even. It is even between Democrats and Republicans saying that they are showing up.
He has, however, made significant dents in the law's potency through executive action.
Price was forced out in the fall of 2017 after his travel drew the ire of President Trump, who was also upset over the GOP failure to repeal Obamacare.
While campaigning in Warren, Michigan, Democratic nominee Joe Biden took aim at President Trump's comments to Woodward, according to CBS News reporter Adam Brewster.
MARGARET BRENNAN: But it could if the Supreme Court upholds this ruling.
Young, healthy workers may be making a trade-off between the cost of buying insurance versus taking the risk of remaining uninsured and paying a fine come tax time. The average penalty for foregoing insurance in 2016 will be about $969, while the typical cost to insure a single 25-year-old making the median household income of $54,000 under a silver plan would be about $2,800, according to Kaiser.

DR. VANESSA TYSON: --I'd want him to resign. There were two main reasons why I came forward, right. There's a million reasons not to come forward, right. It's tough. I'm not going to lie. But, you know, I look at my beautiful students. I have the most wonderful kids. They're brilliant and thoughtful and kind and passionate, and they want to make the world a better place. And I teach politics, and then they want to get involved, and all I can think of is that I don't want this to ever, ever, ever happen to them. And then the second thing that I think is that the Virginia people need to know who it is that they elected. They need to know. I think the Virginia people, the voters of Virginia have a right to know, you know, both my story and Meredith's story, right. I think there should be a public hearing. I think that--
No. Okay. A lot of records have come to light. You talk about the records for closing the Flynn case. Were those new records to you? Because--
FACT CHECK: Mostly true. Bill Clinton was impeached by the House of Representatives in 1998 on perjury and obstruction of justice charges stemming from his affair with White House intern Monica Lewinsky and his testimony about it in the course of a sexual harassment lawsuit filed by Paula Jones.
A Massachusetts native, Hardiman settled in Pittsburgh, where his wife comes from a family of prominent Democrats. In 2017 SCOTUSBlog, a blog that closely follows the Supreme Court, described Hardiman as a solid, although hardly knee-jerk, conservative with a consistently conservative voting record.
CLINTON: No, I wasn't. I was gone. I hate to interrupt you, but at some point...
Still most of the women reiterated that the ultimate goal for black women has been the same since the beginning of the primary: defeating President Trump. Regardless of who Vice President Biden chooses as his running mate, I'm going to be out there making sure that we get out the vote, said Georgia Democratic Party Chair Nikema Williams, who is also a Georgia state senator. But I think at some point we want to see ourselves reflected in the leadership that we're voting for.
Hood supported using federal funds to expand healthcare in Mississippi, which is one of 14 states that didn't expand Medicaid in 2010. Reeves labeled it Obamacare expansion and said there would be a cost to taxpayers.
A federal judge restored the New York Democratic presidential primary, ruling Tuesday that its cancellation by the New York State Board of Elections last month was unconstitutional. CBS News campaign reporter Nicole Sganga and political unit associate producer Eleanor Watson report the order from U.S. District Judge Analisa Torres returns all qualifying presidential candidates — including Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders — to the primary ballot and mandates that the election must take place June 23, as previously scheduled.
TRUMP STATEMENT: We are going to areas like Syria, where they're coming in by the tens of thousands.
WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump's long-promised plan to bring down drug prices would mostly spare the pharmaceutical industry he previously accused of getting away with murder. Instead he focuses on private competition and more openness to reduce America's prescription pain.
With little more than a week till the election, the president has been barnstorming the swing states where the polls are tight, including Florida, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and in Michigan.
Remember, this crop of people was viewed as incredibly independent from the Democratic party, former DCCC Executive Director Dan Sera said about the freshman House Democrat class. I think there are places where you have to ask, what else is going on politically? Read the full story here.
Most Republicans and Democrats see both self-reliance and taking care of others as important parts of the American way of life, though Republicans are more likely to cite the former and Democrats, the latter. There are sharper differences on showing respect for authority (which 88 percent of Republicans call very important), and preserving the cultural heritage of America's founders (which 77 percent of Republicans call important) while Democrats are more likely to cite welcoming and accepting people of different cultures (81 percent), and the ability of people to protest authority (75 percent) are important.
MARGARET BRENNAN: --you're a key voice on, and that is immigration and also want to talk about the possible shutdown here. One very particular case here, this seven year old migrant girl who passed away. She was a migrant from Guatemala named Jakelin Caal. She died some hours after passing into U.S. territory while she was under the protection of Customs and Border Patrol. Who bears responsibility for her death?
Now, the campaign has taken a different tack, with an announcement before the speech beseeching supporters to not harm protesters and to chant Trump's name instead. Trump often jokes that he stages the protesters so he can get the cameras to show his crowd sizes.
Clinton did not bring up the Obamacare rate hikes Tuesday but she was asked about them in a Miami radio interview, giving vague assurances that she would fix things.
Lesley Stahl: Okay. Let me-- let me ask you something about suburban women.
Woman accused of choking girl for blocking view of fireworks
SENATOR RICK SCOTT: --I want to focus on driving down costs.
5:40 p.m. ET Melania Trump, Trump's third wife, is a former model who Trump has previously called a very beautiful woman. But back in 1999, Trump believed that it could be a negative in the world of politics to have a beautiful woman by your side.
That didn't happen. Is it really the case that there is no way to resolve those differences? Roberts asked at one point.
Yet there is also a sense among the Republican faithful that Trump, despite his low approval ratings, will somehow bail Republicans out in November. Over at The Daily Caller, for example, my friend Chris Bedford has written a variation on this argument, saying it's preposterous that Democrats can replicate Lamb's success nationally.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, she says she's coming forth now because she thinks it's disqualifying for Joe Biden. Do you think it's disqualifying?
The federal health care exchanges are so far falling short of signing up young (and presumably healthier) workers, which may portend trouble ahead for plans sold through the Affordable Care Act. When the law was created, actuaries estimated that 40 percent of the Obamacare plans would need to be sold to people between 18 to 34 years old in order to offset higher costs tied to older (and presumably sicker) workers.
We saw strangers shielding strangers from a hail of gunfire on the Las Vegas strip.
CLINTON: ... you may not be able to have insurance because you can't afford it. So let's fix what's broken about it, but let's not throw it away and give it all back to the insurance companies and the drug companies. That's not going to work.
Cindy McCain: Yes. He is that tough.
SEN. SANDERS: I have no reason not to believe Lucy. And- and I think what this speaks to is the need to fundamentally change the culture of this country and to create environments where women feel comfortable and feel safe. And that's something we have got to do.
MCGAHN: And she just got nominated for the Supreme Court.
The bill would, among other things, repeal the individual and employer mandates put in place by Obamacare that has required people to carry insurance or face a tax penalty, it would provide refundable tax credits to help people afford coverage, expand health savings accounts and phase out an expansion of Medicaid.
MAYOR FRANCIS SUAREZ: Again, you know, we-- we only control the ones that we give. We started doing it about a week ago at Marlins Park, and I can assure you that the ones that we're doing are-- are for the general public they're-- it's a state registration system, but it's possible that people are getting preferential treatment at hospitals. And that's something that, frankly, needs to stop immediately. We've been focusing on our minority communities, our underserved communities, to make sure that there's an equitable distribution of the vaccine to those that are vulnerable and that need it most.
Catholic Social Services is one of 30 agencies in Philadelphia that provides services for foster parents and children, but in early 2018, the city cut off foster care referrals to the agency after learning it did not work with same-sex couples because of its religious objections to gay marriage.
According to Leader, Turnout is everything. And it's especially everything in those all-important battleground states, where it does often come down to just a few thousand votes.
Both Karen Watkins and Patsy Crawford, living in Ohio suburbs, came to the U.S. as children. Crawford, a Brazilian immigrant, supports the president's wall: I'm all about doing it the right way. I mean, we had to follow the laws and go through the naturalization process.
Arizona is one of the battlegrounds the Trump campaign is focusing heavily on. Second Lady Karen Pence is in the state for the latest in a flurry of Trump administration and campaign visits this week, kicked off by a visit by Mr. Trump on Monday, reports CBS News campaign reporter Alex Tin. We just came from the Latinos for Trump headquarters, a place that was buzzing with energy, Arizona's Governor Doug Ducey said Wednesday at a roundtable with Ivanka Trump. We had the president of the United States in on Monday. We've got Ivanka in on Wednesday. We've got the second lady tomorrow and Vice President Pence on Friday. There couldn't be a better way to kick off Hispanic heritage month. The president's campaign has aggressively traveled to Arizona even at the height of the pandemic, a state that the Cook Political Report concluded Thursday was slipping away from Trump after decades of reliably supporting GOP presidential candidates. Meanwhile, Biden has yet to visit the state this year. In late August, Biden had first floated plans to return to in-person campaigning amid the pandemic with stops in Wisconsin, Minnesota, Pennsylvania and Arizona. After stops in the other three states, Biden and his running mate have yet to disclose any plans to visit the state in person.
On the impact of the American Rescue Plan for smaller cities : What's great about this funding is every effort every city gets its money, regardless of how small they are, and smaller communities have a harder time with COVID because it's not like they have a place that they can really cushion. The smaller the community, the less rainy day fund you have. — Mayor Nan Whaley of Dayton, Ohio
TRUMP: Excuse me. She just went about 25 seconds over her time.
Something's got to give, she said by email Credit will begin to tighten up soon.
I guess in a way, you could say I'm sticking up for him, Trump told listeners, in his lengthiest comments yet about the accusation, which Biden addressed directly Friday for the first time, unequivocally denying Reade's claim.
PAUL RYAN: Donald Trump didn't shut down the government. Senate Democr-- why- why did they call this the Schumer Shutdown? Because Senate Democrats shut down the government so--
With so many unanswered questions about the law, it is hard to understand how or why Congress would approve such a request, Camp said Wednesday.
Yet after launching his campaign to win a third term as Minnesota's governor earlier this year, Pawlenty said he did indeed vote for Donald Trump in 2016. And despite his past criticism of Mr. Trump, now Pawlenty and his primary challenger, former member of the Minnesota House Jeff Johnson, are trying to out-Trump each other. Both Pawlenty and Johnson said they would welcome an endorsement from Mr. Trump and the race has been described as a test of who can be more conservative and embrace Trump's policies the most.
The plaintiffs also argued that the individual mandate is so essential to the entire law, so that if it's unconstitutional, the rest of the law must also be thrown out. Judge O'Connor agreed on that point, too. The case now will likely go to the Supreme Court. If it goes to the Supreme Court, the five justices who voted to uphold the ACA still sit on the Supreme Court.
SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: Well, what we've said from the beginning is this is a very tough political map for Senate Democrats. Probably the toughest we've seen in sixty years. The fact that people were talking about Democrats taking back a majority of the Senate, shows how strong we have been and what kind of momentum we got. So I have said from day one, that we have a credible path to a Democratic Senate majority. It is a narrow path. And there are so many very tight seats that this is all about turnout at this point.
The study found that lower-income people, older adults, and people living in high-cost areas would get lower subsidies. I'm worried that this is going to result in folks losing coverage, said John Meigs, president of the American Academy of Family Physicians.
Trump was joined by several family members on the stage, including wife Melania Trump.
As you recall, in January, General Flynn moved to withdraw his plea, and also alleged misconduct by the government. And at that time, I asked a very seasoned U.S. attorney, who had spent ten years as an FBI agent and ten years as a career prosecutor, Jeff Jensen, from St. Louis, to come in and take a fresh look at this whole case. And he found some additional material. And last week, he came in and briefed me and made a recommendation that we dismiss the case, which I fully agreed with, as did the U.S. attorney in D.C. So we've moved to dismiss the case.
That is what our country has always been about. That is what Americans have always stood for, always strived for, and always done.
What we discovered in Mr. Trump's first television interview as president-elect, was that some of his signature issues at the heart of his campaign were not meant to be taken literally, but as opening bids for negotiation.
JAMELLE BOUIE: --in certain states. And if there's an issue that's going to alienate those people from your party, it is saying I'm going to take away your Medicaid. I'm going to take away whatever benefits you get from the Affordable Care Act. And it-- it-- it really is astounding-- an astoundingly bad idea to make the centerpiece of your message, we're going to go with this again, when last time you went at it in August 2017, President Trump's average approval rating dipped to about thirty-six percent. The last time he went after health care like this.
Bill Whitaker: And they turn to you.
4:13 p.m. ET With Trump taking the stage in Cleveland tonight, the pro-Clinton super PAC Priorities USA is coming out with a new digital ad that is a reference to Hillary Clinton's 2008 3 a.m. ad. The ad will begin airing digitally after the conventions.
They want to know what he'll do but he doesn't tell them to do anything -- he usually tells them 'you do it yourselves,' and then we get paralysis.

Lesley Stahl: What did he say?
Marco Rubio: We Should Obstruct Democrats' Agenda
LANNY DAVIS: Again, I can't tell you. I'll wait for Mister Mueller to tell you, but just think about it. He publishes ahead of time, which Mister Mueller criticized him for, his testimony that was a lie about the Moscow Trump Tower. He calls the White House and the President knows from the published testimony that he's about to lie. Not one person from the White House, I can tell you this, ever said, Don't lie.
MARGARET BRENNAN: That's it for us today. Thank you for watching. Until next week, for FACE THE NATION, I'm Margaret Brennan.
Following four days of confirmation hearings earlier this month, the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday voted to send Barrett's nomination to the full Senate for a vote. All Republicans on the 22-member panel voted to advance the nomination, while the committee's 10 Democrats boycotted the vote.
JOHN DICKERSON: We care about this--
Lesley Stahl: Are you going to sometimes have that same rhetoric that you had on the stump? Or are you going to reign it in?
But Obama's deficits came as the U.S. economy recovered from the deep recession of 2007-2009. The return of trillion-dollar deficit now comes amid stronger economic growth, with the CBO predicting that the jobless rate nationwide will average below 4 percent through at least 2022. The growth rate is predicted to hit average 2.2 percent this year.
The whole pattern of conduct before?
MCGAHN: He was very transparent on it. It really helped in the 2016 election. And there's been an intervening election and two Supreme Court nominees and confirmations and those who supported Trump's judicial nominations did pretty well on re-election.
Oklahomans will vote on the legalization of medicinal marijuana on Tuesday.
When did you first learn that Hillary Clinton used an email system outside the U.S. government for official business while she was Secretary of State? Plante asked the president in a sit-down interview last year.
Barrett has been critical of Roberts' majority opinion in 2012, which Democrats point to as evidence she would vote to strike down the health care law.
He also penned an op-ed in Sunday's Salt Lake Tribune threading the needle on his support of Mr. Trump and his policies, writing that he will support the president's policies when I believe they are in the best interest of Utah and the nation, but adding, I have and will continue to speak out when the president says or does something which is divisive, racist, sexist, anti-immigrant, dishonest or destructive to democratic institutions. I do not make this a daily commentary; I express contrary views only when I believe it is a matter of substantial significance.
Robertson said that Trump will have your back.
Since then, pessimism has reigned. The stretch of Mr. Trump's presidency in which Americans were feeling best about the direction of the country came towards the end of March – in the RealClearPolitics average, on March 21, nearly 39 percent of voters said the country is on the right track, while over 51 percent said it's headed in the wrong direction.
Independents, Democrats, libertarians, vegetarians, come on over! Vote for me! he said during the 2000 presidential race.
No party was spared. Donald Trump earned the most Pinocchios. In fact, Kessler wrote, Frankly, it's really not interesting to fact check the Donald, as his assertions are so easily debunked.

Two former GOP presidential candidates seek their third terms as governor
Sure. I think it's about representing the people of your state, so you've got to be willing to cross party lines, Hawley said. You've got to be willing to be independent. I'll work with anybody on any topic if it's good for the people of my state.
Yaros says Biden is likely to succeed in reversing Trump's tax cuts, raising the corporate income tax rate to 28%, increasing the tax rate for taxable incomes of more than $400,000 and eliminating some tax breaks for those making more than $1 million.
I hear my fellow Republicans, they're wonderful people, he said. I hear their speeches. And they don't talk jobs. They don't talk China.
While our interview with the president did not go forward, the one scheduled with the vice president did.
Despite vowing to take up his campaign promise to abolish the ACA, the president now appears to be delaying those efforts until after the 2020 election. Republicans tried and failed to unite around a plan repeal and replace the law in 2017 when they controlled both chambers of Congress and the White House.
PETER DASZAK: Let history be the judge.
Because of COVID-19, workers already facing terrible health risks are also confronting increased barriers to legal representation and worried the clock will run out on seeking relief, Warren said in a statement. Our bill will make sure workers' rights aren't thrown off to the side because of a public health emergency by extending the period of time workers have to file claims.
PAUL RYAN: Yeah, yeah- they don't-- their payment gets deferred. They don't get--
MARGARET BRENNAN: Ed, I want to ask you, we saw a rare very open crack between the entirety really of the Republican Party and Democrats on Capitol Hill breaking from the President's defense of Mohammed bin Salman, the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, and having this symbolic resolution, but still a statement saying, they believe the CIA even if the President doesn't, in terms of culpability for the killing of this journalist, Jamal Khashoggi. Is this just symbolic? Does this indicate some sort of shift at all with the party?
I like what he did in Ohio, and he may not have the ground game here that he has in New Hampshire, but he has a good message, explained Bob Holzel, a 82-year-old retired New Yorker who moved to South Carolina 20 years ago. He voted for George W. Bush in the 2000 South Carolina primary, but Holzel thinks the family name now hurts Jeb Bush.
The USDS is working on modernizing medicare systems that are running on a mainframe that was 40 years old, and are currently being stressed by a surge of users amid the pandemic.
He's a budget hawk Ohio Gov. John Kasich, who is considering a r... 06:04 Kasich's reputation as a budget hawk began during his days as the House Budget Committee chairman. He rose to the position - already famous for his co-sponsoring an amendment that killed the Pentagon's request to build B-2 stealth bombers. He spent his early years in Congress writing budgets that made swift and deep cuts to the federal budget. Then-House Speaker Newt Gingrich credited him as the person most responsible for writing the 1997 Balanced Budget Act, a bipartisan agreement during the Clinton administration to balance the budget by 2002, the last time the federal budget was balanced. He brought that budget fervor to Ohio, where law requires that the state budget be balanced. Despite facing a nearly $8 billion shortfall when he took office, Kasich's first two budgets ultimately produced surpluses and helped replenish the rainy day fund. In the lead-up to his presidential campaign, he created a nonprofit group called Balanced Budget Forever to advocate for adding a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution.
In his second day of campaigning, Bloomberg said his path to the presidency begins in Arizona, a state President Trump won by about 4% in 2016.

Democratic Senator Gary Peters of Michigan put up two TV ads Wednesday morning in his campaign for reelection, reports CBS News political unit associate producer Eleanor Watson. One of the ads is about being tough on China and the other on how to help Michigan through the pandemic. The ads are the campaign's first since February before coronavirus ramped up. Outside groups as well as the campaigns of Peters and his opponent Republican John James have spent over $16 million this year in ad reservations, according to data from Kantar/CMAG.

Trump was also considering former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani for Homeland Security secretary, according to those close to the transition process. Giuliani was initially the front-runner for State and is still in the mix. But questions about his overseas business dealings, as well as the mayor's public campaigning for the job, have given Trump pause.

The ad, which is a six-figure buy running on Detroit broadcasts, concludes with Slotkin criticizing Bishop for his vote to repeal the Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare.
SEN. SANDERS: And- and by the way, when we- when we do that, what we understand is that it is just not acceptable that 30 million Americans have no health insurance. And even more are underinsured with high deductibles and high copayments.
MARGARET BRENNAN: On those particular things though, would it provide maternity care?
Trump plans to release his latest medical records on The Dr. Oz Show on Thursday.
MARGARET BRENNAN: And I think many would agree with you, I guess it's the getting to that point that's the problem. Senator Schumer says no way, no how, no wall. Period.
Speaker Nancy Pelosi: And then Boston. And then Florida. (LAUGH) And then back to California. And then back to Washington.
At least one high-profile ACA critic is casting doubt on the repeal of the mandate. Tom Price, former Department of Health and Human Services Secretary, commented at the recent World Health Care conference in Washington, D.C., that eliminating the mandate will drive up premium prices on the marketplace exchanges. Last fall the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office forecast that 13 million people would lose coverage if the mandate was eliminated.
And that's why I've tried to put forth specific policies and plans, trying to get it off of the personal and put it on to what it is I want to do as president. And that's why I hope people will check on that for themselves so that they can see that, yes, I've spent 30 years, actually maybe a little more, working to help kids and families. And I want to take all that experience to the White House and do that every single day.

In an interview with nationally syndicated conservative talk show host Michael Medved, Romney said, It would be a very different lineup than the president has assembled. His team is almost entirely void of anyone with any experience in the business sector, (who) understands how the economy works. I will assuredly have members of my team who will have experience in the real world, in the private sector. My Cabinet will not be filled with academics and politicians alone.
MAYOR SUAREZ: That's correct. That's right.
Also on Thursday Vice President Mike Pence rolled onto the stage during his visit to Ohio's Lordstown Motors plant riding in the passenger seat of a pickup truck. During his remarks, CBS News campaign reporter Musadiq Bidar reports Pence touted the administration's economic success before the coronavirus pandemic. Citing low unemployment numbers among Black and Hispanic communities, the vice president declared the American dream came roaring back under President Trump. Our economy was on a roll, Pence said while also reassuring the crowd that the recovery is on and Lordstown Motors will be a part of the great American comeback.
The law's supporters say Congress clearly didn't want Obamacare dismantled when it eliminated the tax in 2017. And they said the tax elimination doesn't destroy the whole law.

In South Carolina, incumbent Republican Senator Lindsey Graham is tied with Democrat Jaime Harrison 48% to 48% among likely voters. The Cook Political Report rates this race as leaning Republican, but Harrison's record-breaking fundraising has helped make the race more competitive than recent cycles. In South Carolina, the most important Senate race issues came down to law and order at 23% and the economy at 22%. Likely voters were also focused on the coronavirus pandemic, racial inequality and the Supreme Court.
We've been calling voters and walking them through that process, said Morgan. You know, while everybody is at home to say, 'hey, this is a really good action you can take right now to ensure you get a ballot and can cast your vote this November regardless of what happens.'
Lesley Stahl: Well, Medicare for all-- it's not only being pushed by some members of your caucus, but also some of the presidential candidates. And it is allowing the president to say you're all socialists.
Republicans, of course, view the Puzder nomination differently. Sen. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, who chairs the committee that will vet him, lauded Puzder as someone who understands how excessive regulation can destroy jobs and make it harder for family incomes to rise.

As many as 10 million people also could lose their health care coverage under a House Republican plan to repeal and replace Obamacare. That could raise out-of-pocket medical costs, making it harder for some households to stay current on their credit card bills.
Some politicians advocate offering tax credits to purchase individual health insurance or allowing citizens to put money away for insurance in health savings accounts. At best, these are band-aid solutions to America's health care challenges. They don't come close to overcoming the two health care elephants, particularly for low- and middle-income citizens.
I am finally seeking this help after struggling to do so in the past, and I am ready to admit that I, like countless other Americans, suffer from this disease. Hard work and determination — which have brought me success in life — have not been enough to win this battle. Other than being a wife, mother, and grandmother, the most important job in the world to me is representing my fellow Arizonans. I know I must get better in order to do my best in each of these roles, Kirkpatrick wrote in a statement.
Lesley Stahl: You used to have bigger rallies.
He'll call me and just sing me a Broadway tune, Cruz told supporters in New Hampshire in February.
He relied on figures and statistics to bolster his case. How accurate were those figures? Did they stretch the truth, or accurately reflect reality?
MARGARET BRENNAN: So, will the President instruct Republican governors to continue to implement the law until there is a replacement?
Mr. Trump hoped to project a sense of unity in his address before an audience of lawmakers who remain bitterly divided over issues like immigration, trade and infrastructure. He spoke for about an hour and 20 minutes, touching on subjects ranging from drug abuse and opioid addiction to North Korea and terrorism.
The Bluegrass state has a history of electing Democratic governors even as it regularly sends Republicans to Washington. In 2007, they elected Steve Beshear, who won again in 2011. Now his son, state Attorney General Andy Beshear, is looking to return the governor's mansion to Democratic hands.
I don't pretend to agree with every plank in our party's platform, Thiel said. But fake culture wars only distract us from our economic decline. And nobody in this race is being honest about it except Donald Trump.
How will red-state Senate Democrats navigate the Trump era?
Democratic Party chair Tom Perez told reporters on Wednesday that he expects health care to be a defining issue of this election. Perez continued that the chronic incompetence of this president on health care and so many issues runs far and deep. And the American people will remember. They remembered it in 2017, 2018 and 2019. When health care was on the ballot, Democrats won in scale. According to CBS News Battleground Tracker polls, health care has been the top issue of importance to likely Democratic voters in early contest states since the launch of the CBS News survey in June 2019.
Lesley Stahl: Hi, Mr. Vice President.
Scott Pelley: The president's proposed budget would have cut 16% from the budget of the Centers for Disease Control, and about 8% from the National Institutes of Health.
After the election? Okay. You talk about the importance of timing in this decision. What was the evidence that helped you decide this issue?
Chris, the media fact checkers are not fair and impartial. They are liberal editorial journalists. And they have made it their mission to defend Obamacare, Cruz responded.
He said the consequences of eligible voters staying home is profoundly dangerous to our democracy. In Nevada, early voting is already underway, he reminded voters. You don't have to wait two weeks.
The people who go to Tampa are delegates. These are not casual observers. These are people involved in the party a long time. They've watched the party, they've seen Newt's career, they know who's done what, he said. They know Mitt Romney's career, they know Rick Santorum's career they know Newt Gingrich's career. And so I think there's a very real possibility.
Lesley Stahl: But you're okay with some tough questions?
MARGARET BRENNAN: You heard me ask Larry Kudlow about Republican senators' concerns about Huawei. You are a sitting senator, would you vote to ban American companies from doing business with them?
She and other secretaries of state have been talking about best practices to implement going forward, but said the federal government should set standards for access, security and voter education.
The CBO report landed amid an intensifying presidential campaign in which concerns about the deficit are not really an issue. President Donald Trump has promised to leave Social Security pensions and Medicare benefits off the table as his administration seeks ways to blunt the political impact of the eye-popping deficit figures.

CBS News political unit associate producers Sarah Ewall-Wice and Eleanor Watson note a review of the Facebook ad library found many of the ads that Biden has aired on the social network over the past month involve healing the soul of the nation, taking on Mr. Trump, teasing his VP pick, defeating the NRA, protecting Obamacare, touting endorsements and meeting fundraising goals. The president's ads on Facebook, meanwhile, have focused on slamming Biden and Democrats, building a wall, promoting online events, selling merchandise and reaching fundraising deadlines.
SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR: Thank you, Margaret.
If he wanted to, House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, could put the Senate-passed bill on the floor that would re-open the government for a few more months without any conditions. So far, however, tea party-aligned Republicans have put more pressure on Boehner than House moderates.
While the expert debate over this hot button issue has raged for years, Pew Research Center polling suggests American public opinion has shifted greatly since the early 1990s. In a 2015 poll, 45 percent of those surveyed expressed the opinion that immigrants were a net benefit for the U.S. versus 37 percent who felt their presence had a negative impact.

1982. A 12-year-old is accused of stealing and dragged out a store, told he looks suspicious because his hands are in his pockets. I'm Raphael Warnock and that boy was me, said Warnock in the ad. Back then I didn't understand how much the system works against those without power and money, that the rules were different for some of us. Too often that's still true today, especially in Washington. I approve this message because it's time for that to change.
Mr. Trump said his health care vision will include provisions to protect those with preexisting conditions. The president said it is now the official policy of the federal government to protect preexisting conditions, and he won't sign any bill that comes to his desk that doesn't protect preexisting conditions.
The openly gay 48-year-old PayPal cofounder admitted that his views differ from those of many Republicans, who adopted a decidedly anti-LGBT platform during this convention.

JAMELLE BOUIE: I mean, it could get-- it could get very big. It's still-- it's still very early in the process. And so there is probably space-- space for someone like Stacey Abrams and, hopefully, space for other candidates. But I do think as time goes on, as there are debates, as there's more fund-raising, as all these-- as all the barriers and hurdles start coming up for progressing, I think this field will shrink considerably. The-- the fact that Beto, that Senator Sanders, that Senator Harris are the three candidates who have been able to really take in large hauls to me at least suggests that those three at least have a very durable base within the party that can expand. Everyone else--

Richard Murray has been teaching Texas politics for half a century. He took CBS News on a tour of the 7th District, which has only elected Republicans to Congress for 50 years. Now, it's a toss-up.
I am confident he can stay on message, she said.
TRUMP: And my whole concept was to make America great again. When I watch the deals being made, when I watch what's happening with some horrible things like Obamacare, where your health insurance and health care is going up by numbers that are astronomical, 68 percent, 59 percent, 71 percent, when I look at the Iran deal and how bad a deal it is for us, it's a one-sided transaction where we're giving back $150 billion to a terrorist state, really, the number one terror state, we've made them a strong country from really a very weak country just three years ago.

In 2016, we lost 64,000 Americans to drug overdoses: 174 deaths per day. Seven per hour. We must get much tougher on drug dealers and pushers if we are going to succeed in stopping this scourge, he said. My Administration is committed to fighting the drug epidemic and helping get treatment for those in need. The struggle will be long and difficult -- but, as Americans always do, we will prevail.
On legislative efforts to help Puerto Rico recover from its debt crisis, Ryan said there are technical aspects being working out with the Treasury Department on a bill that would provide for an oversight board to work on debt restructuring.

Casey Mulligan, chief economist for the White House council, said it turns out that the penalty for people going uninsured wasn't really essential for the Obama health law to function. The subsidies were more important.
A federal district judge in Texas agreed with the Republican-led states that the individual mandate is unconstitutional and struck down the entirety of Obamacare in 2018, finding it cannot survive without the mandate. But the judge's ruling was put on hold while the case moved through the courts.
So I have a comprehensive energy policy, but it really does include fighting climate change, because I think that is a serious problem. And I support moving toward more clean, renewable energy as quickly as we can, because I think we can be the 21st century clean energy superpower and create millions of new jobs and businesses.
Though both sides appear to have dug in their heels, there are signs that some Republicans are wary of the strategy. A handful of members - including four from suburban Philadelphia - have now said they would vote for an amendment-free spending bill along the lines of the one being offered by the Senate, according to a count by the Washington Post.
SENATOR MARCO RUBIO: The increases come from the developing world and in other places. But we're not a planet, we're a country. And the question becomes-- I-- I don't think in my mind anyway the debate has been necessarily about-- always about whether or not it's human contribution. It's about whether the public policies that are being advocated would be effective. And--
SENATOR BEN SASSE: Sure. I-- I think that's true. I mean the President and I wrestle on a whole bunch of issues. I-- there are things we agree on, things we disagree on. But I don't think most of what Americans are wrestling with is a problem that's two years old. I think we've had a halving of friendship in America in the last twenty-seven years. It's-- it's a stunning thing. You know nomadic tribes, agrarian history, industrial economics--people have always known their neighbors and known their co-workers. Decreasingly we don't know those things. We've gone from three and a half friends per American twenty-seven years ago to about 1.8 friends today. President Trump can't fix this. He didn't cause this. Politics can't fix this. Politics didn't cause this, but it's true that our political tribalism is filling that vacuum--
I am asking Congress to address the fundamental flaws in the terrible Iran nuclear deal.
Yeah, I'm prepared for that. I also think it's sad that nowadays these partisan feelings are so strong that people have lost any sense of justice. And the groups that usually worry about civil liberties and making sure that there's proper procedures followed and standards set seem to be ignoring it and willing to destroy people's lives and see great injustices done.
FACT CHECK: PARTIALLY TRUE, BUT INCOMPLETE METRIC
Through a combination of executive actions and legislatives goals, the plan would also increase the amount of current healthcare tax credits for Americans already on an ACA plan to ensure no family buying insurance on the [ACA] individual marketplace, regardless of income, will have to spend more than 8.5 percent of their income on health insurance.
Mr. Trump announced earlier this week an extension of social distancing guidelines until April 30, and governors in more than half of states have issued orders for Americans to stay in their homes and nonessential businesses to close.
Volinsky, running as a progressive who has supported the Black Lives Matter movement, said in an apology he recognizes there's a different context to calling past, white nominees unqualified. There is a long history of Black people who have been unfairly dismissed as 'unqualified'; I failed to take that context into account when opposing these nominees. I look forward to engaging in honest and candid dialogue with Black Lives Matter Manchester and take to heart their criticisms about my words, he wrote.

Alan He contributed to this report
But, you know, let's talk about what's really going on here, Martha, because our intelligence community just came out and said in the last few days that the Kremlin, meaning Putin and the Russian government, are directing the attacks, the hacking on American accounts to influence our election. And WikiLeaks is part of that, as are other sites where the Russians hack information, we don't even know if it's accurate information, and then they put it out.
Those remarks followed the Justice Department's filing last week of a brief supporting the complete invalidation of the ACA. The move was a departure from its previous stance that the individual mandate, requiring most Americans to carry health insurance, should be stricken down, but the rest of the law, including the protections for pre-existing conditions, should remain in place.
The giant insurer focuses mainly on group health insurance offered through employers. So, UnitedHealth often offers exchange plans with broader networks but also higher premiums. The bulk of exchange patients, however, are lower-income, receive premium subsidies and choose one of the two lowest-premium plans offered.

He's got back-up and on November 8, I know we'll elect Donald Trump to be the 45th president of the United States of America.
Newt Gingrich and Ron Paul's slim hopes of winning the Republican presidential nomination depend primarily on their ability to triumph at a contested convention in August. The idea is that if front-runner Mitt Romney falls short of the 1,144 delegates he needs to secure the nomination before the convention, his rivals will seize the opportunity to win over the Republican faithful during the convention process.
FACT CHECK: TRUE, BUT THIS HAS BEEN A TREND FOR THE LAST FEW YEARS
The U.S. in return was able to compel Iran to take several steps that will slow its ability to produce a nuclear weapon: They must destroy stockpiles of enriched uranium, slow plutonium production, dismantle a plutonium reactor, and give international nuclear inspectors access to its facilities, among other things.
It's time to organize. Time to galvanize. Time to take back our democracy. It's time, America! she said to a fervent applause.
Shortly before the debate began, Donald Trump invited the pooled press for a press statement with women who have accused President Bill Clinton of sexual assault or rape including Juanita Broaddrick, Paula Jones, and Kathleen Willey. The other participant was Kathy Shelton, the lone woman among the four who made no accusation toward Bill Clinton. She was 12 years old in 1975 when she was allegedly raped by 41-year-old factory worker Thomas Alfred Taylor. Hillary Clinton was the young lawyer who defended Taylor. She had asked to be relieved of the responsibility of defending him but was not, and she later said in an interview she had a professional duty to represent him to the best of her ability, which, she said she did. His charges were ultimately reduced from rape to unlawful fondling of a child under 14. He served 10 months of a year-long sentence.
I just don't understand how many times we have to play this game to finally learn the lessons. We have seen how this turns out, and it ain't pretty for us, one Republican strategist who worked on midterm elections told CBS News. The strategy needs to be keeping the focus on Democrats...not on us.
Earlier in the day, Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wisconsin, said, Obviously, CSRs -- we're not doing that. That is not in an appropriation bill.
JANICE JACKSON, EdD (Chicago Public Schools CEO/@janicejackson): Good morning.

The Bush campaign has all the joy of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre, said a top Kasich strategist to reporters in a phone call later in the day.
As President Trump has vowed that the Republican party will be the party of health care, five Democratic committee chairmen are demanding that administration officials turn over documents and information related to the Justice Department's decision to stop defending the entirety of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) in Court.
According to insurance companies, about 20 percent of people who signed up for Obamacare failed to pay their January premiums on time and consequently didn't receive coverage that month, the New York Times reported last month. I think people are enrolling in multiple places, Aetna CEO Mark T. Bertolini reportedly said. They are shopping. And what happens is that they never really get back on HealthCare.gov to disenroll from plans they prior enrolled in.
The category of people that we have seen in our politics over the last decade or so, from Jim Jordan and Matt Gaetz, to Sarah Palin is part of the reason the country's politics are such a disaster, Schmidt said. And part of the reason the country's in such a mess.
JOHN DICKERSON: --but they would put America's interest, multi-faceted interests. We should also mention that Saudi Arabia is a great counter weight to Iran for the United States.
There will be more legal wrangling ahead before it is at all clear what this decision means for the law, if anything.
Earl Smith Whitehouse.gov Veteran Earl Smith first met then-Senator Barack Obama in 2008 in Austin, Texas while director of security at a hotel. Smith gave Obama a military patch he wore in Vietnam while serving in an artillery brigade that sustained 10,041 casualties and received 13 Medals of Honor. Obama carried the patch throughout the campaign and it will be archived in the Obama Library.
But the most notable difference between the two GOP candidates is their approach to governing as a conservative.

Representative Braun has said he'll vote for whatever Trump wants, Donnelly said. My job is to vote for whatever is in the interest of the state of Indiana and our country.
We wanted him to participate and he chose not to, he said. And we think that was a wrong decision.

The new CBS Battleground Tracker shows him trailing his Democratic challenger, Cal Cunningham, by 10 points.
Only 32 percent of respondents in the Economist survey said the country is headed in the right direction, while 57 percent said it's on the wrong track. In the PBS survey, 31 percent said we're on the right track, 63 percent disagreed. In the Reuters poll, 24 percent said we're headed in the right direction, while 61 percent said we're on the wrong track. And the latest CBS News numbers show 31 percent of Americans believe we're on the right track, while 64 percent say we're headed in the wrong direction.
Dr. Travis Gayles: As a public health official, one of the most frustrating things for me is that many of the disparities that we're seeing play out in COVID were longstanding health disparities that have been in place for decades. And then I feel like we forget about it again, because, when we're rolling out vaccines, it's as if we haven't, we didn't learn anything from that.
Obama's visit to the battleground state follows visits over the weekend by his former Vice President Joe Biden and a rally by President Donald Trump. Last month, the former president spoke at a rally in California for congressional Democrats.
It's amazing to me that Judge Barrett has publicly criticized the decision by Chief Justice Roberts that upheld the constitutionality of the ACA and that President Trump is making it clear a vote for Judge Barrett to be on the Supreme Court is a vote to repeal the ACA and take away health care protection from a majority of Americans during a pandemic, he said Sunday on Face the Nation.
Success, however, could be measured by a number of factors -- some of which the HHS isn't monitoring.
Still, Kagan did not foreclose the possibility of more litigation regarding the rules, writing that she questions whether the exemptions can survive administrative law's demand for reasoned decisionmaking. That issue remains open for the lower courts to address.
Twenty-eight-year-old Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is giving Democratic Rep. Joe Crowley his first primary in 14 years in New York's 14th District. The WSJ's note on the race: Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, a 28-year-old born in the Bronx whose family is from Puerto Rico, wanted to challenge Mr. Crowley's position as leader of one of the most diverse congressional districts in the country. The district, which covers part of the Bronx and of Queens, is overwhelmingly Democratic, and the majority of residents are black and Hispanic, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.
Andrew Puzder's nomination to be President Donald Trump's labor secretary is bogged down. Senate hearings on the controversial fast-food executive have been delayed four times, with a new date scheduled for next week.

And I will tell you that when Hillary brings up a point like that and she talks about words that I said 11 years ago, I think it's disgraceful, and I think she should be ashamed of herself, if you want to know the truth.
A few hours later, House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, responded with a blistering op-ed piece in USA Today. The president isn't telling the whole story when it comes to the government shutdown. The fact is that Washington Democrats have slammed the door on reopening the government by refusing to engage in bipartisan talks. And, as stories across the country highlight the devastating impact of Obamacare on families and small businesses, they continue to reject our calls for fairness for all Americans, he wrote. This is part of a larger pattern: the president's scorched-Earth policy of refusing to negotiate in bipartisan way on his health care law, current government funding, or the debt limit.
We're the last stand for the middle class in this country. And I think people have forgotten that, Gulla added, reflecting on the state of organized labor. They take for granted what has been fought for since labor laws were enacted in this country.
In South Carolina, Republican Gov. Henry McMaster, who was elevated from lieutenant governor to governor when Nikki Haley was named U.N. ambassador by President Trump, faces a competitive primary challenge from his own party despite Mr. Trump's backing. Four other Republicans are vying to be the gubernatorial nominee, and McMaster could face a runoff with either Mount Pleasant attorney Catherine Templeton or Greenville businessman John Warren, according to The Post and Courier. Three Democrats are competing to be South Carolina's Democratic gubernatorial candidate, and state Rep. James Smith is the presumed frontrunner.

Pete Buttigieg Pete Buttigieg explores presidential bid 06:09 Biography The youngest of the presidential contenders, Pete Buttigieg is also the only openly gay candidate who has jumped into the race. Buttigieg, 37, ran for mayor of South Bend, Indiana, his hometown, when he was only 29. He is a graduate of Harvard and was a Rhodes Scholar at Oxford University. After becoming mayor in 2011, Buttigieg deployed to Afghanistan for a seven-month tour in 2013 as a member of the Navy Reserve. In 2015, shortly before the Supreme Court decision legalizing same-sex marriage, Buttigieg came out as gay in an essay in the South Bend Tribune, becoming the first openly gay municipal leader in Indiana. If nominated, Buttigieg would be the first openly gay presidential nominee. Buttigieg ran for chairman of the Democratic National Committee in 2017, running as a dark horse candidate with the backing of former DNC Chairman Howard Dean. However, Buttigieg withdrew from the race on the day of the election, acknowledging his long-shot candidacy. Buttigieg married his husband, Chasten Glezman, in June 2018. Issues Buttigieg has spent much of his time as mayor of South Bend focusing on redevelopment and construction, such as implementing a project to repair or demolish targeted properties across the city and adding pedestrian and bike-friendly amenities to city streets. Buttigieg is making the case that South Bend's economic struggles are a microcosm of the problems the country is experiencing.

When I came out of Washington and the White House, I didn't feel that there was really a glass ceiling in the administration ... and Texas was very different, Cruz said in a 2011 panel discussion, according to a Buzzfeed News account. As the only woman in Goldman Sach's Houston office, the vegetarian Cruz said she felt unable to keep up with Texans' hunting lingo, social circles with few career-oriented females, and overall very traditional culture.

Mr. Trump campaigned on repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act, but failed to do so even when Republican controlled the House, Senate and White House. He did eliminate enforcement of penalties under the ACA.
President Donald Trump: I want them to be fair. You-- you don't ask Biden tough questions.
It is not true that Immigration and Customs Enforcement, a federal agency, endorsed Trump. That would be a violation of the Hatch Act, which limits the involvement of executive branch employees in election and partisan political activity. The union for border patrol agents, which is a separate entity, did endorse Trump.
JOHN DICKERSON: And that top-- the first group you're talking about are people who don't usually vote in midterm elections?
While the Clinton proposals won't cover room and board or addresses poor graduation rates, they provide tangible relief for middle- and lower-income families. It's far from perfect, but it in effect restores public college subsidies that have been dramatically eroded in recent years.
People can continue their employer coverage under a federal law known as COBRA, but they have to pay 102% of the premium — too much for most who are out of work. If there's another coronavirus bill from Congress, it might include subsidies for COBRA coverage.

Mr. Trump pledged to revive the coal industry and reverse the trend in coal jobs and plants under his predecessor.
PAUL RYAN: Yes, so I think it's- I think what the president should do is leave room for negotiation to get a solution. That's exactly what he's doing. He's basically saying in addition to a DACA solution, we have to have border security including funding for a wall. We've got-- He wants to get rid of the Diversity Visa Program.

It's a big snowballing effect that happens here over the next few months, Iowa Democratic Party Chair Troy Price told CBS News. There isn't one point where everyone will have made up their mind and honestly given the nature of the field right now I don't know if there will be a point where it locks in.

She is a disgrace for any, the lies she told those mothers about their children that got killed over there in Benghazi, he said on the Jeff Kuhner Show in Boston Tuesday. She dropped the ball on over 400 emails requesting back up security. Something's wrong there. Hillary Clinton should be put in the firing line and shot for treason.

Former President Obama released a video urging people to enroll under the ACA on Twitter this week, mentioning the memes, the funny interviews, and the stunts he has used in the past to push the uninsured to enroll and get insurance coverage. The ACA was his signature domestic legislative accomplishment.
I think he made a mistake when he said that. It's just incorrect information, the president told reporters during a White House briefing. That is incorrect information. Mr. Trump did not offer a specific timeline for distribution, saying only that the vaccine would be ready very soon.
JOE BIDEN: Which we know nothing about. Look, I opposed the surge in the first place. Number one, I didn't think we should have even the troops we sent there. Now, it's all been made public now that we should have the troops in the first place that we sent there. And I didn't think we should have had the number of troops, which is considerably less than the present-- this-- this President added.
I think what we're seeing health care companies do today is really inspiring, Pence said, without answering the question of whether Medicaid could be expanded to cover middle-class Americans.

Before the Pennsylvania Supreme Court decided to take that case, lawyers for the Trump Campaign requested a preliminary injunction to keep mail-in ballots returned by drop box from being mixed with ones sent by mail.
Yes. Under the rules, the case can be dismissed with leave of court. Generally, the courts have said that that provision is in there to protect defendants, to make sure the government doesn't play games by bringing a charge and then dismissing it; bringing another charge, dismissing it. But he does have a say.
Some House Democrats in competitive districts showed their support of Senator Mitt Romney's remarks and eventual No vote on the first article of impeachment.

Mike Levin of California, a freshman Democrat, thanked the Utah Senator for standing up for America today.

White House outlines issues Trump will highlight during speech
As the Senate goes back and forth ahead of a vote on whether to move forward with a coronavirus stimulus package, Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota announced Monday that her husband has coronavirus. In a statement posted on Medium, the former 2020 contender briefly described how her husband's health has deteriorated—citing that a persistent fever and coughing up blood led to him being tested and later admitted into a Virginia hospital for several reasons, including very low oxygen levels. CBS News campaign reporter LaCrai Mitchell reports that Virginia's governor declared a state of emergency earlier this month and announced Monday that public schools in the state will remain closed for the rest of the academic year. This comes as the Virginia Department of Health has reported 254 cases, 38 hospitalizations and 6 deaths related to COVID-19 in the state. Klobuchar said her husband remains in the hospital and has pneumonia but said she hasn't been in the same place as her husband for two weeks so she won't be getting tested. …since John and I have been in different places for the last two weeks and I am outside the 14-day period for getting sick, my doctor has advised me to not get a test, said Klobuchar in the statement. …there are test shortages for people who need them everywhere and I don't qualify to get one under any standard.

BIDEN: Look, this administration is incapable of learning elections. They like this. Come on. Let's be fair here. They've known this for a long time, for three years. Every intelligence agency has told them they continue to be engaged in this activity. Every intelligence agency told me they were engaged before. There is not any question anymore. There's never been a question for the last three years. And what's he doing? Zero. What is the Republican leadership in the United States Senate and Congress doing? Zero.

Jay Inslee Jay Inslee announces 2020 presidential bid 00:36 Biography Born and raised in Seattle, Inslee received a bachelor's degree in economics from the University of Washington in 1973 and a J.D. from Willamette University College of Law in Oregon three years later. After working in private law for more than a decade, he successfully ran for a seat in the Washington House of Representatives, where he served for four years until his successful bid for Congress in 1992. Inslee represented the state's 4th Congressional district for one term until his reelection bid was thwarted during the so-called Republican Revolution of 1994. During the following years, he unsuccessfully ran for governor and served as a regional Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) director under President Clinton. Inslee ran for Congress again in 1998 and defeated a Republican incumbent in Washington's 1st Congressional district, which he went on to represent for nearly 12 years. During his congressional tenure, the Washington lawmaker was a vocal critic of the war in Iraq and an early proponent of federal initiatives to reduce greenhouse gases and the American economy's reliance on fossil fuels. Inslee left Congress in 2012 to launch his ultimately successful bid to be governor in Washington, defeating the state's Republican attorney general in the general election. After winning reelection in November 2016 -- the same time Mr. Trump unexpectedly won the presidency -- Inslee declared that Washington was, is and will always be a beacon for progressive values.

I ask Hillary, why doesn't — she made $250 million by being in office. She used the power of her office to make a lot of money. Why isn't she funding, not for $100 million, but why don't you put $10 million or $20 million or $25 million or $30 million into your own campaign?
The website also claims that the Trump administration is expanding health care access. While it has provided access to short-term plans that may not cover essential health benefits like maternity or mental health care, the number of Americans lacking health insurance has grown — by 1.9 million last year — since President Obama left office and Mr. Trump made a series of changes to undermine his signature law, the Affordable Care Act, otherwise known as Obamacare. By contrast, Obamacare pushed the number of Americans with health insurance to historic highs.
SEN. SANDERS: And by the way, let me challenge President Trump to do the same. Trust me, we do not have investments in Russia or Saudi Arabia or anyplace else. Yes, we will be releasing them.
He is going to put forth a pretty aggressive schedule for hearings and markups that we believe will happen in the middle part of October, Meadows said of Graham. And if all goes well, then certainly a vote on the floor some time before the election.
Over the past few days, the president has repeatedly attacked a whistleblower who filed a complaint that includes Mr. Trump's phone conversation with the Ukrainian president, a call which has in part spawned the House impeachement inquiry against him.

More than a dozen Democratic House incumbents and several Senate candidates in competitive races have yet to endorse Joe Biden, nearly a month after the former vice president became his party's presumptive presidential nominee, report CBS News political unit broadcast associate Aaron Navarro, CBS News campaign reporter Alex Tin and CBS News Associate Producer Eleanor Watson. The holdouts underscore challenges facing Biden as he prepares to lead a party fighting to defend a House majority and win back the Senate.
It was a speech heavy on themes that Mr. Trump has embraced since his campaign for the presidency. He again pushed for stricter immigration laws and the building of a great wall along the U.S. border with Mexico. A section of the speech that called for an end to family-based immigration, sometimes called chain migration, elicited audible jeers from Democrats. He connected the immigration issue to crime, saying that loopholes in the immigration system had allowed gangs to proliferate.

He added, Small businesses are overwhelmingly being taxed, not at a corporate rate, but at the individual tax rate. So successful small businesses will see their taxes go up dramatically and that will kill jobs. That will be another kick in the gut to the middle class in America. We just saw a terrible jobs report, just last week, and now to add a higher tax on job creators and on small business is about the worst thing I could imagine to do.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, all of us would like to know a little bit more about exactly what's happening, but U.S. intelligence hasn't made any of this public yet. White House isn't shedding much light. But the bottom line seems to be that--
Ryan, a budget geek with a passion for details who announced Wednesday that he would retire next year, proved adroit in drawing up budget plans that balanced on paper but didn't get beyond the hypothetical. Under his leadership, Republicans never tried to implement the deep cuts his budget called for, particularly his vision of turning Medicare into a voucher-like program for future retirees. Instead, the House passed steep tax cuts while increasing spending, setting the government on a path to rising deficits.
Co-host Norah O'Donnell said, One of the things that drove opposition to the Affordable Care Act was massive increases in premiums that perhaps the Obama administration did not accurately predict or prevent.
ANNA PALMER: This is basically the internal fight that the Democrats have been having in the last cycle about challengers in primary races, and you have members like AOC, who want to take the party to the left and they want to have challengers that the party establishment are not okay with. And so this is actually a tool that Mitch McConnell used on the Senate side and Republicans, a couple of cycles to go to take back control. It's a way for the establishment to say, no, no, no, if you're going to run for some of these more left-leaning candidates that are not in line with who we think can win these races ultimately, then you as a consultant aren't going to get the work of the party.
MARGARET BRENNAN: So the president said yesterday he wants repeal and replace handled a little bit differently, reference to failed attempt by Republicans in the past, and that he'll sit down with Democrats if the Supreme Court upholds the ruling. So are you predicting that you spend the next year crafting a new law from scratch?
CBS News is chronicling what has changed for the lives of residents of some of the biggest battleground states in 2020 amid the coronavirus pandemic. In the latest edition of COVID Chronicles, CBS News campaign reporter LaCrai Mitchell continues to examine the economic impacts of the coronavirus pandemic on Black business owners, with a dispatch out of North Carolina. Patrick Williams, 45, had just become one of four business partners at Pier 34 Seafood & Pub in Goldsboro, when the restaurant closed due to the pandemic. Pier 34 continued to offer take-out and delivery options while the restaurant was physically closed but the team barely earned half of what they had been receiving per month. The restaurant has reopened and while it could sustain another six months at its current revenue, Williams said that it would be cutting it hard, and his team would eventually have to decide whether to keep their doors open or permanently close. According to research done by the University of California in Santa Cruz, there were more than a million black-owned businesses in the U.S. at the beginning of February. By mid-April, 440,000 Black business owners had permanently shut down — a 41% drop. Women-owned businesses saw a 25% plunge.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Have you asked your democratic colleagues--
Roberts has typically been to Kennedy's right. He did not endorse a constitutional right to marry for same-sex couples. He dissented when the court struck down Texas abortion clinic restrictions in 2016. The chief justice also was in dissent from the court's first major climate change decision in 2007, when it held that the Environmental Protection Agency could regulate emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases as air pollutants.
I'm not gonna sugarcoat it. We took a gut punch in Iowa, Biden said. The whole process took a gut punch.

Roberts voted in favor of gun rights in two cases that held that Americans have the right to have guns, at least for self-defense in their homes. But the court has since rejected repeated attempts to expand on the right of gun ownership, in part because Roberts and Kennedy would not join the other conservative justices to take on a new case.
To hear them tell it, Lamb basically ran as a conservative. And his opponent, Rick Saccone, was just a lousy candidate. Plus, it will be hard for Democrats to replicate Lamb's success, if only because the progressive grassroots typically rejects moderates of his stripe.

Eight in 10 Republicans disapprove -- including 70 percent who disapprove strongly of the Affordable Care Act. In contrast, although seven in 10 Democrats approve of the law, just 39 percent say they strongly approve. A slight majority of independents disapproves (53 percent) of the law.

According to one Los Angeles Times profile, Cruz dials dozens of donors daily, and she has told at least one reporter that the $10,800 contributions is my lane.
Will you remember that, Texas? Will you remember that Pennsylvania? Oklahoma? Ohio? Mr. Trump said during Thursday's debate, after Biden said he'd transition away from fossil fuels to eventually replace them with renewable energy source. While Oklahoma is not a battleground state for the presidential race, the mention may have been a reference for the state's 5th district, one of the most notable pickup opportunities for Republicans. Oklahoma's 5th district has several major oil and gas companies that use fracking, and while she has spoken out against a ban on it before, freshman Democrat Kendra Horn was quick to show some distance between her and Biden. Here's one of the places Biden and I disagree. We must stand up for our oil and gas industry. We need an all-of-the-above energy approach that's consumer friendly, values energy independence, and protects OK jobs. I'll keep fighting for that in Congress, Horn tweeted after the debate. Her Republican opponent, state Senator Stephanie Bice, called on her to outright disavow Biden's transition away from the oil industry. National Republican groups such as the National Republican Congressional Committee or the Congressional Leadership Fund have been highlighting Biden's comments to target Horn, several Democrat challengers in Texas and Congresswoman Xochitl Torres Small in New Mexico's 2nd. Congresswoman Torres Small and Joe Biden will both say whatever it takes to get elected, but the one thing that remains true is that they are both dead set on ending good paying energy jobs, CLF press secretary Will Reinert said in a press release.
The Obama administration exempted churches, synagogues and mosques from the contraceptive coverage requirement, but also created a way by which organizations with religious affiliations, including hospitals, universities and charities, could opt out of paying for contraception, but women on their health plans would still get no-cost birth control. Some groups complained the opt-out process itself violated their religious beliefs.

As it happens, there are just about the same number of Republican governors across the United States, and their representative was in Washington on the third day of the government shutdown with a very different conservative message: We get things done. Thirty Republican governors are applying conservative principles, says Gov. Bobby Jindal of Louisiana, the chairman of the Republican Governors Association. Here in D.C. they talk about it, but outside the nation's capital we're actually doing it. For too long for the Republican governors, we feel like we've outsourced our brand management to the Republicans in D.C. It's time for us to stop doing that. It's time for us to take control of our own destiny. We want folks to know that when we're talking about Republicans, it's not just the dysfunction that's happening in Washington, D.C., it's the results that are happening in our state capitals.
Sean Kirk: So we've got about 350 here and probably another 100 supporting them remotely.
FACT CHECK: Mostly true, but with a caveat: though there's no evidence Clinton's server was accessed, as FBI Director James Comey noted, there would be little evidence if they had. Comey also notes there is evidence that a number of people that Clinton was in correspondence with did have their emails hacked.

That was Jindal's explicit message on Thursday. Though he had plenty of criticism for the president--who he said liked to play the victim in chief--his message for his own party was not about the incumbent he disapproves of. In the states, he said, You see a party that is fighting for every single vote, that is fighting to help the American people join and thrive in the middle class ... a party that is not just the party of no, and those are the things that we need to do as a party if we want to earn the right to govern and we want to be a majority party. It's not happening in D.C. right now, but it is happening in our state capitals.

The Congressional Budget Office report follows a burst of new spending last year and the repeal in December of several taxes used to help finance the Affordable Care Act. Those have combined to deepen the government's deficit spiral well on into the future, with trillion-dollar deficits likely for as far as the eye can see.

MANUEL BOJORQUEZ (CBS News National Correspondent/@BojorquezCBS): Starting Tuesday, not wearing a mask on most forms of public transportation will be considered a violation of federal law, under a sweeping public health order issued by the CDC. Efforts to stop the spread have taken on new urgency as three mutant strains have now appeared in at least thirty-one states. Even more worrying, the cases are being found in people with no travel history, a clear sign of community spread.
Current partisans feel more connected to their party than did so in 2010. Four times as many Republicans say their party reflects their values than did so in 2010, before the party gained control of the House that year. More Democrats also feel the party reflects their values today than did so in 2010.
There is no sign that the liberals who've spent decades demeaning the character of their political opponents are prepared to stop. It should come as no surprise that their request that the targets of their attacks unilaterally disarm is met with derision and seen as self-serving, disingenuous, and, alas, futile.
On Tuesday night, President Donald Trump's endorsed candidate Corky Messner won the New Hampshire Republican primary, reports CBS News political unit associate producer Eleanor Watson. Messner defeated retired brigadier general Don Bolduc and will now compete in the general election against incumbent Senator Jeanne Shaheen who won the Democratic primary easily on Tuesday. In 2016, Hillary Clinton won New Hampshire by under one percentage point, which has made it an offensive target for Republicans, including the Trump campaign. President Trump has held three rallies in the state since the start of 2019. However, right now, the Cook Political Report rates the Senate seat in New Hampshire solidly Democratic.
Impeachment is a divisive issue, and not the path the party should go on, says Nancy Pelosi, who's likely to be the next speaker of the House. Not a priority.
Douglas Rain Stratford Festival; MGM/Warner Brothers I am putting myself to the fullest possible use, which is all I think that any conscious entity can ever hope to do. The voice of HAL 9000, the murderous computer at the heart of the spacecraft Discovery in Stanley Kubrick's landmark 2001: A Space Odyssey, was provided by Canadian actor Douglas Rain (March 13, 1928-November 11, 2018). A former student at the Bristol Old Vic Theatre School in London, he was head of the English acting section of the National Theatre School of Canada and a founding member of the Stratford Festival, in Ontario, where he spent 32 seasons performing Shakespeare. He was nominated for a Tony Award in 1972 for his role as William Cecil in Vivat! Vivat! Regina! But his most indelible role came as a result of narrating a 1960 National Film Board of Canada short, Universe, the visual effects of which had inspired Kubrick. The director turned to Rain to voice his on-board computer, after deciding the recorded performance by Martin Balsam was too emotional. A supposedly perfect artificial intelligence who covers up a mistake by attributing it to human error, and whose dialogue drips with irony, Hal murders the ship's crew members before he is lobotomized by the mission's sole survivor, David Bowman (played by Keir Dullea). Rain was chillingly neutral, whether talking about chess or locking an astronaut outside the ship.

And if you had that in your heart, and in your ear, you had a lot more to grab from than people who are more technical. Not that the technical part is not important, because it is; you have to have dexterity. It's kind of like a perfect marriage, having that balance between that dexterity and what you have in your heart.
Impeach? The president? Who, us? Why, Democrats can't imagine where in the world you got such an idea.
In one sense, the Supreme Court's immediate future could look a lot like the term that just ended. Roberts seemed firmly in control of a court that overwhelmingly went conservative in divided cases, including upholding President Trump's travel ban, striking a blow at public-sector labor unions, limiting workers' rights to band together to complain about pay and affirming Ohio's aggressive efforts to purge its voting rolls.
Still, Barrett is likely to face pointed questions about Obamacare from Democrats when she testifies before the Senate Judiciary Committee next month.
CLINTON: Not — well, we turned over 35,000, so...
Mike Bloomberg: The middle of the road doesn't want extremism. They want evolution rather than revolution. And if Bernie Sanders is the candidate, Donald Trump will win. Donald Trump not only will win, but the House will go back to being in Republican hands, the Senate will stay in Republican hands. Downstream, a lotta the state houses will flip back Republican. And when that happens, you're gonna have gerrymandering at the local level and judicial appointments at the federal level that will last for decades. And so, what's really at stake here is the future of this country for a very long time. And that's why I'm running.
Lesley Stahl: Let me ask you about Obamacare, which you say you're going to repeal and replace. When you replace it, are you going to make sure that people with pre-conditions are still covered?
A Sunday CBS News poll found that 82 percent of blacks disapprove of Mr. Trump's handling of race relations and racial issues, and 73 percent of Hispanics disapprove. As Democrats strive for a Blue Wave, they are vying not only to bring Obama-Trump voters back to the fold but also to mobilize non-white voters who stayed home in 2016. Turnout in Milwaukee this fall could be a good indicator of their progress.
MARGARET BRENNAN: One of the things that makes Sanders, you know, a candidate who is controversial, you know, certainly starkly in contrast to Joe Biden and what he describes there is also some of his rhetoric. He tweeted and got some guff for it this week, I've got news for the Republican establishment. I've got news for the Democratic establishment. They can't stop us. That was seen as not a message of unity for the party but one of this is an insurgency--
So I want very much to save what works and is good about the Affordable Care Act. But we've got to get costs down. We've got to provide additional help to small businesses so that they can afford to provide health insurance. But if we repeal it, as Donald has proposed, and start over again, all of those benefits I just mentioned are lost to everybody, not just people who get their health insurance on the exchange. And then we would have to start all over again.
Here are the top trends and people to watch in politics this week…
At issue in the case is the individual mandate, which requires people to have health insurance. The penalty for not having insurance was dropped to $0 in the most recent tax legislation, potentially undercutting the Supreme Court's decision in 2012 that the Affordable Care Act was constitutional because of Congress' ability to tax.
Regarding the cost issue, it's an inescapable fact that collectively the institutions, employers or citizens who have money will need to subsidize some portion of medical costs for the citizens who don't. Otherwise, as a society, we need to accept that the less fortunate among us won't be treated.
Lesley Stahl: This is your new branding of Nancy Pelosi. Kind of like a giant slayer almost, or--
Lesley Stahl: Well, as I understand it the progressives want radical change. They wanna get rid of Obamacare and replace it with Medicare for all. I was under the impression that you had said that you do not favor Medicare for all, that-- ACA, Obamacare is better.
What the president glossed over is that Exxon's planned expenditures, while a significant investment by one of the biggest companies in the world, actually marks a decline in its U.S. spending over the previous five years. Citing Exxon's financial filings, the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy says Exxon spent about $58 billion on capital and exploration in the U.S. from 2011 through 2015.
On Saturday, Trump 2020 Campaign Manager Brad Parscale announced the Trump campaign is approaching 35-40 million direct voter contacts. The average campaign, a successful one, barely gets over 10 million direct contacts, Parscale said on this weekend's Trump campaign virtual live stream. We're now getting close to 35 to 40 million direct contact. By Election Day, we might close it off at 50 million. That will nearly be over to two-thirds of all the people that actually vote for the president. CBS News campaign reporter Nicole Sganga notes that Parscale, a longtime Trump family ally, conceded that the Mr. Trump's support lives largely within GOP party lines. The President really has one number that people just, you know, they don't give enough respect to, Parscale said. That is that 'mid 90s' Republicans approve of the President's job. No president has ever had the demo support from any party. Now, he does have record low support from Democrats. He is a Republican.
SENATOR BEN SASSE: Yeah. So, you know where you live, is where you actually love and communities of love are the center of what really keeps people happy. There's a ton of literature now that shows we're the richest people in the history of humanity. And, yet, we're some of the most dissatisfied people in the history of humanity. How do you make sense of that? And it didn't start two years ago. It starts because the digital revolution is really undermining that sense of local community and neighborhood.
The race for the Republican nomination is really down to Donald Trump and Ted Cruz. But if neither candidate clinches the delegates needed to win the nomination before the convention, in theory, almost anyone could be the GOP's pick. We look at some of the most likely of the unlikelies.
TRUMP: No, but I pay tax, and I pay federal tax, too. But I have a write-off, a lot of it's depreciation, which is a wonderful charge. I love depreciation. You know, she's given it to us.
Make Mexico pay for the wall
Other add-ons include a seven-year extension of the Export-Import Bank and a renewal of the government's terrorism risk insurance program. The spending package also extends the government's flood insurance program, as well as several visa programs for skilled and seasonal workers.
In California, where CKE has been based for decades (it will soon move its headquarters to Nashville, Tennessee), labor laws mandate breaks for employees that can conflict with surges in customers coming through the door, he has complained. This leads to long lines and consumer griping. While he doesn't oppose rational increases in the minimum wage, he has said, they shouldn't be so high they kill jobs.
MARGARET BRENNAN: About eighty-six hundred is the number of troops.
JOE BIDEN: Look, this administration is incapable of learning in elections. They like this. Come on. Let's be fair here. They've known this for a long time, for three years. Every intelligence agency has told them they continue to be engaged in this activity. Every intelligence agency told me they were engaged before. There is not any question anymore. There's never been a question for the last three years. And what's he doing? Zero. What is the Republican leadership in the United States Senate and Congress doing? Zero.
SEN. KLOBUCHAR: I think- I- I- I think- I'm thinking the issues you're focused here on, for instance, Medicare for all- and I want universal health care, I just got a different way to get there. And as I said in the debate, I don't think that we should take away people's right to their private insurance and kick half of America off of their private insurance. I think there is a better way to do this and that strengthening Obamacare, taking on the pharmaceuticals. On free college for all, I made it very clear, I want to expand Pell grants, make it easier for kids to go to college. But I don't think- and that's what some of these plans do, that we should be using taxpayer money to finance rich kids to go to college. Many of our public universities, something like 10 percent of the kids come from families that make over 200,000 dollars a year.
According to Murray, Price told her in a meeting that Republican Rep. Chris Collins of New York gave him a stock tip on an Australian biotech firm. But Price says Collins had simply told him about the firm.
President Trump won this district, which is considered solidly Republican, by a slim 1.5 percent in 2016. In contrast, Mitt Romney won it by 23 points.
TRUMP: Absolutely. I think it's such a great question, because energy is under siege by the Obama administration. Under absolutely siege. The EPA, Environmental Protection Agency, is killing these energy companies. And foreign companies are now coming in buying our — buying so many of our different plants and then re-jiggering the plant so that they can take care of their oil.
PAUL RYAN: Bring bills to the floor and see where they go on-- on appropriations. Bring bills to the floor to see where they go on all these other issues. Here's the problem. The Democrats filibuster even considering these bills. And that is why we had this big pileup.
CEDRIC RICHMOND: --of vaccinations. Well, that's an issue in Chicago that both sides are dealing with. I know they're both at the table. Teachers are concerned about their health and making sure that they could teach in a safe environment. And if you look at the CDC study, the CDC study that just came out said with the proper investments, with the proper spacing and class sizes, schools could reopen safely. But another key aspect of that CDC study is that they didn't test all the students and teachers. They just tested people who were symptomatic. And the class sizes in that population was in between ten and twenty students in a class. So, look, we are very serious about making sure that we pass a plan that gives us a comprehensive approach to COVID, which means small business with help, help to our citizens. And so, look, we want kids back in school. No doubt about it. But we want it to be safe for the students, the teachers and the families of both students and teachers.
We'll be back in a moment.
The only possible candidate this fall is the Trump-Pence Republican ticket, he said. That way, we have a Republican ticket to implement Republican principles in Washington.
Republicans feel Trump has made more progress on some of his campaign promises than others. At least four in 10 see a lot of progress on bringing jobs back to the U.S., cutting taxes for the middle class, defeating ISIS, and reducing regulations on business. Fewer Republicans see a lot of progress on repealing Obamacare and only one in 10 think Trump has made a lot of progress in building a border wall.
In the days leading up to the State of the Union, White House officials insisted the president would focus more on the future of the nation than on his own record. Yet Tuesday night, Mr. Obama dedicated a significant portion of time to noting his accomplishments, from helping 18 million Americans gain coverage under Obamacare to killing Osama bin Laden. He noted domestic achievements like lifting high school graduation rates and overseeing the longest streak of private-sector job creation in history. He also highlighted foreign policy achievements such as thawing relations with Cuba and stopping the Ebola epidemic.
His response: Not so much from the people that have been doing it for our country. I mean, look what's happened over the last 10 years. Look what's happened over the years. It's been catastrophic. And, in fact, I won't use some of the people that are sort of your standards, you know, just use them, use them, use them, very easy to use them, but I won't use them because they've made such bad decisions.
Only one pickup truck has received a top safety rating from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety after the group subjected many popular models to the so-called small overlap crash test, which slams one corner of a vehicle into a stationary obstacle.
11:05 p.m. Donald Trump claims that Russia and Syria are fighting against the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS).
The Trump campaign is not running local ads in Ohio, Trump 2020 senior adviser Jason Miller claimed on the call, because it is optimistic about the president's prospects in the must-win state and doesn't want to waste money in the last few weeks before Election Day.
I've been saying for the last year and a half that the best thing we can do politically speaking is let Obamacare explode, Mr. Trump said. It is exploding right now.
On this Face the Nation broadcast moderated by Margaret Brennan:
In a tweet, Jennifer Palmieri, Hillary Clinton's communications director, responded to the accusations of politicizing from Manafort:
SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: I have no reason not to believe Lucy. And-- and I think what this speaks to is the need to fundamentally change the culture of this country and to create environments where women feel comfortable and feel safe. And that's something we have got to do.
Since the previous two debates have divided the field in half over two nights, Warren and Biden have not yet appeared alongside each other. But with only 10 candidates qualifying for Thursday's debate, the two candidates will finally share a spotlight and get the chance to draw contrast in front of millions of potential primary voters.
CEDRIC RICHMOND: They shouldn't have to work two jobs just to make a living wage and live above the poverty line.
Donald Trump: He actually called last night.
JOHN DICKERSON: So your view then, Senator, is that humans are the chief contributor to climate change in this recent period? You-- that's settled for you?
He's right that it is ready. We've been making a number of not only tweaks but modifications to that, Meadows said.
TRUMP: First of all, Captain Khan is an American hero, and if I were president at that time, he would be alive today, because unlike her, who voted for the war without knowing what she was doing, I would not have had our people in Iraq. Iraq was disaster. So he would have been alive today.
MARGARET BRENNAN: And you're making that point because--
Right now, we are at 90 percent health insurance coverage. That's the highest we've ever been in our country. COOPER: Secretary Clinton, your time is up.
Well, it happened again. Amy Klobuchar announced that she is running for President, talking proudly of fighting global warming while standing in a virtual blizzard of snow, ice and freezing temperatures. Bad timing. By the end of her speech she looked like a Snowman(woman)! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 10, 2019
BIDEN: --looks like several thousand people to make sure that we have a place from which we can operate, if in fact, you find that there's a re-amassing of Taliban capacity, excuse me, of al-Qaeda and or ISIS capacity to strike the United States like happened in 9/11.
Association plans have seen their share of scandals in the past, largely due to this state regulatory confusion.
Admittedly, the right track/wrong direction numbers have never been particularly optimistic, in recent years. According to the RealClearPolitics average of polls, only once during the last eight years did the number of Americans who believe the country is headed in the right direction match the number of Americans who believe the country is off track: For a brief shining moment in June 2009, roughly 46 percent of Americans fell into each camp.
We've heard this for decades in Washington, D.C. I remember being a very young law student and hearing this about Robert Bork and hearing this about Clarence Thomas and hearing this about virtually every justice that's been nominated by a Republican, he said. You cannot guarantee results with judges. What you can guarantee is that they are going to approach the task of judging as a judge. They're not going to substitute their own policy views for the will of the people. They're going to try to play it straight and read the law as passed by Congress and as found in the Constitution, not based upon what they think it ought to be, but what it is.
Two of them were in the ACA, but the Republicans undid them. We just have to do those basic things.
President Donald Trump: The priority now--
MARGARET BRENNAN: --releasing your-your tax returns? Senator Gillibrand did so this week, or some of them.
In a very short time, consumers have become very savvy about finding and switching to the least expensive plans, said Corlette. In fact, 43 percent of returning customers switched plans in the 2016 open-enrollment period, according to the Department of Health and Human Services.
Speaker Nancy Pelosi: Do you know that when we did Med-- when Medicare was done by the Congress at the time, under Lyndon Johnson, Ronald Reagan said, Medicare will lead us to a socialist dictatorship. This is-- this is an ongoing theme of the Republicans. However-- I do reject socialism as an economic system. If people have that view, that's their view. That is not the view of the Democratic Party.
It's $30 million less for special interests that will tell you exactly what to do and it would really, I think, be a nice sign to the American public. Why aren't you putting some money in? You have a lot of it. You've made a lot of it because of the fact that you've been in office. Made a lot of it while you were secretary of state, actually. So why aren't you putting money into your own campaign? I'm just curious.
RAMY INOCENCIO: Many are celebrating a new lease on life after the loss of nearly five thousand, and a lockdown for seventy-six days. We were here one year ago, the start of what would be a global tragedy, now World Health Organization investigators are here, too. Scientists believe bats brought COVID to humans. The WHO is looking for the how.
LANNY DAVIS: I can see why Mister Giuliani re-- mentions recordings because he flat out lied when he said that there was no mention of cash by President Trump on the tape recording that I went on CNN to play. It was Mister Giuliani who lied about-- that tape recording is evidence that the primary purpose of the payoff of the hush money to Miss Daniels was the election. It says so on the tape. Mister Pecker from AMI corroborates it and others will corroborate it. Mister Giuliani going on the air today ignoring the fact the FEC never ruled--
ROBERT O'BRIEN: Always great to be here, Margaret.
She said the 33,000 e-mails had to do with her daughter's wedding, number one, and a yoga class. Well, maybe we'll give three or three or four or five or something. 33,000 e-mails deleted, and now she's saying there wasn't anything wrong.
Exciting progress is happening every single day. To speed access to breakthrough cures and affordable generic drugs, last year the FDA approved more new and generic drugs and medical devices than ever before in our country's history.
President Donald Trump: I feel masks possibly work. But certainly you want to stay away a certain distance, socially distance, et cetera. But I would say a mask works. And I have nothing against masks. And I tell people to wear masks. I have no problem--
I felt I was in a different role as his colleague, that I'm someone that has worked with him for a long time, there's a lot of trust there, and I felt it was best to handle it in that way, Klobuchar told CNN at the time about why she did not call on him to resign.
Jim Taylor AP Photo Jim Taylor (September 20, 1935-October 13, 2018), the ferocious Hall of Fame fullback who embodied the Green Bay Packers' unstoppable ground game during the Vince Lombardi era, helped the team win four NFL titles and the first Super Bowl (and scored the first rushing touchdown in Super Bowl history). Taylor was the league's MVP in 1962. During his 10 seasons in the NFL (including one with the New Orleans Saints), he rushed for 8,597 yards. Taylor was often compared to his contemporary, Cleveland's Jim Brown, but Vince Lombardi had different views on two of the most punishing running backs in the league at the time: Jim Brown will give you that leg (to tackle) and then take it away from you, he said. Jim Taylor will give it to you and then ram it through your chest.
Joe Biden will join Yahoo News and chef Jose Andres for a livestream event Tuesday evening. Earlier in the day, Face the Nation moderator Margaret Brennan moderated a discussion with Biden top foreign policy adviser Tony Blinken. Asked about recent criticism of how the World Health Organization (WHO) has handled the COVID-19 pandemic, Blinken told Brennan the U.S. under a Biden administration would not necessarily have to remain the number one donor to the WHO, contributions he noted that are all voluntary. And if Biden takes office, Blinken said their administration would certainly need an after-action report on how the Trump administration handled the global pandemic response. He did not say who would conduct such a report.
White House explains extreme vetting executive order
So now that I'm on the inside, I know something I didn't know then. He's under audit. He's said completely, when audit is completed, he will release, she said on CNN's State of the Union.
But his passing will affect the institution far beyond one term. He was one of nine justices, but his impact on the court and the law was far greater than a single vote.
We are adoptive parents and we deal with a lot with medical issues and learning disabilities that are not covered by private insurance that we struggle to get help with, Christi said while admitting private insurance right now is a great thing to keep.
Lesley Stahl: Will they go to Washington with you?
Other Iowans came to the fair with their favorite presidential hopeful in mind. Former Vice President Joe Biden led the class with 23 Democrats saying they would like to see him take on President Donald Trump next year.
JOE BIDEN: --attacks on me. Fake accounts, yes. And they were taken down. But I-- I don't know who-- I-- I didn't get a call from Facebook. But I-- I'm-- I was told by my-- my staff that's what happened.
Some staff have also shifted their attention to making calls to battleground states like Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Arizona to remind voters that they can sign up to vote-by-mail online in November.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Why does Joe Biden want to be president? What is the- the key thing that's driving you that you want to achieve if you're elected?
JOE BIDEN: I've never said it--
TRUMP: I don't like Assad at all, but Assad is killing ISIS. Russia is killing ISIS. And Iran is killing ISIS. And those three have now lined up because of our weak foreign policy.
President Donald Trump: I haven't gone after her.
9:46 p.m. Donald Trump claims that the Affordable Care Act is causing skyrocketing health insurance costs.
BIDEN: Look, you guys can do all the pontificating about what it means. I'm not going to- that's not my job. My job is to go in and make the best case I can. And I think we're gonna do well, and I think we're going to go on to Super Tuesday and do very well.
Donald Trump: A li-- a little bit, a little bit. And I think-- I realized that this is a whole different life for me now.
1:30 p.m. ET Jennifer De Pinto, of CBS News' Election Unit, breaks down the poll numbers behind how Donald Trump got to the Republican convention. Exit polling data provides a window into who backed the presumptive GOP nominee.
President Donald Trump: They were inappropriately brought up. Right from the beginning. No, your first question was, This is going to be tough questions. You don't ask Joe Biden, I saw your interview with Joe, the interview with Joe Biden.
In the past several months, the Trump administration has paved the way for two alternative types of insurance that won't be subject to the same standards as ACA-regulated policies. The administration loosened restrictions on both short-term health plans and so-called association health plans, both of which are usually cheaper than exchange plans. But they often provide much less coverage of essential health benefits such as maternity care or treatment for preexisting conditions.
According to law enforcement officials, the city is well-prepared for any attacks that may be similar in fashion to the recent shooting in Dallas or to the truck attack in Nice, France: The concrete barriers being placed around likely targets for a Nice style attack will stop most large vehicles unless the driver is very lucky, a source tells Alemany. The snow ploughs blocking the vehicle entrances to Public Square will stop pretty much anything. Police will be again reviewing the firearms threat to their officers after this morning's shooting in Baton Rouge. It is possible that the threat will be deemed high enough to justify officers with long barreled weapons to provide counter sniper cover for officers policing events.
JOHN DICKERSON: Let me ask you a question about climate change in the wake of Hurricane Michael. Congressman Carlos Curbelo, a Republican colleague of yours, believes that Republicans need to stop questioning the science behind climate change. He said that that America was saddling young Americans with an environmental debt that was as bad as the fiscal debt. What's your response to that?
The pressure to vote on a clean bill is likely to build as the shutdown drags on. On Wednesday, bank CEOs -- the sort of deep-pocketed, potential campaign supporters that politicians listen to -- came to Washington to warn leaders that they're current stalemate could harm the economy. Public outrage could also build, and as speaker of the House, Boehner has a vested interest in getting those few dozen vulnerable Republicans re-elected.
When you spend some time with Haley, you notice how often she brings President Trump into the conversation. She is unfailingly loyal to him, constantly stressing his accomplishments.
ELIZABETH PALMER: It's exactly a year ago this week that the very first coronavirus case was confirmed here in Britain. And there is a real hope now that we may be at what you might call the beginning of the beginning of the end. Margaret.
Last week, National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC) Chairman Steve Stivers (R-OH) was one of the first lawmakers out of the gate to speak out against the administration's policy of separating families at the border and to call on the administration to stop it, signaling that he thought it was a political loser is his fight to maintain control of the House in the fall.
It was another busy day for Pennsylvania courts making elections rulings, reports CBS News campaign reporter Zak Hudak. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled unanimously on Friday that mail ballots and applications can't be challenged or rejected for signatures mismatches. The court's two conservative justices joined its five liberal ones in ruling that subjective signatures analysis can't be the reason any ballot is rejected in the key battleground state. County boards of elections are prohibited from rejecting absentee or mail-in ballots based on signature comparison conducted by county election officials or employees, or as the result of third-party challenges based on signature analysis and comparisons, Justice Debra Todd wrote in the opinion. Pennsylvania's elections chief had issued guidance in September in line with that interpretation of the law, and the Trump campaign asked a federal district court judge to deem it unconstitutional. That court dismissed the lawsuit earlier this month, and Pennsylvania Secretary of State Kathy Boockvar asked the state's top court to use it's King's Bench power to affirm the legality of her directive on ballot rejections. This is the first year that Pennsylvania, a state worth 20 electoral votes, is allowing no-excuse mail-in voting. Nearly a third of the state's 9 million registered voters have applied for a mail-in or absentee ballot, and two thirds of those voters are Democrats.
Under Paul Ryan, the deficit certainly increased dramatically, so all that great think tank policy and great ideas wasn't able to translate into legislation and that has a huge fiscal cost, said Maya MacGuineas, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a Washington group that advocates for lower deficits.
BIDEN: I've been saying this for over three years. The President denies they're involved. They've been involved. I was deeply involved in the intelligence apparatus and how it functioned before we left the vice presidency. It was clear they were involved. The President continues to deny their involvement. It's overwhelming. And the fact is that everybody knows. Except when the President stands before the whole world, looks at Vladimir Putin, says, why would he want to interfere in our elections? Well, 17 intelligence agencies told me- told him he did. So this is all- this is bizarre. This is bizarre. This is continuing. And what's happened? Why in God's name haven't we hardened the electoral process- provided billions, hundreds of millions of dollars to states to be able to harden their voter rolls, make sure they can't be attacked by cyber security as a consequence of cyber attacks. Why haven't we provided the capacity for them to be able to have the money to have paper ballots in addition to that? I mean, this is- this is outrageous and it's going on. Look, I joined with the leaders of Europe when the European elections took place back before I got involved. I'd be- before I- before I decided to run. And we set up an organization that in fact said every European leader running in either party, in any party, would take a pledge--
In a message to the Iowa Democratic Party State Central Committee on Tuesday night, which was obtained by CBS News, Iowa Democratic Party Chair Troy Price laid out how the party has been working through the chaos over the past 48 hours. Media accounts tell part of the story - technical issues and new reporting requirements caused delays and confusion, Price wrote. What received less attention by the media, was the deliberative and cross-functional approach we brought to preparing for and solving these challenges.
The president ended DACA, a 2012 program created by President Obama, in September and has given Congress until March 5 to figure out a legislative solution. Democrats want that solution worked out, along with government funding for the rest of the fiscal year, which ends Sept. 30. They also want a deal to lift spending caps set by a 2011 law.
RADDATZ: And we want to get to some questions from online...
The first Democratic primary debates take place June 26 and June 27. They will also take place in Florida, a pivotal swing state that Mr. Trump won in 2016.
McConnell had previously said that if Pelosi and Mnuchin were able to reach an agreement, he would bring their proposal to the Senate floor for consideration. However, CBS News confirmed last week that McConnell told Senate Republicans that he had warned the White House against reaching an agreement on a coronavirus relief bill ahead of the election.
In terms of strength, America certainly projected military might abroad, dropping the largest bomb in its arsenal for the first time in 2017 on a target in Afghanistan, and launching missile attacks on military targets in Syria.
Keeping the Senate in session for part of August — even on this week's modest Wednesday-Thursday schedule — disrupts campaign plans for Democratic senators in the most competitive re-election battles in Trump-won states. It could also help protect the few endangered Senate Republicans.
She has chosen to regulate every aspect of nearly 10 million lives with no consent or input from the people's representatives, whose assistance the Governor publicly disdains, the court filing says.
If the Republicans repeal Obamacare without an immediate effective replacement plan, it's an admission that they're unable or unwilling to wrestle with these big elephants.
This is the legacy of Hillary Clinton: death, destruction, terrorism and weakness, he said.
TRUMP: And we should get on to much more important things and much bigger things.
There are two primaries on Tuesday, August 21: Alaska and Wyoming.
The issue in all the cases is the method originally adopted by the Obama administration to allow religiously affiliated organizations to opt out of paying for contraception while making sure that women under their plans would not be left with the bill.
America is a nation of builders. We built the Empire State Building in just one year. Isn't it a disgrace that it can now take 10 years just to get a minor permit approved for the building of a simple road?
Gillibrand's positions have become more progressive during her time in the Senate. Issues Gillibrand advocated the repeal of the Don't ask, don't tell policy on LGBT military service when she got to the Senate in 2009. She made a name for herself in the Senate by addressing sexual assault in the military. She proposed legislation that would remove sexual assault cases from the military chain of command in 2013, legislation which was co-sponsored by Republican Senators Rand Paul and Ted Cruz. Although the legislation failed, it raised her profile as an advocate for women. Gillibrand has acknowledged her changed positions on immigration and gun control, saying in a 60 Minutes profile in 2018 that she was embarrassed and ashamed of her stances while serving in the House. Health care has been an important issue for Gillibrand since entering the Senate. She came out in favor of single-payer healthcare in 2017 and co-sponsored a Medicare-for-all bill introduced by Sen. Bernie Sanders. She was the first sitting senator to call for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to be abolished, a popular cause on the left. Controversy Gillibrand has faced criticism for representing cigarette manufacturer Philip Morris during her time at Davis Polk, including in civil and criminal investigations by the Department of Justice. She has also been accused of political opportunism for changing her positions so dramatically when she entered the Senate. The New York senator has alienated some in her party with her hardline position on responding to sexual misconduct.
Additionally, Boehner told reporters Thursday, I am highly skeptical that they can do this administratively.
There are states where Republicans are actively purging voter rolls right now, Obama told the crowd. This kind of politics is not conservative, he said. It's radical.
Before we leave this topic, is there anything that you would like to add?
The president said that he's urging the Supreme Court to overturn the Affordable Care Act when it's taken up in the Supreme Court later this year. What's your position? Is that something the Justice Department will continue to back?
I am not trying to boast, but I have to admit that for an uneducated son of an immigrant I could have done far worse, Aznavour said.
President Donald Trump: --spied on my campaign and they got caught--
Until that system is fully running, the administration won't be able to verify how many of the consumers who signed up for Obamacare insurance are, in fact, paying their premiums and are hence truly enrolled.
There have been promises kept, including the confirmation of Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch.
It's always important when we have elections and when things are occurring in America that involve diversity, that we have diversity, said McDaniel. It's a shame that the DNC put so much pressure on candidates to raise money, raise money, raise money, raise money, and we talk about Trump being a billionaire and having no sensitivity, then why is it that we as Democrats are putting so much attention and so much focus on who can raise the money?
SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Yeah. You know, I don't think you can make apples to apples comparisons across these clinical trials. People focused on the fact that the J&J vaccine was seventy-two percent effective in the United States at protecting against moderate to severe disease and the mRNA platforms, Moderna and Pfizer were ninety-five percent protective. And so, you know, there was a presumption that, well, maybe the J&J vaccine isn't as protective. I think that we need to look at what the vaccine is doing. It does appear that the J&J vaccine is inducing what we call a T cell response, meaning that it's protecting against disease. It might not be protecting as well against infection, but it does seem to be protecting very well against moderate to severe COVID. And, in fact, in the clinical trial, no patients who received the vaccine were hospitalized or died from-- from COVID. And so that's a really good outcome from the clinical trial. We also need to keep in mind that the J&J vaccine is a one dose vaccine. They have a study underway looking at two doses. So, it may well be the case that if you get two doses of that J&J vaccine, which may, eventually, be how we end up using it, it'll be just as protective as the other vaccines. But it's a very good development.
Never before have Arizonans sent a woman to the Senate, and our latest poll shows the two are just 3 points apart, which is within the margin of error. About one-third of Arizona voters will be making choices based on local issues but about two-thirds will be voting on national issues.
GOVERNOR NED LAMONT: At this point, it's seventy-five and above, just because, as you point out, you know, eighty percent of the fatalities are related to that narrow group. Then we'll probably go down to sixty-five and above. Most of those folks have comorbidities. And then we'll look at essential workers in a broader group from there. But we can expand quickly if we get more vaccines.
The variant of the virus first detected in the U.K. is now in fifty countries. Senior foreign correspondent Liz Palmer reports from London.
Because I assure you Donald Trump and the Republicans' media machine will do it.
The president tweeted early this morning There is nothing nice about searching for terrorists, and in a tweet about airport detentions related to his executive order Friday banning travel from seven countries, he said, Only 109 people out of 325,000 were detained and held for questioning. Big problems at airports were caused by Delta computer outage.
Russia hasn't paid any attention to ISIS. They're interested in keeping Assad in power. So I, when I was secretary of state, advocated and I advocate today a no-fly zone and safe zones. We need some leverage with the Russians, because they are not going to come to the negotiating table for a diplomatic resolution, unless there is some leverage over them. And we have to work more closely with our partners and allies on the ground.
National Democrats encouraged Beshear, the state's attorney general, to take on Bevin by building off the support of teachers and state workers. According to Robert Goe, a former Republican candidate for state representative, Beshear's strength among public sector workers has helped keep Beshear competitive.
In July, California small business owner Stephanie Mufson wasn't sure if her company Parade Guys, which builds floats and large displays for outdoors festivals, would make it. She's an independent artist and typically works with a team of contractors who are experts at painting, sculpting, and building floats for outdoors festivals and parades in the San Francisco Bay Area.
MARGARET BRENNAN: And that's where the AMI disclosure matters.
Lesley Stahl: Sounds like you're not sure.
Donald Trump responds to shooting of police officers in Baton Rouge.
She also worked on TV specials starring Ray Charles, Perry Como and Petula Clark, and the films Half a Sixpence, Frank Zappa's 200 Motels, Man of La Mancha and Yentl. Last month, Lloyd Webber renamed his New London Theatre the Gillian Lynne Theatre, making it the first in London's theater district named after a female artist.
The city saw a declining population due to the loss of factory jobs, but it has increased since Buttigieg took office. He has focused on improving higher education and health care in the city. In the video announcing his exploratory committee, Buttigieg emphasizes the need for a fresh start in American politics. He also discusses the issues important to him as a member of the millennial generation, saying: We're the generation that lived through school shootings, that served in the wars after 9/11, and we're the generation that stands to be the first to make less than our parents. Unless we do something different. Controversy Buttigieg has very little controversy around him, other than his age and sexual orientation, which some consider to be automatic strikes against him. In his first term as mayor, he dealt with a scandal at the local police department, which led him to demote the first African American chief of police of South Bend. What Trump says President Trump has not tweeted about or insulted Buttigieg as of now.
Any form of outsized federal spending would likely juice the economy even more by spurring investment and hiring. But it will have a downside: rising interest rates. Unless the Democrats can wrangle a partial repeal of last year's tax cuts or institute a new tax on wealthier Americans — possibilities Wall Street views as unlikely — further spending will have to be deficit-financed. Meanwhile, the deficit has tripled since 2007, and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin recently surpassed his predecessor's record for the amount of of notes and bonds the government issues to fund its debt.
Fifty percent of Americans think stricter gun laws will help at least somewhat to reduce gun violence, while nearly as many - 48 percent don't think stricter laws will help much. There is greater support for better mental health screening: more than three in four Americans think better mental health screening would help to prevent gun violence, including 45 percent who think it would help a lot.
Just hours before her 69th birthday, Hillary Clinton got a political gift Tuesday evening -- an endorsement from British singer Adele to a packed Florida arena.
9:19 p.m. With us tonight is one of the toughest people ever to serve in this House -- a guy who took a bullet, almost died, and was back to work three and a half months later: the legend from Louisiana, Congressman Steve Scalise, Mr. Trump said. In the aftermath of that terrible shooting, we came together, not as Republicans or Democrats, but as representatives of the people. But it is not enough to come together only in times of tragedy. Tonight, I call upon all of us to set aside our differences, to seek out common ground, and to summon the unity we need to deliver for the people we were elected to serve.
CBS News' team of fact-checkers are listening closely to both candidates and will be posting here when their statements need additional scrutiny.
I don't know whether this will pay for itself or not, but I do know that this is going to create the kind of growth we need to get out of the hole we're in, Ryan said at the time.
Sanders says his system would provide health care coverage to all Americans, eliminate co-pays and deductibles, and bring health care spending under control.
Polls close at 7 p.m. ET on Tuesday, but in-person early voting was open from May 30-June 16, and over 140,000 cast early ballots -- including 36,000 who didn't vote in the April primary -- according to the Georgia secretary of State. In the primary, 192,000 voters cast ballots, including 52,000 early voters.
MARGARET BRENNAN: But you weren't able to do that with a Republican majority in both houses. Now you have a Democratic majority in the House.
I don't wanna get into particular individuals.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION. We go now to Miami, still a hotspot for COVID-19. Mayor Francis Suarez is there. Good morning to you, Mister Mayor.
Correction: This transcript has been updated to accurately reflect one of William Barr's responses regarding whether Michael Flynn lied to investigators. Barr in two instances referred to a close question, not a closed question.
Wilson pointed to President Ronald Reagan's unambiguous repudiation of the Ku Klux Klan. In a 1984 letter to Morris Abram, then-vice chairman of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, Reagan disassociated himself with the Klan and other hate groups, writing:
Price says he doesn't know for certain but he suspects that is the case, pointing to similar contributions from drug and health companies to the campaigns of other members of Congress.
President Trump's reelection campaign is pouring cash into digital and television ads in the wake of the impeachment inquiry, but CBS News Political Unit associate producer Ben Mitchell says data collected by left-leaning digital strategy firm Bully Pulpit Interactive (BPI) shows the campaign is largely targeting its base, not persuadable voters.
The health care law offers subsidized private insurance to people who don't have access to job-based coverage, provided that they are citizens or legal immigrants, and fall within a certain income range. The GAO report raised numerous questions about the government's system for verifying eligibility for those benefits.
The former vice president then seemed to compare his long political resume to Buttigieg's.
Trump's campaign schedule is less strenuous compared to the rest of the Republican field as well. Until recently, Trump did one massive event a day at about 7 p.m. -- a little like primetime programming. Even now, with the Iowa caucus less than two weeks away, he tops out at two or three events a day while other candidates sometime squeeze in five or six.
This is an unprecedented line item in our budget, to put $9 million dollars aside to make sure that voters know exactly when and how to vote. We certainly don't want to get to the middle of November and say that voter confusion was our Achilles heel, DCCC Chairwoman Cheri Bustos said. The group has also invested $10 million in ballot access litigation in 14 states.
In New Hampshire, gubernatorial Democratic candidate Andru Volinsky was condemned by the Manchester Black Lives Matter chapter on Wednesday, after he opposed Republican Governor Chris Sununu's nominations of two black appointees to statewide positions, according to CBS News political unit broadcast associate Aaron Navarro.
JOE BIDEN: I'm not watching this at all. I go out-- I'm running for the same exact reason when I started: to restore some dignity to the office, to make sure that African-Americans and minorities get treated well, and this time when we rebuild the middle class get brought along, and to unify the country and the party. Nothing's changed why I'm running. I'm going to continue to do that.
And now we turn to our political correspondent Ed O'Keefe, who is out in Las Vegas getting ready to head to South Carolina. Ed, good morning to you. What does Joe Biden need to do to challenge Sanders' front-runner status?
President Trump's ratings are low among most demographic groups, with majorities of both men and women, and most Americans of all racial backgrounds and age groups disapproving. Only a majority of Republicans, conservatives, and white evangelicals approve. Whites without a college degree – whose votes helped Mr. Trump win the presidency - are divided today.
Lesley Stahl: This was the message of your campaign.
Lesley Stahl: You have these wings-- AOC, and her group on one side--
The bill would change the formulas for health insurance tax credits to make them more generous for most people, and also allow a wider number of individuals to qualify. That makes coverage more attractive for people who are considering whether to buy and more affordable for those who already have it, mainly low-to-moderate income working people.
SENATOR JOHN BARRASSO: Well, get-- there are people working on this to get to a conclusion so the government will remain open which is what I believe the American people would prefer.
There was always a hope that we were going to be able to return and build on where we started in 2009-2010, and we finally got to a place where it was possible, said Judy Solomon of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. Her organization advocates on behalf of low-income people and was an early supporter of the health care law.
Lesley Stahl: Well, there's no-- real evidence of that.
It's not exactly an accident that Nancy Pelosi became speaker, given how she grew up. Politics was the family business: her father, Thomas D'Alesandro, was a congressman from Baltimore and then the mayor.
Neil Simon Rene Perez/AP Photo Although he was known for memorable comedic moments, prolific playwright and screenwriter Neil Simon (July 4, 1927-August 26, 2018) had a difficult childhood growing up in the Bronx, as his father frequently left the family. Humor helped get him through the difficult times. Well, it explained things to me anyway, he told Sunday Morning in 2006. It made it easier to deal with if you were able to laugh at it. Simon often used his own experiences for comic material, from Biloxi Blues to Brighton Beach Memoirs and Broadway Bound. Writing gags for TV, especially Sid Caesar's Your Show of Shows, would also inspire his play Laughter on the 23rd Floor. Many of his biggest Broadway hits, including Barefoot in the Park, The Odd Couple, Last of the Red Hot Lovers, Sweet Charity, The Prisoner of Second Avenue, Plaza Suite, The Sunshine Boys and Chapter Two, would be adapted for films and TV. He also wrote original screenplays, including After the Fox, The Heartbreak Kid, The Out-of-Towners and The Goodbye Girl. In all, Simon earned four Oscar nominations, won three Tony Awards and a Golden Globe, and received the Pulitzer Prize (for Lost in Yonkers). Being the toast of Broadway meant something quite personal for Simon. As he told Sunday Morning, Many times I would go to the theatre and stand in the back and people would come up and they say, 'How do you know my father?' 'How do you know my cousin?'
Jason Kelly: And so suddenly, we have this new class of medicine. And we just have never made it at a big scale before. So everybody started workin' on al-- all parts of that problem to try to fix it. We're happy to do our-- our small piece of it and-- and-- and try to scale that up.
Added Julie Bataille, a spokeswoman for the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, We are confident millions more Americans will continue to enroll. Bataille declined to say, however, whether the administration still expects to reach its initial goal of getting 7 million Obamacare enrollees this year. The total number of enrollees grew by about 900,000 between the end of January (3.3 million) and the end of February (4.2 million).

PAUL RYAN: The bill we passed paid troops. It pays the park service. It pays the border patrol. It pays people doing basic health research.
SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR: There's always room to work on things but the best way and what I believe will happen is this will be stayed in court. So, it continues to take effect. Then it will go up on appeal. It will be upheld. But what we should be doing is governing from opportunity and not chaos. That means doing something about pharmaceutical prices and passing my bill to allow Medicare to negotiate for less expensive drugs for our seniors and letting less expensive safe drugs come in from other countries so that we can actually have competition, doing something about premiums with reinsurance and some of the things going on in the states. So, yes there are things to do but we should be working to improve the Affordable Care Act not just throw it out and set it on fire.
Amy Klobuchar Klobuchar announces 2020 presidential bid 25:20 Biography Amy Klobuchar was born in Plymouth, Minnesota, in 1960. Klobuchar has written about her troubled family life as a child in her book, The Senator Next Door: A Memoir from the Heartland. Her father, Jim, was an alcoholic who frequently spent time away from family and was arrested for drunk driving. He and Klobuchar's mother, Rose, divorced when Klobuchar was 15. The divorce took a toll on her family, causing her younger sister, Beth, to drop out of high school. Although Klobuchar's parents reconciled a few years later, she has written that her relationship with her father was not repaired until he quit drinking in the 1990s. Klobuchar attended Yale University and University of Chicago Law School. She returned to Minnesota after graduating and worked for a private law firm. Her experience of being forced to return to work one day after giving birth inspired her to become politically active and advocate for a maternity leave bill in the state legislature. Klobuchar was elected Hennepin County attorney in 1998. She was first elected to the Senate in 2006, and won re-election in 2012 and 2018. Klobuchar and her husband, John Bessler, have one daughter. Bessler is a private practice attorney and a professor at the University of Baltimore School of Law. The three-term Minnesota senator launched her presidential campaign on Feb. 10 under frigid temperatures and relentless snowfall in Minneapolis.
So I believe that this election has become in part so — so conflict-oriented, so intense because there's a lot at stake. This is not an ordinary time, and this is not an ordinary election. We are going to be choosing a president who will set policy for not just four or eight years, but because of some of the important decisions we have to make here at home and around the world, from the Supreme Court to energy and so much else, and so there is a lot at stake. It's one of the most consequential elections that we've had.
No one will ever love you the way they loved my father.... I wish I had been given more Saturday's with him. Maybe spend yours with your family instead of on twitter obsessing over mine? Meghan McCain tweeted in response to Mr. Trump on Saturday. The president replied by retweeting someone who said WRONG Meghan! Millions of Americans truly LOVE President Trump, not McCain. I'm one!
SEN. SCOTT: Well I know- I know- I know in the end the White House is going to have to have their plan and I know it's going to be difficult with Nancy Pelosi. But what I'm going to focus on is how do you drive down costs? The Democrats constantly focus on access. The problem is the cost of health care is too high in this country. That's why I put a bill out this week that requires transparency at the pharmacy, at the- with the insurance companies and says we're not going to allow pharmaceutical companies to charge us more than what they charge in Europe. I had the same issue when I ran a large hospital company. And I said- I did the exact same thing, I said I had hospitals in Europe. I said I'm not paying more for drugs in Europe than I'm paying in the United States. It's- it's not- it's not fair to Americans and that's why I'm going to work hard to get that passed--
On Tuesday, McConnell laid out how the trial will progress. He said the Senate will hear arguments by the parties, conduct a written question period, and then address what he called the more contentious issue of witnesses.
If Democratic gubernatorial first-time candidate Christine Hallquist wins the Vermont primary on Tuesday, she will be one step closer towards becoming the nation's first transgender governor. As the Washington Post points out, The country is seeing an increase in potentially historic candidacies across many demographics, including the LGBTQ community.
Ockerman added that the reforms are common sense and he hopes the reforms will be seriously considered by Ohio's legislature before the legislature recesses for the summer.
SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Well, I think we could definitely have it in time for the fall. We need to come up with a regulatory framework that allows the boosters to be licensed on the ability to demonstrate that they can produce antibody levels. And FDA is working on that. They've talked about developing guidance that would allow companies to develop boosters to the existing vaccines that could be licensed just on the basis of proving that in three hundred or four hundred patients, they can induce antibody levels at a sufficient level that are protective against these new variants. And so I think that framework is going to be mapped out and the companies have said they're already working on those new boosters. We could have them in time for the fall across all these vaccines. There's no reason we can't do that. And the platforms that the companies use to develop these vaccines, these synthetic platforms, lend themselves to those quick adaptations.
Today, the President also announced plans to visit Keystone, South Dakota ahead of the fourth of July, for a fireworks display at Mount Rushmore National Memorial. I'm going to go there on July 3rd and they're gonna have the big fireworks, the President told podcast host Dan Bongino.
In Wyoming, six candidates are competing for the Republican gubernatorial nomination, including businessman Foster Friess, state treasurer Mark Gordon, and attorney Harriet Hageman. The seat is expected to stay in Republican hands.
The Republican National Committee and the Republican Party of California spent nearly $1 million in support of Garcia. The investments included field staff, four different unique pieces of mailers that went out to about 100,000 voters and data to target voters needed for turnout. The Republicans working on this race made over 1.4 million voter contacts in the district and the team sent over 300,000 texts to voters in CD25.
SENATOR MARCO RUBIO: --in light of the fact that in other places carbon emissions continue to grow. And, by the way, technology is moving us in the direction that those who support those measures want us to go anyways.
But in ruling the individual mandate unconstitutional, the question is whether the rest of the law has to be struck down, as well. The district court will now consider that question — whether the other aspects of the law can remain in place.
The Trump campaign launched a website on Christmas Eve to help the president's supporters win arguments with their liberal snowflake friends and family over the holidays.
Tyler, a former longtime aide to Gingrich, is not affiliated with the Gingrich campaign, as PACs are prohibited with coordinating directly with the candidates they support. Super PACs are able to collect and spend unlimited funds in support of a candidate.
As public health officials warn it could be months before life in the U.S. can begin to return to normal, House Democrats have started working on a fourth legislative package that would focus on the recovery phase of the epidemic and provide assistance for health care workers. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi suggested the next measure would include an infrastructure component, which seems to have Mr. Trump's backing.
He wants you to believe that he's not under investigation, he said. Why would an undercover FBI agent posing as a contractor give him a $1,000 ticket to 'Hamilton?'
SEN. KLOBUCHAR: --and that's why I want to move forward, as president, with comprehensive immigration reform.
The committee leadership was also asked about the stalled passage of a COVID-19 stimulus bill, after some House Democrats in swing seats voiced displeasure with how negotiations were going. Bustos put the onus on Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.
Pence said he honestly never thought he'd be standing there as Trump's running mate.
For decades, open borders have allowed drugs and gangs to pour into our most vulnerable communities. They've allowed millions of low-wage workers to compete for jobs and wages against the poorest Americans. Most tragically, they have caused the loss of many innocent lives.
Trump, for his part, praised his wife's speech on Twitter:
As a result, the number of uninsured Americans rose in 2018, the first increase in 10 years. An additional 1.9 million people, including nearly half a million children, became uninsured last year, according to a Census Bureau report in September.
That opt-out process was the subject of a previous Supreme Court case, but the court, with only eight justices at the time because of the death of Justice Antonin Scalia, didn't decide the issue. It instead sent both sides back to see if they could work out a compromise.
The team posted its analysis the next day.
Right. Well U.S. Attorney Jensen since January has been investigating this. And he reported to me last week.
LANNY DAVIS: So the one thing I can't do, when I was his lawyer and now that I'm his adviser, is to get in front of Mister Mueller's findings. So, I can't answer your question, but I will tell you this.
This week, Judge Neil Gorsuch testifies at his confirmation hearings to be Supreme Court justice, filling the vacancy left over a year ago by the late Justice Antonin Scalia. The hearings begin Monday are expected to continue for several days. Day One will feature 10-minute opening statements by the members of the Senate Judiciary Committee, as well as by Gorsuch. On Day Two, the questioning begins.
The result is a laundry list of warnings for all health care consumers, not just those who buy insurance on the ACA exchanges. Here's a closer look at the latest changes to the health insurance marketplace:
Klobuchar, who is expected to tout her moderate politics and Midwestern roots on the campaign trail, denounced the polarization in Washington and the divisiveness in political discourse.
I think that some of the characterization to me personally is unfair. I do understand the concern, Buttigieg said. What I said in that comment before I became mayor does not reflect the totality of my understanding then, and certainly now, about the obstacles that students of color face in our system today.
3. How will Republican campaigns use Trump in the general election?
Good morning and welcome to FACE THE NATION. It was a big win for Senator Bernie Sanders in yesterday's Nevada caucuses with half of the precincts reporting he stands at forty-seven percent. Well behind him is former Vice President Joe Biden with nineteen percent, followed by former South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg with fifteen. Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren stands at ten percent followed by Amy Klobuchar with five percent. And Tom Steyer with four percent. CBS News elections and surveys director Anthony Salvanto is here to tell us more. Anthony, what is behind the senator's decisive win?
Yes, there is question, Cruz said.
I don't know Putin, but wouldn't it be nice if we could get along actually? he said in Albuquerque, New Mexico, in October 2016.
Those visits are happening as week-to-week coronavirus cases are on the rise – the deciding factor for Theresa Costanzo: Mainly the virus, how that's been handled. I know that I can't even get a test even if I want a virus test, I've not been able to get one.
For McCain, it was always about the issue, seldom about who sided with him. He could be Senate's fiercest critic, but he loved the place, respected its rules and maintained friendships with his toughest opponents — like the late Democratic senator, Ted Kennedy.
I want to start with you, Caitlin. You had Bernie Sanders, the senator, on the show saying that a woman he knows, Lucy Flores, a Nevada politician, and has in the past endorsed he has no reason not to believe her allegations of inappropriate touching that she says were--
These reforms will also support our response to the terrible crisis of opioid and drug addiction. Never before has it been like it is now. It is terrible. We have to do something about it. In 2016, we lost 64,000 Americans to drug overdoses -- 174 deaths per day; 7 per hour. We must get much tougher on drug dealers and pushers if we are going to succeed in stopping this scourge.
Promising brain cancer trial gets breakthrough status from FDA
STEPHEN MILLER: --last year-- last year, a hundred thousand unaccompanied alien children or children traveling with adults showed up at our southern border.
Many of the Republican candidates seemed determined to lead us right back into the past, she said. Without naming him, Clinton called out Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, who has yet to announce his bid for the Oval Office, for his suggestion of a constitutional amendment to reinstate the power of the states to define marriage.
Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who joined the conversation from a Maryland hospital where she was being treated for an infection caused by a gallstone, commented to the government's top Supreme Court lawyer, Solicitor General Noel Franciso, You have just tossed entirely to the wind what Congress thought was essential, that is that women be provided these .... services with no hassle, no cost to them.
While in New Hampshire on Wednesday, where next week's first-in-the-nation primary will be held, Biden went after the top two finishers by name in his remarks, a tactic he has rarely used on the campaign trail.
Last week, the Senate voted on a tailored $500 billion coronavirus relief measure put forth by Republicans, but the bill was blocked by Senate Democrats, who said it did not do enough. The GOP, meanwhile, accused Democrats of refusing to compromise.
SEN. KLOBUCHAR: That was a yes--
As a result of the Supreme Court's action in the legal fight, Democrats won't gain access to the materials until after the November 3 election. If Mr. Trump loses the White House or Republicans take control of the House, it could foreclose the need for a ruling from the Supreme Court.
Otto Warmbier was a hardworking student at the University of Virginia -- and a great student he was. On his way to study abroad in Asia, Otto joined a tour to North Korea. At its conclusion, this wonderful young man was arrested and charged with crimes against the state. After a shameful trial, the dictatorship sentenced Otto to 15 years of hard labor, before returning him to America last June, horribly injured and on the verge of death. He passed away just days after his return.
COOPER: We brought up the e-mails.
SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: Well, I think that's a decision for the vice president to make. I'm not sure that one incident alone disqualifies anybody but her point is absolutely right. This is an issue not just the Democrats or Republicans the entire country has got to take seriously. It is not acceptable that when a woman goes to work or is in any kind of environment that she feels anything less than comfortable and safe. And this is an issue the entire country has got to work on.
Mr. Trump's claims about it taking 10 years to get a permit approved for a simple road suffers from a lack of data, and the Washington Post has also critiqued previous comparisons of this nature, pointing out that previous comparisons of this nature do not compare like with like. Mr Trump is contrasting the swift construction time of a pre-planned project which may have taken years to come to fruition with the planning time it takes to bring a project to the construction phase. -- Markham Nolan
President Donald Trump: No, no. It's wrong.
MARGARET BRENNAN: But you still will stick with age as the determining factor at this point?
Analysis on that story and others, are just ahead on FACE THE NATION.
Tyler argued that after the first round, delegates who had come to the convention bound to vote for Romney would drop him for an alternate candidate.
The Health and Human Services Department reported Wednesday that just over 106,000 people have enrolled in plans on the new marketplaces so far -- well below the approximately 500,000 enrollees the administration was expecting to see in the first month of open enrollment.
He slammed Clinton for planting the seeds for Obamacare, implementing President Obama's foreign policy record and turning her back on Americans in Benghazi. Rubio said Trump is committed to cutting taxes, and taking threats from Islamic radicals seriously.
COOPER: Have you ever done those things?
I always felt John McCain had no more fear of death than he had of taking on an uphill political fight, and to the end he fought every fight with every ounce of energy that time allowed.
I'd rather answer that at a little bit different time. We're looking at a lot of different things, including Cabinet, the president said. Soon after, the president announced Whitaker's appointment on Twitter.
10:17 p.m. ET Eric Trump said Wednesday night that it's time for a president with common sense.
PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: COVID relief has to pass. There's no if, ands, or buts.
What Congress says about U.S. strike in Syria
MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be right back in a moment.
Big city mayor accused of sexually abusing teen in 1980s
Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, one of the plaintiffs, applauded the ruling in a statement. Our lawsuit seeks to effectively repeal Obamacare, which will give President Trump and Congress the opportunity to replace the failed social experiment with a plan that ensures Texans and all Americans will again have greater choice about what health coverage they need and who will be their doctor, Paxton said.
John McCain: Yeah, exactly. One criteria to feeding people that are under my situation, it has to taste lousy.
The interesting thing is he said 'that I've ever worked with,' Cruz said of Boehner. I've never worked with John Boehner. The truth of the matter is -- I don't know the man. I've met John Boehner two or three times in my life. If I have said 50 words in my life to John Boehner I'd be surprised, and every one of them has consisted of pleasantries.
The President and the Senate have been clear that they won't accept this kind of game-playing, and if these bills were to come to the President's desk he would veto them.
JONAH GOLDBERG: And so you have this, sort of, cross messaging going on where the situation down there is very, very dire. Added to the problem is that while I'm sympathetic to the idea of more border security, a wall isn't what's going to solve the actual crisis that's going on down there. That requires a change in policy, a change in law, and so none of the messaging is lining up with the reality on either side.
Following the shootings in San Bernardino last week, Americans are on the alert when it comes to terrorism in this country. Forty-four percent of Americans think another terrorist attack in the U.S. in the next few months is very likely, a 16 point jump from two weeks ago and the highest percentage since right after the September 11, 2001 attacks. Eight in ten think an attack is at least somewhat likely.
There are many things to do, but most urgent is to repeal and replace Obamacare, he said in his first major address as speaker at the Library of Congress. We think this problem is so urgent that, next year, we are going to unveil a plan to replace every word of Obamacare.
TRUMP: Of course I do. Of course I do. And so do all of her donors, or most of her donors. I know many of her donors. Her donors took massive tax write-offs.
During Barrett's confirmation process, Democrats argued a vote to confirm her was effectively a vote to kill Obamacare and strip protections from millions of people with pre-existing conditions. But Barrett declined to give any indication of how she would rule in the case and went to great lengths to separate her past writings on the 2012 Supreme Court decision upholding the law from the current dispute before the high court.
RADDATZ: Mr. Trump, Secretary Clinton, we want to get to the audience. Thank you very much both of you.
However, some of his decisions as governor, including his backing of a controversial union legislation, have garnered opposition in Washington. What Trump says Mr. Trump has yet to tweet about Inslee or his presidential aspirations. In February 2018, however, the Washington governor confronted the president in the White House about his idea to arm teachers in the wake of multiple deadly school shootings. I just suggest we need a little less tweeting here and a little more listening. And let's just take that off the table and move forward, Inslee told the president during a meeting with other governors in the East Room. Although he initially pushed back by saying he supported arming certain teachers, Mr. Trump listened with his arms crossed while Inslee pleaded for him to drop the idea and embrace other gun control measure
President Donald Trump: I doubt it. I doubt it. I really doubt it.
MARGARET BRENNAN: On those particular things though, would it provide maternity care?
A White House statement early Wednesday denounced Ryan's proposal as nothing more than vague and recycled ideas to take health insurance away from millions and increase costs for seniors and hardworking families.
Health care markets have other problems as well, such as patients not knowing enough about treatments to be informed consumers. But government regulations or, as in most other developed countries, government-managed health care systems, can help to make these markets work better.
JOHN DICKERSON: But are they complicit in murders and--
Despite Mississippi's well-earned reputation as a Republican stronghold, Democratic gubernatorial candidate Jim Hood is a formidable candidate. The four-term attorney general won every county in the state for the primary, and by a wide-margin in previous state elections despite Mississippi's pronounced conservative lean.
... whereas Biden has been much more heavily focused on, sort of, core issues of healthcare and COVID response.
Kayleigh McEnany: You're welcome and the Vice President will be with you shortly.
The fact that you're going to amend the Constitution on judicial independence is kind of a stretch, he said.
Protests led to the Black Lives Matter demonstrations, that provided a background for a presidential election. The 2016 campaign was like no other in modern history. Loud, angry, divisive, and in its wake, wave after wave of disruption.
RADDATZ: Thank you, Mr. Trump. I want to move on. This next question from the public through the Bipartisan Open Debate Coalition's online forum, where Americans submitted questions that generated millions of votes. This question involves WikiLeaks release of purported excerpts of Secretary Clinton's paid speeches, which she has refused to release, and one line in particular, in which you, Secretary Clinton, purportedly say you need both a public and private position on certain issues. So, Tu (ph), from Virginia asks, is it OK for politicians to be two-faced? Is it acceptable for a politician to have a private stance on issues? Secretary Clinton, your two minutes.

Insurers are hoping that the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services will be able to quickly update HealthCare.gov software, allowing the companies to promote lower premiums and attract more consumers while the current sign-up window remains open. The industry also wants the agency to automatically adjust what existing customers are paying, sparing millions the headache of having to go back and reapply.
MILLER: --in the categories that correspond with these loopholes and the interventions- reckless, lawless interventions of district court judges. And this president has taken historic action to stem the tide of illegal immigration and to fight for working people in this country.

Michigan is one of the states that recently made it easier to vote by mail. In 2018, voters passed a ballot measure to allow for no-excuse absentee voting, which led to an explosion in absentee votes in the state's presidential primary earlier this month. Nearly 40% of the people, or 876,845, voted absentee in that election. That was almost double the number of absentee votes from the 2016 presidential primary in Michigan. Jocelyn Benson, Michigan's Secretary of State, told CBS News campaign reporter Adam Brewster that the big challenges for expanding access to voting by mail are educating voters about the process and securing the infrastructure to tabulate votes securely and quickly. That includes providing postage on ballots, ballot tracking technology, more access to high-speed ballot processing and counting machines and, in some cases, hiring more workers to process the ballots. Those of us who have been doing this work for a long time know exactly what we need and the tools we need for the most part to administer elections by mail or where the majority of citizens are voting by mail in a crisis like this, Benson said. The gap in between what we know needs to happen and our ability to make it happen is all in funding. While it took longer for Michigan to report its full results due to the influx of ballots, Benson said communities that were staffed similar to general elections were typically better equipped to handle the increased number of absentee ballots.
This is a dangerous liberal agenda and it's time for change, he said. We need to end sanctuary cities, keep dangerous people out of our country and secure our borders once and for all.

Short-term plans have been known to play fast and loose with the pre-existing loophole in the fine print. Some policies deny coverage for minor health conditions such as allergies or even if a patient had symptoms of a health condition but didn't seek treatment, according to Families USA.
4:05 p.m. Asked what he has learned in his first year as president, Mr. Trump said, I've really learned a lot. You know, governing -- when you're a businessperson, you don't have to worry about your heart, the heart. You really do what's best for you -- you know, for almost purely monetary reasons. You know, you make your money. You competing against people. In many cases, you don't like them, you want to beat, and all that stuff. And I build a great company -- far better than anybody at this table says. I mean, I have some of the greatest assets in the world. I've built a great company, he said.
Speaker Nancy Pelosi: Well, I think that it--

And, you know, we've been trying to keep our inmates as safe as we can. We let a lot of inmates who are older and don't pose a threat to the community, we've put them on home confinement to get 'em outta the institutions. So we're taking every measure we can to protect those inmates.
Nearly three-fourths of the states have expanded Medicaid to low-income adults under the Obama health law. In those states, low-income adults can qualify for free or very low cost coverage. There is no sign-up deadline. The Kaiser foundation estimates that nearly 13 million people who lost job-based insurance are eligible for Medicaid. But that option is not available in most Southern states, as well as some in the Midwest and Plains, because they have not expanded Medicaid.
They're just making it up, he added.
Trump, who officially received the GOP presidential nomination Tuesday night, warned about the threat of terrorism in the U.S. and around the world, illegal immigration, violence across the nation's communities and President Obama's and Hillary Clinton's foreign policies.

Nicolas Roeg Wenn/Photofest via AP Images Nicolas Roeg (August 15, 1928-November 23, 2018) had already written himself into the film history books when he shot second-unit footage for David Lean's epic Lawrence of Arabia, and was cinematographer on The Masque of the Red Death, Fahrenheit 451 and Petulia. But by 1970 he had turned to directing himself, with the Mick Jagger film Performance. He would later direct David Bowie in the sci-fi classic The Man Who Fell to Earth. Known for provocative stories, he was perhaps best known for the 1973 thriller Don't Look Now, based on the Daphne Du Maurier tale, about a couple (Donald Sutherland and Julie Christie) mourning their daughter's death, who encounter strange goings-on with a psychic in Venice. Other notable credits include Walkabout, set in the Australian outback; Bad Timing: A Sensual Obsession; Insignificance; and Roald Dahl's The Witches. Much of Roeg's acclaim for his work, from critics, other filmmakers, or ticket buyers, came after-the-fact, long after his films first hit screens, a fact that did not strike him with pleasure in a 2011 Guardian interview, when it was suggested he was ahead of his time. I hate that expression, Roeg said. I don't want to be ahead of my time. This is my time. It's Marmite, isn't it? You like it or you don't.
MARGARET BRENNAN: But in hindsight, you know where this story ends up.

They also called for an investigation into whether banks played favorites with wealthier customers and whether companies with political connections received priority access to loans. Ware noted that his office had been proactive in releasing fraud schemes related to PPP and had been the first to commission reports on waste, fraud and abuse in COVID-19 funding.
MARGARET BRENNAN: And so that could be anything from a short term continuing resolution that takes us right up to the beginning of a- of the Democratic majority in January? Or, I- I mean, what wiggle room is there here?
Less coverage for pre-existing conditions. The requirement that insurers must provide coverage to people with preexisting conditions, at the same price as healthy people, is one of the most popular aspects of the Affordable Care Act, even among members of Congress who have sought to repeal Obamacare. But short-term plans are exempt from the pre-existing condition rule. They can refuse an applicant with a health condition or offer a policy that does not cover the condition specifically.
Mr. Trump told reporters during a GOP Conference Friday he thinks COVID-19 will go away without a vaccine. I feel about vaccines like I feel about tests, the president said. This is going to go away without a vaccine. It's going to go away and we're not going to see it hopefully after a period of time. You may have some flare-ups, I guess. Trump campaign officials met at the White House with the president on Thursday ahead of an eight-figure ad blitz targeting Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee. Senior campaign officials confirm to CBS News campaign reporter Nicole Sganga the Trump campaign is exploring ways for the president to return to the campaign trail as states reopen amid the coronavirus pandemic. No campaign events have been formally announced. Mr. Trump has made clear he misses large rallies and hopes to return to the trail ahead of the November election, telling Fox News on Sunday, I would hope that within maybe the last couple of months, we'll be able to do rallies in various states. Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale announced on Twtter that new campaign branded masks will be available to supporters soon. On Friday, Mr. Trump said he does not know if a sexual allegation made against Biden is true. That's a battle he has to fight, Mr. Trump told Fox News. I've had many false accusations made. I can tell you that many – and maybe it is a false accusation, frankly, I hope it is for his sake.
So, tonight, I call on Congress to empower every Cabinet Secretary with the authority to reward good workers and to remove federal employees who undermine the public trust or fail the American people.
Ward, an osteopathic doctor, is a former state senator who challenged Sen. John McCain in the 2016 Republican primary. McCain went on to win the race handily, but the contest boosted Ward's name recognition and endeared her to the party's grassroots.
If you ask most New Hampshirites, they would tell you we're first anyway, Susan Jamback, chair of the Bow Democrats, said. Iowa doesn't really allow their residents to vote. The caucus is not fair and it doesn't make sense. A victory in Iowa is meant to give the winning candidate momentum heading into New Hampshire's February 11th primary and the contests that follow. But New Hampshire does have a history of ignoring the results out of the Hawkeye State. In 2016, for example, Senator Bernie Sanders won New Hampshire handily after losing to Hillary Clinton in Iowa. In 2008, New Hampshire went for Clinton in an upset after then-Senator Barack Obama won the caucuses. The last Democratic candidate to win both contests in a contested primary was John Kerry in 2004.
And that call, there was nothing wrong with it whatever. In fact, it was laudable. He-- and it was nothing inconsistent with the Obama administration's policies. And it was in U.S. interests. He was saying to the Russians, you know, Don't escalate. And they asked him if he remembered saying that, and he said he didn't remember that.
Yes, Trump opponents can argue that any failure on his watch is a Trump failure. And Trump's own confusing tweets and self-contradictory messaging made a shutdown more likely in the waning days.
But the fact is his personal relationship with the president had been fraught. Last summer, he wrote an op-ed saying the president is, quote often poorly informed and can be impulsive.
TRUMP: China this year in trade will make over $500 billion dollars in terms of our trade deficit. $500 billion. That's no partnership, and I'm a free trader. I love free trade. But we have to use our head. And we use political hacks to negotiate with the Chinese.
JAMELLE BOUIE (The New York Times/@jbouie/CBS News Political Analyst): Right. One interesting thing about Sanders this time around versus 2016 is how he has sort in the-- in the interim really developed foreign policy ideas, really put himself out there as someone who was trying to lead the Democratic field on foreign policy specifically an agenda that treats authoritarian regimes, global kleptocracy, all these things as part of a singular challenge for the United States to face, but threatens global stability and American democracy and it's--
The court ruled 7-2 that the Department of Health and Human Services had the authority to carve out the exemptions to the Affordable Care Act's contraceptive mandate, marking a win for the Trump administration and religious liberty. Justices Elena Kagan and Stephen Breyer joined the Supreme Court's conservative justices in upholding the Trump administration's statutory authority to exempt certain employers from the mandate, but did not join the majority opinion.

Still, the Texas court case would potentially eliminate many more ACA provisions, including the premium subsidies so many exchange customers rely on, essential health benefits and Medicaid expansion, said Eliot Fishman, senior director of health policy at Families USA. That said, Fishman believes the court case will take time, so consumers who are planning on signing up for exchange coverage for 2019 at the end of this year should not be dissuaded from doing so.
Since Day One, the Trump Administration has sought to lift burdens on religious exercise for people of all faiths, the White House said in a statement. As the Supreme Court has previously stated, protecting the ability of people to worship and live according to the dictates of their conscience is part of 'the best of our traditions.' The court's decision today carries forward that noble tradition.
Eric Trump: So we have an amazing company. You know, one of, I think, the fortunate things for my father and our father is that he was able to step out of the company to run for commander-in-chief. And I think he's going to rely on us more than ever. And--
Added Sen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., There's no way Congress is going to repeal protections for people with pre-existing conditions who want to buy health insurance. The Justice Department argument in the Texas case is as far-fetched as any I've ever heard.
Democrats hope that if Senate Republican candidates follow Heller's lead and embrace Trump on the campaign trail, it will ultimately hurt them in the general election, especially in states like Nevada, Arizona, and Florida, all of which have changing demographics. Sunday, potential 2020 hopeful Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Massachusetts, who Mr. Trump again referred to as Pocahontas, traveled to Nevada to support fellow Democrats and condemn the President's zero tolerance on the border.
Do you see how diplomatic I've become? Trump said in Sarasota. Because at the last rally we had one person. We had 15,000 people, we had one person who was really, really being bad.

The report looks at three big changes under Mr. Trump that affect former President Barack Obama's health care law. They are congressional repeal of the law's unpopular fines on people who go uninsured, association health plans for small businesses that can be marketed across state lines, and low-cost short-term health insurance that doesn't have to cover pre-existing conditions or basic benefits like prescription drugs.
The Democratic-friendly AFL-CIO endorsed Biden today for president. The mega-conglomeration of unions represents more than 12 million Americans and endorsed Hillary Clinton in 2016. CBS News first reported that Biden joined a private phone call with the union's top leadership following the endorsement where he thanked the group for their support and then briefly turned his attention to President Trump. Mr. Biden told the union leadership that the president has blown the pandemic response. He also scoffed at Mr. Trump's tweets on MSNBC anchor Joe Scarborough pushing a conspiracy theory that blames the former Florida congressman for the death of a congressional aide in 2001. Biden said, He's doing everything in his power now, he's accusing Joe Scarborough of murder…

I felt I was in a different role as his colleague, that I'm someone that has worked with him for a long time, there's a lot of trust there, and I felt it was best to handle it in that way, Klobuchar told CNN at the time about why she did not call on him to resign. Klobuchar has also faced scrutiny over several news reports detailing a pattern of abusive treatment towards her staff, which has reportedly hindered her efforts to recruit campaign personnel. What Trump says A few hours after her announcement, President Trump mocked Klobuchar for discussing efforts to mitigate climate change during a Midwestern snowstorm. Amy Klobuchar announced that she is running for President, talking proudly of fighting global warming while standing in a virtual blizzard of snow, ice and freezing temperatures. Bad timing. By the end of her speech she looked like a Snowman(woman)! the president tweeted.

He and his team went back last week to cover the trip of WHO experts who have been trying to get into that country for a year now to investigate the origins of the virus. Today, that team of investigators was allowed into the seafood market in Wuhan where scientists believe the virus first spread. Here's Ramy's report.

Mr. Trump sometimes claims his administration eliminated the individual mandate, which isn't entirely accurate. The Trump administration eliminated enforcement of the penalty for the individual mandate, effectively rendering it useless.
Over the long holiday weekend and after 74 days of social-distance campaigning from his Delaware home, Biden made his first public stop for Memorial Day, CBS News campaign reporter Bo Erickson reports. Biden and his wife, Dr. Jill Biden, laid a flower wreath at a Service Memorial near their home. The stop was short but we got to see how Biden could return to public campaign stops this summer. There were two lines of pandemic protection for the Bidens: They both donned dark face masks and Biden's Secret Service detail, who were spotted for the first time since dispatched to him as the presumptive nominee, provide a built-in social distancing perimeter. This quick stop comes after Biden's campaign has zeroed in on Mr. Trump's golfing and as they try to move past Biden's comments on Friday questioning black voters who support Mr. Trump. For Memorial Day, read our story on how Joe Biden a few times on the trail shared more about his late son Beau Biden as he explained he believes the large burn pits during Beau's service in Iraq contributed to his fatal brain cancer in 2015. Biden admitted he can't prove the connection, but ahead of the fifth anniversary of Beau's death on May 30th, our story details how Biden hopes to help the thousands of veterans who say they also have been impacted by the overseas burn pits.
TRUMP: No, I'm a gentlemen, Hillary. Go ahead.
Conservatives tend to have more faith in the ability of markets to self-correct when problems exist, and less faith in government's ability to step in and fix market failures without creating even more problems. Honest differences on this point are likely, but there are certainly cases where most people would agree that some sort of action is needed to overcome significant market failures.
Also a tenured professor of economics at Morningside College in Sioux City, Iowa, currently on unpaid leave, Clovis told Inside Higher Ed that Trump would fight Hillary Clinton's plan to offer a debt-free public college degree for 80 percent of American families and President Obama's proposal to offer free community college courses.
In our drive to make Washington accountable, we have eliminated more regulations in our first year than any administration in the history of our country.

COOPER: Secretary Clinton, you can respond. Then we have to move on to an audience question.
Conservatives believe that calls for increased civility are really code for You shut up while we bash you as bigots. When op-ed writers insist it's time to turn down the rhetoric, they're speaking exclusively about the rhetoric from the Right. Conservative talk radio could shut down tomorrow and President Trump would still be called a fascist in the pages of the Washington Post and denounced as a traitor on CNN.

We've had to get very, very creative with executive powers to try to figure out what we can do to substantially affect the health care costs and bring it down through executive action, Meadows said. It's more of an executive action with a legislative component that is more visionary.
As the 2018 midterm elections loom, the partisan divide dominates the political landscape, and each side views the other with suspicion. Most Republicans believe people protesting against President Trump are being irresponsible and dangerous. Half of Democrats say the same about attendees at President Trump's rallies. In each case, these partisan views run counter to Americans' overall, who see both as generally safe and responsible.

In an article published Tuesday, former Congressman Henry Waxman, former Health and Human Services Deputy Secretary Bill Corr and former adviser to the Department of Health and Human Services Kristi Marin expressed similar concerns even while praising the overall efforts. As a package, the proposals could help decrease patient costs for drugs and reduce federal spending … but it's likely that more policies will be needed to control the drivers of drug spending, the trio wrote.

Number three, women can't be charged more than men for our health insurance, which is the way it used to be before the Affordable Care Act. Number four, if you're under 26, and your parents have a policy, you can be on that policy until the age of 26, something that didn't happen before.

With visits from both the president and vice president this week, the political battleground state of Wisconsin is back in the spotlight, report CBS News campaign reporters Musadiq Bidar, Adam Brewster and Nicole Sganga.

In the internal poll, for districts with incumbent Democrats 45% of respondents said they approve of the job of their Member of Congress, 25% disapprove and 30% didn't know enough to give a rating. The poll was conducted in 41 districts Trump won in 2016 and 16 districts Clinton won, where the battle for the House in November could play out.
JOHN DICKERSON: So, these people you're talking about are the ones who would like to tell a pollster they're going to vote, they feel it's their civic duty, but Election Day comes around, they're busy, they got a couple of jobs, whatever, they're not making it. So, these are the people who are the key to what you have identified which is maybe that's the key to whether the repub-- the Democrats take the House or not.
President Donald Trump: Take a look. Yesterday we were in Arizona, record-setting rallies. Numbers of people like nobody's seen before.
For decades, open borders have allowed drugs and gangs to pour into our most vulnerable communities. They've allowed millions of low-wage workers to compete for jobs and wages against the poorest Americans. Most tragically, they have caused the loss of many innocent lives.
MARGARET BRENNAN: But they need the help right now. They're trying to open schools Monday.
I don't really have a label that I can put on myself, Kethledge said at the time. What I would say is that obviously first and foremost I'd follow Supreme Court precedent. The other thing I would say is that again, I would make sure that the values that I would be enforcing if I were a judge are not just my values. I'm not striking something down simply because I don't like it. That is a counter-majoritarian aspect of our system of government. I would start with the text.
JOHN DICKERSON: Yeah. Well, you have a chance to talk about this on the other side of the commercial. We'll do the solutions. So, we'll be back in just a moment with more from Senator Sasse.
If no candidate does this, the state House of Representatives gets to pick the governor. Republicans hold a 74-44 majority in the state House, which could allow them to pick Reeves even if Hood wins more votes. However, a federal judge recently expressed grave concern about this quirk of the Mississippi electoral system, signaling that courts could get involved if the rule is activated, and an appeal is made.
Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden on Sunday called on the Senate to reject President Trump's nomination of Judge Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court, zeroing in on an upcoming challenge to the Affordable Care Act to accuse Republicans of trying to exploit a loophole to strike down the law.

Last year, Ryan was on duty when he saw a pregnant, homeless woman preparing to inject heroin. When Ryan told her she was going to harm her unborn child, she began to weep. She told him she didn't know where to turn, but badly wanted a safe home for her baby.
President Donald Trump, who has repeatedly complained about the Fed moving to hike rates, renewed the attack Monday. He said in a tweet: It is incredible that with a very strong dollar and virtually no inflation, the outside world blowing up around us, Paris is burning and China way down, the Fed is even considering yet another interest rate hike. Take the Victory!
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-New York, said Thursday morning that the House CR would not be acceptable to Senate Democrats.

Kavanaugh, who clerked for Kennedy, is a well-known conservative jurist who has served on the D.C. Appeals Court since 2006. A graduate of Yale and then Yale Law, Kavanaugh went to work for independent counsel Ken Starr after his time with Kennedy, and assisted with Starr's investigations into President Bill Clinton. He was also the lead author of the Starr Report, which famously recounted Clinton's extramarital affairs in sometimes lurid detail.
Lesley Stahl: You said that it was, Gonna be great, you said It's ready, It's gonna be ready--

A NPR/PBS/Marist poll released Wednesday found 38 percent of registered voters approve of the president's job performance, while 53 percent disapprove. (That survey also had some interesting findings on the public view of Republican efforts to overturn Obamacare.)
Cynthia K. Dias Whitehouse.gov Cynthia K. Dias is a Navy veteran and registered nurse. She now lives at Veterans Village in Las Vegas and works there as a volunteer.

Paul Allen Microsoft As teenagers in Seattle, Paul Allen (January 21, 1953-October 15, 2018) and Bill Gates were passionate about the workings of computers and coding. Their idea to take computers out of university and research labs and put them in people's hands was sparked in 1974, in Boston (Gates was then attending Harvard, Allen was a college dropout), when they came across a notice for a new small computer sold to hobbyists, the Altair. In eight weeks Allen and Gates wrote code that could run on the Altair and pitched it to the company. It was the birth of Microsoft, a giant in personal and business computing. After creating the code MS-Basic, Microsoft developed and refined the operating system for IBM computers, which became the core of IBM PCs and clones. By 1991, Microsoft's operating systems (and such programs as Word and Excel) were used by 93 percent of the world's personal computers. Allen was Microsoft's executive vice president of research and new product development until 1983, when he resigned after being diagnosed with cancer – and he pursued a wide range of interests with the passion of a cancer survivor. To be 30 years old and have that kind of shock – to face your mortality – really makes you feel like you should do some of the things that you haven't done yet, Allen said in a 2000 book, Inside Out: Microsoft in Our Own Words.
8:00 a.m. ET The theme for the convention's second night is Make America Work Again, focusing on economic issues and, according to the RNC, solutions to job-killing regulations and legislation like Obamacare.
When asked by Bowman to let him back inside, Hal flatly responds, I'm sorry, Dave, I'm afraid I can't do that. Excerpt: Douglas Rain as Hal in 2001: A Space Odyssey Rain would return as Hal in the 1984 sequel, 2010, and was heard in an uncredited performance as a computer in Woody Allen's Sleeper. He also narrated the Oscar-winning 1975 documentary, The Man Who Skied Down Everest. And Hal's flat delivery would inspire Anthony Hopkins' performance as serial killer Hannibal Lecter. Given his half-century career as a stage, radio and TV actor, Rain was dismissive of his immortal performance in 2001, which encompassed two days in a sound booth being fed lines by Kubrick. If you could have been a ghost at the recording session, Rain recalled for the 2010 Odyssey Archive blog, you would have thought it was a load of rubbish.
House Republicans left the Capitol after the vote, headed to the White House on buses. Scalise said they were invited to the Oval Office or the Rose Garden.
Well, here, the pandemic is a natural disaster, just like a flood. Well, the thing that's different is the flood is over in a day or two with this pandemic is continued on now for almost a year, and it's still going, and so this isn't a bailout. It's a normal and usual thing after other natural disasters. — Mayor Jeff Williams of Arlington, Texas. On the size and scope of the bill: In the midst of uncertainty, there are legitimate reasons that people are saying it's better to go to big than too small. It's better to be safe than sorry. I think pretty much everybody somewhere deep down knows that this bill is bigger than it needs to be and certainly far less targeted than it needs to be. — Maya MacGuineas, president of Citizens for a Responsible Federal Budget.
On the issue of abortion — key for many conservatives — Kavanaugh dissented from a recent ruling requiring an undocumented immigrant minor who wanted an abortion to be granted access to one. The D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals overturned the decision by a three-judge panel of the same court that included Kavanaugh.
Seong-ho traveled thousands of miles on crutches all across China and Southeast Asia to freedom. Most of his family followed. His father was caught trying to escape and was tortured to death.
Also on Friday, a Pennsylvania state court rejected an appeal effort from the Trump campaign over Philadelphia's elections officials not allowing poll watchers in satellite elections offices. The campaign had argued that offices qualify as polling places and therefore poll watchers are allowed in them. The offices allow people to register to vote, apply for a ballot, receive it, fill it out and return it in one trip. Philadelphia's elections officials, the top state elections official and then a Philadelphia judge each said they do not qualify as polling places. A three-judge Commonwealth Court panel today decided that the lower court was correct because the judge's opinion, thoroughly discusses, and correctly disposes of, the legal issues before this Court, wrote Judge Ellen Ceisler in the concurring opinion. Two GOP congressional candidates have a similar lawsuit on going federal court in the Western District of the state.
When UnitedHealth (UNH), the nation's largest health insurer, announced earlier this month that it would exit the Affordable Care Act exchange business in all but three states, the obvious question was, who's next? After all, if the nation's biggest health carrier can't make the Obamacare exchanges profitable, who can? UnitedHealth announced it expects to lose $650 million on its ACA business in 2016, although its first-quarter earnings beat analyst expectations, thanks to the company's highly profitable consulting and technology businesses.
RADDATZ: And, Secretary Clinton, let me ask you about that, because you have asked for an increase from 10,000 to 65,000 Syrian refugees. We know you want tougher vetting. That's not a perfect system. So why take the risk of having those refugees come into the country?
Republicans are frustrated, Ryan said, because the GOP has not controlled the White House in seven years. The newly-elected speaker suggested his party will have to offer concrete plans in order to win it back.
We have more work to do to finish our long fight to provide universal, quality, affordable health care to everyone in America, Clinton said in the statement. Already, the Affordable Care Act has expanded coverage to 20 million Americans. As president, I will make sure Republicans never succeed in their attempts to strip away their care and that the remaining uninsured should be able to get the affordable coverage they need to stay healthy.
It's a terrible thing, it's a very scary thing, Mr. Trump said of the situation, Friday. With that, Biden's going to have to go out and fight his own battles.
Young patriots like Preston teach all of us about our civic duty as Americans, he said. Preston's reverence for those who have served our Nation reminds us why we salute our flag, why we put our hands on our hearts for the pledge of allegiance, and why we proudly stand for the national anthem.
SENATOR RICK SCOTT: Why are drug prices going up the way they have?
Washington — Top health care officials in the Trump administration said Wednesday they are not aware of a health care plan to replace the Affordable Care Act from the White House, revelations that come as President Trump and his top aides continue to assert a proposal will soon be unveiled.
Release of the report came as the House Energy and Commerce Committee held a hearing on the Department of Health and Human Services budget.
Maine, Nevada, North Dakota and Virginia each have one Senate primary election on Tuesday. In North Dakota, Democratic incumbent Sen. Heidi Heitkamp is running unopposed, and Republican Rep. Kevin Cramer is expected to win the primary on Tuesday.

Gorsuch sided with Hobby Lobby in the Obamacare contraception case and wrote a book about assisted suicide that indicated his pro-life views. Before joining the bench, Gorsuch took few if any controversial positions as a D.C. lawyer in private practice or during his brief stint in the civil division of the Justice Department under former President George W. Bush.
Anyone claiming that America's economy is in decline is peddling fiction, the president said after rattling off a list of favorable economic statistics. Later in his speech, he waved off all the rhetoric you hear about our enemies getting stronger and America getting weaker.
CAITLIN HUEY-BURNS: And I think when you look at the two, Biden and Buttigieg, this boomlet that he is having shows that there is no front-runner in this Democratic field. It's pretty amazing that you have a former vice president, a popular former vice president, who hasn't cleared the field. And you're seeing other candidates, Bernie Sanders among them, Beto O'Rourke, raising vast sums of money on a grassroots level. And it allows for some of these other candidates, lesser known, to try to make an impact that way because there is no clear front-runner and voters are trying to assess. We'll get a better idea of that with the fund-raising numbers that are coming out, especially as the party is very much focused on these small dollar donations.
Former Rep. Tom Davis, R-Va., who once headed the House GOP's campaign organization, said Republicans would have owned health care and steadily growing insurance premiums had they successfully enacted legislation. Instead, he says, They may or may not own the outcomes, adding, I don't think it's a silver bullet for Democrats.
TRUMP: A lot of my — excuse me, Anderson — a lot of my write- off was depreciation and other things that Hillary as a senator allowed. And she'll always allow it, because the people that give her all this money, they want it. That's why.
Price denied that he had engaged in any insider trading or other conflicts of interest, saying that his investment portfolio was managed by a broker and he had no knowledge about the stocks that were bought in his name. As the New York Times reported earlier this week, Price had bought and sold stocks worth more than $300,000 over the last four years -- including shares of at least two health companies that could have benefited from legislation Price championed while in Congress.

It's true that a number of candidates are just returning to New Hampshire after a weeks-long absence. The impeachment trial benched the four senators running for president for most of January while most of their rivals for the nomination focused on Iowa. Klobuchar spent just one day in the Granite State in the lead-up to the impeachment proceedings.
COLUMBUS, Ohio - Campaigning in Ohio on Saturday, Rick Santorum displayed his culture-warrior side in full force, as he harshly attacked President Obama by suggesting the president wanted to see more disabled babies aborted and accusing him of projecting his values - which Santorum claimed were not rooted in the Bible - on the Catholic Church.

Belief that global warming is a man-made phenomenon has risen across the board politically, though most Republicans continue to remain skeptical. Most Democrats (85 percent) and independents (60 percent) think global warming is caused by human activity. But while most Republicans believe global warming exists, just 34 percent think it is caused by human activity. Instead, 51 percent say it is caused by natural patterns in the earth's environment.
Other names floated to CBS News as potential court picks for Biden included federal court judges Kentanji Brown Jackson and Tanya Chutkan, both Obama appointees to the federal bench.
RAMY INOCENCIO: Yang Min's daughter died, she says, because whistleblowers were muzzled. In state propaganda, only the positive is told. From a new patriotic documentary for the nation to a massive COVID exhibition in Wuhan. It praises China's president, Xi Jinping, for victory over the virus. And it is a reality one year later, there has been restoration to society after catastrophe. Resumption of movements after isolation, and recovery from tragedy for the city of eleven million on the banks of the Yangtze, still looking for answers about COVID, now living almost as if it never happened.
Insurers say they are losing too much money to stay put. Aetna reported it has lost $430 million on its exchange business since 2014. Other leading insurers have also reported big losses.
JOE BIDEN: The White House is shedding light. The President is angry because the intelligence community, in fact, informed Bernie Sanders and I guess others and members of the Intelligence Committee that, in fact, the Russians want to see Trump reelected. And they like Bernie.
Critics of block grants say they'll provide much less money to states for Medicaid. In addition, states would likely no longer be required to uphold ACA standards for individual insurance, including coverage for essential health benefits and equal premiums for people with preexisting conditions.
He stepped away from GOP orthodoxy on entitlements, though, vowing to save Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid without cutting them (details on how he would accomplish that were vague.) And he took a few shots at his fellow Republican contenders.
They walked the plank on a disastrous economic agenda, said Charlie Kelly, executive director of the House Majority PAC, which backs Democratic candidates. He said the votes underscore a narrative of: Wait a minute, these guys are absolutely not standing with working families. They're trying to screw me on my health care.

Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota entered the 2020 presidential race Sunday with a speech in the middle of a Midwestern snowstorm, joining a record number of women in the most diverse Democratic primary field in U.S. history.
Obama also spoke about the growing economy and claimed credit for getting it moving it in the right direction. By the time I left office, wages were rising, uninsurance rates were falling ... and that's what I handed off to the next guy. So when you hear all of his talk about economic miracles right now, remember who started it.
This is, once again, an example of when a woman threatens Hillary Clinton, how she seeks out to demean her and take her down, he added. It's not going to work.
A way to overcome this problem is to create large pools that prevent people from hiding their health conditions and then choosing low-cost policies and then getting expensive care. And you can force insurance companies to cover everyone (preexisting conditions or not). These are also features of Obamacare.
Many economists and market analysts expect the Fed to slow the pace of interest rate increases next year to reflect what most forecasters say is likely to be slower U.S. growth.
And depending on the judge's decision, could charges be brought against General Flynn in the future for other actions he took during the presidential campaign or during the transition?

Time is short. Get-out-the-vote weekend starts now, and early voting continues in 37 states around the country.
Democrats, on the other hand, are trying to keep the focus on local issues in the hopes that they can cobble together enough voters to beat the GOP in these ruby-red states.
CAITLIN HUEY-BURNS: Well, Democrats have been saying since 2017 and the lead-up to the midterms that they wanted to focus on issues, mostly because the Mueller report, the conclusions at that time were unknown. And we saw health care as the top issue for Democrats in the 2018 election. It helped them to win back, you know, forty seats and, eventually, win back the House. They saw the President's unlikely pivot to health care as a welcome move from the President. And they believe that this is a winning issue for them. And it also removed some of the pushback or criticism that they would have been getting from Republicans who were kind of really eager not to talk about their own health care plans, but to harp on the Democrats' plans. You talked to Bernie Sanders earlier about Medicare for all, which has become, kind of, a baseline for entries--

Some Biden backers cited his time as vice president as reason enough to support him. Anna Jackson-Morris, 66, summed up her support as ride or die Biden because President Obama trusted him, therefore I trust him.
The Navy announced a plan to build up its fleet in late 2016, which would mean a 355-ship fleet by the 2030s. But Chief of Naval Operations Adm. John Richardson said in February that the Navy is open to reevaluating whether its plan for that many ships is necessary or sustainable.
The ruling Thursday by U.S. District Judge John Bates in Washington, D.C., is the second setback in a week for the administration's health care initiatives. On Wednesday another federal judge blocked Medicaid work requirements for low-income people.
Mac Miller Scott Roth/Invision/AP Rap artist Mac Miller (January 19, 1992-September 7, 2018) was known for his canny wordplay and artistic reinvention and his refusal to fit in an artistic box, wrote Rolling Stone. Born Malcolm James McCormick in Pittsburgh, he got his start in the music industry with the local independent label Rostrum Records, where he frequently collaborated with rapper Wiz Khalifa. His debut solo album Blue Slide Park debuted at the No. 1 spot on the Billboard album chart in 2011. In a 2016 Rolling Stone interview, Miller was asked to explain his neck tattoo of a lotus flower. He offered: A lotus flower shines most beautiful in the murkiest of waters.

Average premiums under the bill would increase in the nongroup market before 2020 and decrease after that, CBO said. Average premiums for single people under benchmark plans, for example, would be about 20 percent higher next year and 10 percent higher in 2019, compared to current law. By contrast, CBO said that in 2020, average premiums for single people under benchmark plans would be about 30 percent lower than under current law. By 2026, the analysis projects such premiums will be 20 percent lower than under Obamacare.
This weekend marks the beginning of Phase 1 for some states, as the federal guidelines on social distancing expires and some governors look to gradually reopen businesses in their states.

When the people of Iran rose up against the crimes of their corrupt dictatorship, I did not stay silent. America stands with the people of Iran in their courageous struggle for freedom.
Those remarks followed the Justice Department's filing Tuesday of a brief supporting the complete invalidation of the ACA, a departure from its previous stance that the individual mandate, requiring most Americans to carry health insurance, should be stricken down, but the rest of the law, including the protections for pre-existing conditions, should remain in place.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, actually, that was my point.
A CBS News analysis finds that out of the approximately 400 U.S. House, Senate, and gubernatorial primaries so far this cycle, 161 female Democratic candidates have advanced to the general election, compared to 50 Republican women candidates.
[Hood] has to have historically less-likely-to-vote people, show up to vote. It seems his task is harder. He's got to get the bump of African American turnout, he's got to get the bump of marginally engaged blue-collar Democrats in the state, or not get them to vote Republican, University of Mississippi political science professor John M. Bruce told CBS News.
Roy Clark CBS Country star Roy Clark (April 15, 1933-November 15, 2018) was a guitar virtuoso and singer known for such hits as Yesterday When I Was Young, Honeymoon Feeling, The Tips of My Fingers, Come Live With Me, and instrumental versions of Malaguena and Ghost Riders in the Sky. Clark played the guitar, banjo, fiddle, mandolin, harmonica and other instruments – skills that brought him gigs as a guest performer with orchestras, including the Boston Pops. In 1976 he headlined a tour of the Soviet Union. But his fame extended far beyond country radio, as host of Hee Haw. The country music variety show aired on CBS for two years beginning in 1969, before continuing for another 22 years in syndication, and for years after in reruns. Play an excerpt of Roy Clark performing Foggy Mountain Breakdown In his 1994 autobiography, My Life in Spite of Myself, the future Country Music Hall of Famer wrote that Yesterday, When I Was Young had opened a lot of people's eyes not only to what I could do but to the whole fertile and still largely untapped field of country music, from the Glen Campbells and the Kenny Rogerses, right on through to the Garth Brookses and Vince Gills.
An analysis from the Kaiser Family Foundation determined that a 40-year-old making $20,000 a year would see his or her tax credit drop from an average of $4,100 under Obamacare to $3,000 under the GOP plan.

You all know what's on the line. The future of education because it doesn't survive another four years under Matt Bevin. The future of rural healthcare because it doesn't survive another four years under Matt Bevin. We've got a governor that brags about prosperity, but do you see it right here?
Tillerson advances in full Senate; final vote expected this week
Our legal team thinks I can do that based upon the degree to which there's a crisis in those states, and how bad things are for the country. And if we don't do it what happens, Biden explained. Asked by CBSN political reporter Caitlin Huey Burns if he has confidence in the CDC and FDA regarding a vaccine, Biden said broadly, he does, but he questions some of the top political officials.
Though the two clashed on health care, education, guns and the economy, the same attack themes came up repeatedly in the debate: Democratic Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum called Republican former U.S. Rep.

Heading into Tuesday night, the fear among Republicans has been that, in the era of Trump, the GOP would experience a re-play of 2010 as primary voters chose candidates too Trumpy to win a general election.
MARGARET BRENNAN: The Trump-appointed official overseeing U.S. election security, Shelby Pierson reported to Congress that Russia was interfering in the election and has shown a preference for President Trump but sources tell our Major Garrett there was bipartisan push back on her assertions and questions about the strength of the evidence. Congress has requested to see the underlying intelligence to back up that assessment, which, as you heard, the National Security advisor said he had not seen. CBS stands by Major's reporting that the President was told Russia was trying to help him win. We'll be back in a moment.
Some groups complained that the opt-out process violated their religious beliefs and wanted to be relieved of even signaling their religious objection.

Well, you know, I don't wanna, you know, we're in the middle of looking at all of this. John Durham's investigation, and U.S. Attorney Jensen, I'm gonna ask him to do some more work on different items as well. And I'm gonna wait till all the evidence is, and I get their recommendations as to what they found and how serious it is.

Some of Trump's strongest supporters in 2016 were white voters without a college degree and that was no different in Missouri. Seven in 10 of these voters supported him, many living in rural areas. McCaskill has appealed to some of these voters in the past. While not winning a majority, about four in 10 of whites without a degree backed McCaskill in 2012 and 2006. She can't afford to lose too many of these voters, and at the same time, Hawley is looking to perform better with this group than McCaskill's past Republican opponents have. Nine in 10 black voters backed McCaskill in her previous elections, but black voters made up a slightly smaller share of the state's electorate in 2016 (14 percent) than they did in 2012 (16 percent), and an even smaller share in 2010 (13 percent), which was a midterm election. McCaskill hopes to drive up turnout among black voters.
Progressives warn if Biden is not elected, the Supreme Court's current 5-4 conservative tilt could balloon into a potential 7-2 majority if Ginsburg, 87, and Stephen Breyer, 81, choose to retire or face greater health troubles.
Trump explained that position by again citing the changed economic climate.
JOHN DICKERSON: Because I've looked at a lot of fact checks.
The case arose in the middle of the 2012 presidential campaign, in which Barack Obama was seeking re-election and the health care law also known as Obamacare was a major issue. Then, as now, the five conservatives were nominees of Republican presidents, while the four liberals were chosen by Democrats.
JOHN DICKERSON: Well, let me ask you about Congress though here. This has been a problem for a while, DACA, as has the Children's Health Insurance Program. In a functioning Congress when-- when DACA is thrown back into Congress to deal with, you work through the process, you get a piece of legislation, you vote on it. The same as with reauthorizing children's health insurance. Those things have not been tended to by Congress--
Claude Lanzmann AP Photo, Mark Terrill/Criterion Collection In his monumental, 9½-hour documentary Shoah (1985), French filmmaker Claude Lanzmann (Nov. 27, 1925- July 5, 2018) told the story of the Holocaust without resorting to archival photos, newsreels, actors or music – only images of the barren East European landscape where Nazi death camps were erected and where trains deposited detainees to the gas chambers, and the words of survivors (both the victims and the perpetrators of war crimes) laying bare their memories of a chilling inhumanity. The documentary, told through the unflinching testimonies of Jewish captives, German executioners, and Polish bystanders, was universally praised (Roger Ebert called it one of the noblest films ever made). For Lanzmann, who had been a member of the French Resistance, the topic of his long-in-production film (whose name translates as destruction) was death itself: Death rather than survival, he wrote in his autobiography. For 12 years I tried to stare relentlessly into the black sun of the Shoah.
A White House official confirmed that the two have fought over the administration's efforts to come up with a replacement to the nation's health care law, the Affordable Care Act. Politico first reported their battles over an Obamacare alternative, stating that Verma spent six months developing a proposal, only to have Azar scuttle it before President Trump could see it. According to Politico, Azar thought Verma's plan would end up strengthening the ACA, rather than replacing it.
MARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to Florida Republican Senator Rick Scott who joins us from Naples this morning. Senator, welcome to FACE THE NATION. You got your work cut out for you. President Trump said you are one of the senators in charge of coming up with a Republican alternative to Obamacare. When are we going to see your proposal?
I mean, it's — you know, and I've been saying at big speeches where I have 20,000 and 30,000 people, what do you have to lose? It can't get any worse. And she's been talking about the inner cities for 25 years. Nothing's going to ever happen.
William Goldman AP Photo Nobody knows anything. That was the sage advice of Oscar-winning screenwriter William Goldman (August 12, 1931-November 16, 2018) when asked for the secret of what made a successful film. He should have known; Goldman won Academy Awards for writing Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid and All the President's Men (for which he coined the immortal phrase Follow the money). He also wrote the screenplays for The Princess Bride, Marathon Man and Magic (each adapted from his own novels), Harper, The Hot Rock, The Stepford Wives, The Great Waldo Pepper, Misery and The Ghost and the Darkness, among others. After the Chicago-born Goldman received his master's degree from Columbia University in 1956, he penned a novel, The Temple of Gold, in under two weeks, and sold it to Knopf. More than 20 novels followed (some published under pen names), including Soldier in the Rain and No Way to Treat a Lady, both of which became films. Goldman found work in movies himself (as did his older brother, James Goldman, who would win the Oscar for adapting his historical play, The Lion in Winter). In addition to his own screenplays, he also found service as a highly sought-after script doctor on such films as A Few Good Men, Twins, Dolores Claiborne, Malice and Indecent Proposal.
10:23 p.m. ET Donald Trump makes a grand entrance to the convention as Queen's We are the champions plays in the background and introduces his wife, Melania Trump, who he says will be the next first lady of the United States.
Has this been one of the most consequential decisions that you have made as attorney general?
PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: The best way to describe them, to undo the damage Trump has done.
JOE BIDEN: --we alone were doing something.
Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Massachusetts, will bring an Iraqi refugee as a guest to the event and House Democratic women are planning to wear white to the address, which they said is the official color of the suffragette movement.
Sebelius said the administration is still building the portion of HealthCare.gov that would collect that information automatically. In the meantime, they're working with insurers to obtain it.
Bill Whitaker: What are those challenges?
Controversy Although she is likely to cite her long career as a prosecutor on the campaign trail, Harris is poised to face scrutiny from some progressives for her law enforcement work. Some factions on the left have denounced aspects of her record as a district attorney and state attorney general. Critics have pointed to California's overcrowded prisons and to her defense of controversial convictions to challenge the notion that she was a progressive prosecutor. If Kamala Harris wants people who care about dismantling mass incarceration and correcting miscarriages of justice to vote for her, she needs to radically break with her past, wrote law professor Lara Bazelon in an opinion piece for The New York Times. What Trump says Although Mr. Trump has not yet tweeted about Harris, the White House has previously criticized the California senator. In the summer of 2018, the White House Twitter account wrote, @SenKamalaHarris, why are you supporting the animals of MS-13? You must not really know what ICE does. Harris has said that lawmakers need to reexamine the role of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).
TRUMP: It is a disastrous plan, and it has to be repealed and replaced.
Arthur Mitchell Martha Swope/Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture, New York Public Library In 1986 Arthur Mitchell (March 27, 1934–September 19, 2018) told 60 Minutes correspondent Ed Bradley that, when he was a teenager, people did not encourage his pursuit of dance: Friends, people that you know in the business, they kept saying, 'Why are you studying ballet? There will never be a black man in the ballet until the year 2000.' And the minute they told me I could not become a dancer, that's when that something inside me said, 'Oh, really? I'll show you!' Born in Harlem, the son of a building superintendent, Mitchell rose to become a star performer with the New York City Ballet under George Balanchine, whose pairing of Mitchell with a white dancer in the late '50s was deemed audacious. Mitchell also choreographed his own works, performed on Broadway, and worked with dance companies in other countries. In 1968, committed to living up to the legacy of murdered civil rights pioneer Martin Luther King Jr., Mitchell started a school for classical dance at a time when few people of color were performing classical ballet (and even fewer were teaching it). It would grow into the Dance Theatre of Harlem, the country's first major African-American dance company. Mitchell would also introduce inner-city children to the arts via Dancing Through Barriers, a program that taught tens of thousands of kids every year in cities from New York to Miami to London.
Mr. Trump nominated Barrett for the Supreme Court on Saturday, kicking off what is sure to be an intense, partisan confirmation battle in the Senate just weeks before November's election.
The state's other senator - Majority Leader Mitch McConnell - accompanied Mr. Trump to his Kentucky rally.
A federal judge on Tuesday granted Wisconsin's request to withdraw from a multi-state lawsuit seeking repeal of the federal health care law and another lawsuit challenging a rule related to the law.
Yes, there's anger that his appointments aren't being held to a 60-vote standard, but that wasn't Trump's doing—that was Democratic Senator Harry Reid. As Majority Leader in 2013, he took one of those democracy's in peril! actions and invoked the so-called nuclear option of using a simple majority to change Senate rules on presidential appointments. While it's true that he didn't extend the rule at the time to Supreme Court picks, it's also true that Obama never had such a pick under the Reid Rule until after the GOP had taken control of the Senate.
Perfectly competitive markets have attractive features. They deliver goods and services to consumers at the lowest possible price, use resources efficiently and respond flexibly to changes in tastes and technology. And they do this without any need for a government central planner to direct their operation.
The case is separate from a challenge to the health care law that the court has agreed to hear in its term that begins in October.
I feel very confident that Joe Biden will be elected president on Tuesday, Pelosi said. We have to be ready for how we are going to go down a different path.
Delegates chanted on the floor, Lock her up, lock her up!
However, in an interview published in the May issue of trade journal Inside Higher Ed,Trump's education policy surrogate and campaign co-chairman, Sam Clovis detailed some of Trump's positions on higher education.
The analysis found about 150,000 people who live in states that did not expand Medicaid programs would fall into the coverage gap, meaning they are ineligible for Medicaid but have incomes too low to qualify for tax credits to help cover costs in the marketplace.
What it means to defund the police is being explored nationwide by some of the candidates running for district attorney and county prosecutor, the law enforcement officials who have the power to directly hold police accountable. Progressive candidates told CBS News they interpret the phrase to mean reallocating some police funds for health care and education. And many would also like to see police forces demilitarized, fewer non-violent crimes prosecuted and an end to the cash bail system.
SEN. SCOTT: And I know a lot of people liked it- like the grand bargains. I personally don't believe in grand bargains. I believe in piece by piece fixing things.
ANTHONY SALVANTO: Yeah, very much so. Like I said, at-- at historic levels at this point.
Rep. Jacky Rosen, D-Nev., seeking to oust GOP Sen. Dean Heller, has run an ad saying, Repeal and replace Sen. Dean Heller that highlights his support for repeal legislation after initially opposing it.
Critics point out that if it hadn't been for some of the Trump administration's moves to dismantle the law -- including eliminating the individual mandate that required people to sign up for health insurance or pay a tax penalty -- exchange shoppers would be seeing much more dramatic drops in premiums this year. A Brookings Institution report released in August concluded that without the efforts to eliminate or water down Obamacare, ACA premiums would have dropped an average of 4.3 percent for 2019.
President Trump and Republicans in Congress tried several times to repeal and replace the ACA in 2017, but were unsuccessful. The repeal of the individual mandate was included as part of the tax overhaul passed at the end of last year.
President Donald Trump: I think the way she locked down Michigan is a disgrace.
& tell all yr secrets bout yrself to yr face. For Colored Girls Who Have Considered Suicide/When the Rainbow is Enuf, which debuted in 1976, was only the second play by an African-American woman to open on Broadway (after A Raisin in the Sun). Written by Ntozake Shange (October 18, 1948-October 27, 2018), For Colored Girls is a musical choreopoem performed by African-American women, each identified only by the color that she wears. The play describes the traumas of racism, sexism, violence and rape. The show (in which Shange also appeared) won her an Obie Award, and when it transferred to Broadway was nominated for a Tony for Best Play, [It won for Best Featured Actress, Trazana Beverley.] An extremely influential work, it was made into a 2010 film featuring Thandie Newton, Tessa Thomspon, Whoopi Goldberg, Kerry Washington and Janet Jackson. Shange won her second Obie in 1981 for an adaptation of Brecht's Mother Courage and Her Children, and she penned several other plays, essays, poetry collections, novels and children's books. In 2017, as she recovered from health problems, including two strokes, Shange told the website Shondaland that while she could not dance anymore, which she found inhibiting, she nonetheless could still cut loose: I found that I can dance with my upper body, so I do that a lot. I have all my taxi drivers turn on the Latin stations, so I can dance in the backseat.
And we are serving our brave veterans, including giving our veterans choice in their healthcare decisions. Last year, Congress also passed, and I signed, the landmark VA Accountability Act. Since its passage, my administration has already removed more than 1,500 VA employees who failed to give our veterans the care they deserve. And we are hiring talented people who love our vets as much as we do.
Sue Ellen Allen - Criminal justice reformer Evan Vucci/AP Sue Ellen Allen of Scottsdale, Ariz., poses in front of the White House in Washington, Jan. 12, 2016. Allen is co-founder of a nonprofit, Gina's Team, that helps former prisoners re-enter society as well as a former inmate who made a new life for herself after being released from prison in 2009. Allen's organization helps support female prisoners in her state's prison system and once they're released. Gina's Team is named for Allen's cellmate who died in prison.
ROBERT O'BRIEN: The President made it very clear the last time we were closed to signing a deal with the Taliban and they-- they engaged in some malign activity, they-- they had a vehicle-borne IED that killed a number of people, including one American, and the President pulled back from signing the deal. We're hopeful that-- that we can get to a-- a place where the Afghans can talk with each other and negotiate some sort of resolution, a political resolution of the conflict. We've been there nineteen years. It's time for us to stop bringing our-- our sons and daughters home through Dover Air Force Base and dignified transfers. We've got to get out of-- of the war in Afghanistan, but we're going to do it in a way that protects American interests. So if the Taliban does not live up to their agreement on the reduction of violence plan, then we'll take a very care-- careful look at them. I think it'd be unlikely that we'd-- we'd sign a peace treaty, but we're not going to reduce troops to a level below what is necessary to protect American interests and our partners in Afghanistan. I can assure you of that.
Sen. Amy Klobuchar unveiled a plan on CBS This Morning Friday to provide a cure and treatment options for some of the most aggressive chronic conditions facing the country's elderly population, including Alzheimer's disease, by 2025. The 2020 Democratic presidential candidate considers the issue to be one that hits close to home; her father has struggled with Alzheimer's.
These four pillars represent a down-the-middle compromise, and one that will create a safe, modern, and lawful immigration system.
A dismal October wiped out most of the market's gains this year, while an elevated VIX, an index that measures market volatility, suggests more day-to-day mayhem is possible. The good news is that the stock market jitters will likely end as soon as the midterms do—regardless of who the winners are. Research shows that historically, nearly every U.S. election since the World War II has been followed by a so-called relief rally, where stocks rise at least modestly.
When I was secretary of state, I went around the world advocating for our country, but also advocating for women's rights, to make sure that women had a decent chance to have a better life and negotiated a treaty with Russia to lower nuclear weapons. Four hundred pieces of legislation have my name on it as a sponsor or cosponsor when I was a senator for eight years.
MARGARET BRENNAN: We're going to have to leave it there. Caitlin, good to have you on.
Don't like Trump's picks? Good news—the Constitution provides a simple solution: Elect more Democrats. That's how you fix the alleged problem—not by packing the court.
Arizona Secretary of State Katie Hobbs, a Democrat, has asked a federal court to dismiss a suit brought by members of the Navajo Nation who claim the state's election-day deadline for mail-in ballots violates the Voting Rights Act. CBS News campaign reporter Alex Tin reports the secretary's filing came as Chief Judge G. Murray Snow issued a rare rejection late Wednesday of a myriad of motions to intervene as defendants, including from President Trump's campaign and the Arizona Advocacy Network. Hobbs warned the court that changing the state's deadline mere weeks before Election Day could sow confusion in the electorate generally as well as among Navajo voters. The Navajo Nation has also distanced itself from the suit, according to a court filing, in a cease-and-desist letter warning the organization behind the suit against libel and defamation for initially claiming to represent the tribe as a whole.
While Mr. Trump has renewed his calls for the repeal and replacement of Obamacare, he and other Republicans have insisted that they support protecting coverage for pre-existing conditions. But if the ACA were to be invalidated as the DOJ seeks, insurers would not be required to cover pre-existing conditions.
Isiah Robertson AP Photo When he was 14, Isiah Robertson (August 17, 1949-December 6, 2018) survived a freak accident aboard a fishing boat off Louisiana, when a fuel can exploded, killing two coaches from his high school. Robertson swam two miles to shore. Life became very precious to me, he said of the experience to the Baton Rogue Advocate in 2017. I've been trying to give back all my life to thank God for sparing me and giving me an opportunity to have this unbelievable life and the great people I've met. An outstanding Southern University defenseman, and a first-round draft choice of the Los Angeles Rams in 1971, Robertson was one of the fastest NFL linebackers of his era. The Defensive Rookie of the Year, Robertson would be elected to the Pro Bowl six times, and finished his career with two seasons in Buffalo with the Bills. But he hit a wall with a crack cocaine addition after retiring from the game, at one point nearly dying from a beating by drug dealers who stuck a shotgun in his mouth and pulled the trigger; the gun jammed. Remembering his ordeal in the fishing boat, Robertson overcame his addition, and founded the House of Isaiah, a faith-based drug and alcohol treatment center in Mabank, Texas. More than 5,000 men have passed through his program, what Robertson called his greatest achievement.

Both tried to dismiss their previous statements and emphasize their current stance of wanting to secure the nation's southern border before any other actions are taken to address immigrants living in the country illegally.
The Washington Post has taken a look at this claim, which the president has made before.
In his book, Trump also called for a one-time, 14.25 percent tax on individuals and trusts with a net worth over $10 million, which the Club for Growth called a massive tax hike on Americans that would kill jobs and investment.
In an election cycle expected to have record Hispanic turnout, a conservative Hispanic group is endorsing three incumbent Republican senators facing high-profile reelection battles. The conservative LIBRE Initiative Action PAC is rolling out endorsements for incumbent Senators Cory Gardner in Colorado, Thom Tillis in North Carolina, and John Cornyn in Texas, reports CBS News political unit associate producer Eleanor Watson. But LIBRE is not yet weighing in on Arizona, a state with a competitive Senate match-up where Hispanic turnout is influential. Senator Martha McSally is facing a special election in November against former astronaut Mark Kelly.
But Eric Trump, the nominee's eldest son, trashed the speech as classless in a CBS This Morning interview.

JOHN DICKERSON: He says he wants it to be a referendum on him and it turns out the voters are seeing it that way.
In the case before the Supreme Court, Texas and other conservative-led states argue that the ACA was essentially rendered unconstitutional after Congress passed tax legislation in 2017 that eliminated the law's unpopular fines for not having health insurance but left in place its requirement that virtually all Americans have coverage.
Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson announced today that Michigan will be mailing all registered voters absentee ballot applications for the August primary and November general election, according to CBS News campaign reporter Adam Brewster. There are 7.7 million registered voters in Michigan and 1.3 million are already on the permanent absentee voter list. By mailing applications, we have ensured that no Michigander has to choose between their health and their right to vote, Benson said in a statement. Voting by mail is easy, convenient, safe, and secure, and every voter in Michigan has the right to do it. In 2018, Michigan voters passed a ballot measure that made the state a no-excuse absentee voting state, meaning anyone could request a mail ballot without a reason. This goes a step further to put the application in voters' mailboxes. During the March presidential primary, the first statewide election since the no-excuse absentee law took effect, 876,845 people returned absentee ballots. That was almost double the number from the 2016 presidential primary.
In an interview with the Christian Broadcasting Network set to air Thursday, Pence said the cases in which Roberts has joined with the liberal wing of the bench underscore the importance of the upcoming election for the future of the Supreme Court.
How can it get worse? he asked rhetorically. So, sure, I'm voting for Trump. Why the hell not?
The biggest winners will be the more than 11 million people already enrolled in Obamacare as well as those who are now shopping for HealthCare.gov coverage. Biden has opened up a special sign-up period through May 15.
TRUMP: It's just words, folks. It's just words. Those words, I've been hearing them for many years. I heard them when they were running for the Senate in New York, where Hillary was going to bring back jobs to upstate New York and she failed.
SUSAN GLASSER: --and also the politics.
Sister Wendy Beckett Victoria Arocho/AP She was a nun who became a television star, talking about art history and rhapsodizing about classical depictions of male and female nudes. Born in South Africa, raised in Scotland and educated at Oxford, Sister Wendy Beckett (February 25, 1930-December 26, 2018) was a sister of the Catholic Church who taught literature in Cape Town until she suffered three grand mal seizures and was diagnosed with a form of epilepsy. She returned to England in 1970, moving into a trailer on the grounds of the Carmelite Monastery in East Anglia. She would maintain the responsibilities of a hermitic life even after appearing as the host of a BBC documentary series, Moving Art, in 1991. Standing in front of paintings in her nun's habit, Sister Wendy discussed artwork without a script or teleprompter. The series was a hit, and made the 61-year-old an unlikely TV star. Her debut was followed by several other series, including Sister Wendy's Odyssey, and Sister Wendy's Grand Tour, in which she visited landmarks of art in Rome, Paris, Amsterdam, Florence, Berlin, Vienna, Madrid and elsewhere. She also wrote 15 books on art and religion.
It was that same yearning for freedom that nearly 250 years ago gave birth to a special place called America. It was a small cluster of colonies caught between a great ocean and a vast wilderness. It was home to an incredible people with a revolutionary idea: that they could rule themselves; that they could chart their own destiny; and that, together, they could light up the entire world.
The influential conservative group Club for Growth on Monday released a statement calling Trump a tax-hiking liberal whose open flirtation with single-payer health care and warm embrace of protectionism disqualifies him from consideration by conservatives.
Lesley Stahl: Hillary called you. Tell us about that phone call.
The agreement abides by the 2015 budget deal that alleviated federal spending caps that were put in place by a 2011 law.
That war also saw the first substantial combat use of the Air Force F-117 stealth fighter, which made it possible for the U.S. to lower risk to pilots flying against enemy air defenses while delivering precision weapons.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has since slammed the administration's attempts to repeal the ACA as declaring an all-out war on the health care of the American people.
PAUL RYAN: Look, I-- I'm not going to comment. I just saw that. I don't know if that's necessarily productive. It's no secret the president has strong views on immigration. But what is not productive is a pointless government shutdown that the Senate Democrats have foisted on this country.
The move by the nation's third-biggest insurer to leave 11 of the 15 states and almost 70 percent of the counties in which it participates on the exchanges comes on the heels of similar moves from Humana (HUM) and UnitedHealth (UNH). Aetna insures about 838,000 people through the exchanges.
From universities in the Research Triangle, to the Appalachian Mountains, to its craggy coastline, North Carolina has always been a study in contrasts. Personally, I'm supporting Donald Trump, said Ron Regular, while for Kathy Martin, it's Biden, Biden, Biden.

In 2008, then-Obama campaign manager David Plouffe accused Hillary Clinton's campaign of sharing a photo of the president in African dress. Politico noted that the photo in question showed Mr. Obama in the dress of a Somali elder during a 2006 visit to northeastern Kenya. Plouffe accused her campaign of circulating the photo in the most shameful, offensive fear-mongering we've seen from either party in this election.
JOHN DICKERSON: So your point is people can get more enthusiastic so they're snapping the lever off when they pull it, but it doesn't mean that an-- that an additional person is going to vote necessarily. Is there a way enthusiasm splits by party?
JOHN DICKERSON: But you're a politician.
Lesley Stahl: But I can't believe, after what happened in the Rose Garden here, after the announcement, with all the people getting sick--

Ted and Marco did a really good job, Trump said. Did quite well. One sentence right? Good.
Also staying in Des Moines, Amy Klobuchar will be holding a Thanksgiving dinner with family, supporters and media.

Mulvaney said that if the government shuts down, the effects will be different than the repercussions seen during the 16-day shutdown in October 2013. He claimed that the Obama administration weaponized the shutdown in 2013.
SENATOR RICK SCOTT: Look, let's focus on--
It's deplorable what he said. That's what I called it from the floor of the Senate seven months ago, the Georgia senator said during the interview, adding that said the President's weekend comments showed a lack of respect for McCain's service. However, he expressed opposition to naming the Russel Senate Office Building after McCain, saying that the proposal by Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer to do so was playing politics.
The outlook for the ACA and its health care exchanges may not be so positive past 2019. Ongoing legal and Congressional actions may affect the law's future and that of the health care exchanges, particularly for people with preexisting conditions.

Ed King AP Photo Guitarist and bassist Ed King (September 14, 1949-August 22, 2018) was an original member of the California psychedelic group Strawberry Alarm Clock, which had a hit with Incense and Peppermints in 1967. He joined the Southern rock band Lynyrd Skynyrd in 1972 and was part of the band's first three albums with their distinct three-guitar sound.

The president said he is working with McConnell, House Speaker Paul Ryan and other lawmakers to get the health care overhaul passed.
Now, she talks tough, she talks really tough against Putin and against Assad. She talks in favor of the rebels. She doesn't even know who the rebels are. You know, every time we take rebels, whether it's in Iraq or anywhere else, we're arming people. And you know what happens? They end up being worse than the people.

Just after Thanksgiving, an elephant with Trump: Make America Great Again painted on its side roamed the Sarasota Fairgrounds. Thousands of spectators gawked at the elephant, who was really just the opening act for businessman and Republican candidate Donald Trump. Then, as the soundtrack from the movie Air Force One blared, Trump's helicopter landed, and the candidate alighted to address the overflow crowd and give helicopter rides to children -- Gorgeous, wonderful, but only really well-behaved.
Republicans continue to use Pelosi as a foil, with Mr. Trump arguing in Nevada yesterday that a vote for Jacky Rosen is a vote for Nancy Pelosi.
Last August, I said that any of the Republicans running would be better than Hillary Clinton. I meant it then, and I mean it now. So let me be clear: a vote for anyone other than Donald Trump in November is a vote for Hillary Clinton, he added.
On the heels of the first Democratic debate of the year, which featured no candidates of color, Mitchell reports that South Carolina state Representative Annie McDaniel, a vocal Booker supporter, said that his run was important in part because of the diversity he brought to the race.
TRUMP: You did that. Wait a minute. One second.
Roberts and the court's conservative wing also formed a 5-4 majority in finding states cannot disqualify private religious schools from receiving public money.
Republican Governor Matt Bevin's latest pitch to Kentucky voters could be summed up with two signs at his rally last Saturday.
But on the number of regulations withdrawn, Mr. Trump's claim can be determined using figures from an OMB database for President Trump, Barack Obama, George W. Bush and five years of Bill Clinton's presidency. Over the course of these presidencies, the database shows the following numbers for withdrawn regulations:
We think the case against Flynn for false statements should be dismissed, as far as the Department of Justice is concerned.
But the international community is skeptical. The investigation has been long delayed. China has been accused of repeatedly blocking access. Beijing has pressed an anywhere but China origin story. The Biden administration says Chinese officials are spreading misinformation.
His change of heart may have come about after he spoke with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell Monday afternoon. McConnell told reporters that in a good conversation with Mr. Trump, I pointed out to him, the Senate Republicans' view on dealing with comprehensive health care reform with a Democratic House of Representatives -- so I made it clear to him, we were not going to be doing that in the Senate.
Slotkin tells voters in the ad about how her mother lost her job -- and her health insurance -- and had no health insurance when she was diagnosed with ovarian cancer several years later. Slotkin moved up the date of her wedding to ensure her mother could see her married. The ad shows video footage of her mother at the reception, telling her daughter and new husband, Seeing the love between the two of you is the thing that get me through the terrible months in the hospital.
Lesley Stahl: If the president wanted to have a rapprochement with you, would you be receptive?
When you're a star they let you do it. You can do anything, Trump was heard saying on a hot mic, as he talked about women to Access Hollywood reporter Billy Bush. Whatever you want. Grab 'em by the p***y.
There's been tremendous divisiveness -- not in the last year. There's been tremendous divisiveness for many years, he said. I would love to be able to bring back our country into a great form of unity...Without a major event where people pull together, that's hard to do. But I'd like to do it without that major event because usually that major event is not a good thing. I would love to do it.
A CBS News contributor since September, Patrick will no longer serve in that role. Governor Patrick has been a political contributor to CBS News but in light of this decision, the network will be discontinuing that relationship, CBS News said.
According to Leader, women on both ends of the political spectrum are unusually energized this year … a trend that has been building since 1980, when Ronald Reagan won the presidency. Women have always been very committed to voting, she said. At least since 1980, they've been outvoting men. But I think this level of the sense 'Our vote is fundamental to the future' is new and different.
CEDRIC RICHMOND: Look, the bi-- the President said in his inauguration speech that he wanted to work with both sides in order to help the American people. And what we know about President Biden is it's never about him. It's always about the people. So, yes, he is very willing to meet with anyone to advance the agenda. But, look, this is about seriousness of purpose. This is about meeting the moment. And this crisis is enormous, and our response to it meets that challenge. And so when you start talking about fourteen hundred dollars to individuals, another hundred and sixty million dollars so we can safely open schools, a couple of hundred million dollars to make sure that we help small businesses that are struggling, that's what the American people want to see. Seventy percent of the American people support President Biden's plan and another seventy-one percent of the American people want to see Republicans work with the President to meet the enormous challenges that we have.
JONAH GOLDBERG: Right? It's just-- whatever-- if capitalism is in bad odor at any given moment, like during the financial crisis especially, then people say, socialism, because it's basically-- they think it's a binary thing. And the reality is I don't think there are a lot of voters out there that actually want real socialism, but they don't necessarily love capitalism right now either.
Rep. Anna Eshoo: And she is a moderating force.

ED O'KEEFE: Well, his aides say that they will continue to try to keep the focus on Sanders and make the argument that it would be dangerous for Democrats to nominate him because he wouldn't necessarily be able to attract the kind of independent and, potentially, disgruntled Republican voters that the Democrats will need in order to win back the White House. But he is going to continue to face questions about his business practices and his decision to release at least three employees from their nondisclosure agreements. Elizabeth Warren, especially, continues to hammer away at him and it appears to be working at least from a financial sense. She's been able to raise a lot of money since that debate, when she attacked him, and there's evidence from the results in Nevada that her debate performance there may have helped her. Remember, in the next few days, most of these candidates will be campaigning not just in South Carolina but in the fourteen other states, voting on Super Tuesday--Texas, North Carolina, North Dakota, Arkansas, Colorado. They won't all be in South Carolina this week because they know there are huge prizes to be won on March 3rd, just three days after South Carolina.
In a strange turn of events on Wednesday, the IDP at one point posted incorrect results showing former Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick winning statewide delegates. The state party issued a statement that there will be a minor correction, but it took nearly 45 minutes before results were updated and corrected.
TRUMP: I think Aleppo is a disaster, humanitarian-wise.
Walker asked Mr. Trump to revisit his steel and aluminum tariffs that would adversely affect Wisconsin companies like Milwaukee-based Harley-Davidson, which announced in June it would outsource some production overseas to avert those tariffs.
Though sometimes, she has admitted, it becomes inconvenient. I'm thinking, 'I'm on a finance call right now,'  Cruz said of some moments. Do you really need to be doing this?
And as she took Braver on a visit to the floor of the United Nations Security Council, she defended her tough stance.
Mr. Trump has mocked McCain's time as a prisoner of war in Vietnam and repeatedly slammed him for his vote against repealing and replacing Obamacare in July 2017. McCain, perhaps the last lion of the Senate, died of brain cancer in August.
Clinton's interview, her first since Trump announced his running mate, took place at a campaign stop in Cincinnati, and it comes just days before Trump is set to be nominated by the Republican party at its convention in Cleveland. The presumptive Democratic nominee has previously and persistently characterized Trump as temperamentally unfit to do the job of president, and cast his proposals as dangerous and his style of campaigning as divisive. But her comments to Rose on Monday went one step further. -- CBS News' Hannah Fraser-Chanpong.
The numerous changes instituted by the law would be difficult to unwind, and the political consensus necessary for accomplishing it difficult to achieve. And despite near-universal agreement among Republicans on the need to undo the law and replace it with something better, the GOP has never united behind, much less passed, a legislative proposal to do so.
Even though they have Obamacare coverage… their deductibles are so high that, in essence, they'd have to spend money they don't have before they can even begin to use the plan, Rubio said. Now that doesn't mean you throw those people out in the street, it doesn't mean we go back to the system we had before 2010. I don't want to go back to that either. I want to replace it with a system that for the vast majority of Americans means they're going to be able to access private health insurance that's more affordable and covers the things they want in a vibrant, private marketplace.
Let's assume that Trump's vague call for enhancing college success through accountability is implemented.
McConnell in Kentucky leads Democrat Amy McGrath 53% to 41% in the new poll. The most important issues in the race there were the economy at 26%, followed by law and order at 20% and health care at 13%.
While the budget stalemate stems from the GOP's insistence on dismantling or delaying the health care law, one of the major portions of Obamacare goes into effect on Tuesday. Open enrollment begins Tuesday on the state-based, online marketplaces where consumers will be able to purchase private health insurance coverage.
Mr. Obama, Romney said, instituted the most anti-growth, anti-investment, anti-jobs agenda in seen in a lifetime. While the president has called his agenda ambitious, Romney said he called it reckless.
If you are saying that the president of the United States has abused his office, if you are suggesting that he's doing things that are clearly impeachable, but then you say, well, but let's not talk about impeachment, that creates an unreality to the discourse, says John Nichols of The Nation. And I think, frankly, it's not appropriate.
Lawmakers grilled Verma, the administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, on the future of Obamacare, the landmark 2010 law whose fate remains uncertain. Although the executive branch typically defends federal laws in court, the Trump administration earlier this year joined a lawsuit brought by Republican state attorneys general that seeks to strike down the law.
President Trump repeatedly contradicted one of his top health officials Wednesday, telling reporters that Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Director Robert Redfield made a mistake when he told Congress a potential COVID-19 vaccine would not be widely available to the general public until at least mid-2021.
Lesley Stahl: --he listen? Does he--
The White House cheered the Supreme Court's ruling in its favor, calling it a big win for religious freedom and freedom of conscience. The high court, the White House added, has once again vindicated the conscience rights of people of faith.
But most Americans don't feel they have benefited directly from the president's policies. Feelings on this are largely driven by partisanship. Also, blacks and Hispanics are more likely than whites to say they have been hurt by his policies.
On March 19, the president conceded to Mr. Woodward that he publically downplayed the dangers of the virus. I wanted to always play it down. I still like playing it down, because I don't want to create a panic, Mr. Trump told Woodward. While the Trump administration sent mixed messaging on mask-wearing in public, the president openly mocked his political opponent, Joe Biden, for donning a face covering while pushing states to reopen in the spring. Into the summer, President Trump alleged the virus will go away on its own and told thousands gathered at a crowded campaign rally in Tulsa, OK that he directed officials to slow down COVID-19 testing.
The president's been in discussions with a number of people, Senator Cornyn among them, about his approach to this issue, and we'll see whether later they decide to make an announcement on that subject, it wouldn't be up to me to make that announcement, said McConnell.
After a Quinnipiac poll released Wednesday showed the South Carolina Senate race tied, the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee announced a seven-figure investment in the state to bolster Democrat Jaime Harrison against incumbent Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, reports CBS News associate producer Eleanor Watson. In the announcement, the DSCC said the investment will go towards supporting TV ads and other resources. Harrison's campaign announced Thursday morning it raised $1 million alone yesterday. The Cook Political Report rates this race as leaning Republican.
You will have the finest health care plan there is. She wants to go to a single-payer plan, which would be a disaster, somewhat similar to Canada. And if you haven't noticed the Canadians, when they need a big operation, when something happens, they come into the United States in many cases because their system is so slow. It's catastrophic in certain ways.
You know, children listen to what is being said. To go back to the very, very first question. And there's a lot of fear — in fact, teachers and parents are calling it the Trump effect. Bullying is up. A lot of people are feeling, you know, uneasy. A lot of kids are expressing their concerns.
EMI Records A look back at the esteemed personalities who left us this year, who'd touched us with their innovation, creativity and humanity. By CBSNews.com senior producer David Morgan. The Associated Press contributed to this gallery. Oh, my sorrows,
Bo Erickson and Adam Brewster contributed reporting.
Then there's Saccone, the man the GOP tried to blame for Lamb's upset. Here's the thing, though: while Saccone may have been a mediocre candidate, mediocre candidates win elections to the House all the time. The district he ran in was firmly Republican, going for President Trump by 20 points and Mitt Romney by 17. In the last two election cycles, the seat's Republican incumbent didn't even have a Democratic challenger.
In a moment, the Trump children join us and we will ask the president-elect where he stands on gay marriage, Obamacare, and ISIS.
The next round of presidential nominating contests, which are scheduled for April 4, will now all take place with mail ballots amid the coronavirus pandemic. The Alaska Democrats on Monday canceled in-person voting for their primary in favor of voting by mail. On Saturday, Democrats in Hawaii scrapped their in-person primary voting and said they would offer another round of mail ballots to voters. And earlier this month, Wyoming Democrats canceled their in-person caucuses and told Democrats to submit their votes by mail or drop off ballots to local election officials.
Steps from the Washington Monument, the National Museum of African American History and Culture will be the first to focus on the story of black Americans. With opening day just months away, we get a first look at what's inside the newest Smithsonian museum.
A bipartisan group of senators, including Sens. Dick Durbin, D-Illinois and Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, unveiled their immigration plan Wednesday, which would appropriate $2.7 billion in border security investments, eliminate the government's Diversity Visa Lottery, and would provide a pathway to citizenship for Dreamers. It would also define eligibility criteria for DACA, among other provisions. President Trump rejected their proposal last week.
Mr. Trump recognized at Wednesday's briefing that China's numbers seem to be a little bit on the light side, adding he's being nice when he says that. Bloomberg reported earlier Wednesday that the U.S. intelligence community concluded China is intentionally under-reporting the number of cases and deaths in the country, citing officials familiar with the report.
Republicans won the House majority in 2010 on a crest of tea party anger against Democratic rule -- particularly against President Obama's health care law. Some of those Republicans, in fact -- like Rep. Lynn Westmoreland, R-Ga., and Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah -- campaigned in 2010 on the promise to make dramatic changes in Washington or shut the government down.
Days away from the start of his eighth and final year as president, he wants to spotlight the administration accomplishments he thinks are overlooked or taken for granted, and also lay out his vision for the rest of his term in office. He has made it clear he has no interest in cruising gently to the end of his presidency.
Melania Trump: They might. We will see. We will discuss that.
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-California, released a statement Wednesday afternoon and suggested that the administration's assurance was good enough. This came after she spoke to White House chief of staff Reince Priebus twice on Wednesday.
Fifty percent of those surveyed in a CNN/ORC poll said they oppose scrapping the individual mandate, which requires that U.S. individuals have health insurance coverage; 48 percent favor getting rid of the mandate. (The survey was conducted before Republicans released their plan Monday evening.)
A convention speech can perhaps boost a potential First Lady's name recognition. In polls conducted after the Republican conventions in 2012 and 2000, Ann Romney and Laura Bush were better known to voters than Mrs. Trump is today and voters nationwide and were more inclined to view both women favorably.
CLINTON: Well, it's not only my opinion. It's the opinion of many others, national security experts, Republicans, former Republican members of Congress. But it's in part because those of us who have had the great privilege of seeing this job up close and know how difficult it is, and it's not just because I watched my husband take a $300 billion deficit and turn it into a $200 billion surplus, and 23 million new jobs were created, and incomes went up for everybody. Everybody. African-American incomes went up 33 percent.
Pocketbook alert: People with job-based coverage should keep an eye on a proposal to tax part of the value of the most generous employer plans.
RADDATZ: Mr. Trump, let me repeat the question. If you were president...
Patrick said he will tell superintendents, Do not enact this policy, which he said 70 to 80 percent of the schools do not want to implement.
I believe that, Clinton replied. I believe that.
TRUMP: And women have respect for me. And I will tell you: No, I have not. And I will tell you that I'm going to make our country safe. We're going to have borders in our country, which we don't have now. People are pouring into our country, and they're coming in from the Middle East and other places.
Lesley Stahl: Let's talk about your cabinet.
The retreat by big insurers likely means consumers will have fewer choices for 2017 coverage. That lack of competition puts a major wrench in the way the health care exchanges are supposed to work. Theoretically, competing carriers on each exchange offer consumers plenty of choices while keeping premiums affordable. In many urban and densely populated markets, that's pretty much what's happening.
Correspondent Janet Shamlian, who spent the weekend talking with voters in North Carolina, said the selection of a Supreme Court nominee is having a significant impact there — a motivating force for voters on both sides — as 69% of likely voters say the court is a major factor in their vote.
But the Obamacare repeal effort imploded in the Senate, leaving the growth of Medicaid untouched and the health care law's subsidies in place. Politically, the effort both angered the GOP base and whipped up the Democratic opposition.
I think, yes. I think there was an aspect of that. And I think, for the last several decades, the Department has been used more and more, or the efforts have been made to draw the Department into that. And I think it's very important that that not happen.
We have the greatest testing program in the world, President Trump said Thursday, in Marinette. We've developed it over a period of time. We're up to almost 30 million tests. That means we're gonna have more cases. If we didn't want to test or if we didn't test we wouldn't have cases. In a call with reporters Thursday, Center for Disease Control Director Robert Redfield said for every reported case of COVID-19, there are 10 more undetected infections. Johns Hopkins University has tracked over 2.4 million confirmed coronavirus cases in the US. Based on the CDC's new estimates of unreported cases, over 20 million Americans have had the virus.
JOHN DICKERSON: But it's quite a volatile thing to say they're not getting paid. 'Cause they are getting paid--
When asked if she thinks Mr. Trump's presidency is a success, she said it's a work in progress.
The state's most recent weekly allotment shot up to 118 thousand doses - an increase of 55 percent since the start of the biden administration. Even so, dr. Gayles says demand far outstrips supply.
If a customer enrolled in Obamacare is eligible for subsidies, those government payments go directly to the insurer, and then the insurer passes on the savings to the customer in the form of lower premiums. The payments are happening on time, Carney stressed. However, there is an automated processing system that is not online yet.
Given Mr. Trump's current legal challenges, Kavanaugh's opinions on these issues are sure to be intensely scrutinized during his upcoming confirmation hearings.
The candidates are at Washington University in St. Louis, Mo., for a town-hall style debate. Half the questions will be asked by the moderators, CNN's Anderson Cooper and ABC's Martha Raddatz, and half will be asked by undecided voters in the audience.
Navarro says Bloomberg sees a chance for Democrats to flip the state if we nominate somebody who makes winning here a top priority.
I will say this about Hillary. She doesn't quit. She doesn't give up. I respect that. I tell it like it is. She's a fighter. I disagree with much of what she's fighting for. I do disagree with her judgment in many cases. But she does fight hard, and she doesn't quit, and she doesn't give up. And I consider that to be a very good trait.
If nothing else, the voters should be very clear about one thing: President Trump and his party and Judge Barrett will overturn the Affordable Care Act, and they won't stop there, Democratic vice presidential nominee Kamala Harris, a senator from California who sits on the Senate Judiciary Committee, said during an event in North Carolina on Monday.
Before the briefing, Mulvaney said, I'm handicapping it now at some place between 50 and 60 percent. But again we're planning for it as if it's 100 percent. That's what we do, we run the government, and we will run the government if a bill passes, we will run the government if a bill doesn't pass.
This poll was conducted by telephone October 14-17, 2018 among a random sample of 1,108 adults nationwide. Data collection was conducted on behalf of CBS News by SSRS of Glen Mills, PA. Phone numbers were dialed from samples of both standard land-line and cell phones.
The administration had floated the possibility of reopening the marketplaces for several weeks, but a senior administration official confirmed that is no longer the case. The news of the administration's decision was first reported by Politico.
SEN. KLOBUCHAR: I think- I- I- I think- I'm thinking the issues you're focused here on, for instance, Medicare for all- and I want universal health care, I just got a different way to get there. And as I said in the debate, I don't think that we should take away people's right to their private insurance and kick half of America off of their private insurance. I think there is a better way to do this and that strengthening Obamacare, taking on the pharmaceuticals. On free college for all, I made it very clear, I want to expand Pell grants, make it easier for kids to go to college. But I don't think- and that's what some of these plans do, that we should be using taxpayer money to finance rich kids to go to college. Many of our public universities, something like 10 percent of the kids come from families that make over 200,000 dollars a year.
TRUMP: Well, I actually agree with that. I agree with everything she said. I began this campaign because I was so tired of seeing such foolish things happen to our country. This is a great country. This is a great land. I've gotten to know the people of the country over the last year-and-a-half that I've been doing this as a politician. I cannot believe I'm saying that about myself, but I guess I have been a politician.
The feud laid bare the tensions generated by Mr. Trump's populist approach, fostered by his former campaign strategist Steve Bannon. At the time, Bannon was vowing to take on McConnell, along with every incumbent senator, in a scorched-earth approach to GOP primaries. Fox News' Sean Hannity called for McConnell to retire.
Taxpayer-subsidized health insurance is available for a modest cost — and sometimes even free — across the country, but industry officials and independent researchers say few people seem to know how to find it. For those who lost their health insurance as layoffs mounted at the end of March, a 60-day special enrollment period for individual coverage under the ACA closes next week in most states.
Last May, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated that the House-passed bill would have left 23 million additional people uninsured by 2026 and boosted premiums an average 20 percent this year.
His work as a managing director at Bain Capital is likely to draw scrutiny from primary voters increasingly critical of corporations. Romney, a former Bain executive, was attacked by Democrats for his role at the firm when he ran for president in 2012.
Once that automated payment processing system is online, in a few months, that system will provide [Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services] with the kind of data that we've been asked about -- and CMS has been asked about -- which is the overall picture of how high a percentage of enrollees have made their premium payments, he said.
Did you consult or discuss the decision in any way with President Trump?
MARGARET BRENNAN: Trevor, thank you. Paula, always good to have you on.
Joe Biden announced working campaign panels comprised of mostly prominent Biden and Senator Bernie Sanders supporters, CBS News campaign reporter Bo Erickson reports. The six panels will focus on climate change, criminal justice reform, economy, education, health care, and immigration, and have been in the works since Sanders endorsement weeks ago.
To the Brady PAC, the panic purchasing at gun shops highlights the issue of improper use and storage of weapons in the home. They're introducing this element to their home and because they're new gun owners and because perhaps they aren't able to go to the range for practice or get more familiar with the weapon, it's being mishandled and it could be used to harm those in their homes, he said.
In a nutshell, while there are some indications the Pentagon is beefing up under Mr. Trump, it remains to be seen how much he lives up to that promise.
Lesley Stahl: How would you describe how the president is handling his job so far?
Scam robocalls calls continued to grow In August, to an estimated 1.76 billion calls, or nearly 42 percent of all robocalls made during the month. (Some computer-generated calls, such as those you've authorized to remind you to make a payment or call your doctor for a checkup, are legal.)
Very soon, auto plants and other plants will be opening up all over our country. This is all news Americans are totally unaccustomed to hearing. For many years, companies and jobs were only leaving us. But now they are roaring back. They're coming back. They want to be where the action is. They want to be in the United States of America. That's where they want to be.
Yes, I'm very embarrassed by it. I hate it. But it's locker room talk, and it's one of those things. I will knock the hell out of ISIS. We're going to defeat ISIS. ISIS happened a number of years ago in a vacuum that was left because of bad judgment. And I will tell you, I will take care of ISIS.
The 5th District Democratic Committee voted to have a primary convention instead of a traditional primary. The convention was held in May, and Leslie Cockborn, a first-time candidate and journalist for 35 years who worked as a producer and correspondent on programs such as CBS News' 60 Minutes and PBS' Frontline, secured the Democratic nomination. The 5th District Republican Committee also held a nominating convention on June 2 instead of a primary, and Denver Riggleman, a craft distillery owner and former Air Force intelligence officer, was selected to be the party's nominee in the fall.
SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: --contributions. I'm not quite sure. But I am enormously impressed by the many, many, hundreds of thousands of Americans who are making contributions. Many of them are very small contributions. I am also impressed by the fact that we have over one million people from every state in this country who have volunteered to work on what will be an unprecedented grassroots campaign. Look, Margaret, the way we win the Democratic nomination, the way we beat Trump--who in my mind is the most dangerous President in modern American history--is through a massive grassroots effort, which demands that we have an economy and a government which works for all of us and not just the one percent. That we end this massive level of income and wealth inequality where three of the wealthiest people own more wealth than the bottom half of Americans, while at the same time over half the people in this country are working paycheck to paycheck and cannot afford a health care.
Puzder issued a statement saying that, once he discovered the servant lacked documentation, he fired her and offered her help in getting legal status. He went on to say he and his wife paid back taxes due to the U.S. and California for the woman. Puzder's wife paid the housekeeper in cash, a spokesman said. It was a mistake and he's owning that.
Bloomberg is divorced with two daughters and two grandchildren. He still owns his boyhood home in Medford, Massachusetts.
Earlier Monday, President Obama placed calls to Reid, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio and Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. Monday afternoon, but did not seem to be looking for a negotiating partner. He reiterated his preference for a clean spending bill free of any amendments and said he would continue to oppose any attempts to defund or delay the healthcare law, a White House official said.
The attack in Nice last week has had somewhat of an impact on the security planning, too.
They're already using it in ads from Georgia to Arizona and planning others in their drive to win House control in this November's elections — often coupling it with December's tax cuts, which disproportionately benefited businesses and wealthy Americans.
The order, which was based on one of Mr. Trump's campaign promises, also provided regulatory relief from Obamacare requirements such as the requirement that organizations provide contraception care, which was heavily debated in the Little Sisters of the Poor case.
The GOP presidential nominee is expected to say that his proposed economic policies will improve the quality of life for all Americans.
11:37 p.m. ET Trump's speech clocks in at an hour and 15 minutes and his family joins him on stage for the balloon drop. Fireworks are going off outside the arena over Cleveland.
Braver said, In that campaign, you had two people falsely say that they have had extramarital affairs with you. Just recently we had somebody who was very much slapped down trying to insinuate that there was something with you and the president. Is that just the price you pay for being a young, attractive woman in politics?
CBSN's live coverage begins at 7:00 p.m. ET. CBS News will broadcast live, primetime coverage of the address and the Democratic response from 9:00 p.m. to 10:30 p.m. on CBS, CBSN and all CBS News platforms.
Now, with these 200 admirals and generals, they can't believe it. All I say is this. General George Patton, General Douglas MacArthur are spinning in their grave at the stupidity of what we're doing in the Middle East.
The 2019 budget was originally designed to double down on last year's proposals to slash foreign aid, the Environmental Protection Agency, home heating assistance and other nondefense programs funded by Congress each year.
A limit on how much insurers can charge older customers would be eased. Currently older adults can be charged no more than three times what they charge young adults. The new ratio would be 5-to-1.
If Ossoff wins, it'll give heart to Democrats that the enthusiasm among Democratic voters and activists who oppose Mr. Trump can make a difference in midterm races, even in some Republican districts. Mr. Trump's opponents around the country -- Democrats and anti-Trump independents -- will have some proof that Mr. Trump can be a political liability and they'll get a huge lift in terms of energy and enthusiasm for recruiting candidates and for fundraising.
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: The collusion delusion is over.
Gillum then called DeSantis a liar, and DeSantis called Gillum corrupt, pointing at Broadway tickets to Hamilton that were supplied by an undercover FBI agent investigating corruption at Tallahassee City Hall.
COOPER: We've got a question over here from James Carter. Mr. Carter?
MARGARET BRENNAN: I looked at the White House report for your state this week and it highlights the metro area around Miami as being in the red zone. But your restaurants are allowed to have a hundred percent capacity, along with social distancing, of course. But your bars, your nightclubs, your gyms are all open. Should you be rethinking that?
ED O'KEEFE: And-- and we should-- the reason that it's become an issue is because there is now an incentive to get as many donors as you can.
DR. VANESSA TYSON: There is a difference between hearings and investigations. Investigations often allow people in power to sweep things under the rug, right? That's just, you know, kind of a pattern that as a political scientist that I have witnessed and-- and seen emerge, right?
Americans overall are feeling upbeat about the economy and the President gets some credit for that. Sixty-seven percent say the economy is very or fair good – a figure that has been at the 60 percent level or higher since Mr. Trump became president. Even half of Democrats give him at least some credit.
As a judge, Gorsuch has said he follows the conservative philosophy embodied by Scalia during Scalia's nearly two decades on the nation's top court, one that depends on strict constructionism -- a firm reliance on the text of the Constitution for judicial interpretation.
When you talk to them individually, when you talk about some of these competitive races not just in California but across the country, they are very afraid of Bernie Sanders, Bera told CBS News campaign reporter Alex Tin, as he campaigned this week in Nevada for Joe Biden. I think they realize Bernie Sanders at the top of the ticket is going to make their reelection pretty difficult, Bera added later, praising the former vice president's ability to help defend tough districts.
Speaker Nancy Pelosi: How would I describe him. I think that he describes himself on a daily basis and-- I think that there's nobody in the country who knows better that he should not be president of the United States than Donald Trump.
It's unclear exactly how many immigrants Mr. Trump's proposed immigration framework would affect, so his claim is impossible to rate with certainty.
For Rubio, there was one fact on the stage that he couldn't escape - fellow candidate Jeb Bush verified that Rubio asked him to support his path-to-citizenship legislation when it was being written in 2013. And Cruz was caught by a video clip of himself on the Senate floor, urging the bill's passage.
The administration will pursue a raft of old and new measures intended to improve competition and transparency in the notoriously complex drug pricing system. But most of the measures could take months or years to implement, and none would stop drugmakers from setting sky-high initial prices. Mr. Trump said his administration will begin work immediately, although there is no timeline for implementing his proposals.
The way to keep our communities safe is to work with law enforcement, not against law enforcement, and you need to identify those individuals who should not have access to firearms, he said.
The total price tag of the Biden Plan to Protect & Build on the Affordable Care Act is $750 billion over 10 years, according to a senior campaign official, and would be paid for by raising the top tax rate to 39.6 percent and increasing taxes on the stock income of wealthy Americans.
A man who can get the job done, she said. There's someone who comes in ahead of schedule and under budget, who's read the specs, seen the bottom line, negotiated the cost and built something to last. A leader who knows the country is not full of assets to be managed, forgotten or deleted. Our nation is full of citizens who want a leader who knows the sure route to prosperity, who inspires, who knows leadership is a hard-fought verb and not a subject line in an email. That's why I'm asking you to join me in electing Donald Trump president.
Republican leaders have begun trying to sell this plan to their GOP members, which is a challenging task because some key numbers and details are still missing. It's being hashed out behind closed doors as GOP leaders try to tamp down a rebellion from their own right flank, reports CBS News congressional correspondent Nancy Cordes.
Clinton said that the question of whether undocumented immigrants should be eligible for subsidies will have to be worked out in comprehensive immigration reform.
JONAH GOLDBERG: Just, very quickly, I think thought one of the interesting data points was that Fox News stopped carrying all of his rallies--
MANUEL BOJORQUEZ: There are some indications the virus' wildfire pace has slowed just slightly. The number of new cases and hospitalizations nationwide has eased, but the daily death toll surpassed four thousand twice in the past week. Today, Florida ends its deadliest month of the pandemic. Margaret.
Lesley Stahl: Not at all. Same person?
LANHEE CHEN: I mean, I-- I think it's quite divisive in the sense that he's speaking to his base that's who he's communicating to. He's communicating to his supporters. And we've seen this movie before, by the way, in terms of how candidates communicate with the people who support them. His message is to his supporters to say, look, you know, you've been ignored, you've been marginalized, no longer I will be your voice. I alone can do this. We've heard this rhetoric before. So I think it is incredibly divisive for Senator Sanders to engage in that. And-- and the Democratic establishment needs to wake up on this. If they're going to stop Bernie Sanders, if they're going to figure out some way to make sure he isn't the nominee, that needs to start today. Not after South Carolina, not after Super Tuesday, it needs to start today. And, by the way, Mike Bloomberg could easily engage in this activity. He could turn all of his advertising against Bernie Sanders tomorrow if he wanted to. And that's the only way there's a difference made in this race, I think.
The Trump administration has already stopped enforcing the penalty for individuals not purchasing health insurance, and Mr. Trump has claimed his administration eliminated the individual mandate.
We're encouraged that Marketplace consumers are increasingly young, engaged and shopping for the best plan, Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia M. Burwell said in a statement. She added: We have more work to do before the next deadlines.
MARGARET BRENNAN: And that means a shutdown?
The Senate then convened for a rare weekend session to clear the last hurdles before moving to the vote to confirm Barrett, which is set to take place Monday evening, just eight days before the presidential election.
No American should be denied health coverage based on their pre-existing medical conditions, Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, said Wednesday. Hatch chairs the Finance Committee, which oversees health care and tax law. He supported repeal of the ACA's insurance mandate, but draws a line on pre-existing conditions.
They say one thing and they do another, they say they're gonna protect preexisting conditions as a benefit, and then they go to court to strip it, Pelosi said. And strip the whole bill, that means that tens of millions of people, 20 million people will lose their health care.
In many parts of the country, spring allergy season is coming on early, and it's getting worse. One allergy specialist reports tree pollen counts three times higher than this time last year. We've got the outlook for spring allergies around the country, and offer the latest advice if you're suffering now.
In the latest edition of CBS News COVID Chronicles, campaign reporter LaCrai Mitchell revisits the impact of the coronavirus on small minority businesses in the battleground state of Florida.
Americans in general—and the blue-collar voters in Rust Belt states who voted Obama in 2008 and Trump in 2016 in particular--have a credible case that their confidence in the system and its two parties was misplaced. They voted for change in 2008. The one major change, Obamacare, was unpopular (its polls were underwater the entire Obama presidency) and poorly implemented. Voters voted for change again in 2010 and again in 2014, but generally got more of the same.
It would be a clear waste of taxpayer dollars if Obamacare subsidies are going to prisoners, Upton said.
JOHN DICKERSON: It's Sunday, October 14. I am John Dickerson and this is FACE THE NATION.
1:40 p.m. ET Sen. Patty Murray called for an investigation into Price's stock buys.
Lesley Stahl: I want to ask you about the tweet that you put out, I think it was last night or the night before, about these demonstrators.
CLINTON: ... I told people that it would be impossible to be fact-checking Donald all the time. I'd never get to talk about anything I want to do and how we're going to really make lives better for people.
That was the slot that the Obamacare approach was to take. And like I say, 20 million people now have health insurance. So if we just rip it up and throw it away, what Donald's not telling you is we just turn it back to the insurance companies the way it used to be, and that means the insurance companies...
Morrisey, who has been endorsed by President Trump, signed onto the lawsuit in February. The lawsuit consists of 19 other GOP attorneys general, including McCaskill's challenger, Missouri Attorney General Josh Hawley. Morrisey's campaign has largely been focused on pressuring Manchin to support Supreme Court Justice nominee Brett Kavanaugh. But in response to today's ad, Morrisey's campaign released a statement criticizing Manchin's National Rifle Association (NRA) rating and accusing Manchin of siding with Washington liberals on health care.
Schumer said his Republican colleagues in the Senate were afraid of Mr. Trump because he has still not provided clear indications on where he stood on a fix for DACA.
The 2016 tax year is the first year people who do not have health insurance have to pay the full amount in penalties. The government is hoping that when uninsured consumers face the full penalty, they will change their minds and sign up. But that won't happen anytime soon, said Cox. Most people won't know how much they owe until they do their taxes, she explained. We probably won't see the effect the penalty has until 2018.
KANSAS CITY, Mo. — The midterm elections are three weeks away, with control of Congress hanging in the balance. One of the key races is in Missouri, where polls show Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill locked in a tight re-election battle with her Republican challenger, state Attorney General Josh Hawley.
Meanwhile, CBS News political unit associate producer Sarah Ewall-Wice reports that the Senate Majority PAC, which works to elect Democrats, is running its first television ad in Montana for the 2020 election cycle this weekend. This comes after the state's Democratic governor, Steve Bullock, decided to challenge GOP Senator Steve Daines, putting the race closer in play. The ad titled Maybe accuses Daines of supporting not only corporate tax cuts, but also cuts to Medicare. It's a six-figure buy that will start running statewide on Saturday. According to Kantar/CMAG tracking, Daines has already spent more than $600,000 on ads in the race, including both TV and digital. Bullock has spent $114,000, but all of his ads so far have been digital.
JOHN DICKERSON: So is this all the Senate's fault?
On Sunday, the White House exempted green card holders from the seven countries after initially including them in the ban. On Sunday evening the White House claimed that it had always been the intention of the executive order that legal permanent residents be exempt from the ban under a waiver.
The House and Senate passed a bill, which Mr. Obama signed late Monday night, ensuring that active-duty military personnel and those who support them will be paid through the shutdown.
The two traded a several barbs throughout the six-and-a-half minute segment before Mr. Obama encouraged young people to sign up for insurance coverage by March 31 (which Galifianakis treated as an annoying plug, checking his watch and joking, is this what they mean by drones?)

Looking ahead to the weekend, CBS News campaign reporter Alex Tin reports airport officials in Northern Nevada have rejected President Trump's plans to host an in-person rally at a hangar in the battleground state, citing the state's cap on large gatherings. The campaign's state co-chair Adam Laxalt expressed outrage over the move, decrying the cancellation as partisan political retribution. In a release, aviation authorities insisted their move has nothing to do with politics.
Five dollar flags, hats, t-shirts! Engelskirchea said to bystanders in the parking lot. Big ones are $20, little ones are $5.
Tonight, I am calling on the Congress to produce a bill that generates at least $1.5 trillion for the new infrastructure investment we need, he said. Every Federal dollar should be leveraged by partnering with State and local governments and, where appropriate, tapping into private sector investment -- to permanently fix the infrastructure deficit. Any bill must also streamline the permitting and approval process -- getting it down to no more than two years, and perhaps even one.
COOPER: So have you (inaudible) personal federal income tax?
We have had six meetings now of the whips group and we've not agreed on one thing. Nothing, Durbin told reporters Thursday.
Donald Trump: Well, there are a couple of things. They'll be pro-life, they'll be-- in terms of the whole gun situation, we know the Second Amendment and everybody's talking about the Second Amendment and they're trying to dice it up and change it, they're going to be very pro-Second Amendment. But having to do with abortion if it ever were overturned, it would go back to the states. So it would go back to the states and--
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, said Wednesday that they're at a stalemate in part because President Trump has not yet clearly indicated what needs to be in an immigration bill that he would sign.
The case originated with a Texas-led effort backed by the Trump administration. Now, as both parties move forward with filings in the Supreme Court, Democrats are sounding the alarm on what has been one of their main talking points during the 2018 midterms and continues to be in the 2020 election: protecting the Affordable Care Act.
PAUL RYAN: We've passed the CHIP program. This is the third CHIP long-term reauthorization we have passed in the House. And the Senate Democrats have been filibustering it each and every time. We passed all 12 appropriation bills for all of government last September in the House. And the Senate Democrats have been filibustering those bills.
Congress shut down the government for almost two weeks in 2013—part of an astonishing string of budget battles that involved the Democratic-controlled Senate simply refusing to pass a budget for four years—even in 2009-10 when Democrats had total control of Congress. In 2012, Harry Reid's Senate voted down President Obama's budget proposal 97-0(!) The most basic task of Congress is collecting taxes and funding the government, and it's been an unseemly mess for at least a decade.
Earlier this year the Trump administration released a rule barring clinics that provide abortions from getting federal planning funds under Title X. But that's already facing legal challenges, and a federal judge in April blocked the rule from taking effect for now. The rule would affect Planned Parenthood, which serves many low-income women who benefit from Title X.
Law enforcement is a noble, essential calling and we all grieve that we've again seen attacks on officers, she said. Ohio governors do not have the power to arbitrarily suspend federal and state constitutional rights or state laws as suggested. The bonds between our communities and police must be reset and rebuilt--as we're doing in Ohio--so our communities and officers can both be safe. Everyone has an important role to play in that renewal.
Interesting how President Obama so haltingly said I would never be president - This from perhaps the worst president in U.S. history! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 17, 2016
Democrats on Thursday focused on health care as the Trump administration faced a deadline to file a brief with the Supreme Court to strike down the Affordable Care Act. This comes as coronavirus cases in the United States surge and nearly 20 million people are facing unemployment due to the pandemic, reports CBS News political unit associate producer Sarah Ewall-Wice. In March, the Supreme Court agreed to hear a case at the request of Democratic attorneys general seeking to reverse a lower court ruling. The initial case was brought by Texas, other Republican state officials and backed by the Trump administration seeking to dismantle the health care law. The case will be heard during the next term, which does not begin until October. The ACA is more popular than ever for one simple reason: it works, said DNC chairman Tom Perez Thursday in a statement ahead of the expected filing. The ACA has significantly reduced the ranks of the uninsured; it's helped Americans can get the health care they need and helped keep them from being bankrupted just because they get sick.
By siding with the Republican Attorneys-General who are seeking to invalidate the ACA in the U.S. Supreme Court, Trump has made clear where his priorities lie. Not with protecting the millions of people who depend on the exchanges for their health coverage. Not with ensuring that more than 100 million people with pre-existing conditions won't be denied coverage or charged more by their insurers. Not with the thousands of Americans who may develop new 'pre-existing conditions' due to their battle with COVID-19. Not with the young people who can now stay on their parents insurance until 26. Not with women, who will no longer be protected against being charged more for their insurance, presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden said in a statement.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Will anyone be willing to compromise? We'll talk with White House senior adviser and former Congressman Cedric Richmond. Connecticut Governor Ned Lamont's state is a success story when it comes to vaccinations. Miami Mayor Francis Suarez's city has reported dozens of cases of coronavirus variants. Plus, we'll take a closer look at the push to get schools to reopen for in-person learning.
MARGARET BRENNAN: --continue to cross. I want to quickly, though, get to--
The gale-force one-liners can be nauseating as presidential candidates try to cajole and convince voters. So how do you know what's true and what's not?
Morgan told CBS News the PAC is focusing on battleground races where it can make the most difference, but because access to the ballot is core to its mission, the group is also concentrating on a slate of candidates who support legislation focused on voting access like the For the People Act and the Voting Rights Advancement Act.
Lesley Stahl: Give us some meat.
Last year I pledged that we would work with our allies to extinguish ISIS from the face of the earth. One year later, I'm proud to report that the coalition to defeat ISIS has liberated almost 100 percent of the territory once held by these killers in Iraq and Syria. But there is much more work to be done. We will continue our fight until ISIS is defeated.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Bernie Sanders. Can you stop him, in terms of the momentum he has? The Bloomberg campaign, as you know, is out saying that for moderates like yourselves, he is going to basically end up with an insurmountable delegate lead because of his early success.
Children's health insurance, funding for our troops, keeping the government going. They shut it down over an unrelated immigration issue with a deadline weeks away. And what's- what's so baffling about this was we were negotiating in good faith on DACA all the same.
TRUMP STATEMENT: Bill Clinton was abusive to women, Hillary Clinton attacked those same women and attacked them viciously. Four of them are here tonight: one of the women, who is a wonderful woman at 12 years old was raped at 12, her client she represented got him off and she's seen laughing on two separate occasions laughing at the girl who was raped, Kathy Shelton.
But advocates worry that the move is a return to the bad old days before insurers had to adhere to standard regulations that protected consumers from paying insurance premiums, only to find coverage wasn't there when they needed it.
That's a butcher. That's a butcher, he said, so I felt we had to do something about it.
As I've said to many of you, this work is personal to me, Price wrote. I know how important it is for everyone - from our neighbors to new voters - to have confidence in the process and its results. We are taking the time we need to do just that.
President Trump on Thursday outlined his health care vision, which he had pledged to release two months ago. The president signed an executive action that lays out that vision, but has no legislative power.
Penny Marshall Paramount Television/ABC In 2012 actress and director Penny Marshall (October 15, 1943-December 17, 2018) told CBS This Morning that she had been sent by her father to the University of New Mexico (and her brother, director Garry Marshall, to Northwestern) in order to lose their Bronx accents. It didn't work, she said, not that she had to. Marshall's distinctive voice and smart-alecky delivery were the bedrock of her character Laverne DeFazio, a brewery worker who dreams of better things, in the top-rated '70s sitcom Laverne & Shirley. The series would take her character from Milwaukee to California during its eight-year run (with even a cartoon spinoff along the way). Her early roles also included Myrna, Oscar's secretary, in The Odd Couple, and appearances on The Mary Tyler Moore Show and Love, American Style. But she became a formidable force behind the camera, as the director of the comedies Big (featuring Tom Hanks as a 12-year-old boy magically transformed into a 30-year-old boy), and A League of Their Own (in which Hanks' coach memorably castigates a player with There's no crying in baseball!). Both movies passed the $100 million gross mark, blazing a trail for female-directed films. Marshall's other credits included Awakenings, starring Robin Williams and Robert De Niro (only the second film directed by a woman to be nominated for a Best Picture Oscar), The Preacher's Wife, and Riding in Cars With Boys.
Our task is to respect them, to listen to them, to serve them, to protect them, and to always be worthy of them.
Republicans hope that Rep. Martha McSally, a trailblazing former fighter pilot, can keep the seat in GOP hands. But McSally, known as a relative moderate, may have her work cut out for her fending off Arpaio and conservative activist Kelli Ward.
Mulvaney said that there's no DACA bill to vote on and no emergency in terms of the timing because Congress has until March 5 to work out a legislative solution on the issue.
The House Democrat campaign arm began their second rollout of television ads specifically geared towards the Asian American and Pacific Islander community. The committee announced in August they had made a buy on VietFace TV, a Vietnamese cable network based in Los Angeles. The ads began running in California's 48th district in Orange County, in English and Vietnamese.
According to its last FEC report at the end of June, the RNC had more than five times as much in the bank as the Democratic National Committee.
SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: Look, no-- no Donald-- Donald Trump when he goes say go beat the crap out of them at a rally and then he says I'm going to pick up your legal bill. I mean look, the guy-- the guy knows no bottom, but the reality is what Democrats are saying is that we are locked in a pitched political battle and we are going to engage fully. I mean this is political trench warfare and we're going to engage in that battle. And that's why Democrats in the Senate are doing a lot better than people expected us to do more than a year ago when Republicans said they were going to win a net of eight seats.
By comparison, President Obama began his presidency with 41 percent approval among Republicans and, while it eventually faded, his first two years he never had the level of partisan opposition Trump does.

They got the state to fix translation errors in a Spanish language signup site. They're advocating for a mass vaccination site in Montgomery County. And they continue to help people like 76-year-old retired nurse Nancy Hart. We caught up with her this past week when she got her second shot. Now she has a shot at getting back to normal life.
Later, he was tortured by North Korean authorities after returning from a brief visit to China. His tormentors wanted to know if he'd met any Christians. He had -- and he resolved, after that, to be free.
Cory Booker Cory Booker launches 2020 campaign 02:57 Biography Cory Booker was born in Washington in 1964 and raised in the affluent suburbs of northern New Jersey. He received a bachelor's degree in political science and a master's degree in sociology from Stanford University, where he also played tight end for the football team. After graduation, Booker was awarded a Rhodes scholarship to study at the University of Oxford, earning a master's degree in modern history. He returned to the U.S. for a law degree at Yale. After working as a public-interest attorney and housing advocate in Newark, Booker decided to run for the city's municipal council in 1998. He managed to topple a long-time incumbent and, at age 29, become the youngest-ever member of the council, where he gained notoriety for fasting outside a housing project to denounce the intensifying crime and drug use in some of Newark's neighborhoods. After launching an unsuccessful bid in 2002 against incumbent mayor Sharpe James, Booker ran again in 2006 and defeated deputy mayor Ronald Rice. During his seven-year tenure as mayor, Booker was praised for attracting large companies to Newark and revamping the city's downtown. But he was also criticized by local residents and officials for appearing out-of-touch and focusing on his national image. The only way you can see the mayor is if you turn on 'Meet the Press,' Newark's current mayor, Ras Baraka, said when he was a councilman during Booker's mayoral administration.
President Donald Trump: I think we have enough of an interview here, Hope. Okay? That's enough. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go meet for two seconds, okay? Thanks. I'll see you in a little while. Thanks.
MARGARET BRENNAN: You heard some disagreement among Republicans on how to do that. There's also disagreement within the Democratic Party on how to handle healthcare. Former Attorney General Eric Holder says it's time now to move to some version of Medicare for all and end this nonsense. That was his reaction to Friday's ruling. Do you agree with him?
We know all the instances of, you know, women at a restaurant, the daughters, granddaughters, and wives of senators he was swearing in on swearing-in day at the Capitol, things he's done and said that were sort of seen as, oh, that's uncle Joe--
MCGAHN: I don't think they're fair assumptions one way or the other. We've heard this for decades in Washington, D.C. I remember being a- a very young law student and hearing this about Robert Bork and hearing this about Clarence Thomas and hearing this about virtually every justice that's been nominated by a Republican. You cannot guarantee results with judges. What you can guarantee is that they are going to approach the task of judging as a judge. They're not going to substitute their own policy views for the will of the people. They're going to try to play it straight and read the law as passed by Congress and as found in the Constitution, not based upon what they think it ought to be, but what it is. I disagree that there is any hesitancy or pause last time. She was a relatively new federal judge. She was placed on a short list. The public found out about the short list because it was publicly announced. So the process has really been transparent. Recall the president, even as a candidate, put out not one, but two lists of judges who could be on the Supreme Court; he's updated it a few times since. So I think that at the time, Brett Kavanaugh was the right person at the right time. And I think Amy- judge Amy Barrett is the right person at the right time now.
President Donald Trump: It is totally true.
In his concession speech he allowed that he would continue to find ways to serve the public, while also getting active in the grandchild business. Coming from a family that prized public service, Mr. Bush had heralded a thousand points of light as a marker of community and volunteerism, and promoted those efforts beyond the White House. He also worked with fellow former presidents to raise millions for hurricane disaster relief and recovery. And if age ever got the better of him, it was hard to tell: on his 75th, 80th, 85th and 90th birthdays he marked the occasion by skydiving. He was as accepting about his 1992 election loss as his public demeanor suggested. In a 1996 interview for Sunday Morning, Mr. Bush told Paula Zahn, There wasn't any period of self pity or thinking, on the other side of it, thinking you were entitled to a grand lifestyle. … There was no [more] decision-making. Went from one day making decisions, getting worried about getting a call that something was wrong, the next day nothing, nobody gives a damn about what I thought, cared. And that was the way it ought to be.
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-New York, said in a statement late Sunday that it's a good agreement that takes the threat of a government shutdown off the table.
Testifying before a Senate Appropriations subcommittee on the federal response to the coronavirus crisis, Admiral Brett Giroir, the assistant secretary for health at the Department of Health and Human Services, Dr. Robert Redfield, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and Dr. Robert Kadlec, the assistant secretary for preparedness and response, were asked by Senator Dick Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, whether an Obamacare replacement plan exists.
Democrats would be to blame, Ryan said, if the government winds up shutting down, blasting them for using the military as bargaining chips.
Trump, Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio, Jeb Bush, Ben Carson and John Kasich were also on the ballot.
Now, a band of lifelong Republicans is using the lessons they learned over 30 years as political strategists for the GOP to do more than criticize their party. Rather, they are actively working to defeat its incumbent president and Republican senators who support him.
Government statistics on the people who are losing —and finding— health insurance coverage in the coronavirus contraction won't be available for months.
CLINTON: So I want us to get to 100 percent, but get costs down and keep quality up.
I think when the president makes a nomination, he's obligated to do so under the Constitution, McGahn said, adding that there have been election-year nominations to the Supreme Court more than 20 times before. This idea that somehow this is out of the norm simply doesn't ring true.
I think several cases out of the Supreme Court are a reminder just how important this election is for the future of the Supreme Court, Pence said.
So a guy like Saccone, who had a fine resume, plenty of outside cash, and touted himself as a strong Trump supporter, should have easily won the district. Yet he lost to a guy who ran -- in the heart of Trump country -- as a liberal. And to make matters worse for the GOP, Lamb campaigned directly against the tax cut that the GOP had hoped would give them a soft landing in November. If Republicans can't run on Trump's coattails, and they can't run on tax cuts, what can they run on in November?
The vice president is maintaining his campaign schedule and, inexplicably, intends to preside over the Senate chamber tomorrow evening, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a Democrat from New York, wrote in a letter to his Democratic colleagues Sunday. Their carelessness with the health and safety of their colleagues and Capitol employees mirrors their carelessness with the health and safety of Americans during this crisis.
Rose's question followed up on a Fox News interview Tuesday night in Milwaukee, when Trump was asked whether he trusted U.S. intelligence.
According to early exit polls, 32 percent of the state's Republican voters named terrorism as the most important issue. A plurality of voters said the most important quality is that a presidential candidate shares his or her values. More than half of GOP voters said they are dissatisfied with the federal government, 40 percent are angry and only 7 percent are satisfied.
ANDERSON COOPER: If China took military action against Taiwan, is that something you would--
RADDATZ: We're going to move on to Syria. Both of you have mentioned that.
Republicans control 53 seats in the Senate, and there are few procedural tools Democrats have at their disposal to block Barrett's nomination completely. But foremost in their opposition to Barrett's nomination are her views on the Affordable Care Act, a challenge to which will be heard by the Supreme Court on November 10.
Maybe we can do better than that.
Employers who don't offer retirement plans would be required to allow employees to make contributions to individual retirement accounts, IRAs, Hall said. Contributions to the IRAs would come directly from paychecks.
MARGARET BRENNAN: According to the CDC, Florida is the state with the most cases of B117. That's that strain first detected in the U.K. It's highly contagious. And I know there's a concentration in South Florida. What mitigation measures are you putting in place in your city to contain it?
Plus, intelligence officials tell Congress that the Russians are at it again. This time they are interfering in the Democratic primary race as well as the President's re-election campaign. But the White House denies it, saying it's all Democratic disinformation.
Let me just also say that when he pled, the issue of materiality is related to whether the government has a bona fide investigation going on. And that's information that's really within the control of the government. The individual party would really not have that information. So as new information just became available that has a bearing on whether there was a legitimate investigation, that requires us, our duty, we think is to dismiss the case.
Here tonight is one leader in the effort to defend our country, Homeland Security Investigations Special Agent Celestino Martinez. He goes by DJ and CJ. He said, Call me either one. So we'll call you CJ. Served 15 years in the Air Force before becoming an ICE agent and spending the last 15 years fighting gang violence and getting dangerous criminals off of our streets. Tough job.
KELSEY SNELL: --we saw Mitch McConnell say, good luck working with Nancy Pelosi.
Speaking at a Senate hearing Wednesday, Redfield also testified that wearing a mask is more guaranteed to protect someone from the coronavirus than receiving a vaccine. We have clear scientific evidence they work, I might even go so far as to say that this face mask is more guaranteed to protect me against COVID than when I take a COVID vaccine, because the immunogenicity may be 70%, Redfield said. If I don't get an immune response, the vaccine's not going to protect me, this face mask will.
She said her motivation for ripping into the Florida governor was to criticize him for a bill he signed last month stripping funds from the state's Planned Parenthood clinics, along with other health facilities that provide abortion services.
Senator Kamala Harris of California said Floyd's death adds to a pattern of recent videos involving prejudice against black Americans. Here's the sad reality: what happened to George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery & Christian Cooper has gone on for generations to Black Americans. Cell phones just made it more visible. Dismantling systemic racism in our nation starts with demanding justice & holding offenders accountable, she Tweeted. Florida Congresswoman Val Demings – who is a former police chief – called for a complete investigation and quotes Mayor Frey's comments that being Black should not be a death sentence in America.
He wrote, this is my pledge to you, and he signed it.
Meanwhile, Sen. Chuck Schumer blamed Mr. Trump for the three-day-long shutdown, citing his inability to negotiate with Congress.
Regardless of the outcome, the Great Government Shutdown of 2018 will go down as a win for President Trump. Why? Because it's yet another why the hell not moment from Washington, D.C.
In April, Tillemann leaked a recording of a conversation of a meeting he had with House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer to The Intercept. In the recording, Hoyer encourages Tillemann to bow out of the race, making it clear that Crow is the establishment favorite. Tillemann has used this to burnish his credentials as an outsider fighting against the party machine. The Denver Post reports, With just weeks left in the race, Tillemann has doubled down on that outsider approach by trying to position himself as the true progressive in the Democratic primary — arguing that he, not Crow, would pursue the impeachment of President Donald Trump. Impeachment is a topic that the establishment is hoping to avoid since they think it could galvanize the right and hurt their chances of winning in the fall.
Still, a Democratic Congress would be hard-pressed to undo the major market-impactful legislation that has already been passed, UBS analysts note in a recent report. Many key regulations have been undone, and Mr. Trump retains the power to veto any Congressional legislation.
Within that context, Sebelius on Wednesday redefined what success looks like: Success looks like millions of people with affordable health coverage, which we will have by the end of March, she told the House Ways and Means Committee.
YouMail collects scripts that robocallers leave in messages on blocked consumer cell phones and then it analyzes what the crooks are after, Quilici said. In this case, YouMail believes the bulk of the health care robocalls are aimed at perpetrating identity theft.
According to HealthCare.gov, the annual open enrollment period is Nov. 1 through Dec.15. But even though the ACA enrollment period ended, losing previous coverage is considered a qualifying event that opens up a special enrollment period. Americans may have 60 days before or after the qualifying event to enroll in an ACA plan, or they may have to wait until the next open enrollment period to apply.

McCaskill has gone after Hawley for his lawsuit, as the state's attorney general, against the Affordable Care Act. Hawley has countered saying he wants to repeal Obamacare but maintain coverage of pre-existing conditions. Voters see McCaskill (41 percent) as better than Hawley (33 percent) on the issue of health care, according to CBS News polling. Will this be the issue that's on the minds of voters when Election Day comes? Trade and tariffs are also an in the state.

LANNY DAVIS (Former Attorney to Michael Cohen/@LannyDavis): Yes.

Just three days earlier, however, Mr. Trump made it sound as though he had a plan ready for Congress to replace the ACA, telling reporters at the White House, We are going to have a plan that's so much better than Obamacare.
Mr. Trump, who won the state by 30 points, will be holding a rally for Bevin in Lexington on Monday. Republicans hope that they can inspire enough of the GOP faithful to show up and pull Bevin across the finish line, and of the three gubernatorial races scheduled for November, the president's support may matter here the most.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Fake accounts being run by the Russians?
MARGARET BRENNAN: All right. Anthony Salvanto, thank you very much.
One of my greatest priorities is to reduce the price of prescription drugs. In many other countries, these drugs cost far less than what we pay in the United States. And it's very, very unfair. That is why I have directed my administration to make fixing the injustice of high drug prices one of my top priorities for the year. And prices will come down substantially. Watch.

In her remarks Thursday, Ivanka Trump told a story about the times Trump has worked to help others, even people he didn't know.
Tab Hunter AP Photo His agent gave actor Art Gelien his stage name: Tab Hunter (July 11, 1931-July 8, 2018). The shy boy - abandoned by his father and raised by a domineering mother - joined the Coast Guard at 15 by lying about his age. An equestrian and figure skater, he emerged a star in the 1952 potboiler Island of Desire. Soon after, the handsome, muscular Hunter appeared on a flood of magazine covers, nabbed a seven-year contract with Warner Brothers, and won the admiration of millions of teenage girls as the Sigh Guy. He starred in the films Battle Cry, The Burning Hills (opposite Natalie Wood), They Came to Cordura (with Gary Cooper), and Damn Yankees! He also topped the Billboard chart in 1957 with his recording of Young Love Rumors about the actor's homosexuality burned up the scandal sheets, but he continued working under the studio-projected image of him as a teen heartthrob. I was living a lie, absolutely, he told Sunday Morning in 2005. I was another person. I mean, my sexuality was my sexuality. And it was not what people perceived. You know, people believe what they want to believe. But this was very difficult for me. His career ebbed to a short-lived TV show and cheap exploitation flicks (Ride the Wild Surf), and small roles in The Loved One, ''The Life and Times of Judge Roy Bean and Grease 2.
They did that because he said he would go out and fight for our values and the things we believed in, and I think he's doing that. And so long as he's doing that, I'm going to be for him, Hawley said.
On Wednesday, Mr. Trump recalled those comments: I said it was obsolete; it's no longer obsolete.
Twice, though, Roberts was among a larger grouping of justices in cases that skirted the big issue at stake, but that could return to the court. In one case, the justices rejected a lower-court ruling that set limits on redistricting for partisan gain, but without deciding whether limits ever could be imposed. In another, the court ruled in favor of a baker who would not create a wedding cake for a same-sex couple, yet left on the table the question of whether religious objections could be used to avoid complying with anti-discrimination laws that protect LGBT people.
The latest CBS News poll, released last week, found that 36 percent of Americans approve of the job the president is doing, while 57 percent disapprove.
Democrats are still reeling from the unmitigated disaster that was the Iowa caucuses, which has yet to produce a clear winner in a year when their voters remain far from settled on a presidential nominee. But the good news for Democrats, if you can call it that, is that primary voters in the nation's next contest seem totally unfazed by Monday's botched caucus results. As voters settled into folding chairs and bench pews Tuesday, CBS News campaign reporter Nicole Sganga says it was business as usual in New Hampshire. We've always discounted Iowa, Michael Rosenblum of Nashua said while waiting for a selfie with Senator Amy Klobuchar. This is where it really happens. This is where it really starts. Iowa's not going to determine how New Hampshire votes.
We are scaling up funding for priorities that will make our country safer and stronger and help hardworking families get ahead, said House Appropriations Committee Chairwoman Nita Lowey of New York.
Pence says Manchin has voted 'no' time and again on the policies that West Virginia needs.
The comments have sparked responses from Republican leaders in Georgia and Florida who welcome the idea of the convention being hosted in their state and respective cities. Republican Governor Brian Kemp joined the conversation on Twitter Tuesday afternoon saying his state would be honored to safely host the convention. Both Florida and Georgia were two of the first states to begin re-opening amid the pandemic. In recent weeks, both the president and vice president have praised DeSantis and the state in its re-opening efforts.
The gun control group, which expects to spend some $60 million on the cycle around the country, says it plans to support both the campaigns of Joe Biden and Mark Kelly in Arizona. Despite President Trump's 2016 victory in the state, Democrats see Arizona as a key opportunity this year. Incumbent Republican Senator Martha McSally in recent polls has trailed Kelly, who rose to prominence as an advocate of tightening gun restrictions after his wife was shot in 2011.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Clearly, the White House is going to have to weigh in, and the White House acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney was on other television programs this morning saying he can promise no one will be left without health care if Obamacare is struck down. But as you've just said there is no plan yet. So how can you promise that-- like a state like yours where it has the most people reliant on Obamacare of any state--how can you promise them they won't be left hanging?
We believe that it's absolutely imperative that individuals that have health coverage be able to keep health coverage and move, hopefully, to greater choices and opportunities for them to gain the kind of coverage that they want for themselves and for their families, he said.
And President Trump reopened a fight over Obamacare that many believed, including some congressional Republicans, he already lost.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Since that time, a bipartisan Senate Intelligence Committee finding faulted the Obama administration for its response and said that the actions taken undermined public confidence in the election and allowed for further Russian interference. Do you agree with these findings--
It's largely Democrats who have become more negative about the Trump presidency. Republicans are mostly positive about the president's first year: Eight in 10 Republicans approve of the job Donald Trump is doing and most are just as optimistic with him in office now as they were right before he was sworn in as president. Seven in 10 say he has been a very good or good president.
Now, with that being said, she talks tough against Russia. But our nuclear program has fallen way behind, and they've gone wild with their nuclear program. Not good. Our government shouldn't have allowed that to happen. Russia is new in terms of nuclear. We are old. We're tired. We're exhausted in terms of nuclear. A very bad thing.
He said they were bought by a broker, and though they're made on my behalf, he did not direct the trades.
Collectively, Congress is always fearful of taking on tough issues, and there's no budget issue tougher than Medicare and Social Security, said former Sen. John Sununu, R-N.H., who co-sponsored Ryan's 2005 Social Security bill. It's been true for three decades or more.
Senator Kamala Harris' big moment in the first debate, when she challenged Biden on his support for federally mandated busing, set high expectations for the second debate. However, Harris struggled in the second debate, and that showed in the polls afterward.
Trump also explained his switch from supporting abortion rights to opposing them, saying his change of heart was inspired by a friend's situation.
Man shouting Allahu akbar fatally stabs British traveller
Another stop on Mister Trump's victory lap, Capitol Hill, where the President declared he was taking back an issue that helped Democrats win control of the House.
MARGARET BRENNAN: --when it comes to the shutdown--
Donald Trump: I'm not like the people going in right now and fighting Mosul and they announced it four months before they went into Mosul and everybody now is -- it's a tough fight because, number one, the people from the --leaders of ISIS have left. What do you-- why do I have to tell you that?
Trump doesn't have power today because non-existent GOP Bosses give it to him, but because about 90 percent of Republican voters support him.
MARGARET BRENNAN: So you think this piece-by-piece approach is the best way to do it rather than a wholesale Republican alternative?
MCGAHN: One of many, but yes.
We want a very big tax cut, but cannot do that until we keep our promise to repeal and replace the disaster known as 'Obamacare,' he told the crowd of thousands in Louisville. This is our long-awaited chance to finally get rid of 'Obamacare.'
South Carolinian GOP strategists say he is trying to play the delegate game in picking up enough votes in counties along the coast, where a swath of more moderate Republicans reside. But he'll be competing with Rubio and Bush for those votes against establishment-friendly Republican votes, too.
Conway also addressed the intelligence briefing Trump attended Thursday, on the heels of a television interview where the candidate said he did not trust U.S. intelligence sources.
And so, for example, even after the hyper-partisan controversy of the hanging chad 2000 election, President George W. Bush's 2001 tax plan received a bipartisan 58-33 vote in the senate thanks to the support of 12 Democrats (and opposition of GOP Sen. John McCain.)
TRUMP: It turned out to be a disaster.
The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) in April, for instance, finalized a rule that raises premiums for millions who purchased subsidized insurance through the ACA. The administration has also allowed for states to apply for waivers to opt out of coverage requirements under Obamacare.
Early in his law career, a 26-year-old Gorsuch clerked for Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy, who still sits on the Court. If Gorsuch is confirmed, it would mark the first time a justice and his or her former clerk would be seated on the Court at the same time.
Earlier this month, a three-judge panel on the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals rejected those new arguments and ruled Vance can enforce the subpoena to Mazars USA for the records, but put enforcement on hold to allow Mr. Trump to appeal the decision to the Supreme Court.
Lesley Stahl: How many of you are going to be willing to tell me how afraid you are of her?
Governor Gretchen Whitmer was the target of a kidnapping plot by an armed militia group.
Biden said he recently met with a Lordstown elementary school teacher whose husband worked at the shuttered plant, which manufactured the now discontinued Cruze. He had to transfer to a plant in Kentucky eight hours away to maintain his healthcare and pension, Biden said. He drives 16 hours a weekend to see her and their two kids.
Trump said his father has single-handedly employed tens and tens and tens of thousands of people around the country.
Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the head of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, was detained at a U.S.-run facility during the height of the Iraq War before he founded the terrorist group. al-Baghdadi was never held in Guantanamo Bay, however.
SENATOR JOHN BARRASSO: There-- there are a number of different options. That's one, another is a longer term. I would like to get actually all the appropriations bills passed. I think we do much better governing for our country if we do the whole thing through the appropriations process. We were able to do seventy-five percent of the funding. We still have a ways to go but border security is critical--
Mike Bloomberg: Well, yeah, there's no argument about it. It was a mistake. I erred. It was a mistake. I've took-- I haven't walked away from my responsibility for it.
MARGARET BRENNAN: --when it comes to the shutdown--
Lesley Stahl: I thought you liked spy-- sparring--
Trump announced Pence would be his No. 2 in a tweet Friday morning, but Trump had delayed his planned news conference because of the deadly truck attack in Nice, France.
As I speak, we are still in the midst of the worst global health crisis in a century, Biden said. A crisis that's already taken over 200,000 lives. And yet, the Trump administration is asking the Supreme Court right now to eliminate the entire Affordable Care Act.
I don't know. I let other people judge that. It's certainly – I feel good about the decision because that's what we're here to do. We're here to do what's right.
Everything that's a special election anywhere becomes a tossup, simply because unfortunately, we haven't figured out what that magic is to get our Democratic voters to turnout in those off-cycle elections, she said. We're taking a different approach with contacting voters, but turnout is everything in this moment.
Given the polarizing nature of the President, I suspect some Republicans will refuse to turnout during the General Election because they don't want to vote for him, though I don't know that we will know what this universe would look like without us or a stakeholder creating a model. Regardless, I suggest we set up a contingency budget to target these folks with mailers, digital ads, and texts to encourage them to turnout for U.S. Senate, State Senate, State House, and so on, a draft obtained by CBS News political unit associate producer Eleanor Watson read.
Of the ACA, Price said, no one is interested in pulling the rug out from anybody about potential losses of health insurance under a repeal of Obamacare.
In Ohio, Attorney General Mike DeWine, the Establishment candidate, beat John Kasich's Lt. Governor Mary Taylor in the primary for governor. Trump-friendly Congressman Jim Renacci will be the US Senate candidate. Trump won Ohio, but nothing like his margins in Indiana and West Virginia. Republican candidates there face uphill fights, but both candidates have legitimate shots at winning.
I think, if people can follow social distancing by leaving space, wearing masks and so forth, there has to be accommodation to religious practice. The Department has already entered a few cases around the country where there have been these sweeping prohibitions against religion where there were comparable secular activities are not controlled the same way.
If the number of claims has exploded, so too have the number of fact checkers.
If the Senate Democrats want to shut the government down...that's a choice they would make, he said. That would be their decision to make.
MARGARET BRENNAN: I said there are a record number happening right now in the Trump administration.
MAYOR FRANCIS SUAREZ: Well, you know, we've been restricted from being able to put in mitigation measures. I had implemented a mask in public order back when we were allowed to do that during the summer, and that drove down cases by ninety percent. Now, we're not allowed to implement a mask in public order. It's something that I had been speaking to the coronavirus task force about. The good news is that as-- as opposed to the summer where we had twenty-three hundred COVID patients countywide, which was a tremendous strain on our hospital system, now we have less than a thousand patients. So, you know, even though, we are, you know, obviously, battling with-- with a new strain, that is not thankfully at this point materializing into more hospitalizations.
ANTHONY SALVANTO: Yeah. What we did with this was because we want to emphasize for people that we're defining a range of possibilities here, especially still weeks out. We actually took the model and we reran it with the scenarios, one, how many seats could the Democrats conceivably get if everything breaks their way. If all of these folks really do show up, if all of these groups that they're dependent on these younger voters these women voters all do stay the way they are in the polling.
According to BPI, only 35% of Mr. Trump's Facebook ads that mention impeachment — less than $200,000 of the roughly $2 million spent — target voters in swing states. The buy suggests that accusations of a Democratic overreach on impeachment might not be a winning message with people who aren't already Trump supporters, but the president's massive fundraising haul in the third quarter shows that playing to the base can have a massive strategic upside.
If five percent don't vote for [Jeb Bush] because of his name, he won't win. So I don't think he can make it, Holzel explained.
President Donald Trump: Hillary Clinton, let-- let me just tell you-- Hillary Clinton deleted, she deleted 33,000 emails after she got a subpoena from the United States Congress.
MARGARET BRENNAN: --hasn't been able to deter them from making that trip.
LESLEY STAHL (60 MINUTES): What about General Mattis, is he going to leave?
BIDEN: And so we'll see. I mean, it's a little premature to make the judgment whether or not this is a good deal or not a good deal.
JOHN DICKERSON: The they as Republicans are calling it the Schumer Shutdown. I want to get past all that. Here's the thing.
Dorcas Reilly CBS News Dorcas Reilly (July 22, 1926-Oct. 15, 2018) was a Campbell Soup kitchen supervisor in 1955 when she combined the ingredients of the now-legendary green bean casserole for an Associated Press feature. The popular dish, made with green beans and cream of mushroom soup and topped with crunchy fried onions, is the most popular recipe ever to come out of Campbell's corporate kitchen. In a 2005 AP interview marking the recipe's 50th anniversary, Reilly said she didn't remember having a hand in it because the dish was among hundreds that were created during her decades at Campbell's. [She also helped create a tomato soup meatloaf, a tuna noodle casserole, and Sloppy Joe-like souperburgers.''] The recipe is still a fixture on soup-can labels and television commercials. And Reilly said she always kept the ingredients for the casserole on hand in her home, just in case someone asked her to whip one up. The recipe's website got 2.7 million visits during last year's holidays, the company said.

We have to make up for lost times, because I want to invest in you. I want to invest in hard-working families. And I think it's been unfortunate, but it's happened, that since the Great Recession, the gains have all gone to the top. And we need to reverse that.
Reid, meanwhile, said Monday afternoon that House Republicans were spinning their wheels attempting to dismantle Obamacare.

Donald Trump has won South Carolina's GOP primary, CBS News projected a half hour after polls closed on Saturday evening.
A Tea Party activist and former talk-show host, Clovis was a Republican candidate for the U.S. Senate in Iowa two years ago and had previously worked with Rick Perry's presidential campaign.
Aretha Franklin Sony Archives Born in Memphis but raised in Detroit by her single father, a Baptist preacher, Aretha Franklin (March 25, 1942-August 16, 2018) began singing in the church choir at an early age, and by 14 the young prodigy was already recording professionally. In the 1960s she released 10 albums with Columbia Records, featuring such songs as You Made Me Love You and Runnin' Out of Fools. But it was at Atlantic Records where Franklin became a superstar, with the 1967 releases Respect, I Never Loved a Man (The Way I Love You), (You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman, and Chain of Fools. She won two Grammys that year (she would go on to win a total of 18), and followed that breakout success with such classics as Think, I Say a Little Prayer, Until You Come Back to Me (That's What I'm Gonna Do), Freeway of Love, and I Knew You Were Waiting (For Me). Her range ran the gamut from gospel, R&B and jazz to rock and pop. Affectionately known as the Queen of Soul, Franklin was hailed by Rolling Stone as the greatest singer of the rock era, and was the first woman to be inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame. But she always defied categorization. At the 1998 Grammys, where she sang Respect, she also substituted for an ailing Luciano Pavarotti by performing Nessun Dorma, from Puccini's Turandot.
You cut Medicaid, so I couldn't get Obamacare, the woman yelled at Scott as he attempted to place an order. You're an a**hole! You don't care about working people.
As he makes the case that voters should reelect him to the highest office in the land, here's how Mr. Trump is doing on delivering some of those original pledges.
Trump is expected to warn that Hillary Clinton will only prolong poverty and violence that exist domestically and war and destruction abroad.
I think this is a test theory about whether voters are going to vote on their local issues that they say poll after poll are most important to them, Turner told CBS News. Or they're going to vote based on who's in what party.
DeSantis, however, mentioned the Broadway tickets several times during the course of the debate.
President Trump said Friday that both parties can do better after the vote on the GOP health care bill was abruptly canceled in the House after it seemed likely it did not have enough support to pass.
4:40 p.m. ET According to CBS affiliate WOIO in Cleveland, some of the protests outside the convention site have begun to get heated.
MARGARET BRENNAN: It's your list. I know you like it.
FACT CHECK: False. The money that Iran is able to access under the nuclear deal was Iranian currency that was frozen through various sanctions over the years. Additionally, Politifact cites experts as saying that the frozen Iranian assets are estimated at closer to $100 billion; $150 billion is a very high estimate.
Later, Stahl brought up Trump's reputation as a man who wasn't prone to being humble.
Six members of the savage MS-13 gang have been charged with Kayla and Nisa's murders. Many of these gang members took advantage of glaring loopholes in our laws to enter the country as illegal, unaccompanied alien minors, and wound up in Kayla and Nisa's high school.
President Biden does not believe, as a principle, it should be difficult ... for people to gain access to health care, she said. He's not been supportive in the past, and is not today, of putting additional restrictions in place.
On Wednesday, Navarro reports Bustos and Guinn addressed several campaign topics that'll be in play these next two months. When asked about public safety and the civil unrest over police brutality, Bustos pointed to the passage of the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act.
There are a lot of very important planning going on, and some of it is to signal to the Sunnis in the area, as well as Kurdish Peshmerga fighters, that we all need to be in this. And that takes a lot of planning and preparation.
America is a nation of builders. We built the Empire State Building in just one year – isn't it a disgrace that it can now take ten years just to get a permit approved for a simple road?
Earlier in the afternoon, an aide to the IDP said the results were being thoroughly vetted and that was part of the reason why final results have not been reported more than 40 hours after the caucuses began. Staff is literally examining the photo or paper records that have been collected and matching it against the inputted response, which obviously takes time, the aide said. We have to do this for all three sets of data — first alignment, final alignment and the state delegate equivalents.
Carla Sands. Chair of investment firm Vintage Capital Group.
GOVERNOR NED LAMONT: I don't think so. They've done a relatively good job of getting us the vaccines when we need it. Our hospital systems and federally qualified health centers, they do things by appointment. That clears up a lot of the confusion you see in some other states. But I do know that one or two of these systems maybe overpromised and, you know, had more people than they had vaccines. We're watching that very carefully. Do it by appointment. Clear up the confusion. Get people vaccinated.
Already on the docket for the Supreme Court this term are blockbuster disputes involving the Affordable Care Act and special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election. Court watchers are also warning the 2020 general election could bring with it a legal battle that puts the Supreme Court in the middle of the contest between Mr. Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden.
No, not at all – I mean, anything that comes like this, it should play its part. It should go through the process. But they need to do it quickly. For the good of the country this investigation needs to happen quickly.
President Donald Trump: It will be.
JOE BIDEN: --what I have read and has been reported. No one has confided in me. I have no inside information.
And when Republicans see President Trump blamed as the sole cause for America's ills, many of them think Buddy, I know exactly how you feel.
But I want to do things that haven't been done, including fixing and making our inner cities better for the African-American citizens that are so great, and for the Latinos, Hispanics, and I look forward to doing it. It's called make America great again.
Lesley Stahl: OK, but what about – they're in every city.
As the Senate Judiciary Committee confirmation hearing is underway for Kavanaugh, Donnelly said he is looking for impartiality and judicial temperament in the confirmation hearings and said he believed Roe v. Wade is settled law.
Moriarty asked, Donald Trump said prior to being elected that he could shoot someone on Fifth Avenue and people would still vote for him. Is there anything that the President could do that would make you change the vote before this election?
One of McCain's closest friends in the Senate, GOP Sen. Lindsey Graham, of South Carolina, issued two tweets praising McCain without mentioning Mr. Trump. Sen. Mitt Romney, a frequent critic of Mr. Trump, went a step further, writing on Twitter, I can't understand why the President would, once again, disparage a man as exemplary as my friend John McCain.
THE FACTS: He is. The U.S. has allocated a substantial amount of weapons and other military equipment to help the Kurds fight the Islamic State group, and is sending the aid.
It includes a permanent funding fix for retired coal miners' health benefits, the senior aide said, as well as $295 million for Puerto Rico's Medicaid shortfall. There are no funding cuts to Planned Parenthood in the package, the aide added, and it would restore year-round Pell Grants.
Republicans would do away with a requirement that insurers cover 10 categories of essential health benefits, leaving such regulation to the states.
I felt I was in a different role as his colleague, that I'm someone that has worked with him for a long time, there's a lot of trust there, and I felt it was best to handle it in that way, Klobuchar told CNN at the time about why she did not call on him to resign. Klobuchar has also faced scrutiny over several news reports detailing a pattern of abusive treatment towards her staff, which has reportedly hindered her efforts to recruit campaign personnel. What Trump says A few hours after her announcement, President Trump mocked Klobuchar for discussing efforts to mitigate climate change during a Midwestern snowstorm. Amy Klobuchar announced that she is running for President, talking proudly of fighting global warming while standing in a virtual blizzard of snow, ice and freezing temperatures. Bad timing. By the end of her speech she looked like a Snowman(woman)! the president tweeted.
Meanwhile, conservative House Republicans introduced a bill on Tuesday that includes elements of failed attempts to repeal Obamacare in 2017. That fall, voters in several red states approved ballot measures to make more low-income people eligible for insurance through Medicaid — a major provision of Obamacare. With Democrats in control of the House, the bill isn't expected to go anywhere.
JOHN DICKERSON: And we'll be right back in one minute with Senator and Author Ben Sasse. Don't go away.
Gillibrand's positions have become more progressive during her time in the Senate. Issues Gillibrand advocated the repeal of the Don't ask, don't tell policy on LGBT military service when she got to the Senate in 2009. She made a name for herself in the Senate by addressing sexual assault in the military. She proposed legislation that would remove sexual assault cases from the military chain of command in 2013, legislation which was co-sponsored by Republican Senators Rand Paul and Ted Cruz. Although the legislation failed, it raised her profile as an advocate for women. Gillibrand has acknowledged her changed positions on immigration and gun control, saying in a 60 Minutes profile in 2018 that she was embarrassed and ashamed of her stances while serving in the House. Health care has been an important issue for Gillibrand since entering the Senate. She came out in favor of single-payer healthcare in 2017 and co-sponsored a Medicare-for-all bill introduced by Sen. Bernie Sanders. She was the first sitting senator to call for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to be abolished, a popular cause on the left. Controversy Gillibrand has faced criticism for representing cigarette manufacturer Philip Morris during her time at Davis Polk, including in civil and criminal investigations by the Department of Justice. She has also been accused of political opportunism for changing her positions so dramatically when she entered the Senate. The New York senator has alienated some in her party with her hardline position on responding to sexual misconduct.
Why are Democrats all talking about Obamacare today? On Wednesday, California Attorney General Xavier Becerra, leading a coalition of 20 states and D.C., filed a briefing with the U.S. Supreme Court to defend the Affordable Care Act. CBS News political unit associate producer Sarah Ewall-Wice says this comes after the high court agreed to review an appeals court decision that found the health care law's individual mandate unconstitutional and called into the question whether the law could stand as a whole.
The GOP is asking the high court to block an extension of the state's deadline to receive absentee ballots postmarked on or before Election Day to November 12. The full 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals voted 12-3 to deny a request from the Republican lawmakers, as well as the Trump campaign and the Republican National Committee, to shorten the deadline for accepting absentee ballots postmarked by Election Day to November 6.
Mike Bloomberg: Well, I don't know if it's a blank check, but, when they come to me and they wanna spend more, I've so far said yes.
He's in his second term as Ohio governor Protestors and union supporters gather as Ohio Gov. John Kasich delivers the State of the State address at Ohio Statehouse on March 8, 2011 in Columbus, Ohio. Mike Munden, Getty Images Had Kasich's first term gone as planned, he might have become the union-busting president before Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker did. In 2011, he championed legislation that would have limited the collective bargaining rights of 350,000 public workers, including teachers, police and firefighters. The backlash was intense, and union forces managed to secure a referendum vote on the law. Voters rejected it, dealing a blow to Kasich and sending his approval rating into the low 30-percent range. But he took the defeat graciously, saying he respected the decision of the voters, and he turned his attention to other budget issues like cutting income taxes and rebuilding the state's rainy day fund (it rose from 89 cents when he took office to more than $2 billion today). He has really not gone back to try to do anything more or be supportive of anything more in terms of attacks on unions, Beck said. Kasich's approval rating rose, and today he's one of the most popular governors in the nation. He was re-elected in 2014 with a whopping 64 percent of the vote, though that was partially due to the collapse of Democratic candidate Ed FitzGerald.

Financial forms for Amy Kennedy, who's running against Jeff Van Drew in New Jersey's 2nd, show investments with several corporations that are either based in or work with Chinese companies. A majority of these are made through the Buena Vista Asian Opportunity hedge fund, and include two education-related companies and a state-owned life insurance company. The value of her listed assets collectively ranges from $20,000 to $120,000. Earlier this month, the National Republican Congressional Committee sent out a press email with a story about her assets calling her a pawn of Communist China. Kennedy's campaign did not respond to a request for comment.
MARGARET BRENNAN: --can you-- can you say--
: What's great about this funding is every effort every city gets its money, regardless of how small they are, and smaller communities have a harder time with COVID because it's not like they have a place that they can really cushion. The smaller the community, the less rainy day fund you have. — Mayor Nan Whaley of Dayton, Ohio On the bill being framed as a bailout versus a disaster relief bill: Well, here, the pandemic is a natural disaster, just like a flood. Well, the thing that's different is the flood is over in a day or two with this pandemic is continued on now for almost a year, and it's still going, and so this isn't a bailout. It's a normal and usual thing after other natural disasters. — Mayor Jeff Williams of Arlington, Texas.
RAMY INOCENCIO: We spoke with Wuhan natives who blame the government. Zhang Hai lost his father and calls it murder.
Interviews were conducted in English and Spanish using live interviewers.
MARGARET BRENNAN: And that is something that has come up with Michael Flynn, the former national security adviser to the President, some defending him saying, Well, it wasn't disclosed to him that he shouldn't lie when he was speaking to FBI agents. Is that entrapment as is being suggested?
But, this election is not actually about Donald Trump, or Hillary Clinton. In fact, this election is not about you or me either. This election is about the very survival of the American Dream, he said.
I know firsthand that when we start going down that road, it can be very, very deadly, DeSantis said. It is important that we try to unify.
Later, Price clarified that he did direct his broker to buy stock in Innate Immunotherapeutics after discussing the company with Rep. Collins of New York.

She was the first senator to call on Sen. Al Franken to resign in 2017 after he was accused of sexual harassment by several women. A few big Democratic donors, including billionaire George Soros, have said that they will not support Gillibrand because of her position on Franken. She has also distanced herself from the Clintons. In November 2017, she said that President Bill Clinton should have resigned after his affair with White House intern Monica Lewinsky became public. What Trump says President Trump tweeted at Gillibrand in December 2017 after she called on the president to resign due to sexual misconduct allegations against him. Lightweight Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, a total flunky for Chuck Schumer and someone who would come to my office begging for campaign contributions not so long ago (and would do anything for them), is now in the ring fighting against Trump. Very disloyal to Bill & Crooked-USED! Mr. Trump tweeted. Critics interpreted the words begging and used in the tweet as having a sexual connotation. You cannot silence me or the millions of women who have gotten off the sidelines to speak out about the unfitness and shame you have brought to the Oval Office, Gillibrand wrote on Twitter in response.
Lesley Stahl: And who is our biggest foreign adversary?
And on Wednesday, he said, Right now we're not getting along with Russia at all.
Obama also took issue with Republicans who have been saying that they will protect patients with pre-existing conditions while threatening to repeal the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. The former president said, Let me say something as the man who passed the law that protects people with pre-existing conditions from being discriminated against: They have no way of protecting people with pre-existing conditions in anything they've proposed.
Lesley Stahl: Are you in any way intimidated, scared about this enormous burden, the gravity of what you're taking on?
In 1996, Seong-ho was a starving boy in North Korea. One day, he tried to steal coal from a railroad car to barter for a few scraps of food, which were very hard to get. In the process, he passed out on the train tracks, exhausted from hunger. He woke up as a train ran over his limbs. He then endured multiple amputations without anything to dull the pain or the hurt. His brother and sister gave what little food they had to help him recover and ate dirt themselves, permanently stunting their own growth.

Joe Biden, speaking of travel, is going to be in Ohio today speaking to literally several people on the ground — a state the president won in 2016 and is going to win again in November, Stepien said on a phone briefing with reporters. We are quite happy to see Joe Biden wasting a valuable day on the campaign trail in a state that he won't win in three weeks.
Mr. Trump wasted no time tweeting about the results:
On the trail in New Hampshire Wednesday, Joe Biden called the early results from the Iowa caucuses a gut punch.
TRUMP STATEMENT: She said the 33,000 emails had to do with her daughter's wedding, number one, and a yoga class. Maybe we'll give three or three or four or five, or something. 33,000 emails deleted. And now she's saying there wasn't anything wrong. And more importantly that was after getting a subpoena, that wasn't before, that was after she got it from the United States Congress.
Who here thinks Mike Pence is a liberal? Anybody? Mike Pence pioneered this in Indiana, Waller said at a state fair before the race. It would be a billion dollars to the state and it wouldn't cost any Mississippi tax money.
Mr. Trump doubled down on his threat to relocate the Republican National Convention if North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper did not issue a definitive answer on whether the Charlotte convention would be allowed full occupancy in August, CBS News campaign reporters LaCrai Mitchell and Nicole Sganga report. As you know we don't have much time, the pesident told reporters Tuesday afternoon. If we're going to spend millions of dollars on an arena, we want to be in North Carolina. Mr. Trump said he would like an answer from the governor's office within a week, adding, certainly, we have to know. Now if he can't do it, if he feels that he's not going to do it, all he has to do is tell us and then we'll have to pick another location. I will tell you a lot of locations wanted it. On Monday, the president tweeted Democrat Governor [Roy Cooper] is still in Shutdown mood & unable to guarantee that by August we will be allowed full attendance in the Arena. Plans are being made by many thousands of enthusiastic Republicans, and others, to head to beautiful North Carolina in August, he continued. They must be immediately given an answer by the Governor as to whether or not the space will be allowed to be fully occupied.
During the campaign Mr. Trump said he would appoint a special prosecutor to look into Hillary Clinton's email issue.
SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR: We have suggested so many things. Comprehensive immigration reform that passed the Senate would have brought down the debt by one hundred fifty eight billion and there was significant funding in there for border security. We just did it with the dreamer's--
JOHN DICKERSON: The president came in saying, Washington's broken. I'm going to fix it.
Meanwhile, the president is also talking health care. We are not going to hurt anything having to do with pre-existing conditions, Mr. Trump said in response to a question at a town hall Tuesday night. But his administration is currently backing a lawsuit to dismantle Obamacare including those protections. The president went on to say he would have a health care plan protecting people with pre-existing conditions and insisted he has it already.
MILLER: Well everybody's bound by the law as long as the law is in effect. I think the important thing, again, is for real bipartisanship to happen, for Democrats to work together with Republicans. You have lawmakers from both--
SEN. BARRASSO: which would be a conte-- we have a different make up of the Supreme Court. It may be several years till it gets there. But as a doctor, I will tell you, I focus on people with preexisting conditions I've always been focused as I was working on health care legislation to make sure people could get the care they need from a doctor that they choose at lower costs. And we didn't get that in Wyoming. We had- after Obamacare was passed many people lost their insurance, premiums doubled. So that wasn't- that doesn't give people affordable insurance that's appropriate for them and their families
MILLER: Our hearts break for the tragic death of the 7 year old girl. The loss of that precious life is. Horrifying. It is a painful reminder of the ongoing humanitarian tragedy that is illegal immigration and the misery that it spreads. A coyote dropped off one hundred sixty three migrants in an extremely remote section of New Mexico. Those individuals were found by border patrol who, many cases act as first responders. In fact Border Patrol saves about 4,000 lives every single year. Unfortunately hundreds die on the dangerous trek up. Smuggling organizations profit off death and misery. They are vicious, vile organizations. And it's time that both parties had the appropriate level of outrage over the fact that these organizations--

The Republican presidential candidate's winning margin has grown from one-tenth of a percentage point in 2008, to 10 points in 2012, and 19 points in 2016. McCaskill was first elected in 2006 as part of a blue wave when Democrats took control of both the House and the Senate.

'I was very thankful that I was able to pivot my business model…not every business is capable of doing that.

SENATOR RICK SCOTT: --and running all of health care has never worked. It's not going to work. We're going-- we're going to ruin the entire system. Let's focus on the problem we have. The problem is not access the problem is the cost of health care and the unbelievable inflation we've seen. Let's start with drug prices.
Defenders of the Affordable Care Act argued that the issues raised by the case are too important to let the litigation drag on for months or years in lower courts, and that the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans erred when it struck down the health law's now toothless requirement that Americans have health insurance.

The Democrats' rally is part of a broader messaging campaign the DNC is launching between now and Tuesday to draw attention from Mr. Trump's reelection launch. Using digital ads, the DNC intends to persuade voters that the president has not helped them while attacking his record on health care, education, jobs and the environment. The DNC also plans to put its representatives on TV to push that message.
Donald Trump: That's the only people you have down there.
While Republicans largely oppose Obamacare on its merits, they have not been able to coalesce around an alternative when they controlled both chambers of Congress and the White House. In a divided government, the task is infinitely more difficult. And Republicans lack a central figure to effectively make the case to the public.
Nearly 600,000 thousands jobs in the clean energy industry have been lost since the beginning of the pandemic, according to an analysis from the BW Research firm.

Lesley Stahl: So you get all this affection. And then you give them this speech kinda scolding to the people who just stood up and loved you. This was a speech condemning the way the Senate has been operating.

Allowing Medicare to negotiate prices is unacceptable to the powerful drug lobby, which has spent tens of millions of dollars since Trump's inauguration to influence the Washington conversation around drug prices, including a high-profile TV advertising campaign portraying its scientists as medical trailblazers.
Donald Trump: Don't be afraid. We are going to bring our country back. But certainly, don't be afraid. You know, we just had an election and sort of like you have to be given a little time. I mean, people are protesting. If Hillary had won and if my people went out and protested, everybody would say, Oh, that's a terrible thing. And it would have been a much different attitude. There is a different attitude. You know, there is a double standard here.

COOPER: Your two minutes is up. Secretary Clinton, two minutes?
Nevada's Democratic Governor Steve Sisolak late Wednesday released a letter that was sent to Vice President Mike Pence decrying Mr. Trump's recent campaign rallies in the state, expressing confusion and utter disbelief over rallies held in defiance of the state's caps on mass gatherings and social distancing guidelines, reports CBS News campaign reporter Alex Tin. The president has repeatedly denounced Nevada's governor after the campaign's initial plans ran afoul of Nevada's coronavirus measures, accusing Sisolak of being a political person in a recent White House briefing and linking his criticism to the state's recent move to expand mail-in voting amid the pandemic. It's the secretary of state here, who happens to be a Republican, who oversees the election here as well as our administrators, our local registrars, Nevada Attorney General Aaron Ford, a Democrat, told Fox News. There won't be any cheating on behalf of the governor or anyone here.

Donald Trump is desperate to bend this — to pin the socialist label of socialist, socialist, socialist, on our party. We can't let him do that, Biden said. But he added that the Vermont senator a good man.
RADDATZ: There's been lots of fact-checking on that. I'd like to move on to an online question...

He knowingly and willingly lied about the threat it posed to the country for months, Biden said. He had the information. He knew how dangerous it was.

Growing up, Haley said, her family as always the other.
In closing, this was a big decision in the Flynn case, to-- to say the least. When history looks back on this decision, how do you think it will be written? What will it say about your decision making?

In fact, the Club for Growth is a heavy political hitter. The Center for Responsive Politics notes that Club for Growth is one of the top all-time political donors from the period between 1989 and 2010 -- even though the group was only founded in 1999. In the 2010 election cycle alone, the group spent more than $8.2 million supporting conservative candidates like Pennsylvania's new senator, Pat Toomey.

Tonight, I'm calling on Congress to produce a bill that generates at least $1.5 trillion for the new infrastructure investment that our country so desperately needs. Every federal dollar should be leveraged by partnering with state and local governments and, where appropriate, tapping into private sector investment to permanently fix the infrastructure deficit. And we can do it.

The same Rep. Hoyer who dismisses impeachment talk as unproductive has accused the president of treason. Sen. Schumer says Trump's presidency is so riddled with corruption that his Supreme Court pick shouldn't be allowed on the court. Elected Democrats regularly call the president a crook, a racist, a sexual predator and a psychopath.
Mr. Obama acknowledged Thursday that he will have to win back some credibility on this health care law in particular and on a whole range of these issues in general.

Verma deflected questions with off-topic responses in which she stressed the cost-savings the Trump administration has achieved, the flexibility it has given health care providers and consumers, and the lack of affordability in premiums. At one point, she argued that people don't really have protections for preexisting conditions because they can't afford to buy health insurance in the first place.
Separately Buttigieg's campaign says it has bought ad time on urban contemporary radio stations in southern Nevada, with plans to expand the ad buy to local Spanish music and talk stations. CBS News campaign reporter Alex Tin says the South Bend mayor joins a handful of candidates, including Bernie Sanders and Tom Steyer, who have taken their campaigns to black and Hispanic drivetime audiences in the state.
MARGARET BRENNAN: And that means a shutdown?
The Trump administration had no immediate rebuttal to the issues raised by the two experts.

People like Donald, who paid zero in taxes, zero for our vets, zero for our military, zero for health and education, that is wrong.
Many leaders said that race shouldn't be the top or only factor in choosing the right running mate. And all of the black women political leaders that CBS News spoke with said the eventual vice-presidential pick must have a strong grasp on the problems facing the black community and particularly black women. Perry and Mitchell reported on CBSN that while prominent black women like former Georgia State House Leader Stacey Abrams and Senator Kamala Harris of California were mentioned as viable prospects, activists in battleground states like Wisconsin believe that Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts is the candidate who can deliver on issues that are important to black women. [Warren] works with people and listens to people and will continue to push the work of making racial justice a priority, advocating for black women's leadership across the country [and] lifting up especially in those down ballot races where there are so many powerful black women running in their communities, said Priscilla Bort, who is an organizer for the Wisconsin Working Families Party.
Later, the Washington senator hammered Price on past statements expressing skepticism at the need for birth control coverage in the Affordable Care Act.

Historically, stock market volatility increased ahead of the elections due to policy uncertainty. However, stocks also tended to rebound strongly coming out of midterm election-year lows, LPL Financial wrote in a research note last month. We are now entering the most favorable part of the four-year presidential cycle.
Progressive groups called on the Senate to match the $3.6 billion in election assistance funding that the House passed earlier this month in the HEROES ACT in a press call on Tuesday afternoon. The groups explained these funds will be able to improve and implement vote-by-mail systems and ensure no-excuse absentee ballots ahead of the November general election, reports CBS News campaign reporter Jack Turman. Sean Eldridge, the president of Stand Up America, also commented on the president's recent attacks on vote-by-mail. Trump is trying to make it more difficult for us to vote in the middle of a pandemic for what he perceives as personal political gain, Eldridge said. Trump's lies, his tweets and his baseless lawsuits are despicable attacks on our democracy.

There's a lot of independents like me who might have voted for Trump last time who are gonna vote Biden this time because of what Trump has done, Martin said.
MARGARET BRENNAN: --right at the heart of American democracy.
SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: Well, I don't think Democrats overreached. Democrats wanted a thorough FBI investigation. In the end, it was Mitch McConnell--Senator McConnell--who really cut that short and did not allow a full investigation, but what I have seen actually is that the Kavanaugh hearings have actually energized a lot of Democrats especially younger voters and women voters. Yes, they've energized some Republicans. It just goes to show that turnout is really important in these midterm elections.
Supporters of Mr. Trump outside the rally told CBS News that they would vote for Reeves because of the president's endorsement. Chuck Mauney of Booneville refused to say anything bad about Hood but said he would vote for Reeves because it would do no good to vote for someone who wouldn't work with Mr. Trump.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you think are lessons for the current administration to learn?
Congress should remain in session with no recess until we work out a long-term bipartisan budget deal that addresses all issues, they said. The current CR ignores key priorities -- community health centers, permanent protection for Dreamers, emergency relief for Florida, Texas, western states ravaged by wildfires, Puerto Rico, the [U.S. Virgin Islands], opioid treatment and pension reform.
Republican efforts to end Planned Parenthood funding legislatively have largely fallen short.

When asked by CBS News if Dr. Redfield stood by his comments after the president publicly contradicted him at today's news conference, Redfield said in a statement, I 100% believe in the importance of vaccines and the importance in particular of a COVID-19 vaccine. A COVID-19 vaccine is the thing that will get Americans back to normal everyday life. The best defense we currently have against this virus are the important mitigation efforts of wearing a mask, washing your hands, social distancing and being careful about crowds.
If there are roadblocks on Capitol Hill, the president could take executive action, a power he has resorted to before, despite his frequent criticism of former President Obama for the same thing.

Mulvaney indicated that, while the Trump administration had continued the CSR payments, they had not yet decided whether they would make the May payment, the aide said. Mulvaney has also offered a dollar for dollar exchange with Democrats -- funding the CSRs at the same level as a southern border wall, which Democrats have rejected.
MARGARET BRENNAN: --start of, because I do want to get to some of your platform issues, but let's start with these allegations from Lucy Flores. She is a Nevada politician who you had endorsed and who in the past has been supportive of you. She hasn't endorsed a candidate in this particular race, but she's accused Vice President Joe Biden of inappropriate touching. You know her. Do you believe her? What do you make of this?
MARGARET BRENNAN: You said that Michael Cohen has evidence to back up his allegations here.
While analysts at the conservative Heritage Foundation concede undocumented immigrant households do contribute tax revenue, they make the case that what they contribute is far outweighed by what their presence here in the U.S. costs taxpayers.

During the 2016 primaries I was a radio talk host in Atlanta, Georgia—a conservative host on a conservative station in a conservative state. I was surprised by the amount of support a big-city, liberal-leaning TV star like Donald Trump had among people I knew were traditional conservatives who in the past would never support someone with Trump's (ahem) troubling background.
We did not need to create this huge explosion all around it, Donnelly noted. We needed to fix that piece, but you didn't need to do all of the collateral damage that has occurred around it.
DR. VANESSA TYSON: In front of the Virginia general assembly under oath. I would want Meredith, myself, and Mister Fairfax to be able to speak, to be heard, and particularly for survivors I think this is incredibly important. They need to be heard. We need to be seen, right. We need to be treated as the human beings that we are.
The CR includes a six-year reauthorization of the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) and delays on three Obamacare taxes. North Carolina Republican Rep. Mark Meadows, the chairman of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, has also demanded new funding for the rest of the year for the military. But Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wisconsin, expressed optimism Thursday morning that Republicans will have the votes to pass the bill in the House.
The Trump administration this week released the final rule on short-term health insurance plans that are a cheaper alternative to buying individual insurance on the Obamacare exchange but usually offer far less comprehensive coverage.
MARGARET TALEV: I don't think that that shake up is done. In fact, it was only a week ago when the world thought that Nick Ayers would be the President's next chief of staff, but if he had come in under that arrangement they were discussing, it also would have been interim arrangement. The President wasn't comfortable with that a week ago. Part of that interim arrangement would have been to execute the sort of staff overhaul, shake up, whatever you want to call it, that is now kind of slow rolling underway. Will Mick Mulvaney execute it differently than Nick Ayers? Possibly. But it's all up to the President. It's always been up to the President. So, some of the other folks who may or may not be on the chopping block, the education secretary, the commerce secretary. But it will ultimately be up to the President, and always-- always would have been. For months now, they've been looking at those midterm elections as a reset point, understanding that if the Democrats took the House, it would change the dynamic of the second two years of the President's term. And now the President is trying to go into this new era in the stronger position as possible. So, folks who have baggage, political weakness that could drag him down, they-- he wants to be able to transition them out in some of these places including interior--

At this late stage, it's no longer about persuading people on the fence. Campaigns should be focused on getting the converted to their polling places. For Democrats, the message is simple: We are better than this.
A large majority of Democrats interviewed said they are worried about the future of the economy in Iowa. Democrats indicated while the economy may be working for them personally, the trade war with China is threatening the state's agriculture sector.
Fresh off what he and his allies saw as a major victory in the conclusion of the special counsel investigation, President Trump surprised his party this week by embracing a politically perilous subject: health care.
Lesley Stahl: 'Cause you were in front of a rally of people saying it, encouraging it.
This current set of furloughs could be the straw that breaks the camel's back for some of these folks, he said.
President Trump did not attend Mulvaney's meeting with the two. White House officials maintain that Verma continues to have the support of the president, but Mr. Trump has made it clear that he wants the bickering between Azar and Verma to stop. Mr. Trump doesn't care if they like each other, but they have a job to do, one official said. Their jobs are not in jeopardy, the source said.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator, thank you for being here. You certainly have your work cut out for you.
The case hardly marks the first time the Supreme Court will hear a dispute involving Obamacare. Most notably, in 2012, the high court upheld the health care law's individual mandate, which is considered to be the heart of Obamacare and requires all Americans to purchase health insurance coverage, in a 5-4 vote.

The world is a dangerous place, a narrator says as the digital ad, provided first to CBS News, opens on a shot of the White House at 3 a.m. At any hour, our president could be called on to act calmly, decisively, intelligently.
... what would you do about Syria and the humanitarian crisis in Aleppo? And I want to remind you what your running mate said. He said provocations by Russia need to be met with American strength and that if Russia continues to be involved in air strikes along with the Syrian government forces of Assad, the United States of America should be prepared to use military force to strike the military targets of the Assad regime.
Divesting his company holdings. This is a thorny and potentially time-consuming problem because CKE is not a public traded company. The goal is to prevent any possible conflict of interest with regulating an investment Puzder might hold, such as interest in a fast-food enterprise with thousands of employees.
Voters in early primary states have repeatedly said in interviews with CBS News that they are impressed and overwhelmed by their options — and not seeking more. Polling and interviews show that Democratic primary voters are eagerly seeking someone equipped to defeat President Trump next year.

PAUL RYAN: And with respect to DACA, it's really important. We want to fix the root cause of the problem while we address the symptom of the problem. That's perfectly common sense. And just so you know, John, we had good faith negotiations on this issue

Partisan court-packing undermines the fundamental premise of the SCOTUS: that it is above politics. (In theory, at least.)
Medicaid, the federal-state program that currently covers more than 70 million low-income people, would cease to be an open-ended federal entitlement. Though federal funding would be limited, states would get more leeway to run their programs. A richer funding stream for adults newly covered under former President Barack Obama's law would be eliminated.
Lesley Stahl: If the Supreme Court ends this-- Obamacare--
PAUL RYAN: That's one that we don't support. And it was- it was an end-run around the negotiations we had. The president-- so we had a negotiating format up. They brought other-- another bill, end-run around it. The president doesn't support it. We don't support it. So what we're saying is let's stick with these negotiations. We had Kevin McCarthy in the majority leader of the House. Steny Hoyer the majority whip. Dick Durbin, the majority-- minority whip and John Cornyn, the-- the majority whip of the Senate in negotiations. They try to bring some end-run around it that the president, he doesn't support, that we wouldn't support. We will support a bill that the president supports to fix this problem. And that means fixing this problem more comprehensively so we don't have another DACA problem five, ten years down the road.
I am proud to be gay, he said to cheers and a standing ovation from the delegates, as he said words never before uttered from the podium during a GOP convention.
Like other candidates, he has his groupies - people who follow him around from event to event. Sixty-four-year-old retired nightclub owner Richard Snowden, once drove nearly 700 miles to Virginia Beach, Virginia for a Trump rally, only to find it had been canceled because of Hurricane Joaquin.
9:52 p.m. Here tonight are two fathers and two mothers: Evelyn Rodriguez, Freddy Cuevas, Elizabeth Alvarado, and Robert Mickens. Their two teenage daughters -- Kayla Cuevas and Nisa Mickens -- were close friends on Long Island. But in September 2016, on the eve of Nisa's 16th Birthday, neither of them came home. These two precious girls were brutally murdered while walking together in their hometown. Six members of the savage gang MS-13 have been charged with Kayla and Nisa's murders, Mr. Trump said.
As we have seen tonight, the most difficult challenges bring out the best in America. We see a vivid expression of this truth in the story of the Holets family of New Mexico.

Lesley Stahl: One of the complaints we've heard is that you don't reach across the aisle because it seems like right now nothing is getting done. You pass things-- whatever it is dies in the Senate.
Joe Biden's search for a running mate is likely well underway, CBS News campaign reporter Bo Erickson reports. The vetting process may look a little different this year because of the constraints caused by the coronavirus pandemic. Biden recently said he expects the vetting process to take at least five to eight weeks. Previously, he said he hopes to announce his decision by July.
Few Republicans, 7 percent, are confident that stricter gun laws would reduce gun violence, though most Democrats and half of independents think that would help somewhat. There is greater bipartisan support for better mental health screening.

Donald Trump: We have so much work. There's so much work to be done. And I want to get it done for the people. I want to get it done. We're lowering taxes, we're taking care of health care. I mean, there's just so much to be done. So I don't think we'll be very big on vacations, no.
Yes. Essentially. They had started a counterintelligence investigation during the summer, as you know, related to the campaign.

Biden flatly denied Reade's accusation in an interview on MSNBC on Friday morning, calling upon the National Archives to release documents relevant to her allegation.
The DNC War Room plans to make the case that Mr. Trump's reelection launch represents a new campaign with more broken promises, arguing the president has sold Americans short. They will particularly focus on his tax cut plan, arguing it's given cuts to the wealthy but not to average Americans, and that he's flooded the swamp he promised to drain with special interest lobbyists. They also plan to attack Mr. Trump's promise that he'd make health care cost less, save manufacturing jobs, and stand up to drug companies, arguing that he hasn't done any of those things. During Mr. Trump's rally, the DNC will be offering their own fact check of Mr. Trump's claims.
It sounds to me like one of your objectives is to never allow the Justice Department to be used as a political weapon. That's what you're saying you think happened here?

For Mr. Trump, that means Democrats will have every opportunity to obtain the president's tax returns, which he has refused to hand over since before the election. Democrats are also poised to launch or continue probes into the president's businesses and potential conflicts of interest. Mr. Trump never fully divested from his businesses upon assuming office, and Democrats are unsatisfied with the lack of information on how the president and his family might be profiting from transactions the public can't see. Litigation is already pending claiming foreign payments to Mr. Trump's businesses violate the Emoluments Clause of the U.S. Constitution.
But the Washington Post noted that in her autobiography, Living History, Clinton wrote that she told the prosecutor in the case, I really don't feel comfortable taking on such a client, but [the prosecutor] gently reminded me that I couldn't very well refuse the judge's request. Ultimately, the prosecution's case against the man fell apart for other reasons, the Post notes, including investigators' mishandling of evidence.
STEPHEN MILLER: Our hearts break for the tragic death of the seven-year-old girl. The loss of that precious life is horrifying. It is a painful reminder of the ongoing humanitarian tragedy that is illegal immigration and the misery that it spreads. A coyote dropped off a hundred and sixty-three migrants in an extremely remote section of New Mexico. Those individuals were found by Border Patrol who, many cases act as first responders. In fact, Border Patrol saves about four thousand lives every single year. Unfortunately, hundreds die on the dangerous trek up. Smuggling organizations profit off death and misery. They are vicious, vile organizations. And it's time that both parties had the appropriate level of outrage over the fact that these organizations--

The response from Democrats was muted for most of the address. However, Mr. Trump was able to elicit a number of bipartisan ovations for his guests in the audience. Several of the guests were moved to tears by the reception.
While acknowledging that student debt levels for graduates are averaging around $27,000, the GOP college plank states the federal government should not be in the business of originating student loans ... and private sector participation in student financing should be restored.
Other invited guests represent concerns about education, small business, the military and veterans.
The Trump administration's views on what parts of the ACA might be kept or replaced if the law is overturned have shifted over time. But in legal arguments, it has always supported getting rid of Obamacare provisions that prohibit insurance companies from discriminating against people on account of their medical history.
Both Azar and Verma have powerful allies in the administration. Azar is close to White House counsel Pat Cipollone and Attorney General Bill Barr, while Verma, who oversaw Indiana's Medicaid program, has close ties to Vice President Pence.

-- Reflections of My Life Scottish singer-songwriter Dean Ford (September 5, 1946-December 31, 2018) was best known as the frontman for the pop group Marmalade in the late '60s-early '70s. He co-wrote their hits Reflections of My Life and I See the Rain, and recorded a cover of The Beatles' Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da that went to #1 in the U.K. Prior to Marmalade, he was lead singer of Dean Ford and The Gaylords, whose songs included Twenty Miles. Marmalade toured with Joe Cocker and The Who, but after moving to the United States, Ford entered AA and conquered his alcoholism. He returned to music in the late '80s, including his 2017 solo album, Feel My Heartbeat. (Pictured: His eponymous 1975 album.) Play excerpt: Marmalade's Reflections of My Life Play excerpt: Dean Ford's Glasgow Road In 2015 he told The Scottish Mail, I tend not to look back too often. I don't like looking back.

Sen. Patty Murray, the ranking Democrat on the HELP committee, said in a statement at the beginning of the hearing that Price will face tough questions on Obamacare and his own investments and stock trades involving health care companies. Murray also voiced her concerns on how Price's policy stances could impact women's access to health care, including access to Planned Parenthood.
It is unclear how Patrick's late decision to join the fray could reshape the Democratic contest. The Iowa caucus is less than three months away on February 3. And he starts far behind in a record-sized field that polling shows is now divided into two tiers — with the top tier consisting of Joe Biden, Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders and Pete Buttigieg.
The bills to fund on-time veterans benefits, re-open the national parks and memorials and let the D.C. government continue running on its own revenue failed in the House Tuesday evening, primarily because of Democratic opposition; the measures needed two-thirds support to pass. Before the House even voted on them, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., called the bills just another wacky idea from the tea party Republicans, and indicated they had no future in the Democratically-controlled Senate.
Under her leadership last year, the Democrats won back control of the House. The San Francisco liberal is now the voice of her party and chief critic of President Trump; she's also keeping close tabs on at least six House committees investigating the president. And she's pressing for release of the full, unredacted Mueller report.
I think wherever we can cooperate with Russia, that's fine. And I did as secretary of state. That's how we got a treaty reducing nuclear weapons. It's how we got the sanctions on Iran that put a lid on the Iranian nuclear program without firing a single shot. So I would go to the negotiating table with more leverage than we have now. But I do support the effort to investigate for crimes, war crimes committed by the Syrians and the Russians and try to hold them accountable.
This marks the fourth short-term spending bill Congress has had on its plate since September. Democrats, however, remain largely opposed to the measure because they want it tied to a larger immigration deal over the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program and border security.

John Kasich by casting him as an ally of President Obama's.
Democratic Senate hopeful Jaime Harrison of South Carolina raised $57 million between July and September. Sara Gideon in Maine raised more than $39 million in that same period. And Mark Kelly in Arizona brought in $38.7 million. These eye-popping numbers shattered the previous record for fundraising, Beto O'Rourke's $38 million cash haul in the third quarter of 2018. Now the Democrats are spending that money in the face of massive Republican super PAC funds, report CBS News political unit associate producers Sarah Ewall-Wice and Eleanor Watson. And it's left many Republican candidates with more cash on hand than the Democrats in the final weeks of the race. In South Carolina, where the Senate race is unexpectedly tight, Harrison's $57 million in three months was more than double what Republican incumbent Senator Lindsey Graham raised with $28 million, a state record for a Republican. Records show from July through September, Harrison spent more than $55 million. According to his October FEC filing, Harrison paid AL Media LLC more than $42 million over three months for TV, radio and digital advertising. He also spent another $6.5 million for digital advertising and services to Mothership Strategies, and $2 million to Blueprint Strategy LLC for radio and billboard advertising. $641,000 went to direct mailing services. That amounts to more than $51 million spent on ads and direct mail alone.

Extended timing. Under Obamacare, short-term plans could only be sold for a coverage period of 90 days. That seemed a reasonable amount of time to offer bare bones coverage for people who are in between jobs or in another short-term bind.
Klobuchar also said she would like to see Congress get to the bottom of what happened in the death of 7-year-old Jackeline Caal, an immigrant who died two days after she and her father were taken into custody along the U.S. border.

Like a lot of Trump rhetoric, it isn't entirely accurate. It claims, for instance, that Elizabeth Warren's Medicare for All plan would cost taxpayers 52 TRILLION DOLLARS – undoubtedly raising taxes on the middle class to pay for it. The plan she released specifically avoids increasing taxes on the middle class.
A day after House GOP leadership laid out its agenda for the election homestretch and beyond, the DCCC issued a 48 days out memo detailing the state of the House battlefield.
McCain stayed above the fray during the controversy that ensued, but his relationship with Trump was never warm. He was the deciding vote that killed the new president's plan to repeal Obamacare.
On Friday, Donald Trump announced that he was changing the head of his transition team. Governor Chris Christie was replaced by Vice President-elect Mike Pence. Mr. Trump also added his three older children to the transition team.
So what should Democrats focus on in these final days?

In a memo obtained by CBS News, the chairs of the committee in charge of approving the delegate selection plans told its members they are in close contact with the state parties about modifying delegate selection plans.

Most recently in early August, the president teased an executive order to require health insurers to cover pre-existing conditions, but that has not yet been unveiled. This comes as less than a week ago, the Biden campaign also started airing another ad in which Biden talks about his experience with health insurance, saying Obamacare is personal to him and taking aim at the president.
