Companies and groups last year increased their spending on Washington lobbying to a level not seen in nearly a decade, according to the latest disclosures.\n\nThe outlays to influence the federal government hit $3.47 billion in 2019, the biggest total since 2010's spending of $3.51 billion. The annual figures, shown in the chart below, come from a Center for Responsive Politics analysis of lobbying disclosures filed through last week.\n\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and subsequent efforts to get extenders and clarifications passed have been big drivers in the rise in lobbying spending since 2016, said Jeff Hauser, founder and director of the Revolving Door Project, which aims to track corporate political influence and is part of the Center for Economic and Policy Research, a left-leaning think tank. There also has been considerable lobbying around drug pricing, tariffs and other trade issues, immigration and Big Tech FDN, -0.36% matters.\n\nHauser also said the Trump administration seems to be signalling that lobbying is nothing to be ashamed of as many former lobbyists have executive-branch jobs, and at the same time more people might be disclosing their lobbying activities now that former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort is in prison after failing to register as a foreign agent.\n\nSo how does the increase in lobbying spending square with President Donald Trump's promise to drain the swamp?\n\nI think Trump is redefining what the term 'swamp' means, Hauser said. It was initially understood to be excessive influence of money on politics, but I think the term has morphed in how it is understood on the right. Now it means entrenched people in Washington, especially progressives.\n\nThe White House and Trump's re-election campaign didn't immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nA recording that surfaced last week sheds light on some current approaches to Washington lobbying, even as it mostly got attention for its implications in Trump's ongoing impeachment trial. The tape — which was released by a lawyer for Lev Parnas, an indicted associate of Rudy Giuliani — features donors to a Trump super PAC making requests such as backing for a 500-mile highway that would be used just by self-driving trucks, a New York Times report said. Another donor pushed the president to further limit steel imports.\n\nWhen using numbers adjusted for inflation, lobbying spending last year rose to an eight-year high, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Meanwhile, the number of registered lobbyists hit a six-year high in 2019, though the nonpartisan center has warned that there is rampant shadow lobbying in Washington, meaning undisclosed activities.\n\nThe peak lobbying spending in 2009 and 2010 was driven in large part by efforts to influence Obamacare and the Dodd-Frank financial reform law, as well as cap-and-trade legislation and the Employee Free Choice Act, the Revolving Door Project's Hauser said.\n\nThis report was first published on Jan. 27, 2020.
What might be the implications for Americans 50 years and older if Democrat Joe Biden wins the race for the White House?\n\nA close look at the Democratic platform draft as well as Biden's website and interviews with analysts suggests that Biden wants to tackle several major challenges confronting those in the second half of life. It lays out the kind of policy framework President Obama had, but several initiatives take it a step farther — perhaps an additional two to three steps.\n\nReading through the draft Democratic platform, the cumulative effect is that the federal government would take on a bigger role in everything from retirement security to health care to sustainability. A core idea: animating the greater government activism with policies to improve the general welfare and social connectedness.\n\nThe platform's focus and what's missing\n\nIt's a focus on the common good and sharing risk and strengthening the safety net, including the retirement safety net, says Norm Ornstein, political scientist and resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute.\n\nThat said, Biden's platform is big on promises and light on funding details, which isn't uncommon for party platforms. And, of course, if Biden does become president, the fate of his legislative ambitions will depend on which party controls the Senate and the House of Representatives. We'll know that on Nov. 3, or fairly soon thereafter.\n\nHighlights and analysis of the draft Democratic Party platform:\n\nCaregiving, caregivers and long-term care: The most striking part of Biden's platform — to me — is its emphasis on supporting the professional long-term care workforce serving older adults in nursing homes, assisted living facilities and in homes, as well as assisting family caregivers.\n\nBiden calls for improving the pay and benefits of the low-wage direct care workforce, such as home care aides and personal care assistants. They often earn minimum wage with no benefits.\n\nAlso read: Kamala Harris on student-loan forgiveness, Medicare, universal basic income, credit scores — and a tax on trading stocks\n\nThe draft platform backs a national minimum wage of $15 an hour for the caregiving workforce. In addition, they'd get up to 12 weeks of federally provided paid family and medical leave.\n\nThey are among the hardest working people, yet the lowest paid workers, says Eric Kingston, professor of social work at Syracuse University. The emphasis on caregiving is long overdue.\n\nThe estimated 40 million-plus unpaid family caregivers would also get a financial boost. Among the ideas Biden backs is an annual tax credit of up to $5,000 for informal caregivers to reimburse expenses. Unpaid family caregivers would also be able to accrue Social Security benefits for the time they spend caregiving. And they'd be allowed to make catch-up contributions to retirement accounts, even if they're not earning an income.\n\nOlder Americans who buy long-term care insurance and pay for it from their retirement savings would get a generous tax break, too.\n\nBiden's platform also embraces state Medicaid home- and community-based care for low-income adults. Its $450 billion initiative targets getting 800,000 people off waiting lists for community care.\n\nThe plan falls well short of universal long-term care coverage, though.\n\nFor example, it doesn't include much to benefit middle-income recipients of long-term care and their families, Howard Gleckman, senior fellow at the Urban Institute, recently wrote for Forbes. These are the millions of people who are not poor enough to be eligible for Medicaid, but do not have sufficient resources to purchase assistance on their own, he said.\n\nStill, analysts like Gleckman applaud Biden for grasping the need for better long-term care support and services.\n\nThis proposal recognizes, if you're going to be serious about home-based and community services, it will take real dollars, says Ruth Katz, senior vice president for public policy/advocacy at LeadingAge, the association of nonprofit providers of aging services.\n\nTaxes and health care\n\nTaxes: They'd be going up. Much of the initial round of Biden's tax increases would come from reversing many of Trump's signature tax cuts from 2017. This would impact upper-income Americans the most, regardless of age.\n\nFor example, Biden wants to roll back Trump's 20% long-term capital-gains tax on investments and restore the 39.6% top tax rate for anyone making over $1 million. He'd also close loopholes that wealthy Americans avoid taxes on capital gains altogether and raise estate taxes back to the historical norm, according to the draft platform.\n\nHealth care: The health care proposals are really trying to take Obamacare to the next level, says Ornstein. It's probably the next thing Obama would have done if he could have a third term. The Affordable Care Act [ACA] was always a step toward robust universal coverage.\n\nBiden's draft platform would give everyone the option of choosing a public health insurance option like Medicare. Intriguingly, it also proposes lowering the Medicare age from 65 to 60, for those who want to enroll earlier than they can today. That would benefit early retirees, whether they were laid off or voluntarily left employment, perhaps to start their own businesses.\n\nThe lowest-income Americans would be automatically enrolled in the public option without health care premiums; they could opt out at any time.\n\nFor people losing health insurance coverage due to lost jobs resulting from the pandemic, the federal government would pick up 100% of the cost of COBRA (the federal law extending employers' health insurance for workers who lose it).\n\nAnd there are several ideas to lower prescription drug costs that Democrats have pushed for years — including some Trump has supported. Medicare would be free to negotiate prices with drug companies; makers of Medicare-covered prescriptions wouldn't be allowed to raise prices by more than inflation and consumers could legally buy prescription drugs from other countries.\n\nThe draft platform says Democrats will cap out-of-pocket drug costs for seniors, but doesn't offer a dollar amount for the cap. It also talks about ensuring that effective treatments for chronic health conditions are available at little or no cost, but doesn't explain how that would happen.\n\nAlthough the Trump administration has tried to repeal the ACA — Obama's signature legislation —and made it less comprehensive, Biden would expand the ACA with the goal of lowering Americans' health care costs. If costs fell, that would be a boon to those in the second half of life and not yet eligible for Medicare.\n\nNo family buying insurance on the individual marketplace, regardless of income, would spend more than 8.5% of income on health insurance. And tax credits would be based on the marketplaces' more generous gold plan, rather than the silver plan.\n\nBiden also wants to create a Public Health Jobs Corps to mobilize at least 100,000 people and help identify those at risk of contracting or spreading infectious diseases. Think of a public health version of Teach for America, with jobs as community health workers and elsewhere.\n\nPeople have talked about it for a long time, says Katz.\n\nA Public Health Jobs Corps might be an option for experienced workers looking for encore careers.\n\nSocial Security, retirement and working longer\n\nSocial Security: Early in the first Obama administration, numerous Democrats flirted with the idea of serious deficit reduction including cuts in Social Security benefits, possibly by raising the retirement age. Those days are gone with the Biden platform.\n\nMore: Social Security could be vulnerable under President Trump's plan for payroll taxes\n\nIn fact, Biden is calling for increases in Social Security benefits and no benefit cuts, says Teresa Ghilarducci, professor of economics at the New School for Social Research and the Director of the Schwartz Center for Economic Policy Analysis. No sneaky cuts as a result of raising the retirement age.\n\nAmong the draft platform's Social Security proposals:\n\nImprove Social Security's long-term solvency (its trust fund is expected to be depleted by 2035 or perhaps sooner due to the pandemic) by having Americans with high wages pay the same Social Security payroll taxes that middle-class families pay. The platform didn't offer specifics, but Biden has said he'd require people to pay Social Security taxes on income over roughly $400,000. Today, employment earnings of up to $137,700 are subject to Social Security payroll taxes.\n\nThe oldest beneficiaries — people receiving Social Security retirement benefits for at least 20 years — would get a higher monthly check (not stated: how much higher) to help protect against dwindling retirement savings. And workers who spent 30 years employed would get a benefit of at least 125% of the poverty level.\n\nSurviving spouses would keep a higher share of Social Security benefits. Biden would raise the monthly payment by about 20% for them.\n\nRetirement security and savings: Here, the approach is pragmatic rather than bold. The Democratic draft platform doesn't favor universal retirement savings plans (an idea floated by various Republican and Democratic administrations since President Carter). I was looking for the word to delink pensions from employers, said Ghilarducci. I don't see it.\n\nThe biggest change here would convert tax-deductible contributions to 401(k)s, which favor higher-income families, into tax credits equalizing the tax break for all income levels. Ghilarducci thinks this would lead to most people eligible for 401(k) plans putting at least some money into them.\n\nThe platform also mentions providing more equitable access to employer-sponsored retirement plans through automatic enrollment.\n\nFor workers without access to employer-sponsored retirement savings plans, Biden would offer employers incentives to create automatic 401(k)s for employees.\n\nWorking longer: The platform is sketchy but says that Democrats will invest in career and technical education and high-quality job training programs.\n\nBiden also favors bipartisan legislation offering greater protections for older workers against being workforce discrimination due to their age.\n\nRelated: Joe Biden's retirement reforms are the boldest we've seen in generations\n\nAnd he calls for expanding the unemployment insurance system to cover independent contractors and gig workers, many of whom are over 50.\n\nThe platform also would prioritize support for Black entrepreneurs and other entrepreneurs of color, as well as women entrepreneurs. And it talks about exploring innovative approaches to closing racial wealth gaps, including policies that provide seed capital in order to access the economic security of asset ownership.\n\nClimate change\n\nClimate change: While a concern for Americans of all ages, a Next Avenue reader survey of our 50+ readers taken before the pandemic found climate change was the No. 1 election issue for them.\n\nThe Democratic draft platform calls for rejoining the Paris Climate Agreement and greatly increasing federal investments in clean energy research and development, including spending $2 trillion over four years to shift millions of jobs into the clean energy sector and cutting carbon emissions from power generation to zero by 2030.
As Washington aims to rein in soaring drug prices, the spending by the industry's main trade group and seven key drugmakers has climbed to a level not seen in a decade.\n\nThe disclosed outlays by these enterprises to influence Washington climbed to a total of about $70 million in 2018, the second-highest level ever behind their spending of $87 million in 2009, when Obamacare was beginning to shake up the health-care sector. That's shown in the adjacent chart and based on data from OpenSecrets.org, a website tracking money in politics that's run by the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics.\n\nThe trade group is the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, also known as PhRMA, and the seven companies are those that were invited to a February grilling by the Senate Finance Committee — AbbVie Inc. ABBV, +0.53% , AstraZeneca PLC AZN, +2.62% AZN, +3.64% , Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. BMY, +0.83% , Johnson & Johnson JNJ, +0.59% , Merck & Co. Inc. MRK, +0.76% , Pfizer Inc. PFE, +1.19% and Sanofi SA SNY, +1.42% SAN, +1.35% .\n\nSo far this year, pharma's lobbying spending is staying sizeable. PhRMA spent $9.91 million to influence Washington in the first quarter, according to a disclosure filed in late April. And the Q1 total is $10.01 million when the trade group's subsidiaries are included, says a tally from OpenSecrets.org.\n\nMeanwhile, AbbVie laid out $2.68 million during this year's first three months, AstraZeneca spent $1.06 million, Bristol-Myers paid $1.2 million, J&J shelled out $1.46 million, Merck ran through $2.76 million, Pfizer disbursed $4.2 million and Sanofi, $1.67 million.\n\nIn total for the first quarter, the trade group and the seven companies spent about $25 million, suggesting they could set a new record this year.\n\nThere's just such an increase in activity from lawmakers that it's really not surprising to see an increase in lobbying activity as well, Lindsay Bealor Greenleaf, a former registered lobbyist for drug manufacturers, told MarketWatch. She is currently director of policy at consulting firm ADVI Health, where drugmakers and physician groups are among her clients.\n\nWhen asked to comment on its recent lobbying spending, a Sanofi spokeswoman said the company regularly engages with policymakers to promote public policies that support patient access to the medicines they need and an environment that promotes and rewards innovation and scientific advancement.\n\nWe continue to engage with policy makers and others about the proposed solutions regarding patient access and affordability while continuing to support scientific innovation, an AstraZeneca spokeswoman said. The proposals include reforming the U.S. rebates system, capping out-of-pocket costs for Medicare patients and having greater transparency across the biopharmaceutical supply chain, she said.\n\nPhRMA and Bristol-Myers declined to comment, while AbbVie, J&J, Merck and Pfizer didn't respond to requests for comment.\n\nBig Pharma is clearly feeling the heat, said the Campaign for Sustainable Rx Pricing in a statement on PhRMA's first-quarter lobbying. That campaign, which regularly criticizes drugmakers, is backed by health insurers, hospital operators, physician groups, the AARP and pharmacy benefit managers, a sector that also has drawn flak on Capitol Hill for its role in pricing.\n\nUnderscoring Washington's interest in lowering drug prices, White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders on April 30 said President Donald Trump and top Democratic lawmakers agreed during a much-anticipated infrastructure meeting that they should get together again in the near future to discuss prices for prescription medicines. Trump feels drug prices should be much lower than they are today, Sanders also said.\n\nThe federal government's efforts to rein in pharmaceutical prices have included bills that aim to deter pharma companies from blocking or delaying generic competition, as well as a Trump administration plan to curb rebates that have gone to pharmacy benefit managers. In addition, another bill would require drug makers to justify large price hikes and high launch prices.\n\nAt a Capitol Hill hearing in early May, Texas GOP Rep. Michael Burgess offered a warning to witnesses who represented drug makers and other health-care companies.\n\nYou all have the knowledge and expertise to solve these problems. We lack that knowledge and expertise, but if you don't solve it, we will, said Burgess, the ranking member of the House Energy & Commerce Committee's health subcommittee. He added that the companies probably won't like lawmakers' solutions. The hearing was titled Lowering Prescription Drug Prices: Deconstructing the Drug Supply Chain.\n\nShares in AbbVie are down 13% this year, AstraZeneca is off by 1% and Bristol-Myers has lost 11%.\n\nJ&J's stock is up 7% and Merck has advanced 3%, while Pfizer has slipped 4% and Sanofi is down 4%. The S&P 500 SPX, -0.16% has outperformed the seven pharma stocks, gaining 14%.\n\nThis is an updated version of a report that was first published on May 2, 2019.
If President Joe Biden cannot gather enough bipartisan support for his $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief plan, Democrats will look to another way to get at least some of it through on a simple Senate majority with 51 votes.\n\nThey'll use a process called budget reconciliation, not to be confused with talk of unity and political reconciliation. It has been used often for high-profile legislation, including massive tax cuts in 2001, 2003 and 2017 and 2010's Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare.\n\nDespite that, it's often seen as a black box — what is allowed under it isn't always clear. That's because, according to experts, it actually isn't clear. The limitations are vague and subject to the whims of the Senate parliamentarian, who doesn't provide written guidance.\n\nBelow is a quick guide to reconciliation.\n\nWhat is budget reconciliation?\n\nAn optional process Congress can choose to use after adopting a budget resolution that allows some types of legislation to be filibuster-proof in the Senate and thus easier to pass.\n\nWhy is it called reconciliation?\n\nFor a tool that's been mostly used for partisan purposes for the last 20 years, its name does sound odd. It stems from the technical purpose in the law creating it, that the bills that receive protection from the filibuster are meant to reconcile current law and pending bills in Congress to the fiscal targets in the budget resolution.\n\nHow does it work?\n\nFirst, the House and Senate have to agree to a budget resolution, something that happened regularly until the late 1990s but now only happens when both chambers are held by the same party. In that resolution, lawmakers lay out tax, spending and deficit targets for the years ahead and give instructions to specific committees to write legislation to hit those targets.\n\nThe spinoff bills — a tax bill, a spending bill (or a combined deficit-increasing or deficit-reducing bill that includes both tax and spending changes) and debt-ceiling bill — are immune to the filibuster in the Senate, meaning they can be passed with 50 votes and the vice president's vote as the tiebreaker. But if parts of the bills stray from budget-related issues, they can get stripped out individually and require a supermajority, usually 60 votes, to retain.\n\nWhat are these limits you keep mentioning? Is that the Byrd rule I keep hearing about?\n\nIn the early 1980s, Democratic Sen. Robert Byrd of West Virginia, already suspicious of anything that allowed bills to bypass normal Senate rules, was alarmed by the number of extraneous measures his fellow senators were trying to stuff into a reconciliation bill. (According to one expert consulted for this article, Bipartisan Policy Center Senior Vice President Bill Hoagland, it was a provision dealing with Coast Guard user fees that a senator had been previously unable to pass that drew Byrd's ire.)\n\nTo put a stop to that, Byrd proposed a Senate rule that was later codified into law. The rule has six thou shalt not provisions about what cannot be included in reconciliation bills. The most prominent are prohibitions against changes to Social Security, increasing the budget deficit in the so-called out years, years beyond those mentioned in the instructions to the committees, and any changes that have only a merely incidental effect on revenues or spending.\n\nSo what does merely incidental mean?\n\nAnd here's where it gets weird. While many focus on the size of a budget impact — would a $50 million change in revenues over 10 years be merely incidental in a $2 trillion reconciliation bill? — experts warn that the test is not just about the size of fiscal change but also its relation to the policy involved.\n\nOne expert said a Republican proposal to split the Ninth Circuit of federal courts — a long-sought goal of conservatives who see the circuit as dominated by liberal judges — was dropped after the Senate parliamentarian indicated that even though the change would have fiscal impact and include the autopilot direct spending reconciliation is used for, the budget impact would be seen as incidental to the policy change involved.\n\nA related hangup is that a reconciliation change must make a change in outlays or revenues or the terms and conditions under which outlays are made or revenues collected, with the meaning of terms and conditions not always clear.\n\nWho is this parliamentarian and why do they matter?\n\nElizabeth MacDonough was appointed to be the Senate parliamentarian in 2012, by then-Majority Leader Harry Reid, a Democrat. But parliamentarians are shared Senate staff and thus expected to be nonpartisan so MacDonough was retained when the chamber switched to Republican control in 2015.\n\nWhen there's a question of whether a provision would be successfully challenged on the floor via the Byrd rule, the issue is usually argued first in the parliamentarian's office by staff from the two parties. The parliamentarian may rule then or withhold a ruling until the issue is brought up on the floor.\n\nEither way, the process is opaque, even for the often-Byzantine Senate. No written decision is formally issued and sometimes even the staff can be unsure why the parliamentarian ruled the way they did or how much weight as a precedent a call has.\n\nCan the parliamentarian be overruled?\n\nYes, and with only 51 votes, but it's risky. First, there's the public relations aspect — overruling the closest thing the Senate has to a neutral umpire may look bad, or even cause them to resign in protest. But also the override becomes a new precedent, which would govern future disputes.\n\nMore importantly, overruling would also likely be seen as breaking the filibuster without voting to get rid of the filibuster. If a provision can be brought into reconciliation bill, ruled out of order by the parliamentarian and then be allowed on a simple majority vote, that is no different than passing the same thing outside of reconciliation with 51 votes, the argument goes. The counterargument is overrides could still be stopped with a supermajority, making it different from scrapping the filibuster.\n\nSo what can/can't Democrats do?\n\nIt all depends. Do the Democrats pass a budget? How is a provision structured? Does it meet the Byrd rule? But some Democratic priorities look like good candidates for reconciliation, while others don't.\n\n$15 minimum wage: Probably not. Mandates have a speckled history in reconciliation in general and even then the size of a minimum wage hike on the federal budget would likely make it too small to be more than merely incidental. A broader analysis of its economic impact could show a larger effect but that would be similar to Republicans' failed effort to use dynamic scoring to show a smaller revenue loss from tax cuts in 2017.\n\nRead more: Yellen says raising minimum wage to $15 would have 'minimal' impact on jobs, but nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office disagree\n\nImmigration reform: Sort of. Some parts of a plan similar to what was proposed by a bipartisan group of senators in 2013 would squarely be within the bounds of reconciliation, experts say. But some other portions, particularly those without any revenue or spending effects, would not be, leaving the possibility of a Swiss cheese immigration bill with loopholes.\n\nInfrastructure: Probably. While Biden has indicated infrastructure will not be a part of his initial package aimed at easing the economic pain caused by the pandemic, it may be in a second round of reconciliation this year. A surge of spending on infrastructure – but limited to five or ten years like the Bush tax cuts to avoid the Byrd outyear deficit prohibition – could pass parliamentary muster, if written correctly, experts say. It's not a slam dunk, though — the nature of highway trust fund spending, which is not quite appropriations and not exactly direct spending, could be a problem.\n\nOpinion: Biden can forge bipartisan cooperation with a bold infrastructure program\n\nWhere can I learn more?\n\nPrimers exist from a variety of sources, including Congressional Research Service, the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities and the conservative Heritage Foundation.
Last night as I was closing my computer before taking care of my medically fragile (but less so than ever) daughter, Amaris, I saw a picture of Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton on a headline on Scutify. My happiness about playing with and feeding my daughter was momentarily suspended, as I felt myself stress out about this election once again. Long-time readers know that I'm committed to my stance against ever voting for anyone in the Republican-Democrat Regime, but this post isn't about politics. And the point of this intro is that I think it's finally be time to hedge our portfolios for some election-stress discounts coming into the markets.\n\nI've been writing about and prepared to profit from this ongoing Bubble-Blowing Bull Market for the last six years since I left TV and returned to trading. More recently, I've been outlining how negative interest rates around the world and how the U.S. economic/monetary cycle plus corporate earnings and financial engineering have been very bullish for both stocks and gold. Those broader trends and cycles remain intact.\n\nBut the markets — tech and my Revolution Investing stocks including Amazon AMZN, -1.71% , Facebook FB, -0.13% and Google GOOGL, -1.31% specifically — have been on one heck of tear from the Brexit lows, when we had the opportunity to sneak in and buy some more of our favorite stocks at a temporary discount.\n\nDoes it matter who wins?\n\nIt's not like I'm changing my stance, but the time to hedge is when you can and not when you have to. But the election looms, and those who want Clinton or Trump and think that their candidate will be best for the stock market will become increasingly worried about the possibility that their candidate will lose.\n\nI personally expect Clinton to win and that she'll basically keep the Bush/Obama/Republican-Democrat Regime status quo intact with all the corruption, corporatism and Wall Street-controlled government that comes with it. That doesn't necessarily mean smooth sailing for the stock market and the economy either. And then the Republicans will claim they're worried about socialism, and the show will go on. If Trump wins, I'd expect we'll see much of the same status quo mentioned above.\n\nWhich brings us back to the markets and the economy, of course. Obamacare, bank bailouts, reckless spending, infrastructure investment and anything else the U.S. government wants to do is a lot easier to do and has a temporarily positive effect on the economy so long as the government can borrow money at close to 0%. And whatever Clinton or Trump spend our future generation's money on by borrowing trillions will probably seem to work well at least while rates are this low.\n\nMeanwhile, our lives, jobs, the Fed, the E.U., the currency wars, energy, tech, innovation, and everything else that makes up these cycles, these economies, these societies we live in will go on.\n\nWe'll have to continue to freshly analyze the economy, cycles and markets regardless.\n\nHow early is too early?\n\nThe market and the psychology that drives the stock market don't always move in sync. And while the bears and many traders have been betting for the last few months that the markets would price in an election selloff have been wrong. Maybe I'm early, too. And maybe the markets won't sell off at all, as the aforementioned bull forces continue to overpower election stress discounts.\n\nAt any rate, I am going to go ahead and hedge my overall portfolio a little bit here. I'm going to buy a first tranche of puts with expirations dated out into November and December. The puts are:\n\nDecember DIA with strike prices around $175-$180\n\nNovember QQQ with strike prices around $108-$112\n\nDecember IBB with strike prices around $250-$270\n\nI'll buy another tranche of these same puts if the stock markets rally another 2%-3% in the next couple of weeks. I'll still be net long overall in my personal portfolio, as I have plenty of long Revolution Investment stocks that I want to hold steady. But I'd rather start hedging while our portfolios are through the roof, especially given the current setup for the stock market and the election.\n\nOn a side note, I am writing an article about Cannibas Sativa, a marijuana company that trades OTC under the symbol CBDS. The stock is down 80% since I warned everybody that it would crash.. I'd be interested in hearing from any of you who know anything about the company or if you were an investor who lost money on it.
The gloomy mixture of COVID-19 fears and political uncertainty are on investors' minds early on Tuesday.\n\nThe global coronavirus death toll has now passed 1 million, according to Johns Hopkins University, which United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres described as an agonizing milestone. Many regions around the world are still reporting rising numbers of infections, also fueling fears over the impact of a second wave.\n\nInvestors are anxiously awaiting the first presidential debate between President Donald Trump and Democratic challenger Joe Biden, which is expected to attract a record-breaking television audience from 9 p.m. Eastern time on Tuesday night.\n\nIn our call of the day, Goldman Sachs GS, -1.25% strategists said they remained 'pro-risk' but warned risky assets may be stuck in a 'fat and flat range' unless election uncertainty eased.\n\nMarkets have generally been 'risk off' over the past week, they said, as COVID-19 cases rise and the likelihood of a vaccine by the first quarter of 2021 has diminished.\n\nWhile we retain a fairly pro-risk stance in our asset allocation, volatility is likely to remain elevated in the near term — risk assets might continue to be stuck in a 'fat and flat' range, the investment bank's portfolio strategy research team wrote in a note late on Monday.\n\nThe team said it would take more investor optimism around growth for stocks and other risky assets to breakout in a more sustained way. That would likely require falling uncertainty around the U.S. election and positive vaccine developments, said the strategists, led by Christian Mueller-Glissmann.\n\nWith the eyes of the world set to be on Trump and Biden later on Tuesday, the Goldman strategist said the first debate could be an important catalyst for investors to assess risks.\n\nSaxo Bank strategist Eleanor Creagh said, given Biden's lead in the polls, a strong showing in the debate could raise expectations of a Democratic clean sweep. One way to lower the odds of a contested outcome (that brings noise and volatility) is via a large margin of victory that cannot be undermined, she said.\n\nAlthough undoubtedly under the clean-sweep scenario there is the negative implications for risk assets to be considered, stemming from a Democratic legislative agenda including higher corporate taxes and increased capital-gains taxes, Creagh added.\n\nThe markets\n\nAfter climbing 410 points on Monday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.39% was 0.6%, or 166 points lower in late morning trading.

To hear the current mayor of London, and possibly future prime minister of Britain tell it, President Barack Obama harbors a dislike of the U.K. because of an anti-colonial mindset developed by having a Kenyan father.\n\nBoris Johnson, in a column written for The Sun newspaper, regales the tale of the removal of the bust of Winston Churchill when Obama took office.\n\nNo one was sure whether the president had himself been involved in the decision, Johnson writes. Some said it was a snub to Britain. Some said it was a symbol of the part-Kenyan president's ancestral dislike of the British empire — of which Churchill had been such a fervent defender.\n\nAlso read:Euroskeptic Brits to Obama: Keep your nose out of our Brexit\n\nAnother British leader, UKIP head Nigel Farage, has made similar comments about Obama. I know his family's background. Kenya. Colonialism. There is clearly something going on there, Farage said.\n\nSo let's look at Obama's track record to find evidence of anti-colonial mindset, itself a phrase devoid of much meaning but for argument's sake will translate as anti-Western populism.\n\n• Obamacare. The president's signature health-care law keeps existing doctors in place, keeps the middlemen (the insurers) in place, and even keeps the payment system for drugs and equipment in place.Is that corporatist or populist?\n\n• Dodd-Frank. The bank-reform legislation the president signed into law keeps existing banks in place — in some areas, they've gained market share — but forces them to have a bigger cushion against default. Is that corporatist or populist?\n\n• Free-trade agreements. The president has overseen the negotiation and enactment of the South Korean trade pact, is pushing for approval of a Pacific trade agreement and has started negotiations with Europeans. The main beneficiaries of these trade deals are big multinationals. Is that corporatist or populist?\n\n• Immigration. One could make the argument that Obama's policies, which encourage or at least don't discourage Latin American migration, are anti-Western. But they sure aren't populist, as corporate titans overwhelmingly support increased migration.\n\nFinally, let's look at the issue Johnson is upset by, Obama's support for the U.K. remaining in the European Union. Johnson says the U.S. wouldn't stand for giving up its own rule-making authority.\n\nLeft unsaid by Johnson, of course, is that states as diverse as Texas and Massachusetts share that authority, not always happily. And the U.S. has ceded authority to international institutions, notably the World Trade Organization, on key economic issues.\n\nBut that's not the prime motivation of Obama. Brexit has emerged as the number-one economic concern for the globe. That was clear from the spring meeting of the International Monetary Fund, and it's been made by policy makers from Tokyo to Berlin.\n\nObama is concerned with a near-term global economic shock from a U.K. withdrawal from the European Union, which would be felt mostly keenly, of course, by big corporations.\n\nWhether that is a reason for the U.K. to stay is another matter. But the very last thing Obama should be accused of is populism.\n\nAnd as for a dislike of British empire — the U.K. turning more inward by exiting the European Union is surely the most anti-empire move of all.
The Affordable Care Act is going to cost more and enroll less people through its exchanges than previously thought, according to a new Congressional Budget Office report.\n\nThe report released Thursday projected 2016 enrollment of 12 million, one million less than the agency's projection of 13 million just two months ago, and significantly less than a 21 million estimate a year ago.\n\nIf enrollment is shrinking, why are costs increasing? As always, you can blame the economy.\n\nOne facet of Obamacare is that it expanded Medicaid eligibility. The CBO now expects a bump in Medicaid sign-ups — up to 11 million enrolled this year and 15 million by 2026, per the report — citing new economic projections and a decrease in the share of future wage growth projected to go to lower-income people.\n\nIn other words: future economic growth isn't expected to benefit poor people, which will accelerate the ACA's overall costs.\n\nYet these increases aside, Obamacare is overall still costing less than was first expected years ago: $157 billion less, or 25%, the CBO report said.\n\nRead more: Will hiking average Obamacare tax penalty to $969 boost enrollment?\n\nProjections have a tendency to change, especially with this sprawling a piece of legislation, said Cynthia Cox, an associate director at Kaiser, but she noted that the new numbers were framed in terms of economic outlook and wage growth even as enrollment projections have declined.\n\nSee more: This is the fate of Obamacare under the next president\n\nThe CBO is now expecting enrollment to max out at 19 million in 2019.\n\nSome experts think even that's a little high. The Kaiser Family Foundation's analysis suggests that enrollment would be, at most, 15 or 16 million, and that's only if all state enrollment rates matched those of the top 10 states now.\n\nKaiser's Cox noted that there could be some uptick in the enrollment rates in the next or following years, since a phased-in penalty on being uninsured reached its cap this year. (Households will pay $969 on average for remaining uninsured in 2016, according to a Kaiser Family Foundation analysis.)\n\nBut that cost could take some time to change the behavior of consumers, since they'll only pay the penalty the following year, alongside their taxes, she said.\n\nSee: 7 Obamacare failures that have hurt Americans

Over the past year or so, thousands of people have become eligible to attend college at low or no-cost — and that's not thanks to a new government policy or a sudden drop in tuition levels.\n\nIt's because major employers from McDonald's MCD, -0.27% to Disney DIS, -1.28% have launched or expanded programs that allow some of their employees to attend certain colleges and take certain courses on the company's dime. Walmart WMT, -0.03% announced in June that the retail giant would extend its educational assistance benefits program to high school students. Through the program, teens working at Walmart will have access to flexible schedules, free standardized test prep and up to seven hours of free college credit.\n\nDon't miss: Walmart entices high-school-age workers with benefits in tight labor market\n\nThe company also added more degrees to the suite of programs employees can pursue for $1 per day and introduced a completion bonus for workers who finish their bachelor's degrees and haven't completed any previous college credits.\n\nOn Tuesday, the company went even further, saying workers could apply for one of seven bachelor's degrees and two career diplomas in health-related fields. The degrees include health science and healthcare management through Purdue University Global, Southern New Hampshire University, Bellevue University and Wilmington University. The career diplomas are for jobs as pharmacy technicians and opticians.\n\nJobs in the healthcare field are growing fast, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nIt's become pretty trendy for these big corporations to offer higher education benefits, tuition benefits, degree programs, things along those lines to help students, said Kevin Kinser, a professor at Penn State University and head of the school's Department of Education Policy Studies. It clearly represents the anxiety around attending college particularly for lower-income individuals that many of these companies seem to be targeting for employment.\n\nAnd indeed, rising college costs, growing student debt and the increased need for a college degree to secure a decent living have fueled the rise of these programs in recent years. But the new programs represent the latest iteration of a perk that's been around for decades.\n\nTuition reimbursement programs have been essentially ubiquitous at major employers for years. But those programs, which provide workers with money for tuition after they've already paid it, have relatively low participation rates and are typically geared towards white collar workers looking to improve their skill set, including through earning a graduate degree.\n\nThe new rash of tuition help is geared towards a different audience — low-wage workers who may not have a college degree. They're also typically structured differently. With these new initiatives, the company often pays the employee's tuition directly to the school through an agreement the two parties have worked out. In some cases the programs are facilitated through a third party that processes the tuition payments and allows workers to access the courses and degrees offered relatively seamlessly.\n\n 'It clearly represents the anxiety around attending college particularly for lower-income individuals that many of these companies seem to be targeting for employment.'  — — Kevin Kinser, a professor at Penn State University and head of the school's Department of Education Policy Studies\n\nThe parties typically able to negotiate a deal whereby employees have their entire tuition bill covered. Under more traditional tuition reimbursement plans, the company money functioned as sort of voucher that offset the cost partly, but not completely. But this new setup also means that to receive the benefit, employees have to attend specific schools and in some cases earn specific credentials.\n\nSo what's behind the growth in these programs and what does it mean for students, colleges and companies? We break it down.\n\nCompanies need to stand out in a tight labor market\n\nArguably the first major example of these programs is a partnership between Starbucks SBUX, +2.24% and Arizona State University that began in 2014. When the program initially launched, the company paid for Starbucks employees working an average of 20 hours per week to finish up the last two years of their degree for free through ASU's online program. In 2015, the company expanded the program to cover four years of tuition.\n\nThe idea for the program came from talking to the company's employees and learning that many had a desire to finish college, but couldn't afford it, said Noelle Novoa, a senior manager for social impact communications at the company. Starbucks officials realized they could help, she said.\n\nThe tuition coverage also fell in line with Starbucks' history of offering generous health insurance and other benefits to its baristas — a move that helped them attract and retain talent. But by 2014, when the company announced the program, Obamacare had made access to health insurance more of a norm for a wider swath of workers. The ASU program helped to keep Starbucks at the top of the heap when it came to benefits packages, the company's then-CEO Howard Schultz told the Atlantic in 2015.\n\nIt really goes back to what are the most innovative benefits that we can provide, Novoa said.\n\nNow, more than 12,000 Starbucks employees participate in the program and nearly 3,000 have graduated, she said.\n\nWorkers tend to stick around when their company pays for their education\n\nToday, that competitive pressure is more urgent than ever.\n\nCompanies, now that the labor market is tight, are trying to figure out what's a smart way to attract and, especially, retain employees, said Peter Cappelli, the director of Wharton's Center for Human Resources at the University of Pennsylvania. And these programs tend to work in that regard, according to a study conducted by Cappelli. He found that offering tuition assistance allows companies to hire better quality and more productive employees, making the cost worth it.\n\nAnd indeed, Novola said the tuition assistance is attractive to prospective employees. Roughly 60% of new hires said they're interested in learning more about the program and 17% of applicants said the perk is the driving reason they applied to work at Starbucks.\n\nIn addition to being a great recruitment tool, Cappelli's research found that tuition assistance can also help retain employees. Workers stick around while they use the benefit in order to finish their degree, which often takes many years because slugging through college part-time while working can be a slow process, the research found.\n\nYou might think somebody cynical would say, 'They're just staying until they get a degree' — and so what?, he said.\n\nCompanies get a great return on investment in terms of publicity\n\nThe cost of college and student debt is top of mind for a wide swath of Americans and policymakers. That means, in terms of PR, being able to do something about this would be a terrific thing, Cappelli said.\n\nSome employees certainly do benefit from the programs. But the limits on where the perk can be used, what workers can study and how challenging it can be for employees to make it through school while working at the same time mean that the companies have probably run the numbers and know that offering the benefit is not going to be super costly, Cappelli said.\n\nIt sounds a lot better than it is, he said. Nevertheless it is something.\n\nCompanies that offer these programs say they're a valuable investment in their workforce. Disney, launched its Aspire program last year with an initial investment of $150 million over five years and plans to add up to $25 million more each year. Thousands of employees are taking classes through the program, Bob Iger, Disney's CEO told shareholders in March. Nothing would make me happier than if we had 100% of our eligible cast members take full advantage of this opportunity, he said.\n\nDon't miss:Disney heiress calls CEO Bob Iger's $65 million pay package 'insane'\n\nStarbucks is committed to helping at least 25,000 employees graduate by 2025, Novoa said, which the company estimates will cost at least $250 million.\n\nMichelle Malashock, a Walmart spokeswoman, said the company isn't yet comfortable sharing the amount of money it's spending on the program, but she described it as a significant investment.\n\nThere are a lot cheaper ways to get headlines, she said. As of September, more than 13,500 associates had been accepted into the program, which now offers more than 50 choices for career and educational advancement. We will continue to expand until we truly feel like everybody has an option, she said.\n\nThe constant need to upskill\n\nThese days, given globalization, technological change and other forces, it's rare that an employee will be able to survive in their career long-term without adding new skills, whether that's a full degree or some kind of certification.\n\nCompanies are starting to have a better understanding of this trend and the skills required from their workers to meet their business needs — and they're willing to pay for workers to meet those needs, said Jaime Fall, the director of UpSkill America at the Aspen Institute, an employer initiative promoting training and advancement opportunities for workers.\n\nPart of the motivation for launching Walmart's education benefits program was to help employees continue to build their skills so they're prepared for a long career at the company, Malashock said. The company chose to add 14 degree offerings focused on technology to the program last month in part because like many retailers, Walmart is becoming more and more of a technology company, Malashock said.\n\nWe know the workforce is changing and we believe that our associates want to be in the position to come along on the ride with us, she said.\n\nIdeally, tuition benefit programs are designed in a way that address a skills gap within an employer's workforce or other challenge a company may be facing, said Vivek Sharma, the chief executive officer of InStride, a company launched out of Arizona State University this year that helps employers design and manage these programs.\n\nThe focus is less on starting with what universities have, but more on starting with the actual problem the organization is facing, and translating that into how a university can help the employer, the employee and the community, he said.\n\nThe rise of online education\n\nThe growth in online education over the past 15 or so years had made it much easier for companies to offer these programs at scale to workers across the country and even around the world. Companies are typically partnering with at least one institution with online programs in offering this benefit.\n\nAfter launching the ASU-Starbucks partnership in 2014, EdPlus, an institution within ASU that designs online courses and degree programs for the school, was able to use that as a model to work with other companies to offer similar programs, said Sean Hobson, chief design officer at EdPlus.\n\nASU is one of the major leaders in online higher education, but over the past several years, a number of other colleges have worked to increase their prowess in this space.\n\nFor example, Walmart recently added Purdue Global, an all online arm of Purdue University that was created when the school acquired Kaplan University, a for-profit college, to its list of schools where employees could earn their degrees.\n\nColleges are hungry for students\n\nOver the past several years, demographic trends have caused the number of high school graduates to drop. That means colleges have fewer students to pull from and some are struggling to balance their budgets amid enrollment challenges.\n\nIn this environment, a partnership with a company that brings in at least some number of students, guaranteed, is attractive to colleges, said David Bergeron, a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress, a left-leaning tank.\n\nThese are programs that are designed to be revenue generators, whether we call it profit or excess revenue it's basically the same thing, said Kinser, the Penn State professor.\n\nThese programs are likely poised to grow\n\nInfrastructure is building around these programs, indicating they're likely to become even more widespread.\n\nCompanies are forming to help facilitate partnerships between businesses and colleges. One is Denver-based Guild Education, which was founded in 2015 and works with companies like Walmart to streamline the system students use to access the programs, offer support services and the process by which companies pay the tuition.\n\nAnd, earlier this year, ASU partnered with a global impact investing fund to launch Sharma's company, InStride. InStride came out of the model EdPlus pioneered with Starbucks, Hobson said.\n\nAs these partnerships between employers and colleges grow, they won't replace traditional higher education, but they may play an important part in the sector's future. Already, our nation's colleges are shifting from places dominated by 18 to 24-year-olds who recently left home to adult, working students — exactly the group may of these programs target.\n\nIn addition, given the high cost of college, many Americans may never gain access to higher education without some kind of employer help.\n\nIt's a door that's so closed to so many people that I think they have to be looking at alternate pathways, Fall said. As employers are willing to pick up the tab, that's certainly going to draw more higher education players into the market.\n\nWhat employees/potential students should keep in mind\n\nEmployees considering taking advantage of these types of programs should ask themselves some questions, according to Bergeron, including: Will your employer will support a major or program that makes sense for your career trajectory? And do the completion rates for these programs for students like you indicate you'd be successful?\n\nBalancing work and school often means students may struggle to make it through the program in a timely fashion. In addition, achieving success through online programs — what many of these partnerships offer — can be particularly challenging for students who have traditionally struggled in higher education.\n\nIn some cases, the employers acknowledge these challenges. Over the course of offering its program, Starbucks realized that roughly one in five of its employees had an academic history that would mean they couldn't get into ASU, Novoa said. In response, they launched a program in 2017 called Pathway to Admission, which offers employees who don't meet ASU's admissions standards the opportunity to take up to 10 courses for free to qualify.\n\nWorking with one specific college allows Starbucks to tailor its benefit, including with programs like Pathway to Admission, to meet the needs of the students participating, who are also working part-time, Novoa said. There's a lot of great support that ASU provides in terms of guidance counselors and tutors and mentors, she said.\n\nFor Walmart, part of the appeal of partnering with Guild is that the organization has screened the university partners to make sure they have a track-record of success with adult and working students, Malashock said. In addition, Guild offers individual coaching and other resources as part of its programming.\n\nBut even with these kinds of supports, Bergeron suggests potential students weigh whether their degree would provide them with a bigger economic boost if they earned it another way.\n\nThink really hard about whether this is the right thing for you or whether you should enroll full-time and get and complete the degree as quickly as possible, he said.\n\nThis story was published on June 15, 2019 and updated on September 24, 2019.
After the industry rebuffed the White House's request not to raise prices, the president publicly denounced the CEOs, opened a federal investigation and shifted some contracts to firms that toed the government line.\n\nDonald Trump's Washington? No. Try the Kennedy administration during a 1962 standoff with the U.S. steel industry.\n\nWhite House conflicts with business are not uncommon. Presidents have often been critical of big businesses or how they operate. More recently drugmakers have come under fire for raising prices, for example, and other firms have been assailed for moving their headquarters outside the U.S. in a process known as a corporate inversion.\n\nTrump Today:President freshens his attack on Amazon, defends Sinclair Broadcast Group\n\nWhat's unprecedented about Trump's criticism of Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, -3.44% , however, is the frequency and intensity of his attacks and an apparent personal animus toward company owner Jeff Bezos.\n\nGoing all the way back to the early 1900s, presidents have shied away from singling out specific companies. They usually stick to more general, if infrequent, industry criticism and use milder language unlikely to roil stock markets.\n\nTeddy Roosevelt gained public acclaim in the early 1900s as the first White House trust buster, but he did not target executives or companies in a sustained manner, opposed efforts to ban monopolies and eventually worked hand in hand with the leading industrialist of his day, J.P. Morgan.\n\nHis younger cousin and eventual president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, famously criticized malefactors of great wealth and he heavily regulated corporate America, but FDR also avoided public criticism of individual companies.\n\nThat's not the case in Trump vs. Amazon.\n\nThe president first started bashing Amazon on Twitter in December 2015 after polls showed he was the frontrunner to win the Republican nomination. The editorial page of the Washington Post, acquired by Bezos a few years earlier, became an early and frequent critic of the future president.\n\nTrump has not let up. He's issued 13 tweets critical of Amazon since the middle of 2017, including a barrage in the past five days targeting the company's shipping deal with the U.S. Post Office. He's claimed the post office loses money even though independent analysis shows the USPS makes a profit on the deal.\n\nThe attacks on Amazon, along with a spate of new White House tariffs, have clearly unnerved investors. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.46% sank on Monday after Trump hinted that the post office contract could be reworked in a way that would be more costly for Amazon, and after a recovery on Tuesday, fell once more on Wednesday.\n\nRead:Crazy-fast pace of new job creation can't last, can it? Slower hiring likely in March\n\nThe only historical episode that shows any resemblance is Kennedy's fight with the steel industry 56 years ago. Worried about inflation, the White House brokered a deal in which union workers accepted a smaller raise than they wanted and the steelmakers tacitly agreed not to raise steel prices.\n\nWhen the biggest steel companies reneged and raised prices, an enraged JFK publicly criticized a tiny handful of steel executives whose pursuit of power and profit exceeds their sense of public responsibility. Everyone knew who he meant.\n\nThe White House didn't stop there. The Justice Department, led by Robert Kennedy, probed the price increases and reportedly sent FBI agents to interview steel executives at their homes. The Defense Department also shifted some submarine contracts to smaller steelmakers that declined to raise prices.\n\nThe steel industry backed down, but the standoff frightened Wall Street much like Trump's attacks on Amazon today. The Dow began to slide in 1961, but it sank another 20% after the steel standoff.\n\nThe attack by Trump is not entirely without precedent, though. In one instance his predecessor, Barack Obama, called out a company that earned his displeasure.\n\nIn 2015, Obama criticized the office superstore Staples for supposedly cutting pay for workers and keeping their hours down to avoid health-care costs associated with the law commonly known as Obamacare. Staples countered by saying the president appears not to have all the facts.\n\nObama did not criticize Staples again publicly.
Why has the economy taken so long to recover fully since the financial crisis? Why has growth for the last seven or eight years been so anemic?\n\nSome blame deleveraging. Some blame Obamacare. Some say federal budget deficits have been too big, and others that they've been too small. Still others blame excessive corporate greed, and others excessive corporate taxes.\n\nBut here's a culprit everybody missed: America's chief financial officers.\n\nNew research shows corporate America's top bean counters and pencil pushers have been way too cautious. They've held back investment in new projects — even when those would have been very profitable, and good for jobs and growth.\n\nOh, and yes — hard to believe, but many of them may actually have gotten their sums wrong. I kid you not.\n\nThese are the astonishing implications of a new research paper published by Duke University's Fuqua School of Business.\n\nDuke regularly surveys hundreds of top CFOs about the assumptions, analyses and expectations they use when the running the numbers on all new corporate investments. It turns out the typical CFO doesn't want to OK a project unless it offers a return on investment of at least 14% — even though their company can borrow for half that.\n\nIn other words, CFOs are setting a 14% hurdle rate for new investment even the cost of borrowing money in the bond market, and the imputed cost of borrowing money from investors through the equity market, was around 6% or 7%.\n\nProtestors Target Fed Policies at Meeting in Wyoming\n\nSure, you wouldn't OK a project unless it offered a healthy return over your cost of capital. You want to make a profit, and you want a margin of safety. But demanding a return that's twice your cost of capital is quite something.\n\nWhy would they do that? It turns out that many CFOs are simply overestimating their company's cost of capital. For example in one survey the average CFO told Duke that his company had to pay 10% for its money, even though his own calculations, and public data from the stock and bond markets, meant that the number was only around 6%.\n\nThe authors of the study, John Graham and Campbell Harvey, finance professors at Duke's Fuqua School of Business, also considered and rejected a number of hypotheses to explain the gap between the cost of capital and the return CFOs want. For example, it isn't that small companies involve higher risks; large companies actually set a higher hurdle rate than smaller ones.\n\nAfter the financial crisis, former Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke pushed zero interest rates and quantitative easing to get companies to invest more in the economy. He figured that ZIRP and QE would drive down the cost of capital for corporations. They did. But he, and everyone else, has been baffled that this hasn't unleashed quite the flood of new investment that you'd expect. And now we know why.\n\nBlame the CFOs.
NEW YORK (Project Syndicate)—Commentators have offered many reasons why one should vote in November for Joe Biden, the Democratic nominee for U.S. president. Yet the economic dimension of the election has been of little interest to pundits, and few, if any, economists speaking on the subject have bothered to highlight how the outcome bears directly on people's welfare.\n\nBut the economy is the stage on which people work in the hope of gaining personal development and the satisfaction of succeeding. It isn't just about the money.\n\n\n\nTrump's economic failures\n\nThe economic case for Biden begins with the economic case against President Donald Trump. Consider Trump's costly corporate tax cut. It did not deliver anything like the investment and growth he promised, and the main effect was to run up fiscal deficits in the first three years of his presidency.\n\nTrump has gravely weakened the nation's economy, while Biden has shown over his life that he cares about people's chances for prosperity and rewarding lives—for achieving the American Dream.\n\n\n\nTrump's disregard for this fiscal profligacy has set a precedent for unnecessary deficits in future administrations. (Of course, the deficit incurred more recently in responding to the pandemic was unavoidable and, under the circumstances, beneficial.)\n\n\n\nHis habitual threats to American businesses have added new uncertainty to investment and trade decisions. He practices Mussolini's doctrine of corporatism: the government as puppet master pulling the strings of puppet companies. That economic policy inhibits enterprise and innovation at a time when they are desperately needed.\n\nBreaking news: Trump bestows 'blessing' on proposed Oracle-Walmart deal for TikTok's U.S. operation\n\n\n\nTrump's misguided crusade to reduce the harmless trade deficit has shrunk world trade, thus worsening the efficiency of resource allocation at home and abroad.\n\n\n\nHis populist rhetoric has not translated into better pay for less advantaged workers or victims of discrimination. He has sought to erase any sense of economic justice. He cares nothing about the appallingly low wage rates for those at the bottom or about the terrible living standards that these wages afford. And he has done nothing to support the eradication of statistical discrimination—racial, gender, and LGBT+.\n\nHis weakening of the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) has heavily affected people with low incomes.\n\nPutting the world in danger\n\nTrump's insistence that climate change is a hoax has put the world economy and the viability of the planet in further danger. He says that the wildfires ravaging the American West are the result of poor forest management. He has depreciated American soldiers' heroism and sacrifice, and has no appreciation or understanding that the economy needs people's heroism to dream up new ideas and risk investing in their development and market entry.\n\n\n\nIn attacking institutions from the FBI to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Trump is hollowing out the governmental structure. In imposing pointless obstacles that lead to trade wars, he has alienated America's allies. In his admiration for dictators and authoritarian leaders, he is helping them to establish 21st-century fascism. And his chronic lying from the Office of the President undermines the people's confidence in their government.\n\n\n\nOpinion: Trump is faking it on the economy, just as he's faking it on the pandemic, just as he's faked everything his whole life\n\nThere are other outrages too numerous to mention. But one of the most appalling was his effort to eliminate the so-called DACA program for undocumented aliens who were brought to the U.S. as children, who, after being raised and educated in America, now face deportation. Yet another outrage is his tactic of instilling fear of reprisals and arrest. As a result, there is a growing climate of anxiety and distrust.\n\n\n\nToday, a great many people support Biden on these grounds and others. Trump stands in the way of the nation regaining a sense of flourishing, equity, and social harmony.\n\nBut it is not clear that he could be defeated on these grounds alone. Many Americans dread a government devoted to ministering to a mélange of social groups without a thought to core matters of economic growth and job satisfaction.\n\n\n\nThe positive argument for Biden\n\nBut there is also a positive argument for supporting Biden.\n\n\n\nFirst, Biden understands that in America there is still a crushing disparity between the wages of the seriously less-advantaged and those paid to middle-income people—and payments for single mothers do not change that.\n\nBiden, having grown up in the steelmaking region of Pennsylvania, can hardly be blind to the deprivations and pain of low-paid workers. So, if elected, we would have a president responsive to legislative initiatives for subsidies designed to pull up these workers' meager compensation.\n\n\n\nBiden is also attentive to the existential threat of continuing climate change. There is a vast litany of problems, such as the burning of fossil fuels causing increased levels of carbon dioxide and rising temperatures. Addressing these problems will require government intervention and international cooperation, such as that mandated by the 2015 Paris climate agreement, from which Trump withdrew the U.S.\n\nNo one can doubt that, if elected, Biden would be eager to play a central role in the resumption of the battle against global warming.\n\nAlso read: 'Science' itself is on the ballot, so this 175-year-old institution makes its first ever endorsement for president\n\n\n\nFinally, Americans are living with the virtual stagnation of the economy since the early 1970s (interrupted for about a decade by the Information Revolution). This continuing malaise lies behind wage earners' increased frustration over their relative standing in wage distribution—a sentiment that, more than anything else, accounted for Trump's rise. There can be no question that a President Biden—unlike President Trump—would want to restore the economy to its former glory.\n\n\n\nFor all these reasons, it is vitally important that the people vote for the Biden-Harris ticket. Trump has gravely weakened the nation's economy, while Biden has shown over his life that he cares about people's chances for prosperity and rewarding lives—for achieving the American Dream.\n\n\n\nEdmund Phelps, the 2006 Nobel laureate in economics and director of the Center on Capitalism and Society at Columbia University, is the author of Mass Flourishing and co-author of Dynamism.\n\n\n\nThis commentary was published with permission of Project Syndicate—The Economic Case for Biden.\n\nMore provocative ideas from Project Syndicate:\n\n\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic is about to enter its most treacherous phase\n\nTrump is following the playbook of other enemies of democracy—here's how to stop him\n\nThe American tragedy: A lousy economy and lots of COVID-19 infections
Ann Romney, whose In This Together came out in paperback Tuesday, talked on MSNBC about the book; her struggles with illness and depression and the return of hope; her new center at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston; and, of course, her noteworthy family.\n\nShe and her husband, the 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney, have some two dozen grandchildren, in addition to their five sons. She said that her book includes confessions to a few really, really bad parenting moments but that she and her husband live for their kids' kids:
Vice President Mike Pence and Sen. Kamala Harris engaged in a more civil, substantive debate than President Donald Trump and Democratic nominee Joe Biden did one week earlier.\n\nThat's not to say the pair answered all the questions posed to them.\n\nOne reply from Pence in particular could leave millions of Americans with pre-existing health conditions wishing for more.\n\nModerator Susan Page asked Pence to tell us specifically, how would your administration protect Americans with pre-existing conditions to have access to affordable insurance if the Affordable Care Act (ACA) is struck down?\n\nPence didn't answer the question, though, at another point in the evening, he said the Trump administration has plans to improve health care and protect pre-existing conditions for every American.\n\nThat comes weeks after the president signed an executive order pledging protections so Americans with pre-existing conditions can obtain the insurance of their choice at affordable rates.\n\nBut Harris didn't buy it. If you have a pre-existing condition, heart disease, diabetes, breast cancer, they're coming for you, she said during the debate.\n\nBetween a coronavirus pandemic that had infected 7.6 million Americans as of Friday and a high-stakes Supreme Court case just weeks away, health insurance for people with pre-existing health conditions is on the minds of many.\n\nThe ACA, also known as Obamacare, outlawed health insurance carriers from increasing prices or denying coverage for people due to their pre-existing conditions.\n\nThere are 54 million non-elderly adults with a pre-existing condition that would have resulted in coverage denial without the ACA, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation.\n\nMore than 100 million people also had health conditions that, without the law, would possibly result in higher premiums and coverage limits, wrote Larry Levitt, executive vice president for health policy at the foundation, which focuses public health matters.\n\nIt's possible a coronavirus infection would become a pre-existing condition without the ACA, according to Levitt. He also noted that Trump's executive order on pre-existing conditions carries no force of law, and he has never released a plan to replace the ACA or protect people with pre-existing conditions.\n\nBy October, the pandemic may have already added roughly 3.4 million adults under age 65 who contracted COVID-19 to the rolls of Americans with pre-existing conditions, according to The Commonwealth Fund, a private foundation offering grants and analysis on health care matters.\n\nIf the current infection rate holds, the pandemic could add over 20,000 non-elderly adults daily to the number of Americans with pre-existing conditions, researchers at the foundation estimated.\n\nSee also: 'We were frustrated and afraid': Some COVID-19 patients suffer lung and heart damage, but there's encouraging news for these 'long haulers'\n\nOne week after Election Day, the Supreme Court will hear arguments in a case filed by an array of Republican attorneys general seeking to strike down the ACA, known an Obamacare. With the individual mandate penalty now at $0, the entire law falls apart, they argue.\n\nHarris's home state of California is leading the charge to defend the law and they say 20 million people could lose health coverage if the ACA falls.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether eight justices will hear the case or nine justices will decide the matter.\n\nThe confirmation hearing for Trump's Supreme Court nominee, Judge Amy Coney Barrett, is scheduled to start Oct. 12. Barrett would replace Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, a member of the court's liberal wing, who died at age 87 last month.\n\nThe confirmation hearing is scheduled to roll on over the objections of Democrats like Harris. She reiterated those concerns at the debate, saying lawmakers should let the next president pick the next judge after the election.\n\nWhen Page asked Pence about specific protections for people with pre-existing conditions, he pivoted to whether Harris and Biden would work to pack the court if they won.\n\nThat's a tactic where the party in power would add extra seats to the nine-person Supreme Court and fill those new seats with their own appointees.\n\nHarris didn't answer Pence's question. Harris and Biden say they want to build on Obamacare by adding a public health insurance option and lowering the Medicaid eligibility age to 60 from 65.\n\nOn Thursday, a Trump campaign spokesman criticized the Biden-Harris plan and defended the current administration's work on health care matters.\n\nThe Biden-Harris Bernie Sanders-inspired, socialist health care agenda would bankrupt U.S. taxpayers and eliminate quality access to health care for millions of Americans, said Ken Farnaso, deputy national press secretary. President Trump has fought to safeguard patients with pre-existing conditions, lower prescription drug prices, lower premiums, and will always put the health of patients first. The choice couldn't be more clear in November.
President Trump is coming up on his first 100 days in office — officially, April 29 — but he's not the only one who can make an impact in the first few months of a job. And as hiring managers are sensitive to first impressions, it's good to be on you're A-game during the first 100 days, too.\n\nThe first 100 days of a new job are crucial for both employer and employee. For the employer, those days set the stage of an employer's work ethics and productivity. For an employee, it helps gauge if this was the right move — executives and human resources staff say new hires tend to know if they're going to stay with a job for the long haul within the first six months. Plus, keeping track of your work and progress builds good habits.\n\nBut the first 100 days can give new employees a false sense of security, too. Once you get the hang of it and are in a routine, you don't take the time to take stock and pause, said Vicki Salemi, a career expert for jobs site Monster.com. It's important to do that while things are still fresh.\n\nSee:What your first seven jobs say about you\n\nTrump listed the tasks he plans to accomplish in his first 100 days of president before he was elected, during a speech in Gettysburg, Pa. In it, he said he intended to impose term limits on Congress, introduce 10 pieces of legislation that would repeal Obamacare, fund the construction of the Southern border wall, and rebuild military bases, among other priorities. Thus far, he has pushed to repeal Obamacare — but support came up short and therefore the Affordable Care Act is still in place — and asked Congress for a little more than $4 billion to begin building the wall. As of April 18, Trump's approval rating was 42% — down from 45% when he was inaugurated, according to Gallup.\n\nHere's what you can do to make your first 100 days on the job count:\n\nBy 2020, 50% of workforce will be remote. Here's how.\n\nReview the job description\n\nLook at the job description and within the first month or two, take note of what is expected of you, Salemi said. If there are any discrepancies, or your work is not completely aligned with the job description, look for ways to rectify it. Find clarity, and determine the time needed to make these goals happen, said Adrian Granzella Larssen, career expert and editor at large of jobs site The Muse. Making sure you're super clear and aligned with expectations and goals, she said. Those who said they quit a job within six months, 23% said they did so because they did not receive clear guidelines about their responsibilities, according to a 2014 survey from human resources software provider BambooHR.\n\nSet up routine meetings with the boss\n\nAsk your boss for regular meetings, where you can both track progress, Larssen said. People tend to wait until the boss says now is the time to check in, she said, but being proactive is a better choice, she added. Employees who had routine meetings with their managers were almost three times as likely to be engaged in their jobs than those who didn't have meetings, according to a 2015 Gallup survey. Also, if anything is in fact misaligned with your job description or what was discussed during the interview, talk about that too — just make sure to bring solutions to the problems you want to bring up, Salemi said. And always mention how what you want or need can help the business.\n\nSee also:After Uber CEO and driver clash — this is how you make an elevator pitch to your boss\n\nCheck the company culture\n\nSometimes, it isn't until after the interview that an employee gets a real sense of the company's culture. Take into consideration how you fit in and what you're doing to get there. This could take a negative turn for your new job, unfortunately, but that's okay, Salemi said. People can become numb to unpleasant situations, such as a rude coworker, which can create workplace conflicts. It's better to be honest about these situations, and take note of what you like and don't like about the place for when you're looking for your next job. If after a few months you don't plan to stick it out, be honest with future interviewers about your values, what you want out of a job and what you can give. You want to be vigilant in the first 100 days, and self-aware, Salemi said.\n\nSee: Would you take a pay cut to help out a colleague?\n\nMingle with everyone\n\nAnother important part of the first 100 days is to create a network of people you can talk to — get to know people, be friendly with everyone around you, whether they're above or below you on the ranks, and build relationships, Larssen said. These friendships help employees feel connected to their jobs — about two-thirds of 716 full-time workers with six or more workplace friends said they loved their company, and 55% said work relationships were very to extremely important to their quality of life, according to a 2014 Workforce Mood Tracker Report conducted by employee recognition firm Globoforce.
Americans got a big break on gasoline prices in 2015 as well as furnishings for their homes, but they got less relief on some of their largest expenses such as medical care and shelter.\n\nConsumer prices rose just 0.7% last year to mark the second slowest rise in inflation in 54 years, the government said Wednesday. (The consumer price index rose just 0.1% in 2008 during the worst of the Great Recession.)\n\nThe biggest relief, of course, came at the gas station.\n\nPlunging oil prices drove the average cost of regular gas to $2.14 a gallon by year end from $2.50 at the start of 2015, according to the Energy Information Administration. As measured by the CPI, the cost of fueling up sank 20% in 2015.\n\nLower fuel costs also led to a 3% decline in the price of airfare.\n\nCheap gas helped fuel a car-buying binge in 2015 as Americans bought new vehicles at a record rate. Low interest rates and dealer incentives added a helping hand: prices of new autos were basically flat last year.\n\nThe same could not be said for insuring vehicles. Forget all those funny TV ads about cut-rate plans: auto insurance jumped 5.7% last year.\n\nAnother large household expense, medical care, also accelerated. The cost of going to the doctor's office or the hospital rose 2.9% in 2015 to mark the fastest increase in three years, the CPI report showed.\n\nHigher health-care costs and the fate of Obamacare are major talking points in the 2016 election season.\n\nAlso on the up and up in 2015 was the cost of renting or buying a home. Rents climbed 3.7%, the biggest increase in eight years.\n\nMoving to your new home was also expensive. Freight costs leaped 13%.\n\nNew home buyers did get small breaks in other ways. Furniture prices slid 2.3% in 2015 and the cost of clocks, lamps, cookware and tableware posted even steeper declines.\n\nOh, and that new big-screen HDTV? Prices of televisions tumbled 15%.\n\nThe cost of putting food on the table also eased after a big runup in the previous year. Food prices rose just 0.8% in 2015 — the smallest gain since 2009 — with most of the increase coming early on. Prices had jumped 3.4% in 2014.\n\nEven better, the cost of buying groceries to prepare meals at home actually fell for the first time in six years and only the second time since 1976.\n\nBeef prices finally began to subside last year after soaring almost 20% in 2014 to record highs. Buying a beef roast cost 7% less than the year before.\n\nAmericans were also able to pig out more cheaply, as size of the U.S. pig herd hit the highest level since the government began keeping track in the late 1980s. The cost of pork fell 7%, mainly because of the cheapest ham prices in several years. Shoppers can buy fresh hams for $2 a pound or less in stores now.\n\nJust don't expect such great deals on bacon, whose cost soared in 2014 after disease wiped out millions of piglets. Americans much prefer bacon to any other cut of pork, so prices only fell slightly last year even though the pig herd increased.\n\nSome staples did post big increases in 2015. Eggs surged 15% because of chicken disease and lettuce prices rose almost 9% owing to funky weather.\n\nIt also cost more to eat out. Prices rose four times faster than the cost of dining at home.\n\nIf you dressed up for the restaurant, however, take heart. The cost of buying a men's suit dropped 4% and women's dresses fell almost 10%.
The Federal Reserve is making a huge error in believing that labor markets are so tight that interest rates must move higher, a leading academic said Monday.\n\nAt issue is full employment, the level where the unemployment rate can't go lower without resulting in higher inflation.\n\nThe Fed's latest estimate for full employment is a range between 4.1% and 4.7%. The unemployment rate stood at 3.9% in July.\n\nRead:U.S. gains 157,000 jobs in July\n\nDavid Blanchflower, an economics professor at Dartmouth College, thinks full employment is closer to an unemployment rate of 2.5%, which would mean that the Fed needn't be in such a hurry about raising interest rates.\n\nThis is an absolutely classic error, it is the kind of error that ends recoveries, Blanchflower said, in an interview.\n\nIn a new paper, David Blanchflower, and David Bell, an economics professor at the University of Stirling, argue that, in the wake of the Great Recession, underemployment is a better measure of labor-market health than the unemployment rate. The fact that millions of workers want to work more hours means that the labor market still has plenty of slack.\n\nEven though the unemployment rate is at historic lows in many countries this still does not suggest that these country's labor markets are anywhere close to full employment, the paper said.\n\nUnderemployment reduces wage pressure.\n\nFor evidence, the authors note that wage growth remains relatively paltry in this expansion. Underemployment reduces wage pressure.\n\nIn the U.S., there was a norm of average wages rising 4% per year in the years before the Great Recession and 2% subsequently.\n\nThe paper argues that the Labor Department doesn't do a good job in measuring underemployment. Its current measure of part time for economic reasons does not ask how many hours the underemployed want to work.\n\nBlanchflower said underemployment is not caused by Obamacare because it is so prevalent around the globe.\n\nFirm profitability, or survival, is taking precedence over worker's hours preferences, the paper said.
Joe Biden decisively won South Carolina's Democratic presidential primary on Saturday, according to projections, giving the former vice president his first victory in the 2020 nominating battle and a burst of momentum ahead of the critical Super Tuesday contests next week.\n\nNetworks called the race for Biden seconds after polls closed at 7 p.m. Eastern. With around 45% of the vote in, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders was behind Biden, and billionaire businessman Tom Steyer was in third place. Steyer, who invested millions of dollars in the South Carolina race, dropped out late Saturday.\n\nFormer South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar trailed far behind the top three. Former New York Mayor Mike Bloomberg skipped the first four 2020 nominating contests, and is focusing on the 14 states that will vote on Super Tuesday, March 3.\n\nSouth Carolina was widely seen as a must-win for Biden, who is aiming to be the moderate alternative to self-described democratic socialist Sanders.\n\nBiden made a direct appeal to Super Tuesday voters in remarks in Columbia, S.C., and jabbed at Sanders by saying people don't want a revolution.\n\nIf the Democrats want a nominee who's a Democrat, a lifelong Democrat, a proud Democrat, an Obama-Biden Democrat, then join us, Biden said.\n\nBiden's campaign may enjoy only a short-lived boost, however, as he faces a steeper test on Super Tuesday. Sanders is topping polls of states including California and Texas, and is the front-runner in national surveys, according to RealClearPolitics.\n\nIf Biden can win southern states like Alabama, Arkansas, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Tennessee, and Texas and cross the 15% delegate threshold in a state like California, he will firmly position himself as the Sanders alternative, wrote analysts at Beacon Policy Advisors in a note on Friday. Those seven states, plus seven more and U.S. territory American Samoa, vote on Super Tuesday.\n\nRead:Super Tuesday: Democrats fight over huge delegate pool, as hopes could fade fast for moderate rivals to Sanders.\n\nSanders held a rally Saturday in Warren's home state of Massachusetts, and projected confidence as that state's voters prepared to go to polls Tuesday. If we have the largest voter turnout in the history of the Massachusetts primary, we can win here in Massachusetts, we can win the Democratic nomination, we can defeat Donald Trump and we can transform this country, Sanders said in Boston, according to the Boston Herald.\n\nThe African-American vote was key in South Carolina, and Biden scored a critical endorsement on Wednesday from Rep. Jim Clyburn, the highest-ranking black member of Congress. Buttigieg, Klobuchar and Warren have performed poorly in polls of black voters — who make up about 60% of South Carolina's Democratic electorate.\n\nSouth Carolina offers 54 delegates of the 1,991 needed to win the Democratic nomination on the first ballot at the party's convention in July. Ahead of Saturday's primary, Sanders led in the delegate tally, followed by Buttigieg, Biden, Warren and Klobuchar, according to a tracker by NBC News.\n\nHealth care was the leading issue among South Carolina's Democratic voters, according to the Associated Press. Sanders' agenda includes Medicare for All, canceling student debt and reducing income inequality, and President Donald Trump has been eager to paint the Vermont senator and other Democrats as a threat to American prosperity and the U.S. stock market DJIA, -0.39% , even as it reels from the coronavirus outbreak. Stocks just wrapped up their worst week since 2008.\n\nRead:Trump calls Democrats' concerns of his coronavirus handling 'a new hoax' as outbreak rattles stock market.\n\nTrump on Friday night urged Republicans to vote in South Carolina's Democratic primary, and pick who he described as the weakest candidate. The state's open primary means voters may participate in any contest. South Carolina's Republican Party canceled its primary, one of just a handful of states to scrap GOP nominating contests this cycle.\n\nI think maybe Crazy Bernie has it, Trump said about Sanders at a rally in North Charleston, S.C., after asking audience members to cheer for the Democrat they thought he could beat the easiest in November. Sanders has called Trump the most dangerous president in modern U.S. history.\n\nBiden's appeal to moderates includes his pledge to build on the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, named after the president he served under for eight years. Long popular with African-American voters, the former vice president has also proposed creating national standards for home appraisals, as part of an effort to stamp out racial discrimination in the real-estate industry.\n\nA prolonged slog for the nomination would raise the possibility of a contested convention, in which no candidate will win the magic number of delegates on the first ballot at this summer's convention in Milwaukee. The last time the Democrats' convention went past the first ballot was 1952.\n\nNow see:How Democrats could end up deadlocked on a presidential nominee for the first time in 68 years.
