{"original": "the battle over the replacement of justice ruth bader ginsburg has refocused american attention on the future of the affordable care act. the supreme court is scheduled to hear oral arguments nov. 10 in a case seeking to overturn the law that brought insurance coverage to millions of americans."}
{"original": "meanwhile, trump recently released his america-first healthcare plan. in it, the president claims significant achievements. he also outlines broad principles of his vision for the future of health care in america."}
{"original": "over the past three years, the trump administration has taken a number of steps to dismantle pieces of the aca. and his recently introduced executive order lacks a number of key details and the legal grounds for enacting much of the proposal."}
{"original": "the two factors leave me — a health policy and politics scholar who has closely followed the affordable care act — skeptical about the emergence of a meaningful replacement to the aca that would expand insurance access should the supreme court invalidate the obama administration's signature achievement."}
{"original": "president trump campaigned and entered office with the pledge to repeal and replace the aca. in his own words, there would be a really great healthcare plan with far lower premiums (costs) & deductibles right after the election."}
{"original": "since 2016, congress has made little headway besides eliminating the aca's penalty for not carrying insurance. this is the basis for the current lawsuit to be heard before the supreme court in november. the argument is that because congress did away with the penalty, the individual mandate can no longer be constitutionally justified as a tax. as a result, the entire law should fall."}
{"original": "while republicans have been unable to repeal the law, the trump administration has taken a number of executive actions to limit its reach. in combination, these efforts have contributed to bringing the uninsured rate to 14% by 2019 from a low of 11% in 2016. this leaves millions of americans without coverage and exposed to medical bills should they fall ill."}
{"original": "one of the major targets of the trump administration has been reducing enrollment through the aca's marketplaces. here, the administration shortened the periods in which people are allowed to purchase insurance and drastically reduced funding for individuals who help consumers enroll in coverage as well as advertising. it also withheld subsidies to support low-income individuals with out-of-pocket costs, which also caused problems to insurers offering plans to those people."}
{"original": "the administration has also worked to expand alternative insurance plans like so-called short-term, limited-duration health plans and association health plans. while these plans have lower premiums, they do not carry the consumer protections of the aca like preexisting condition coverage. they also do not pay for prescription drugs or hospital stays. and unlike the aca, they also require consumers to undergo a medical assessment before enrollment. consumers may be charged higher premiums or rejected entirely based on their medical condition and age."}
{"original": "regulations issued by the trump administration have reduced access to reproductive care for women. the administration has also pushed states to implement work requirements for medicaid beneficiaries and discourage immigrants from enrolling in medicaid for fear of being denied permanent residency. as a result, thousands of individuals have become uninsured."}
{"original": "even on one of the president's favorite topics, reducing the cost of prescription drugs, numerous initiatives regarding generic drugs, drug importation and capping insulin prices for medicare beneficiaries have done very little to reduce cost or improve access."}
{"original": "on one of the president's other priorities, eliminating surprise bills for medical services that patients unexpectedly receive for care that they reasonably thought would be covered by their insurance, the administration's actions have yet to have a meaningful effect."}
{"original": "when it comes to trump's executive order, the topic that received the most public attention — the guarantee that americans with pre-existing conditions can obtain the insurance of their choice at affordable rates — carries no legal weight nor clear explanation of how it would be achieved or funded."}
{"original": "more generally, after years of promising a detailed plan, the america-first healthcare plan focuses primarily on past actions. it also spends just 491 words on laying out a set of objectives — lower costs, better care and more choice — yet does not provide a mechanism or road map for how to implement them."}
{"original": "all this leads me to believe that if the aca is overturned before the supreme court, the prospect of substantive replacement that seeks to expand care to more americans is unlikely."}

{"original": "it's not easy to draw conclusions from elections that had america overwhelmingly choosing democrats in the house of representatives, while republicans comfortably defended the senate and did better than polls foresaw in gubernatorial races."}
{"original": "wish you could retire right now? give up the rat race, embrace a life of independence, reduce your stress, and have more time for what you value most — your family, education, travel? that might seem like a fantasy but early retirement is within reach of most americans, if they would only take the steps to make it happen."}
{"original": "that's not a sales pitch. it's true. sure, you might not have the resources of sam's club wmt, -1.31% chief executive officer rosalind brewer, who is 54 recently announced plans to retire; or the google goog, -2.62% -sized plans of former chief financial officer patrick pichette, who announced his retirement at age 52, but don't let that deter you. you, too, can retire the way you want, when you want."}
{"original": "while many think of retirement planning as a complex process, it doesn't have to be. below, we outline the key strategies learned by people who have done it — people who, without being millionaires, managed to retire in their 30s, 40s and 50s. if you're eager to join the ranks of the financially independent, get going by following the steps below."}
{"original": "step 1: how much do i need to save?"}
{"original": "these days, a better term for retirement might be financial independence. that is, retirement isn't connected to a specific age, and it may entail continuing to work or volunteer. it's all about doing what you want, when you want."}
{"original": "and anyone can do it. financial independence, after all, is a simple concept: you need enough money to create income to support your lifestyle for the rest of your life. that points to the crux of retirement planning: how much you need to save depends entirely on how much you spend."}
{"original": "your spending rate is the single biggest factor determining when you'll be wealthy enough to retire, says mr. money mustache, also known as pete, the operator of the blog mrmoneymustache.com. he and his wife retired when they were just 30 years old."}
{"original": "the first step to financial independence is figuring out where your money is going now. monitoring and, if possible, reducing, your current spending has two important benefits: it frees up more money to be put aside in savings, and it reduces the amount you need each year to live on, thus lowering the total amount you need to save."}
{"original": "to track your spending, sign up for a free online service such as mint.com or check to see whether your bank or credit union offers an online tally of your spending. alternatively, just create your own spreadsheet or simply get out pencil and paper. however you do it, figure out where your money is going and how much you spend each month. can you reduce any unnecessary expenses? in addition to cutting out small expenses that you can do without, it's important to periodically compare costs and shop around on larger expenditures, such as home and car insurance and cellphone bills."}
{"original": "certainly, your spending will change once you retire. you'll stop sending money to savings. you won't be spending money on commuting. other costs may rise. perhaps you'll want to travel more, or you may encounter higher health-care costs (more on those below)."}
{"original": "still, getting control of your spending as soon as possible will go a long way to determining when you can retire. for example, mr. money mustache says he and his wife saved $600,000 and paid off their mortgage before quitting their full-time jobs. his family of three (they have a young son) now lives on about $25,000 a year."}
{"original": "billy and akaisha kaderli, who blog at retireearlylifestyle.com, are now in their 60s, but they retired more than 20 years ago, when they were both 38. they travel the world, living on less than $30,000 a year."}
{"original": "a recurring theme among early retirees: even if they are traveling the world, their lifestyle is simple. if they own a car, it's just one, and it's far from new. (your car costs more than you may realize. early retirees often talk about car costs and the importance of reducing them. if your car costs $500 a month for loan payment and insurance, that adds up to $6,000 a year. if you assume a federal and state tax bill of 30%, you have to earn about $8,600 a year just to pay for your car — and that's not even counting gas and maintenance costs)"}
{"original": "the kaderlis' method for tracking spending — outlined in their book your retirement dream is possible — is based on figuring out their costs-per-day figure. each day, the kaderlis enter their previous day's spending into a spreadsheet; they keep a running total, which they divide by the number of days. the daily average can fluctuate quite a bit; to smooth out the numbers, they continue to track their spending into the next year. so, their spending for jan. 1 is the first day, and after 365 days, jan. 1 of the second year is entry number 366. they've learned that, despite sometimes large daily fluctuations, their spending over each year is remarkably constant — and that has helped ease their minds over spending."}
{"original": "for his part, mr. money mustache says he doesn't keep a detailed budget. at the end of the year, he and his wife create a spending report from their credit-card statement (they purchase most items via credit card to earn the rewards; they never carry a balance on the card) to see where their money went over the year (they then post their spending details to their blog)."}
{"original": "another early retiree couple, skip and gaby yetter — they quit full-time work in their early 50s and blog at themeanderthals.com — work with a u.s.-based financial adviser as they travel the world. but they, too, say that their early retirement, which included selling their three-bedroom, waterfront home in marblehead, mass., north of boston, has fostered an awareness of just how consumer-focused they'd been. as we rid our lives of accumulated things, we began to realize how much happiness we found in living simply, writes skip yetter in their book just go! leave the treadmill for a world of adventure."}
{"original": "one note: there is always an element of uncertainty in financial planning at any stage of life. for example, you could lose your job or face a debilitating illness. so, like any other financial planning, it's necessary to embrace a little uncertainty."}
{"original": "another example: you don't know how long you'll live, and thus it's impossible to say how long your savings need to last. a number of early retirees interviewed by marketwatch rely at least to some extent on the 4% rule: in your first year of retirement, you withdraw 4% of your total savings; in each succeeding year, you withdraw the same dollar amount, plus inflation."}
{"original": "in other words, a rough rule of thumb is that, before you retire, you should save 25 to 30 times' your annual spending."}
{"original": "while the 4% rule has come under attack in recent years — many financial experts argue that it's too optimistic a number given the outlook for lower financial-market returns in the future — early retirees say it worked for them even in years when the markets performed poorly, such as the market downturn in 2009. the key is flexibility; that is, being able to trim costs so that you can withdraw less in years when the market is down."}
{"original": "step 2: how do i invest?"}
{"original": "just as reining in spending is a recurring theme among early retirees, so is the idea of investing in a diversified portfolio of low-cost index mutual funds. generally, mutual funds that track an index, such as the s&p 500 index spx, -1.48% , will charge investors lower fees than mutual funds where the portfolio of investments is chosen and actively managed by a fund manager."}
{"original": "for a straightforward guide to low-cost investing, look no further than marketwatch's lazy portfolios. each of the eight lazy portfolios holds 11 mutual funds or fewer; a couple of the portfolios hold just three mutual funds."}
{"original": "among these portfolios, the current top three performers — the coffeehouse portfolio, dr. bernstein's no brainer portfolio, and second grader's starter portfolio — have returned 8%, 9% and 10%, respectively, on average over the past three years (data are through dec. 8, 2015)."}
{"original": "the current top performer, the second grader's starter portfolio, comprises just three mutual funds: 60% of the portfolio is in the vanguard total stock market index fund vtsmx, +0.33% , 30% of the portfolio is in the vanguard total international stock index fund vgtsx, +0.39% and 10% of the portfolio is in the vanguard total bond market index fund vbmfx, -0.09% ."}
{"original": "worried about investing for retirement? all you need to do is try to match one of these portfolios. that doesn't mean you need to invest in precisely the same mutual funds; the point here is to pick a portfolio and then mimic it by investing in similar mutual funds, e.g. an index fund that invests in a broad group of international stocks."}
{"original": "if you're investing through a 401(k) or other workplace account, your investment options will differ, but you can try to get as close as possible to these suggested portfolios. you don't have to stick with vanguard mutual funds (though that company is known for its low-cost funds)."}
{"original": "once you've picked a portfolio and done your best to match it given the investment choices available to you, then allocate your money as per the portfolio (e.g. 60% to a total stock market index fund) and stick with it. you don't need to know any more than that to invest. that said, you should monitor your own investment portfolio regularly to make sure your percentage allocations don't get out of whack. when, for example, the u.s. stock market gains steeply, you may need to rebalance, i.e. push some of your investment money toward bonds or international stocks, say, to get your portfolio allocations back to the percentages stated in your chosen lazy portfolio."}
{"original": "can robo advisers manage your money and emotions?"}
{"original": "step 3: housing costs in retirement"}
{"original": "a key piece of retiring early is keeping your housing costs low. if you plan to live in the u.s., the ideal situation is to pay off your mortgage before retiring, as the money mustache family has done. but as noted in no. 1 above, the key to retiring early is a simple function of how much you spend versus how much you have in income. if you save enough such that you can cover your mortgage costs after retiring, then there's no inherent problem with holding on to a mortgage."}
{"original": "many retirees cite the significant psychological value of carrying no debt when they quit working, but with interest rates as low as they are, others argue that holding the mortgage and investing in the financial markets the cash that otherwise would pay off the mortgage can be a smart financial move."}
{"original": "for some retirees, however, the proceeds from selling their home may in fact fund a good chunk of their retirement, whether they end up using some of the money to buy a smaller house in the u.s. or on cheaper accommodations in foreign lands. for example, the yetters chose the latter path. now, thanks to housesitting websites such as trustedhousesitters.com and mindmyhouse.com, they say they live rent-free about 70% of the year, in places such as england, italy and greece."}
{"original": "the danger of relying on home equity to fund retirement is that it assumes the local housing market is strong when it comes time to sell the house and retire; it's crucial to take this uncertainty into account and build a flexible timeline into one's retirement plan."}
{"original": "for their part, the kaderlis travel the world, yet they own a home in an active adult community in arizona. they lease the land and pay lifestyle fees for the various amenities, such as a swimming pool and cultural activities, which they enjoy when they're in the u.s. most of the time, however, they're traveling the world, staying in hostels and hotels, renting apartments and housesitting. they enjoy discounts by booking longer-than-average stays and going to places in the off season. they live on about $30,000 a year, including health-care costs, airfares, housing and living expenses."}
{"original": "step 4: paying for health care"}
{"original": "early retirees deal with the issue of health insurance in a variety of ways. individual costs will vary widely, depending on the situation. certainly, the availability of health insurance in the u.s., thanks to the affordable care act, has made it easier for individuals to quit jobs they might otherwise have kept for the health insurance."}
{"original": "mr. money mustache, the popular blogger and early retiree based in colorado, said last year that he relies on a low-cost, high-deductible health plan purchased on the individual market. the plan costs about $275 a month to cover his wife, son and himself. should that plan expire, he said he would switch to a bronze plan, available via his state's health exchange under obamacare."}
{"original": "meanwhile, the yetters spend most of their time traveling internationally. they purchase health insurance for about $120 a month from a company called world nomads. when they visit the u.s., they buy temporary catastrophic coverage."}
{"original": "like the yetters, the kaderlis spend a good chunk of every year living in other parts of the world. when they travel to the u.s. they purchase a temporary traveler's insurance policy for u.s.-based care. when they're elsewhere, they pay out of pocket."}
{"original": "just as when we're working, taxes are a consideration in retirement, whether you retire early or not. it's crucial to include an estimate of your annual tax bill in your total savings needed amount."}
{"original": "your tax bill may come in a variety of flavors. if you're pulling your income out of a taxable brokerage account, you'll most likely owe capital gains on those distributions."}
{"original": "if you'll be withdrawing money from retirement accounts such as iras and 401(k)s, you'll owe income tax. if you're younger than 59-1/2, you'll also face a 10% penalty, but there are ways to avoid it. be sure to familiarize yourself with the 72-t rule. this rule outlines a precise process for distributing retirement funds such that you avoid the 10% penalty on early withdrawals."}
{"original": "also, your social security benefits are taxable if your income exceeds a specific amount."}
{"original": "keep in mind that, if you continue to do consulting or part-time work after your official retirement, then any social security benefits you've claimed will be temporarily reduced."}

{"original": "the democratic nominee also has said he'll support rather than tear down the experts and he talked about implementing a national mask mandate. he mentioned face coverings, testing and more aid for schools and businesses when asked directly at the oct. 22 presidential debate about how he would handle the pandemic if elected."}
{"original": "what i would do is make sure we have everyone encouraged to wear a mask all the time, biden said at the second and final debate. i would make sure we move into the direction of rapid testing, investing in rapid testing. i would make sure that we set up national standards as to how to open up schools and open up businesses so they can be safe and give them the wherewithal, the financial resources, to be able to do that."}
{"original": "trump has said he gives himself an a+ on handling the pandemic, but just a d on public relations because i have fake news. he has touted his jan. 31 travel restrictions on china, which had the first covid-19 hotspot, and harped on biden saying he would shut down the economy again to stop the spread of the coronavirus if experts recommended it."}
{"original": "trump has also defended himself after storied journalist bob woodward reported that the president acknowledged playing down the pandemic in its early days, with trump saying he was trying prevent a panic. trump said on oct. 2 that he had tested positive for covid-19, then resumed holding campaign rallies on oct. 12 after receiving an antibody treatment and other drugs."}
{"original": "kim monk, an analyst and managing director at capital alpha partners, said she thinks the trump administration and congress have done an extraordinary amount, both in terms of tackling covid directly and in terms of the economic impact, and she praised the operation warp speed public-private partnership that aims to accelerate vaccine development. but she said there were missteps in the beginning, and the no. 1 problem for trump has been communications."}
{"original": "starting with him. i mean just stepping on the message, confusing the message, suggesting political interference in the fda. that's just been the biggest problem, said monk, who previously worked for senate republicans."}

{"original": "biden is promising to build on obamacare, meaning the affordable care act that overhauled the u.s. health-care system xlv, -0.06% a decade ago, when the longtime politician was president barack obama's vice president."}
{"original": "the trump administration is waging a legal fight against obamacare, arguing that it must be scrapped after federal lawmakers in 2017 zeroed out the individual mandate's penalty for lacking health insurance. that comes after the failure of trump and the gop's efforts to repeal obamacare, with the late republican sen. john mccain of arizona casting a decisive vote at one point in 2017."}
{"original": "biden and trump are both being pulled by a wing of their party on medical coverage, said capital alpha's monk."}
{"original": "progressive democrats got biden to do a proposal that i think for them is a foothold in the door for a more expansive agenda that gets them closer to 'medicare for all,' she told marketwatch."}
{"original": "biden is pledging to deliver a public-health insurance option, while medicare for all (which was backed by many of his unsuccessful opponents in the democratic presidential primary) would be a government-run program that replaces the private health insurance system. he also says he'll lower the medicare eligibility age to 60 from 65."}
{"original": "while the perceived threat of a broad government-run 'public option' would threaten managed-care companies and hospitals, we believe the actual result will be something both managed care and hospitals ihf, -0.79% can live with, raymond james analysts said in a recent note."}
{"original": "meanwhile, trump has been convinced by the right wing of the party that if they can somehow undo obamacare, they can sweep in with more market-based reforms, while still protecting pre-existing conditions, capital alpha's monk said. but there is no clear gop consensus on an obamacare replacement, and trump's recent executive order intended to protect those with pre-existing conditions does nothing legally and just proves he's feeling some pressure, she added."}
{"original": "trump signed the executive order in september in an effort to address the concerns of americans with such conditions who have health-insurance protections because of obamacare and fear those safeguards will disappear. that came as he announced an america first healthcare plan and $200 discount cards for medicare recipients in a speech that conflated some of his administration's achievements with policies that are in stages of implementation and others that remain aspirational."}

{"original": "during the republican primaries in 2016, trump ran against the republican establishment, mocking figures such as candidates marco rubio and jeb bush, and house speaker paul ryan as hopelessly beholden to the special interests that had turned washington against the people. his message resonated with primary voters who were fed up with the swamp created by two nearly identical political parties that favored an elite class over the common man."}
{"original": " the feeling on capitol hill and on wall street was that trump was still caged, even if he roared now and then. "}
{"original": "trump's message on trade and immigration was a big part of his success in 2016. he appealed to the people who had lost their jobs and their communities to a bunch of foreigners who take advantage of the dummies in washington who negotiated the trade deals and who encouraged the illegals to stay."}
{"original": "after a brief flirtation with a never trump movement in the summer of 2016, the leaders of the republican establishment decided that if the voters were going to elect a lemon as president, they'd best make some lemonade. they swallowed their pride and embraced trump as if they'd always been best friends."}
{"original": "the republican establishment — the congressional wing led by paul ryan and mitch mcconnell, as well as the corporate wing led by the u.s. chamber of commerce and the business roundtable — took advantage of the chaos in the white house and trump's inherent weakness as a policy maker to tame the beast. they flattered trump as they grabbed the initiative on the policies they cared about — tax cuts, repealing obamacare, deregulation, gutting the safety net, followed by more tax cuts."}
{"original": "for most of his first year, trump gave the republican establishment — the swamp — what it wanted. these were issues that really didn't interest trump. the details of health insurance, taxes and budgets were beyond him, and so he let the congressional and business leaders figure them out."}
{"original": "but trump never let go of the concerns that propelled him into the white house: immigration and trade. trump's administration cracked down hard on immigration, and began to dismantle the trade agreements with canada and mexico."}

{"original": "in the tax returns that the researchers mined, many filers had completed an optional survey. among those who lived in nonexpansion states — and who did not have access to employer-paid insurance plans — there was a 46% increase in the rate of being insured as households qualified for the subsidized marketplace plans."}

{"original": "we do hope to have white house buy-in, because that seems to be the route to getting any votes in the united states senate, said pelosi, the california democrat, in a reference to how senate majority leader mitch mcconnell, a kentucky republican, has blocked democratic legislative efforts but also has followed trump's lead. her comments came at a news conference that also featured new jersey democratic rep. frank pallone, chairman of the house energy and commerce committee, and massachusetts democratic rep. richard neal, head of the house ways and means committee."}
{"original": "as the speaker said, the president is very much the key, pallone said. if he indicates support, or at least suggests this is a good idea that should be pursued, then hopefully we can get some of the energy and commerce republicans to go along."}
{"original": "their lower drug costs now act would have the government each year negotiate the prices for at least 25 of the most expensive drugs in medicare and the private market. up to 250 medications could be subject to negotiation. the upper limit for prices would be 1.2 times an average international price, and a failure to reach a negotiated price would subject the manufacturer to a sizable penalty, starting at 65% of gross sales and ramping up to a maximum of 95%. in addition, the bill would set a $2,000 out-of-pocket limit on drugs for seniors on medicare."}
{"original": "in the grassley bill, there's a $3,100 cap, pelosi said, referring to legislation co-sponsored by iowa republican sen. charles grassley that's among the array of proposals targeting drug prices. our bill is better in that respect and many other respects, but we look forward to working in a bipartisan, bicameral way on this."}
{"original": "grassley and pelosi's approaches are similar in aiming to modernize medicare in a way that's beneficiary-friendly, said kim monk, an analyst and managing director at capital alpha partners. monk predicted that pelosi's bill has no chance of becoming law, and she gave a chance of probably less than 50% for grassley's measure, the prescription drug pricing reduction act."}
{"original": "i do think there will be drug pricing reforms — probably small-ball reforms, monk added. she said there could be a deal that would include a revamp of medicare's prescription drug benefit, but that's very tricky, because democrats want their direct negotiations and republicans won't go there."}
{"original": "house minority leader kevin mccarthy and other house gop leaders blasted pelosi's proposal as a socialist approach on thursday."}
{"original": "the pelosi plan is a step toward nationalizing the drug industry and opening the door to a one-size-fits all, government-controlled rationing of prescription drugs, mccarthy, the california republican, and his house colleagues said in a statement. it also includes an unprecedented 95% tax on companies, which will subsequently drive out competition and force drug makers to close their doors. mcconnell reportedly offered similar criticisms, describing the pelosi plan's provisions on thursday as socialist price controls that will damage the health-care system."}
{"original": "washington is focused on drug prices after health care ranked as the most important issue for voters in the 2018 midterm election. as lawmakers aim to rein in soaring prices, the lobbying spending by seven key drugmakers and the industry's main trade group, phrma, climbed last year to about $70 million — a level topped only by the $87 million total for 2009, when obamacare was beginning to shake up the health-care sector."}
{"original": "speaker pelosi's radical plan would end the current market-based system that has made the united states the global leader in developing innovative, lifesaving treatments and cures, said stephen ubl, president and ceo of phrma, in a statement. it would fundamentally restructure how patients access medicines by giving the federal government unprecedented, sweeping authority to set medicine prices in public and private markets while importing price controls from other countries that restrict access to innovative medicines."}

{"original": "what should the approximately 20 million americans with affordable care act insurance be doing after federal appellate judges voided a portion of obamacare?"}
{"original": "taking a deep breath, experts say."}
{"original": "make no mistake, any ruling that deals with health coverage is serious stuff. but consumers with plans under the law — also known as obamacare — should know that nothing changes immediately while the case wends through the courts."}
{"original": "in a 2-1 decision wednesday, judges in the fifth circuit court of appeals said the law's requirement that most americans must have health insurance or pay a fee is unconstitutional. that's the law's so-called individual mandate. congress in 2017 reduced the mandate's fee for people without insurance to $0."}
{"original": "but that's only one aspect of the sweeping law. the affordable care act also imposed health insurance market reforms, like outlawing coverage denials for pre-existing conditions. it subsidized certain plans and encouraged states to adopt the federal government's widened medicaid program for low-income residents."}
{"original": "the circuit ruling affirmed a lower court's decision that the individual mandate was unconstitutional. the texas federal judge, reed o'connor, said because the mandate was invalid, the entire law was invalid."}
{"original": "the appeals court didn't go that far. it sent the case back to o'connor, saying the judge needed to decide whether there were constitutional parts of the affordable care act that could be cut away from the unconstitutional mandate."}
{"original": "does the court ruling mean the affordable care act is still in effect?"}
{"original": "yes it is. all of it, said karen pollitz, a senior fellow at the kaiser family foundation, a nonprofit organization that provides nonpartisan analysis on public health matters."}
{"original": "nobody's coverage is going to change, she said — it's just going to keep a lot of lawyers busy for the foreseeable future."}
{"original": "california attorney general xavier bercerra, one of the lawyers leading the charge for the 21 states trying to keep the law intact, said he would appeal the ruling to the u.s. supreme court."}
{"original": "the high court doesn't have to take up the appeal. it could deny the petition, which would mean the case would go back to o'connor for review. (four of the u.s. supreme court's nine justices need to decide to hear the appeal.)"}
{"original": "it remains to be seen whether the supreme court will pick up any appeal. remanding the case back to the texas court would draw out the process even longer."}
{"original": "remand is going to mean many more years of litigation, katie keith, a professor at the georgetown university law center. for real people, real patients and consumers, nothing is changing in the near future, she later added."}
{"original": "what does the court decision mean for my obamacare premium?"}
{"original": "no change, pollitz said, noting 2020 rates were locked in months ago. take a deep breath. pay your first month's premium so your 2020 coverage is ensured, she said."}
{"original": "any rate changes this year would only occur if someone has a change in their personal financial situation from events like a change in income or a job loss. changing income levels can affect the size of the tax credit people receive to lower their monthly insurance payment, pollitz said."}
{"original": "any widescale premium changes would only happen in 2021 and those rates are typically ironed out in the fall, she said."}
{"original": "what if the courts ultimately strike down obamacare? how can i start planning back-up health care plans?"}
{"original": "it's impossible to predict future court action. besides, a person's own money situation might change too — they could score a job that offers health insurance, for example."}
{"original": "in any case, it's a good idea to stay informed on politics going into the 2020 elections, pollitz said — and not just the presidential election."}
{"original": "federal lawmakers most surely have a critical say on the funding and future direction of the program, she said. presidents also pick supreme court justice candidates who are confirmed by the senate, increasingly along bitter partisan lines."}
{"original": "but pollitz said concerned consumers need to remember state politics are important too. state governors and attorney generals can decide to challenge or defend the law, and state officials are the ones who decide whether to join the broadened medicaid program, she noted."}
{"original": "more than a dozen states — including florida, a perennial swing state — have not adopted the expansion, according to kaiser family foundation statistics."}
{"original": "america is coming up on the 10-year anniversary of the affordable care act's march 2010 enactment. lawyers and politicians have fought over the law since then, pollitz said."}
{"original": "i guess people need to get used to the background noise and keep going, she added."}

{"original": "the biggest tech fails and what you can do"}
{"original": "health care stocks tend to be more stable than their peers in other sectors and have some durable long-term trends behind them that point to a bright future. accordingly, here's why you should buy health-care stocks now:"}
{"original": "1. safety in troubled times: do you fear that a crash is in order not just for stocks but for the broader global economy? health-care stocks are stable. after all, sick patients around the globe will keep spending on medicine and cut back on other expenses rather than jeopardize their health. consider that in 2008, while the s&p 500 spx, -0.37% plunged 37%, the ishares u.s. health care etf iyh, +0.15% lost 23%. and in 2011, when the eurozone debt crisis caused tremendous volatility and a flat year for the s&p, the ishares etf tacked on 11%."}
{"original": "2. earnings strength: while there has been much talk about broad earnings pressure these days, driven mostly by mayhem in the energy sector, health care earnings have been robust. according to factset earnings insights, 81% of health care stocks have beat earnings estimates to help drive a 9.4% earnings growth rate for the sector. furthermore, that's up from a previous estimate of just 4.8% growth in earnings for the sector in 2015's fourth quarter. to top it off, factset reports that health care stocks are reporting the second-highest revenue growth rate of any sector at a brisk 8.5% pace."}
{"original": "3. fair value: even with this growth, the forward price-to-earnings of health care stocks is around 14 right now. sure, there are a few biotechs out there still trading at nosebleed valuations, but the recent rout for many of these momentum names has brought overall valuations in the sector back to earth. in fact, health care as a sector now boasts a lower forward p/e than even utility stocks as a group."}
{"original": "4. dividends: the income potential of big health care names is also attractive both as a hedge against volatility and as a way to find better yield than investment grade bonds. take abbvie abbv, -0.24% and pfizer pfe, +0.11% , two big pharma stocks that both yield more than 4% and both have sustainable payouts at about half of fiscal 2016 earnings. or consider hybrid health-care/consumer play johnson & johnson jnj, +0.06% , which offers a 3% yield but is now just one of three companies with the elite triple-a credit rating from standard & poor's. not only are these dividends better than the alternative in the bond market, they are high-quality payouts that aren't going away."}
{"original": "5. obamacare adds health care customers: an independent study recently estimated that 17 million americans have gained health insurance since the affordable care act's core provisions took effect in 2013. and even fox news won't deny that obamacare has dramatically increased the number of americans with health insurance. more customers with health insurance means more business for health care companies as a result."}
{"original": "6. demographic tailwind: according to the administration on aging, the number of americans older than 65 will roughly double from about 45 million people in 2013 to almost 100 million by 2060. global trends are even more dramatic, with the 65-plus population tripling from about 524 million in 2010 to a projected 1.5 billion in 2050, according to the world health organization. more aging people means growing demand for doctors, drugs and ultimately consumers of health care in the future."}
{"original": "7. global growth trends:the world bank estimates china spent just 5.6% of its gdp on health care in 2013, india spent just 4% and indonesia spent 3.1% of gdp. those are three of the four most populous countries on the planet (the fourth being the u.s.), yet their rate of health care spending significantly lags the roughly 10% to 12% that is typical for developed nations such as germany, japan, and canada. not only should these nations continue to see health care grow as a share of their economy, but they will continue to see brisk population growth, too, creating a massive long-term growth trend for health care."}

{"original": "economic scarring, a term that's recently come back into vogue as covid-19 tramples the most vulnerable in the economy, isn't new, blitz noted in a january analysis. most researchers date the steepest decline in labor's share of capital to the late 1990s, as automation increased, union membership declined, and china began to compete on the world stage."}
{"original": "downward mobility and rising 'deaths of despair' have been the result, blitz wrote. trump tapped into this broad disquiet to build his popularity… it is key for biden to communicate that he too recognizes this scarring problem and orders his economic priorities accordingly."}
{"original": "read: does america need to be made great again?"}
{"original": "the geopolitics team at bca research agrees. structural reform is coming to the us in the wake of the riotous 2020 election cycle, they wrote in january. extreme levels of political polarization will subside, albeit remaining relatively elevated. this will smooth the way to a more proactive fiscal policy that secures the economic recovery. the biden administration has enough political capital to pass large fiscal stimulus, an expansion of obamacare, and an increase of taxes, regulations, and the minimum wage."}
{"original": "of course, in any country, let alone one as divided as the u.s., a big-government agenda won't appeal to everyone."}
{"original": "but the bca team thinks it may face less opposition than in the past. the populist republicans are increasingly willing to accept large spending to ease burdens on their voter base. trump was a big spender, and the republicans passed large spending bills during his term, they wrote. granted, desperate times call for desperate measures – republican fiscal hawkishness will return now that the party is in the opposition. but there can be little doubt that republican fiscal discipline has eroded."}
{"original": "blitz believes covid relief is just the beginning, though. infrastructure was a running joke of the trump administration, yet might be the key to what blitz calls rebalancing the economy in favor of the middle class."}
{"original": "(biden) can't sell it as stimulus and the need for a green economy, blitz said in an interview. but if he sells it as a part of a broader effort that started with some of trump's tax changes and trade policies to rebalance consumption and capital spending in the us, it might work. we need a rebalance that's going to hire back that middle-income, middle-wage, middle-education worker."}
{"original": "if a 21st-century new deal, green or not, seems far-fetched, that's not without reason. covid-19 is still in charge, even as vaccine distribution ramps up and some high-frequency indicators suggest the economy may be more broadly resilient than was initially feared."}

{"original": "the bca team also focused on a longer-term issue: over time, this paradigm shift will erode corporate margins. there will be an earnings hit from the simultaneous increase in taxes, regulations, and the doubling of the minimum wage to $15 per hour. moreover investors need to price in more than biden's agenda. they need to price in a broader shift in us policy to redistribute wealth from capital to labor."}

{"original": "as a health policy and politics scholar who has published extensively on the aca, i see the following as the most obvious effects if the supreme court ruled the aca unconstitutional."}
{"original": "1. millions of americans will lose coverage"}
{"original": "one of the key features of the aca was the expansion of insurance to millions of americans. most of this was achieved through the expansion of the medicaid program, america's safety net program."}
{"original": "additionally, the aca provided insurance market reforms and subsidies that made it easier to buy health plans for those americans making too much to quality for medicaid."}
{"original": "millions of young americans able have been able to also stay on their parents' coverage until they turn 26."}
{"original": "more than 20 million americans will lose their insurance if the aca is undone."}
{"original": "2. many hospitals and clinics may close, especially in rural areas"}
{"original": "even before covid-19, many medical providers including hospitals and clinics were struggling to keep their doors open. this particularly applied to those located in poorer and more rural areas of the country. indeed, hospital closures since 2010 have mostly occurred in states that have refused to expand their medicaid program, like texas and alabama. these pressures would be gravely exacerbated with millions of americans losing coverage."}
{"original": "closures affect all community members, whether they have insurance or not, as residents lose access to hospitals and specialists."}
{"original": "3. loss of protection for pre-existing conditions"}
{"original": "before the aca became law, many americans were frequently turned down when they went to buy insurance. the insurance carriers deemed them too much of a financial risk due to their pre-existing conditions."}
{"original": "before passage of the aca, this practice was subject to a confusing mix of state and federal laws, regulations and enforcement. insurers developed lists of conditions, medications or occupations that would lead to an automatic denial of insurance coverage."}
{"original": "these declinable conditions including diverse issues ranging from substance abuse to acne. many insurers also refused to cover victims of rape, and 45 states allowed the practice for c-sections. in total, a congressional report found that 425 medical diagnoses have been used to decline coverage."}
{"original": "it seems like that exposure to covid-19 would now also fall into this category. and, it's far from certain whether so-called covid long haulers would be covered."}
{"original": "4. loss of some benefits and higher co-pays"}
{"original": "prior to the aca, it was generally up to each state to determine what benefits insurance ought to cover. states differed widely in terms of comprehensiveness. many did not require prescription drugs or well-child visits to be included. for example, 62% of individuals in the individual market lacked maternity coverage, and 34% lacked coverage for substance abuse disorder treatment."}
{"original": "the aca established a floor by generally requiring coverage to include a minimum set of essential health benefits. it also required that preventive services like vaccinations or wellness visits be provided without any out-of-pocket costs."}
{"original": "equally important, the aca eliminated annual and lifetime coverage limits that insurers commonly imposed. these restrictions often confused consumers and left them on the hook for large charges when they got sick and exceeded the limits."}
{"original": "5. seniors will pay more, and medicare will be destabilized"}
{"original": "one of the biggest ways america's seniors would be affected by the undoing of the aca would be increases in prescription drug costs. each year, about 5 million of them experience a coverage gap. this infamous medicare part d donut hole, which the aca moved to close, required seniors to shoulder the full amount of prescription drugs costs after a certain amount until they reach a certain threshold."}
{"original": "adding further costs, seniors, like all other americans, would also face more out-of-pocket payments for preventive services."}
{"original": "early retirees too young to qualify for medicare will find it virtually impossible to obtain insurance coverage on their own. those with pre-existing conditions would be turned down by the insurance carrier. most others would face prohibitively high premiums due to their age."}
{"original": "eliminating the aca would also expunge the increase in payroll taxes for high-income earners, which stabilized the medicare trust fund. this raises new concerns about the long-term viability of the entire program."}
{"original": "6. the opioid epidemic will get worse"}
{"original": "while the public is focused on the current pandemic, an opioid epidemic has ravaged the nation for years. it will also likely long outlast the impact of covid-19, as more than 20 million americans suffer from addiction. the effects are enormous and permeate american communities. the aca has allowed hundreds of thousands of americans to get crucial treatment by providing them with access to health insurance."}
{"original": "equally important, the aca's essential health benefit provisions required policies sold in the individual market to cover addiction and mental health services. as mentioned before, it also eliminated annual and lifetime limits on these benefits."}
{"original": "few groups have benefited as much from the aca as american women, who have gained improved coverage benefits, and access. importantly, the uninsurance rate for women dropped significantly, from as much as 17% prior to the aca to 11%."}
{"original": "reduction in uninsurance were particularly pronounced for hispanic women and those with low socioeconomic status. both groups saw reductions by 10 percentage points to 22% and 21%, respectively."}
{"original": "moreover, the practice of charging women higher premiums solely based on their gender was banned. before the aca, in most states it was even common to charge a male smoker less than a female nonsmoker for insurance coverage before passage of the aca to account for higher levels of health-care utilization of women."}
{"original": "women have also benefited tremendously from the elimination of out-of-pocket cost for preventive services like mammograms, well-woman visits, domestic and interpersonal violence screening and counseling."}
{"original": "pre-existing condition protections have also proven particularly important for women as they could no longer be denied coverage due to having had a c-section, being a survivor of breast or cervical cancer, or having received medical treatment for domestic or sexual violence."}
{"original": "the aca also ensured that women are guaranteed coverage for pregnancy, maternity and newborn care and that preventive and prenatal services are now covered free of charge. similarly, insurers are now required to provide new mothers with equipment to extract breast milk and the support services to do so."}
{"original": "finally, the aca also supports women in planning their families by eliminating out-of-pocket costs for contraceptive services. this reduced the number of women without such benefits more than 20% to 3%."}
{"original": "8. coal miners and their families will lose benefits"}
{"original": "coal miners and their families will also experience a significant reduction in benefits if the aca is reversed in court. a little-known provision in the aca greatly facilitated access to benefits for miners affected by years of exposure to coal dust now suffering from black lung disease. these benefits would be eliminated with the aca."}
{"original": "of course, it would also affect eligibility for many miners with regard to medicaid and the aca marketplaces."}

{"original": "there is a pressing need for new revenue. with the trump tax cuts sending budget deficits surging toward $1 trillion a year — and the urgent need for investments in public infrastructure, expanded health-care coverage, universal child care, and other initiatives — money will have to come from somewhere."}

{"original": "• it would be paid by the very wealthy who garner substantial revenue from capital gains — that is, from owning assets, rather than just working for a wage."}

{"original": "unlike a wealth tax, which would require setting up a new system to assess and tax assets annually, the framework to levy a millionaire surtax is already in place. it would simply increase the existing income- and capital-gains-tax rate on those earning over $2 million by 10%."}
{"original": "an income surtax has been proposed on a number of occasions. in fact, a 3.8% surtax on net investment income is one of the ways that congress financed obamacare."}
{"original": "how do we know some wealthy people would support it?"}

{"original": "adoptions often cost thousands of dollars. those in the process of adopting or planning to get started should not miss the opportunity to claim a relatively generous federal income tax credit. here's what you need to know about the credit."}
{"original": "the maximum adoption credit for 2016 is $13,460 ($13,400 for 2015). if you adopt several eligible children, a separate credit can be claimed for each one. for instance, if you finalize the adoption of two eligible children in 2016, the maximum credit would be a whopping $26,920."}
{"original": "except for the adoption of a special-needs child, the credit amount equals the lesser of your qualifying adoption expenses or the credit cap ($13,460 for 2016; $13,400 for 2015). if you pay qualifying expenses in several tax years, the credit cap represents a cumulative limit for each adopted child. the credit cap is the same for married and unmarried taxpayers, but married couples must file a joint return to be eligible for the credit."}
{"original": "the credit for a domestic adoption of a special-needs child that becomes final in 2016 is $13,460 or $13,400 for an adoption that became final last year. these amounts are the same as the aforementioned credit caps for other adoptions. for a special-needs child, however, you can claim the full credit (subject to the phaseout rule explained later), regardless of your actual adoption expenses."}
{"original": "how and when to claim the credit"}
{"original": "you can claim the credit for qualified expenses to adopt someone who is under age 18. however, there is no upper age limit if you adopt a physically or mentally disabled person. even so, i'll refer to all adoptees as children in this article."}
{"original": "qualified expenses include adoption fees, attorney fees, court costs, and travel expenses. however, you cannot claim the credit for the adoption of a stepchild if you marry someone who already has a kid."}
{"original": "if the child is a u.s. citizen or resident, the following adoption credit timing rules apply."}
{"original": "for expenses paid in a year before the adoption becomes final, claim the credit with your return for the year after the year of payment."}
{"original": "for expenses paid in the year the adoption becomes final, claim the credit with that year's return."}
{"original": "for expenses paid in a year after the adoption becomes final, claim the credit with the return for the year the expenses are paid. under these rules, you can potentially claim a credit for the same child in more than one year. however, the credit cap applies to the cumulative costs to adopt the child in question."}
{"original": "expenses incurred in an unsuccessful domestic adoption are included with those of the first subsequent successful domestic adoption."}
{"original": "example: you paid $10,000 of qualified domestic adoption expenses in 2014 for an adoption that became final this year. last year and this year, you paid an additional $5,000 to wrap things up. on your 2015 return, you claimed a $10,000 credit (based on expenses paid in 2014). on your 2016 return, you can claim a $3,920 credit (based on the cumulative credit cap of $13,960 reduced by the $10,000 you claimed on your 2015 return)."}
{"original": "note: this example assumes you are unaffected by the phaseout rule explained later."}
{"original": "for a foreign-born child, you generally claim the credit for cumulative qualified expenses with the return for the year the adoption becomes final. for expenses paid after that year, claim the credit with your return for the year of payment. once again, under these rules, you can potentially claim a credit for the same child in more than one year. however, the credit cap applies to the cumulative costs to adopt the child."}
{"original": "if you adopt a special-needs child, you need not spend anything to claim the maximum credit. the only limiting factor is the phaseout rule if your income is high enough to be affected."}
{"original": "for example, the maximum 2016 credit for a special-needs child is $13,960 (reduced by any credit claimed for the same child in an earlier year) even if you had no qualified expenses."}
{"original": "a special-needs child must be a citizen or resident of the u.s. or a u.s. possession (such as puerto rico or guam) at the time the adoption began, and the child must be determined by a state (or the district of columbia) to require adoption assistance due to ethnic background and age; a medical condition; or a physical, mental, or emotional handicap."}
{"original": "claim the credit by attaching a filled-out form 8839 (qualified adoption expenses) to your form 1040. for details, see the form 8839 instructions available at www.irs.gov."}
{"original": "for 2016, the adoption credit is phased out (gradually eliminated) between adjusted gross income (agi) of $201,920 and $241,920 (for 2015, the phaseout range is $201,010 to $241,010). because the phaseout threshold is set fairly high, relatively few adoptive parents are affected by the phaseout rule."}
{"original": "the adoption credit is a so-called nonrefundable personal credit. the total amount of your nonrefundable personal credits cannot exceed your federal income tax liability. the credit cannot be used to offset the 3.8% medicare surtax on net investment income or the obamacare penalty for failure to have qualifying health insurance coverage. if you cannot use the full amount of your adoption credit in the first year it is allowed, you can carry the unused amount forward to the following five tax years."}
{"original": "because of the way the adoption credit timing rules work, getting an adoption finalized this year rather than next year could line you up for tax savings sooner rather than later."}
{"original": "for a rancorous first debate between president donald trump and democratic nominee joe biden, there was a whole lot that went unsaid."}
{"original": "unemployment is coming off double-digit rates in the spring after government shutdowns to deal with the coronavirus outbreak, yet joblessness is still high. but the candidates didn't delve deeply into solutions for joblessness before cross-talk reigned. the same goes for the prospect of another round of fiscal stimulus and more federal unemployment benefits."}
{"original": "health-care costs were another issue discussed briefly before the event became a slugfest. meanwhile, millions of renters could be facing eviction starting next year, but interruptions — many from trump — crowded out talk on that issue."}
{"original": "how about student debt, the top form of nonmortgage debt, which now stands at roughly $1.7 trillion? zero mention."}
{"original": "trump and biden are scheduled to debate again on oct. 15 in a town-hall format with undecided voters. perhaps they'll get to these critical personal finance topics then."}
{"original": "the most searched term on google googl, +1.43% goog, +1.26% during tuesday's debate was unemployment, according to data from google. that's hardly a surprise given the fact that over 20 million americans have lost their jobs during the pandemic-induced recession."}
{"original": "the unemployment rate has come down from 14.7% in april to 8.4% last month as parts of the economy reopened, sending millions of americans back to work. but for the americans who haven't been able to return to work, enhanced unemployment benefits and stimulus checks, both of which were part of the $2 trillion cares act stimulus package, have been a lifeline."}
{"original": "by now, most americans have spent their stimulus checks of $1,200 per person plus $500 per child. additionally, jobless americans are no longer receiving an additional $600 a week in unemployment benefits that expired in july. though many did receive a temporary $300 boost in benefits resulting from an executive order trump signed."}
{"original": "that's caused many americans to cut back on spending in grocery stores."}
{"original": "don't miss: how trump and biden tax policies could affect your paycheck, tax return, investment portfolio and nest egg"}
{"original": "trump and biden have both expressed support for a second round of stimulus checks, but the two candidates disagree when it comes to unemployment benefits."}
{"original": "trump has said the $600 add-on benefit discourages unemployed workers from looking for jobs, because two-thirds of americans received more in unemployment benefits with the extra $600 than they earned on the job. biden's economic recovery plan calls for extending the $600 benefit, more funding for nutrition and health programs, as well as more money for state and local governments, similar to the priorities house democrats put forth in the heroes act, which languished in the senate after being passed by the house in may."}
{"original": "millions of americans continue to face the threat of eviction as a result of the economic turmoil caused by the coronavirus pandemic. in august, researchers estimated that as many as 40 million people could be at risk of eviction in the next several months, calling it the most severe housing crisis in the nation's history."}
{"original": "weeks later, the centers for disease control and prevention and the trump administration announced a nationwide moratorium on evictions. but the moratorium is not a permanent solution: it only lasts through the end of the year, at which point renters can once again be evicted for nonpayment of rent if they've not managed to catch up on what they owe their landlords."}
{"original": "and because the national moratorium was not accompanied by extra funding from congress for emergency rental assistance, renters and landlords alike are facing financial calamity. without aid, trade groups have warned that small-scale mom-and-pop landlords could face foreclosure or the need to sell their homes — and that could shrink the supply of rental housing nationwide."}
{"original": "plus, the cdc moratorium doesn't apply to all americans automatically. instead, renters must notify their landlord using a form that the cdc drew up to stipulate that they are protected by the order. experts have also warned that gaps in the cdc's order could allow for landlords to find other avenues to evict tenants, including people who have unofficial, month-to-month arrangements."}
{"original": "only around 4.2 million americans are likely to file for protection, well short of the total number of people that researchers say could be at risk of being kicked out of their homes, according to a national association of realtors report."}
{"original": "some landlords have sought to move quickly to file for eviction against tenants in the weeks following the cdc's announcement. at least 5,200 eviction cases have been filed by private-equity firms and other corporate landlords since sept. 1, according to data collected by the private equity stakeholder project."}
{"original": "while the explosion in unemployment brought about by the coronavirus pandemic is the most immediate cause of the eviction crisis facing the country, the seeds for such an emergency were sowed well before that."}
{"original": "for roughly a decade now, america has not built enough new homes to keep up with the growth in the number of households nationwide. that shortage of housing has driven up not only home prices for buyers, but also rents for renters. nearly half of all renter households were cost-burdened before the pandemic, meaning over a third of their income went toward rent, said research from the joint center for housing studies of harvard university."}
{"original": "consumer debts (and student debts in particular)"}
{"original": "though new reporting on trump's tax record suggest he's potentially on the hook for more than $400 million in debt, trump said during the debate that he's in good financial shape. i'm totally underleveraged because the assets are extremely good, and i built a great company, he said."}
{"original": "meanwhile, americans have a total $14.27 trillion in household debt as of 2020's second quarter — and that's actually the largest decline on record since 2013."}
{"original": "within that mound of debt is the roughly $1.7 trillion in student debt, which wasn't mentioned tuesday night."}
{"original": "about 44 million americans are coping with college debt and for many of them, that burden is delaying progress in their financial lives. for the millions of borrowers who have defaulted on their loans, the debt is putting their social security checks, tax refunds and wages at risk. more broadly, the nation's debt-financed higher education system has been linked to widening racial inequality."}
{"original": "momentum has been building over the past few years to cancel student debt, with senate democrats elizabeth warren and chuck schumer calling on the next president to cancel up to $50,000 in student debt for every borrower."}
{"original": "biden has said that if elected he'll immediately cancel $10,000 in student loans for every borrower and discharge federal undergraduate student debt for borrowers earning up to $125,000 as long as it was related to their education at a public college, a historically black colleges and universities institution or minority serving institution. he's also vowed to make public college tuition-free for students from families earning $125,000 a year or less."}
{"original": "trump hasn't said much about what he would do to address student debt and college affordability, but his record so far offers some hints. the department of education under secretary of education betsy devos has rolled back obama-era provisions aimed at cracking down on for-profit colleges, which have been accused of luring borrowers into taking on high debt loads for degrees with little value in the labor market. trump, of course, formerly operated such an institution."}
{"original": "this summer the trump administration extended the pause on student loan payments and collections that congress implemented through the cares act, the coronavirus stimulus bill, through dec. 31. the pause was originally set to expire on sept. 30."}
{"original": "how much will your prescriptions and premiums cost if trump is re-elected or biden takes office?"}
{"original": "tuesday's debate provided little clarity on those questions among other pressing cost related health-care issues."}
{"original": "the two candidates however spent a good chunk of the debate going back and forth about obamacare, the informal name of the affordable care act that overhauled the u.s. health-care system in president barack obama's first term, with biden as vice president."}
{"original": "what they didn't delve into were the ways to address rising premiums."}
{"original": "last year, the average annual premium was $7,188 for single coverage, a 4% year-over-year rise, and $20,576 for family coverage, a 5% rise, according to the kaiser family foundation. the average family premium jumped 54% since 2009 and 22% since 2014, according to the foundation focused on health-insurance matters."}
{"original": "some 20 million americans receive health insurance through the program, which covers people with pre-existing conditions. prior to the passage of obamacare, health insurers could deny coverage, limit payouts or charge higher premiums to people with pre-existing medical conditions."}
{"original": "now, the entire obamacare program is facing another challenge in the supreme court from the federal government and 18 republican-leaning states. the supreme court is scheduled to hear the case on nov. 10 while judge amy coney barrett's confirmation battle heats up."}
{"original": "in 2016, trump campaigned on the promise to repeal and replace obamacare. trump, however, has not presented an alternative to the program, wallace pointed out during the debate. trump said he wants to give americans better health-care at a much lower price because obamacare is no good, but did provide more details as to how he'd accomplish that."}
{"original": "trump said he's cutting drug prices by 80 or 90% but did not directly respond to wallace's question regarding medical costs for people with pre-existing health conditions."}
{"original": "biden said that he favors expanding obamacare while adding a public option."}
{"original": "last year, income inequality grew to its widest point in 50 years, according to u.s. census bureau data. the pandemic — which wiped out 40% of the jobs paying $40,000 or less from february to march — may only make matters worse, observers say."}
{"original": "the racial wealth gap is also stark, with new federal reserve data saying the typical black family had eight times less wealth than the typical white family."}
{"original": "wages were the third most searched issue on google during the debate on tuesday, the company said. both said talked about job creation (and their opponent's supposed talent for job destruction) but there was little talk about the compensation for the work. at one point, biden did say his bid for clean energy would create millions of good-paying jobs above $15 an hour."}
{"original": "trump emphasized that he presided over decades-low unemployment before the pandemic hit, while biden referenced the obama administration's stewardship of a long-running economic rebound from the financial crisis."}
{"original": "biden supports a $15 federal minimum wage, which is more than double the current $7.25 rate. that rate is unchanged since 2009, when biden was vice president. numerous states and municipalities have unilaterally moved their minimums upward."}
{"original": "washington (ap) — president donald trump appeared to suggest in a television interview wednesday that he's willing to consider entitlement cuts in the future, a move that would mark a tectonic shift from his stance during his 2016 run for the white house."}
{"original": "trump suggested he was open to a cut in social safety net benefits, such as medicare and social security, in comments during a cnbc interview on the sidelines of the world economic forum in davos, switzerland."}
{"original": "while trump has repeatedly talked up strong economic growth, the federal budget deficit has swollen as his administration has pressed for tax cuts and increased government spending."}
{"original": "asked if entitlement cuts would ever be on his agenda, trump responded, at some point they will be."}
{"original": "as a candidate for the white house, trump stood apart from much of the gop primary field as he vowed to oppose cuts to social security and medicare, while also ensuring every american had health coverage."}
{"original": "in the cnbc interview, trump called tackling entitlement spending the easiest of all things and suggested higher economic growth would make it easier to reduce spending on the programs."}
{"original": "well, we're going — we're going to look, trump said. we also have assets that we've never had. i mean we've never had growth like this."}
{"original": "asked for clarification following the interview, white house spokesman judd deere noted there had been no benefit cuts under trump, and said the president has kept his commitment to the most vulnerable americans, especially those who depend on medicare and social security."}
{"original": "by thursday afternoon, trump had distanced himself from his wednesday remark in davos, suggesting on twitter it was democrats, and not he, who would put the funding of social security in peril:"}

{"original": "the budget deficit is expected to reach $1 trillion this year, according to projections by the congressional budget office."}
{"original": "early in his presidential campaign, trump said he was a different sort of republican, one who would not cut social security, medicare or medicaid."}
{"original": "the medicaid promise was ultimately abandoned. the unsuccessful republican drive to repeal obamacare would have also limited future federal spending on that federal-state health insurance program for low-income people."}

{"original": "more recently, trump's 2020 budget called for deep cuts in medicare payments to hospitals."}
{"original": "although the white house countered that the proposal would not scale back benefits for seniors, democratic congressional leaders and a major hospital group denounced the plan."}
{"original": "as a candidate in the 2016 presidential campaign, trump had seemed to draw a line against cuts to major benefit programs."}
{"original": "every republican wants to do a big number on social security, they want to do it on medicare, they want to do it on medicaid, he said at a 2015 event in new hampshire. and we can't do that. and it's not fair to the people that have been paying in for years and now all of the sudden they want to ... cut."}
{"original": "the head of an advocacy group created to defend the affordable care act said trump tipped his hand with his comments in davos. the president has made it clear that he wants to make draconian cuts to both medicare and medicaid — something that the american people vehemently oppose — and today he said he's going to try again, said leslie dach, chairman of protect our care."}

{"original": "if the fed turns a deaf ear to the market and does not signal a pause in rate hikes, we are likely to see markets in the u.s. and globally continue to sell off and break down to new lows, he explained in our call of the day. however, if the fed finally acknowledges the material slowdown underway in interest-rate sensitive sectors, like housing and autos, and signals a pause we will likely be treated to a sell off in the dollar dxy, -0.12% and a rally in risk assets over the coming weeks."}

{"original": "1. everybody has already made up their mind about trump — and his numbers stink"}
{"original": "right now, trump's net approval rating is minus 8.5 percentage points in the realclear politics polling average. fivethirtyeight.com says it's minus 10, as 53% disapprove, 43% approve and 4% won't say. that spread was first achieved in march 2017. trump hasn't narrowed it below nine since, fivethirtyeight says."}
{"original": "in other words, no one's changing their minds about trump. about 40% of us like his act, if only to own the libs. everyone else? nope."}
{"original": "2. his state numbers are just as bad"}
{"original": "oh, but the electoral college! says twitter, where confident young people educate me about their hero's resilience in midwestern battlegrounds where he snatched victory from popular-vote defeat in 2016. thanks for that. really."}
{"original": "like, in michigan, where morning consult puts trump's net approval at minus 12? trump's michigan numbers haven't been green in 26 months. morning consult says he's doing two points worse than in october, before republicans lost two house seats there and the governorship."}
{"original": "trump's polling in wisconsin? he's minus 13. in iowa, minus 12, and his party lost two of its three house seats."}
{"original": "in pennsylvania, birthplace of former vice president and possible 2020 rival joe biden, trump is minus 7, a point worse than last fall. democrats won the generic house vote in pennsylvania by 10 points."}
{"original": "just on those four, trump's 306 2016 electoral votes fall to 254 (270 needed to win) and it's over. but as many as 215 trump electoral votes could be in play, based on state-by-state polls."}
{"original": "yes, early polling isn't great on head-to-head matchups. but the relationship between late-first-term presidential approval and re-election prospects is pretty close — if it changes, an intervening recession, war or economic boom explains why. this brings us to…."}
{"original": "3. trump isn't getting credit for the economy — and he won't, either"}
{"original": "when the unemployment rate goes to 3.6% from 10%, the guy who came along at 4.7% doesn't get the credit."}
{"original": "trump's whole case on the economy is that he should."}
{"original": "but wage growth — already unexceptional — is slowing. so is job growth, at a year-to-date monthly average 26% below 2015, the third year of the last presidential term. manufacturing job growth has slowed too."}
{"original": "the stock market (trump's favorite indicator) has stalled — the standard & poor's 500 index spx, -0.16% and dow jones industrial average djia, -0.39% have bounced around, driven by trump's on-again-off-again tariff wars. the dow peaked in january 2018, the s&p last september."}
{"original": "that we are back near the peaks shows only that the federal reserve has taken the wheel, moving toward more interest-rate cuts. it's not confidence in trump. twitter's ranter-in- chief turns it off to coolly assess economics, and economics alone? sure."}
{"original": "right now, trump's meandering toward armed conflict with iran. but wartime leadership requires trust, not telling 10,796 lies in office, trump's count according to the washington post last week."}
{"original": "that means trump either climbs down (again) from his latest pseudo-crusade, or tries war without public support. neither makes him more popular."}
{"original": "next, he's throwing himself a july 4 rally at the lincoln memorial — nothing tacky there. trump will salute abraham lincoln's second inaugural, and the anniversary of the battle of gettysburg, offering charity toward none and malice for nearly all. stories about his lack of respect will follow as night follows day."}
{"original": "then he'll mess with trade again, making your portfolio more volatile. open more barbed-wire refugee camps. lose some of their kids. blow off subpoenas, keeping investigations of his inauguration, foundation, taxes and russian influence alive. he even says he'll try another obamacare repeal bill, after 2017's failures handed democrats the house."}
{"original": "5. hillary's not running — neither is hunter biden"}
{"original": "the reason trump is president is clinton's e-mail scandalette. that and her family's history of diving for dollars, even taking $675,000 for hillary's speeches at goldman sachs."}

{"original": "not a lobbyist with his hand out, or foreign potentates staying in their hotels, to be found. let alone a multi-year tax fraud, as asserted in trump's case.trump wants to make hay about biden's son's businesses, but his own son-in-law met with potential lenders to his real estate business — in the white house. that dog won't, ahem, hunter."}

{"original": "james madison, the primary author of the u.s. constitution, wanted to avoid forcing a national consensus on reluctant states. his grand federalist vision led to our teetering between crises for most of our years, but now the pressures have boiled over."}
{"original": "because washington can't put together a consensus on much of anything, lots of the big decisions are moving to the states. the states, in turn, are moving increasingly in opposite directions. that has fueled growing differences between the states, to the point that the government we get depends on where we live."}
{"original": "the result is that the united states of america are now more like the divided states of america."}
{"original": "consider obamacare, formally known as the affordable care act, where the states are playing a mostly hidden but increasingly central role. in some cases, states have created their own exchanges, while others have passed the buck to the feds. in all cases, they've had to decide whether to expand the medicaid program to include more of the poor. in the end, 26 states plus washington d.c. decided to expand medicaid, 14 states decided not to, and 10 are going down a hybrid road."}
{"original": "that means that poorer americans receive different health care depending on where they live. madison's grand plan to bring peace between the states, in fact, has created vast inequality among them."}
{"original": "the differences stretch into how health insurance gets managed. last year, residents of wilmington, del., paid $449 for the most basic obamacare plan. in philadelphia, just 30 miles away, the cost was 18% less. this year, premiums in wyoming, west virginia, and vermont are twice as high as in rhode island, minnesota, and michigan. the big differences have nothing to do with medicaid expansion, since all of these states except wyoming decided to expand medicaid. the inequalities, rather, are the product of how state governments and insurance companies manage insurance differently in different places."}
{"original": "that's the result of the system madison designed. but it's worked out just the way alexander hamilton feared, without enough common ground to pull the nation together."}
{"original": "despite this new war between the states, public support for obamacare has gradually increased since its passage in 2010, to the point where 53% of all americans have a favorable view of the program. its core provisions are very popular — 72% of americans support the guarantee of coverage for pre-existing conditions, 71% are in favor of providing care for pregnant women, and 64% like the prohibition against charging sick people more."}
{"original": "but from the red states, a big campaign to repeal obamacare is bubbling up again, as part of the conservatives' continuing efforts to repeal-and-replace the program and the liberals' struggle to save it. the battle is tearing the nation apart."}
{"original": "on the flip side, the blue states, led by california, are leading the battle on climate change. when congress created the environmental protection agency during the nixon administration, it gave epa the power to give states waivers to experiment with standards at least as tough as the federal rules. california has championed the fight for tougher air pollution problems, with everything from higher fuel economy standards, the check engine light, the catalytic converter, and zero-emission vehicles."}
{"original": "in fact, california has become the de facto leader in national fuel economy standards, with its 70-page catalog of waivers. thirteen mostly blue (democratic) states, along with the district of columbia, have signed on to california's rules, but the republican red states have resisted california's lead. infuriated by the state's leadership, president trump revoked california's waiver authority back in september. gov. gavin newsom counterattacked by reaching voluntary agreement with four car makers — ford, honda, bmw and volkswagen — to continue the standards. the trump administration's response? the justice department is attacking the deal as an anti-trust violation. it's a war between the states about what the standards ought to be where — and who gets to call the shots."}
{"original": "two generations ago, the europeans decided on a collection of programs they wanted to provide equally to all their citizens, programs like health care and environmental protection. they look on puzzlement at the u.s. now about why we haven't done the same. the simple answer is that the system is working pretty much as madison designed it."}
{"original": "that makes alexander hamilton's warning — putting too much power in the hands of the states would cripple america's ability to act as a nation — even more important. differences are growing between the states. and the consequences for america's ability to act in concerted fashion are becoming ever more harsh in an increasingly globalized economy."}
{"original": "hamilton argued that the ability of the country to thrive depended on having a national government strong enough but accountable enough to call the shots on important issues. we don't need to have washington call the shots on everything, even if it could agree on calling the shots about anything."}
{"original": "but relying more on the states frames a fundamental choice. we can embrace madison's vision, preserve a strong role for the states, but get even more unequal results. or we can accept a stronger role for washington. that would mean that the right would have to surrender its leverage over health care from the states — and that the left would have to trust washington to enforce auto emission standards. and it would also mean that the feds would have to find a way to get things done, without getting trapped in endless gridlock."}
{"original": "the american republic has been battling this dilemma for a very long time, but if we're going to thrive in the third century of the american republic, we're going to need more hamilton than hip-hop music and a great orchestra seat to the hottest broadway show in years."}

{"original": "during the freewheeling webinar, i asked the pundits everything from their outlook for a coronavirus vaccine (they were divided on whether there'd be one in 2020) to whether the senate would flip in november and become democratic-controlled (most thought it would, but said not to count out the re-election of current republican senate majority leader mitch mcconnell)."}
{"original": "panelists were united on two issues: all thought the 2020 federal election would not go off without serious hitches, which could delay final election results. and all were in support of a fourth coronavirus emergency package, but most felt it wouldn't be done by october 1."}
{"original": "here's where they came down on four key topics: social security, medicare and telehealth; prescription drug prices and their views on the top aging-related policy change they'd like to see, whoever is elected president:"}
{"original": "most of the pundits felt that social security was not on the table as a 2020 election issue. however, most felt its solvency would be a serious issue in 2021 caused by increased unemployment lowering contributions to social security as well as the rising deficit."}
{"original": "i asked whether president trump put social security back on the political table when he suspended its payroll tax to provide stimulus checks to the american public. and, i queried, shouldn't we start thinking seriously about the exhaustion of the social security trust fund?"}
{"original": "see: this is one trump tax cut you really don't want"}
{"original": "joel white: wait a minute. wait a minute. do we care about the trust funds and fiscal responsibility and all that stuff? are you kidding me? we've got a $3.3 trillion deficit staring us in the face according to cbo [congressional budget office] and the last time i heard someone on the hill talk about trust fund balances and deficits and stuff like that, i think i was still on the hill [from 2004-2007]. i don't think the social security issue is back on the political table this year. i think it's back on the table next year, when we have a budget, whether biden is elected or trump is re-elected."}
{"original": "rich browdie: i would agree with joel's assessment…. and i do think that the social security financing thing will be back, and the next president, whether he's planning to deal with it or not, he's going to have to dip in."}
{"original": "related: why you might not know that trump is threatening your social security"}
{"original": "peter kaldes: i suspect that if candidate biden wins, the next day we'll start hearing about balancing budgets again. so, i'm a little concerned about that. but i'm with rich on this one; i think…using payroll taxes as a tool is something that president obama did as well in some ways.(in 2011 and 2012, the obama administration cut payroll taxes by 2 percentage points to 4.2 percent.)"}
{"original": "jay newton-small: the republican national convention for the first time, i think in history, did not have a platform this year. so, it's hard to know for sure what president trump's second-term agenda, if he were to be re-elected, would be. but he's certainly spoken a lot about tackling deficits and entitlements like social security, medicare and medicaid and appeasing more of the fiscal conservatives that he's got. but i do think, similarly, joe biden — as peter was saying — if he were elected, would also tackle those issues."}
{"original": "john zogby: 'social security really faces insolvency just 10 years from now. so, when do we begin the debate again about either a new funding mechanism for social security, because demographically, there aren't enough young people who are working to sustain the numbers of baby boomers and income gen xers? ten years is not far away. or are we in a situation where we kick the can down the road? but at least for now, the federal debt and deficit continue to grow almost exponentially and yet social security is just not on the table right now. but it has to be."}
{"original": "i asked the pundits this question posed by webinar watcher next avenue's money & policy editor, richard eisenberg: how will medicare change under the next president and why?"}
{"original": "peter kaldes: i think there are some wonderful opportunities under a biden administration to really focus on the salaries of our caregivers and the direct care workforce. to the extent medicare gets more involved with actual covering more of these at-home costs that are very real for people, i think that would be a wonderful addition to medicare."}
{"original": "also see: medicare administrator verma said to have paid private consultants nearly $6 million in taxpayer money for personal image-building campaign"}
{"original": "jay newton-small: i do think donald trump has certainly telegraphed that if he was re-elected, he would move towards a paul ryan, voucher-esque kind of plan for medicare, which you definitely would never get through a democratic-controlled house… it's interesting to see biden move to the left thanks to bernie [sen. bernie sanders] and [sen.] elizabeth warren in the primaries on the issue of medicare for all. he doesn't support medicare for all, but i think he has certainly moved further along than he was when the election started. that said, i know a lot of people in the caregiving world were disappointed that his only nod to caregiving was a $4,000-a-year kind of tax rebate for family caregivers… i think a lot will depend on the control of congress. you're not going to make massive changes to medicare unless you control both houses of congress and the white house, as obamacare showed how hard it was to get that through."}
{"original": "rich browdie: there's a lot of ways that medicare can be adjusted to pragmatic solutions to things we've learned in this covid experience… so, i would think that pragmatism would lead to a number of changes in medicare. partially for budget reasons, because it would be cheaper; partially because i think the sensibility about coverage has changed… you may not get to universal coverage by a particular government program, but i think the pressure to keep movement toward universal coverage will continue."}
{"original": "joel white: i think if next year is a big budget year, we're going to see big changes in medicare… what is interesting to me is that both presidential candidates agree that there ought to be a cap in costs in out-of-pocket expenses in medicare part d [the prescription drug part]. i think it would put on the table in a big budget bill a cap on total costs, whether you're in fee-for-service [traditional medicare] or otherwise in the medicare program [medicare advantage private insurance plans], which would be good, so you're limiting your out-of-pocket costs… if a big budget deal is not in the works, i think rich is right; there's going to be much more in the way of these pragmatic little problems bubbling up that we're going to fix and that's across the board — home health, nursing care, hospital care, physician services. the medicare program right now is kind of in need of some tender loving care and these kinds of bills come across about once every seven years and guess what next year is — it's the seventh year in the process. so, i think something's going to happen, whether it's big or small."}

{"original": "all panelists hailed the increased use of telehealth for medicare beneficiaries during the pandemic, thanks to temporary covid-19 rules, and hoped that many of the new policies enabling its greater use would remain permanent after the pandemic."}
{"original": "however, some panelists voiced concerns about access to telehealth caused by the digital divide that some older adults are facing."}
{"original": "joel white: i think that what we see in access is really that black and brown communities are significantly disadvantaged here, largely because of access to broadband… and so, i think we need to … make telehealth available across the country: rural, suburban and urban."}
{"original": "peter kaldes: i think telehealth is here to stay. i would echo the sentiment that the guidelines need to be made permanent."}
{"original": "jay newton-small: i think that telehealth is the genie that is not going to be put back in the bottle now that people have realized how convenient it is."}
{"original": "john zogby: it's here to stay and to expand as well."}
{"original": "i asked the panelists whether the ability for congress and the president to agree to a meaningful prescription drug bill had passed this year."}
{"original": "jay newton-small: i think it has, unless they tack it onto the larger spending bill. (kaldes and browdie agreed.) but, newton-small added, there usually is a very productive lame-duck session after the presidential election as they clear the decks for either the next president coming in or the next term of the current president. and i would say there's a potential for that if there's enough bipartisan agreement. but i don't think before the election, unless it somehow miraculously gets piggybacked onto a covid bill."}
{"original": "joel white: i think it's more likely that the president is going to issue some programs around the executive orders that he signed at the end of july…the other thing that we are seeing here is that drug prices are actually down; they were negative last year, at 1.7% this year, a full percentage and a half point lower than they were under president obama so i think a lot of the political desire to go after the drug companies has dried up."}
{"original": "the aging policy change they'd most like to see"}
{"original": "one of the more interesting questions during the webinar was posed by an audience member who asked what the panelists thought the top aging-related policy change should be, whoever's elected president. the responses:"}
{"original": "white and zogby called for expanded intergenerational mentoring programs."}
{"original": "browdie wanted to see the age for medicare eligibility lowered from 65 to 60, which biden has proposed."}
{"original": "kaldes hoped for greater enforcement of age discrimination employment laws."}
{"original": "newton-small favored increased reimbursement for home health care under medicare."}
{"original": "i found it interesting that none of the panelists talked about long-term care and long-term services and supports as election issues. this may suggest that the biggest financial liability issue facing boomers may not yet be seen as a political imperative issue."}

{"original": "as bernie sanders continues to increase his standing in the democratic primary, and his opponents in both parties feel the pain, there is an effort to paint him as an extremist of some sort. someone who might even lose to trump because of this alleged radicalism. but it's not that easy to make the case on the basis of facts."}
{"original": "he has a 40-year track record as a politician. the things he is saying now are mostly what he has shouted from the mountain tops for pretty much the whole time. the main difference is that now, other democratic politicians have joined him: on a $15 minimum wage, student-debt relief, free tuition at public universities, expanding social security, reducing income inequality, and some even on medicare for all."}
{"original": "read the latest news and commentary on election 2020."}
{"original": "his actions speak even more consistently than his words: he understands that politics is about compromise. he fights hard for what he has promised to voters, but then takes the best deal he can win if it will advance the ball down the field, and prepares to fight again the next day."}
{"original": "that's why he supported obamacare when it was the best deal on the table — expanding insurance coverage to 20 million americans, without the life-threatening exclusions for pre-existing conditions. this despite the fact that obamacare was still quite a distance from medicare for all — health care as a human right — that had been his passion and signature issue for decades."}
{"original": "but he is a socialist, his opponents cry, leaving out the first part of the term democratic socialist that sanders always uses when this issue is discussed. there is much room to induce confusion here because the term socialist, in english, has a number of different definitions that have all become common usage over the years."}
{"original": "it can be used to mean anything from communist, as in the former soviet union, to the european social democratic or socialist parties that have governed for much of the past 70 years in countries such as france, germany, spain, and the u.k., not to mention the scandinavian countries."}
{"original": "it should be clear to anyone who is not trying to frighten voters that sanders is a social democrat of the latter, european variety. there will be no u.s. government takeover of the means of production under a sanders administration."}
{"original": "the biggest expansion in government will be in public funding of health insurance. like traditional medicare, where less than 2% of expenses are administrative costs, public health insurance will be much more efficient than the current six times as much spent by the private insurance industry. and we won't have 8 million people falling into poverty every year due to medical expenses, or worse, tens of thousands actually dying because of lack of access to affordable health care."}
{"original": "sanders' program is targeted at correcting a very harmful transformation of the u.s. economy that has taken place over the past 40 years."}
{"original": "unlike the first three decades after world war ii, when income gains were broadly shared as the economy grew, most of the increase in income has gone to those who already had much more than their share. since 1993, for example, the top 1% of families captured an astounding 48% of the growth in this country's income."}
{"original": "no wonder so many americans feel like the system is rigged against them."}
{"original": "that right-wing transformation was mostly launched by the reagan team, but it came to be accepted, and even deepened by some liberal political leaders as well. perhaps this normalization of the radical changes of the past few decades is why some commentators perceive bernie's program — designed to reverse this damage — as radical."}
{"original": "here it is important to note that the fight over this right-wing transformation has never been so much about the market versus the state. almost every economy in the world is a mixture of both."}
{"original": "but the reagan revolution and the counter-reforms that followed (e.g., the wto, nafta, financial deregulation, permanent normal trade relations with china, anti-labor legislation and practices) were not so much about changing the relative weight of market and government."}
{"original": "rather what changed most is that both markets and government were harnessed vastly more to redistribute income and wealth upward. the result is an america that is unique among high-income countries in the percentage of people who are employed full-time and yet struggling to get by, not to mention the more than 10 million children in poverty and more than half a million homeless people."}
{"original": "sanders, in his reform program, seeks to use both markets and government to reverse this massive upward redistribution of income and wealth."}
{"original": "of course, government has to take the lead with public investment where private investment would not be forthcoming — as in the transformation of some energy infrastructure to reduce carbon emissions."}
{"original": "but other important parts of sanders' program move the economy away from government toward more market-based solutions: for example, reducing the role of government-granted-and-regulated patent monopolies in driving up the price of pharmaceuticals, medical supplies, and health-care costs. or breaking up other monopolies in favor of more market competition, in the technology and financial sectors."}
{"original": "sanders also favors a less interventionist role for the federal reserve in the labor market, as the fed has triggered almost all u.s. recessions since the end of world war ii (except for the last two) by raising interest rates when this was unnecessary."}
{"original": "and he has led the way to reduce one of the most powerful and destructive abuses that our government has unleashed upon americans and the world: the terrible, unnecessary, forever wars that most americans now reject. some of his best allies in this fight have been conservative republicans who are skeptical of this aspect of big government — as has been true in the historic fight to stop u.s. military participation in saudi arabia's genocidal war in yemen."}
{"original": "in short, sanders is much more pragmatic and less ideological than his opponents would like to admit. but we can expect to hear more — from various quarters — of this labeling him as a radical, if he continues to gain on his competitors in the democratic primary."}
{"original": "will hillary clinton pump money into infrastructure as president? will gop presidential front-runner donald trump? is the tax-exempt status of municipal bonds under a new congress in jeopardy?"}
{"original": "those are all pressing postelection questions that could shape the outlook for municipal bonds."}
{"original": "municipal bonds—typically used to fund infrastructure products, including bridges, tunnels and sewers—were the best performing fixed-income assets in 2015, posting a 3.3% return, even as the federal reserve raised interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade in december."}
{"original": "but as the race for the white house heats up, questions abound for the muni market."}
{"original": "munis stand to outperform other fixed-income categories again in 2016, said peter hayes, head of the municipal bonds group, and sean carney, head of municipal strategy at blackrock blk, +1.35% , in a research note first issued in january and backed in an early-march update."}
{"original": "that's good news for wealthy investors who tend to scoop up these bonds for their tax advantages—for qualifying filers, munis are exempt from certain state and local taxes. modest inflation could help, too, increasing the allure of tax-exempt munis relative to their taxable federal-issued and corporate-issued brethren, all things being equal. rising inflation can erode spending power on your bond's income over time."}
{"original": "however, for state and local governments, political uncertainty could sideline muni issuance. and for income-focused investors who need these tax-exempt bonds to lower their tax bills, limited supply may frustrate."}

{"original": "against that shifting political and regulatory backdrop, here are some key election-related factors to keep an eye on:"}
{"original": "for states and municipalities, the political climate, for instance the likelihood for easier taxing capabilities, typically impacts decision-making on capital projects that are penciled in for several years out from an election, said justin marlowe, public finance professor at the university of washington's evans school of public policy and governance. the presidential election isn't likely to sway decision-making on bond issues spanning even two to five years from an election year. those plans are already baked in, he argues."}
{"original": "but issuers do care now about the future cost of capital, and they may be inclined to try to lock in bond offerings sooner versus later, marlowe said."}
{"original": "on the national landscape comes the potential for new or expanding infrastructure financing tools. they made their way into the obama administration and could have legs for the future, says marlowe. one such program, build america bonds (babs) were created to supplement state and local government's capacity to access conventional corporate debt markets for public infrastructure instead of issuing traditional tax-exempt debt. will they stay around? clinton, for one, has called for the creation of a national infrastructure funding bank to help pay for transportation projects. muni-market trade publication the bond buyer has declared ohio republican presidential candidate gov. john kasich and democratic sen. bernie sanders as the friendliest candidates for infrastructure funding. all told, analysts think that private-public financing options could gain increasing attention, which could limit the number of more traditional bonds coming to market."}
{"original": "candidates including trump and his republican presidential rival sen. ted cruz have threatened to scrap obamacare. easier said than done, said marilyn cohen, chief executive officer of bond-focused envision capital management. but it is true that the challenge of funding obamacare has impacted the fiscal profile of issuers including medium and small hospitals and so this is a national issue that trickles down to the states and locals."}
{"original": "whether talking about bond issuance or job creation, the economy is a major differentiator in this and any election. think china and global trade issues can't touch munis? think again. state economies are deeply dependent on exports in ways that wasn't really the case 10 years ago, said marlowe, who points to washington state's export-led production of software, aircraft, and more. even if local economy fundamentals are solid, the tie-up with asian markets could have a 2% to 4% impact on local tax collection in washington state, for example, said marlowe, whose university of washington posting affords him this vantage point. it is also true that state-specific issues, including the budget and economic toll of unfunded pension liabilities in illinois, can ramp up attention on state and local elections in determining the winners and the losers in the muni-bond market."}
{"original": "the next administration and congressional makeup could have a thing or two to say about the complexity of e-commerce taxation after amazon.com amzn, -1.71% has blown up the model, according to marlowe. states, including michigan, colorado and alabama, are trying to circumvent high-court rulings on cross-state taxation. sales tax can be one of the major revenue streams that finances public debt, including muni bonds. this is a macro trend that alone is a huge source of uncertainty and certain to feature in a new congress, marlowe said."}
{"original": "also, sanders and other lawmakers have questioned the fairness of tax exemption for muni holders. it is a trial balloon floated from time to time in congress and elsewhere that has so far been mostly hot air. a study commissioned by the international city/county management association and the government finance officers association, argues that because investors don't have to pay an income tax on their interest earnings from the bonds, governments can pay off their bonds at a lower interest rate than they would otherwise. in other words, muni bond issuers can compete with the often higher yields on corporates or treasury bonds. the tax-free status of municipal bonds saved governments an estimated $714 billion in extra interest payments from 2000 to 2014, according to the report. without the benefit, a typical bond issue would cost $80 to $210 in added interest per each $1,000 of borrowed money."}
{"original": "loss of the exemption could crush the states' [post tax-benefit] competitive yields compared to corporate bonds, says envision's cohen. you could have governors storming the white house and that may keep this topic a non-starter. washington will have bigger problems than it."}
{"original": "what comes around, goes around, the saying goes. for democrats, that may mean using a tactic first deployed by republicans to move their legislative priorities in 2021 if they win the white house and the senate on nov. 3 and keep the house."}
{"original": "the trick: pass two budgets, which would allow democrats two bites at the apple of budget reconciliation, an optional process that allows bills to be passed with only 51 votes in the senate."}
{"original": "for democrats increasingly confident of their november prospects, it potentially represents a chance to do big things in 2021 and avoid an intraparty donnybrook over senate rules. capitol hill budget veterans agree."}
{"original": "just like in sports, you can take another coach's aggressive strategy as your own if you think it's what is needed to score, said zach moller, deputy director of the center-left third way think tank's economic program and a former democratic budget aide in the senate, in an email."}
{"original": "if dems are unwilling to reform the filibuster, then using reconciliation will be the only path forward to pass large priorities over a republican blockade. some might argue that it should mean democrats need to find a way to be bipartisan, but how can you overlook [senate majority leader mitch] mcconnell's record during the obama years? you can't."}
{"original": "in recent weeks, various senate races once thought to be safely or likely favoring republicans have narrowed, putting democrats close to the 50 votes they would need to control the chamber once a democratic vice president's tie-breaking vote was included. combined with what looks like a safe house majority and upbeat polls for presumptive democratic presidential candidate joe biden, the question of how to position a legislative agenda looms larger."}
{"original": "whether i agree or disagree with it, reconciliation has been pushed out beyond what it was originally meant to do in terms of effectuating a broader blueprint, but clearly the opportunities lie there, said bill hoagland, senior vice president of the bipartisan policy center and a former high-ranking staffer on the republican side of capitol hill."}
{"original": "ordinarily, for bills but not nominations, the minority party in the senate can block something by threatening to filibuster it, which requires 60 votes to overcome. but some legislation doesn't have to travel this route."}
{"original": "enter budget resolution. a nonbinding document laying out projected spending, revenue and debt levels for the next decade, it can pass the senate with only 51 votes. a budget that's cleared both chambers can include instructions for follow-on bills on spending or taxes that also would be immune to filibuster."}
{"original": "there are limitations, though. under senate rules, some areas, like social security, are off-limits to reconciliation, and, because reconciliation is a budget exercise, provisions must have a measurable fiscal impact. that's why it's easier to use the process for tax bills, as republicans have often done, instead of other policies, like health care or environmental protection."}
{"original": "the new wrinkle added by republicans in 2017 was to do two budget resolutions for different years, and thus have two options for budget reconciliation, in a single year. because no budget resolution had been passed in 2016 for the 2017 fiscal year, republicans passed one in early 2017, used its reconciliation spinoff for the failed obamacare overhaul bill, and then used the fiscal 2018 budget and reconciliation process to pass a partisan tax-code overhaul."}
{"original": "the lack of a fiscal 2021 budget would leave a similar door open for democrats next year."}
{"original": "a spokeswoman for house budget chairman john yarmuth said it was too early for speculation, but, the spokeswoman said, our goal will always be to enact the best policies that will deliver for the american people. requests for comment from the office of sen. bernie sanders, the top-ranking democrat on the senate budget committee, were not returned."}
{"original": "aside from easing the legislative path for their priorities, a two-budget plan would also allow senate democrats to avoid a simmering debate among themselves over whether to scrap the filibuster for bills, as has been done with nominations."}
{"original": "biden, for decades a senator from delaware, has said he wants to retain the filibuster, but two of his potential picks for vice president, sen. elizabeth warren and sen. kamala harris, either favored its elimination or were open to scrapping it, according to the washington post. party liberals, in particular, worry an ambitious democratic agenda could be bogged down unless the filibuster is scrapped."}
{"original": "biden, saying it would depend on how obstreperous republicans are in opposition, recently hinted he could warm to getting rid of the filibuster."}
{"original": "that would be a mistake, in hoagland's eyes, for both the senate as an institution and for the already crippled budget process, by removing any incentive for lawmakers to engage with the budget."}
{"original": "frankly, from my perspective, that would spell the end of any vestiges of what the congressional budget and impoundment control act of 1974 was meant to do, he said."}
{"original": "i want to retain the legislative filibuster, he said. though i don't like the way the budget process has evolved, i would much prefer they at least go through that process first before they eliminate the legislative filibuster completely."}
{"original": "hoagland said it's possible an initial round of reconciliation would serve as a stalking horse to gauge appetite for going nuclear on the legislative filibuster."}
{"original": "what i've been hearing, which makes me feel very uncomfortable, is the revisitation of the nuclear option instead to do away with the legislative filibuster in the senate would be back in the front, he said."}
{"original": "reconciliation is an unwieldy instrument, though, and democrats may chafe under its restrictions, according to both moller and hoagland. provisions with only incidental budget impacts can be stripped out and several democratic priorities could be hard to shoehorn into a reconciliation bill."}
{"original": "you can't raise the minimum wage via reconciliation. broader health-care regulations outside of medicare and medicaid that aren't really budget impactful are tough. i think justice and equity issues are going to be a big part of the democrats' governing agenda, moller said. there's a lot of things that are nonbudgetary in that space."}
{"original": "but moller said having two budget rounds would allow for flexibility, especially as the landscape changes in relation to getting past the covid-19 crisis."}
{"original": "the downside, he said, is that going through those would delay a decision on the fate of the legislative filibuster, which he said may need to be scrapped if democrats want to enact big climate or health-care changes more easily."}
{"original": "the current situation is unsustainable, he said. i think everyone can agree on that."}
{"original": "warning: i am going to get a little political. i am trying to be objective and apolitical, which is becoming increasingly difficult. that said, i want to be clear that i think donald trump is a bad person, yet some of his economic ideas are very interesting."}
{"original": "when i said, in january 2016, that trump would likely win the presidency, i was mainly expressing my opinion that people in the u.s. tend to vote with their wallet. if the economy is doing well, people vote in the incumbent. if the economy is doing badly, they vote out the incumbent. and if the seat is vacant, they pick the person with the most relatable economic plan. i am oversimplifying, but i don't think by much."}
{"original": "anyhow, the reason i think trump won is because hillary's economic plan was garbage — she was enamored with the idea of a budget surplus, raising taxes on many people, and never stopped to consider that running a budget surplus during times of weak economic growth might be a recipe for recession, or that the tax-increase rhetoric and being fiscally responsible just doesn't resonate with people's economic preferences. and while trump's economic plan was imperfect, it actually made some sense and tended to resonate with people better. i am fairly certain he had no idea why it made sense, but it does. at least part of it does."}
{"original": "trump's economic plan can be boiled down to three big components:"}
{"original": "1. open-mouth policy: that is, going on twitter twtr, -4.96% and constantly trying to stir the animal spirits with talk about how the economy is the best that it has ever been."}
{"original": "2. the king of debt: blow out the deficit and the national debt during a time of economic weakness with the hope that stimulus will bring us out of 2% growth and closer to 4% growth."}
{"original": "3. trade protectionism: slap tariffs on goods and services with the hope that manufacturers start making those products in the usa."}
{"original": "now, i've been vocal about no. 3 — i am not a full-blown proponent of free trade, but protectionism is silly. as british economist joan robinson said, no one is better off when we dump rocks in our harbors. still, what trump is doing with these trade wars is pretty small potatoes in the grand scheme of things."}
{"original": "no. 2 is something i've advocated for a long time. with a weak economy, the government is usually the entity that has the balance-sheet flexibility to increase spending and debt issuance. i actually said that obamacare was obama's biggest blunder — not because i don't believe in government-run health care, but because i think he should have implemented a much bigger stimulus bill in 2010."}
{"original": "a deficit can be stimulative when the private sector is too weak to expand its own balance sheet (as has been the case for much of the past 10 years). personally, i think trump is doing this is an inefficient manner by lowering taxes disproportionately for the wealthy, but that's a different matter. still, trump is basically on the right track here."}
{"original": "no. 1 is the really interesting theoretical component. we are seeing business and consumer optimism skyrocket. why? we have no idea. but it sure seems to correlate highly with trump talking up the economy at every opportunity he can. is he stirring those animal spirits? i guess we don't know yet for certain, but it sure seems like it."}
{"original": "trump is going against economic orthodoxy in many ways. we won't be able to pin down exactly why it works or doesn't work, but one thing we know is that he's perhaps running the most interesting economic test ever. economists will be dissecting the trump economic experiment for a very long time, and it will very likely change the way we implement policy forever."}

{"original": "yes, tariffs are costs. but they do not somehow destroy our money. they do not take our hard-earned dollars and burn them in a big pile. tariffs are simply federal taxes. that's it. the extra costs paid by importers, and consumers, goes to uncle sam, to distribute as he sees fit, including, for example, on obamacare subsidies."}
{"original": "it wasn't long ago the media was complaining because trump was cutting taxes. now it's complaining he's raising them. confused? me too."}
{"original": "and the amounts involved are trivial. chicken feed."}
{"original": "president trump just hiked tariffs from 10% to 25% on about $200 billion in chinese imports. in other words, he just raised taxes by … $30 billion a year."}
{"original": "the total amount we all paid in taxes last year — federal, state and local — was $5.51 trillion. this tax increase that has everyone's panties in a twist is a rounding error."}
{"original": "meanwhile, the total value wiped off u.s. stocks during monday's panic was about $700 billion. more than 20 years' worth of the new tariffs."}
{"original": "even if trump slapped 25% taxes on all chinese imports, it would come to a tax hike of … $135 billion a year. u.s. gross domestic product (gdp) last year: $20.5 trillion."}
{"original": "so even this supposedly scary escalation of this tariff war would, er, raise our total tax bill from 26.9% of gdp all the way to 27.5% of gdp."}
{"original": "oh, and isn't it interesting to see some people's priorities? apparently the most shocking part of this trivial tax hike is that it might raise the price of new apple aapl, +1.27% iphones."}
{"original": "last i checked, these were luxury items, right?"}
{"original": "meanwhile, the trade spat seems to be bringing down food prices. china is going to take less of our farm products. so wheat prices are down 20% since the start of the year. soybeans are at 10-year lows."}
{"original": "no, no, of course not! silly you. this is also bad news … for farmers!"}
{"original": "and all this ignores the much bigger picture, anyway."}
{"original": "the tariffs are simply a means to an end. the president is trying to get china to start buying more of our stuff. he knows the so-called middle kingdom, which now has the second-biggest economy in the world, responds to incentives more than to nice words. these tariffs give china an incentive to open up."}
{"original": "ok, so china's first reaction is just to retaliate. big deal. that's just posturing."}
{"original": "right now we export less to china than we do to japan, south korea and singapore put together. that's the point. so the effect of china's new tariffs on the u.s. are yet another rounding error. even if china banned all imports from the u.s., that would amount to only 0.6% of our gross domestic product. and we'd sell the stuff somewhere else."}

{"original": "he would build on obamacare to insure more americans by expanding medicaid—14 states still don't fully participate—and raising income caps for who may qualify for subsidies when purchasing insurance on government exchanges. biden would create a public option—federal and state-run insurance plans to compete with private carriers."}

{"original": "biden, like european social democrats, makes few bows to the mandates of the marketplace, because he presides over a political party that views free markets with some considerable suspicion. it increasingly embraces the 1619 project's false narrative of slave-conceived capitalism and racial/gender prejudices to explain our economic system's failures and has boundless faith in the ability of government to deliver."}

{"original": "i'll get to five biotechnology companies that dodge these issues in a second — two favorites from my stock newsletter, brush up on stocks, and three from the biotech team at jefferies."}
{"original": "but first, here are the three main covid-19 landmines for biotech investors to watch out for, and how to diffuse them."}
{"original": "landmine no. 1: smaller biotech companies short on cash will face a funding crunch if the stock market stays down. they'll be forced to dilute the heck out of shareholders by raising capital."}
{"original": "how to diffuse it: favor biotech companies that just raised cash, or have enough on hand to cover at least 18 months of cash burn, says jefferies biotech analyst michael yee."}
{"original": "several companies were lucky enough to raise capital right before the biotech group started to fall apart on march 6. among small biotech companies, karyopharm therapeutics kpti, -0.44% was that last one to extract money from the stock market before the fall, on march 3, according to a jefferies screen. twist bioscience twst, -3.56% and bioxcel therapeutics btai, -5.24% pulled off a similar feat by raising money in the last 10 days of february."}
{"original": "any of the dozens of companies raising capital in january and february should be able to wait out the storm. otherwise, favor companies that have a lot of cash relative to their cash burn. two small biotech companies with very high cash levels relative to cash burn rates are viking therapeutics vktx, -1.42% and pieris pharmaceuticals pirs, -0.72% , according to a screen from jefferies."}
{"original": "landmine no. 2: drug trials could be disrupted by shelter in place limits on travel, or a ban on elective procedures in hospitals."}
{"original": "how to diffuse it: favor companies that are able to do assessments of patients via video conference or phone. next, companies with cancer therapies should be safe here. their patients will probably do all they can to avoid missing potentially lifesaving treatments."}
{"original": "be more careful with companies running trials that require biopsies. they could see disruptions since biopsies may fall into the bucket of elective procedures that hospitals postpone to free up resources for covid-19 victims. a phase ii study of liver ailment therapies by akero therapeutics akro, -3.74% may face hurdles. finally, very small companies with only one trial in progress could also be more vulnerable if shelter in place drags out."}
{"original": "fortunately, the food and drug administration (fda) has signaled it will be ok with reasonable changes to drug trial protocols, as long as they are documented. it's also open to virtual meetings with companies to review data and discuss issues. the fda appears to be flexible and understanding, says yee."}
{"original": "landmine no. 3: drug companies' sales forces are getting grounded."}
{"original": "how to diffuse it: this is one of those problems that i like to call a one-off, or fixable, issue. the cure for this kind of issue in investing is simple: patience."}
{"original": "otherwise, be a little more cautious with companies that were generating excitement because they were launching a new product. covid-19 slowed the launch momentum of fibrogen's fgen, -1.76% anemia drug called roxadustat in china, for example. this could be an issue if it drags out."}

{"original": "a texas judge's ruling late friday that the provision of the affordable care act requiring everyone be insured is unconstitutional and therefore the law doesn't stand will almost certainly not stand on appeal, as most legal scholars agree."}
{"original": "so while the law isn't gone, the ruling adds more uncertainty in the minds of many individuals. this isn't good for insurance costs, no matter what your beliefs are about the program, also known as obamacare."}
{"original": "as a former insurance company ceo, i question whether this is enough to drive insurers away from the individual market. if premiums cover costs for a sufficient number of customers, the profit potential will keep it going. and i'll bet that very little change will actually occur since the aca's key provisions are so attractive to so many."}
{"original": "however, the damage from continuing assaults on obamacare is serious. it is bad enough that incremental challenges to its individual insurance exchanges have already pushed millions away from the pool. but a crazy unintended result of the federal government welching on what it owed insurers in the first three years under the law to help stabilize the new market actually cost it more as premiums skyrocketed."}
{"original": "here's why: insurers had to build the resulting shortfall into 2018 premiums, driving them up between 7% and 38% depending on location. however, under the aca rules that require insurers to help low-income enrollees even if there is no federal aid, subsidies to the working poor had to rise dramatically to compensate for this. as a result, the government paid more in subsidies than any savings it garnered from the payments avoided."}
{"original": "read:texas ruling over obamacare is wrong to claim that without the insurance mandate, the health-care law can't survive"}
{"original": "for those who get health insurance through work, the impact of all this was muted. the underlying changes in health-care costs continued at a 6% trend, leaving large employers largely unaffected by this circus. they have been supportive of the aca largely because the subsidy of otherwise uninsured people has lessened the need for providers to finance that care by charging them more for the policies they buy for their employees."}
{"original": "but health-care policy continues to be a mess since congress refuses to address issues for political purposes. the 2019 numbers for obamacare signups will reflect this confusion. unfortunately, the judge's ruling comes just as the individual exchanges seemed to be reaching some equilibrium, with posted changes in premiums ranging from -17% to +21% for silver plans. for most enrollees there will be no change in cost at all after subsidies. obamacare will still be popular and very hard to eliminate politically."}
{"original": "so no matter what happens on appeal, there is likely to be very little change to obamacare. first, there is the political cost if popular features are lost, such as the prohibition on pre-existing coverage, keeping children on their parents' policies until age 26, expanding coverage of medicaid to the working poor and even the support for better ways of treatment all built into the aca."}

{"original": "under the aca, also known as obamacare, plans can charge their oldest customers only three times the prices charged to the youngest ones."}
{"original": "given that possible change, experts say pre-medicare workers are likely to stay in their jobs longer to keep their employer-sponsored health insurance, even though they may be ready to retire in other ways — financially and emotionally, for instance — to retire."}
{"original": "it seems entirely plausible that the new rules would discourage older workers from retiring or going out on their own to start a new business — if it means giving up employer-sponsored health coverage, said tricia neuman, a senior vice president and director of the program on medicare policy at kaiser family foundation."}
{"original": "read: what the house republican bill gets wrong about the health insurance market"}

{"original": "but experts can't, at present, determine what older americans might pay under the house republicans' bill. we can't say with precision what the payment for someone after the republican tax credit would be because there are a lot of other changes outside of the tax credit, said cynthia cox, an associate director at the kaiser family foundation, noting that doing away with the individual mandate, for example, would have a significant effect on premiums. i don't think there is a lot of reason to believe that premium would be significantly lower under this bill than under the aca."}
{"original": "people spend small fortunes to bury pets at this cemetery"}
{"original": "the house republicans kept a lot of the consumer protections that make insurance under the aca expensive and do away with the individual mandate that has a downward effect on premiums, according to cox. but it would take more complicated modeling to say what the net premium would be after tax credits under the gop plan, she said."}

{"original": "the bottom line? for some, retirement might not be an affordable option, said neuman."}
{"original": "before the aca, neuman said, older adults had difficulty finding affordable coverage that would cover their pre-existing condition. that led to job lock, and stronger incentives to delay retirement, she said. with the replacement proposal, it seems people will have access to coverage, even with pre-existing conditions, but it may not be affordable."}
{"original": "among other things, neuman said the congressional budget office (cbo) and joint committee on taxation (joint tax) will need to consider this in their estimate, and will also take into account incentives for employers under the proposed bill. we'll have to see what they say, she said."}
{"original": "the aarp, the influential group representing senior citizens and a supporter of the aca, released a letter opposing the health care bill on tuesday."}
{"original": "this bill would weaken medicare's fiscal sustainability, dramatically increase health care costs for americans aged 50-64, and put at risk the health care of millions of children and adults with disabilities, and poor seniors who depend on the medicaid program for longterm services and supports and other benefits, wrote joyce rogers, aarp senior vice president for government affairs."}
{"original": "carolyn mcclanahan, a certified financial planner with life planning partners, also said it's likely that older americans will have to keep working under the aca replacement law, but that it will depend on the credits. basically the answer will vary based on the person, she said."}
{"original": "for her part, neuman said those with low or moderate incomes would get smaller tax credits than those offered under the current aca plan to help cover expenses, according to neuman. this report from kaiser illustrates premium tax credits under the house republicans' plan for 60-year-olds by income."}
{"original": "of note, some 9.9% of americans ages 35 to 64 had no health insurance coverage according to this report."}
{"original": "if the current congressional proposal increases costs to older workers to the high level that it appears to, it will definitely lead to 'job block' of older workers staying in jobs for the health insurance, said katy votava, president of goodcare.com. there is evidence that the aca has contributed to job growth for younger workers by relieving 'job block' of older workers, she said."}
{"original": "echoing the sentiment of neuman, votava also said it would discourage older workers who are planning to leave their current employer to start a small business. they will be less inclined to do so because they will face even higher health-care costs as a sole proprietor or very small business, she said. people over 50 have become strong contributors to small business formation. this proposal will stymie the growth of small businesses as well."}

{"original": "when it came to reopening the country, president trump pointed directly at the governors. the responsibility rested with them, he tweeted."}
{"original": "the governors countered that they couldn't follow the president's plan without a much larger number of tests and that they needed the white house's help to get them. it is sort of like the hunger games, with states battling each other for scarce supplies, contended johns hopkins university health scholar jennifer nuzzo."}

{"original": "that's because the fracture lines had already developed long before the virus's outbreak and are part of a much bigger war."}
{"original": "most of the states that jumped first to lock down their economies in march had also been the states that had most enthusiastically embraced obamacare — 28 of the 32 early lockdown states had expanded their medicaid programs to lower income residents under the affordable care act. and for the other states that didn't lock down in march? most of them — 11 of 18 — didn't expand medicaid."}

{"original": " we have not yet seen trump in full fury, but may do so soon, as his room for maneuver continues to narrow. "}
{"original": "none of trump's extremist policy ideas has received public support. the public opposed last year's republican-backed corporate tax cut, trump's effort to repeal the affordable care act (obamacare), his proposed border wall with mexico, the decision to withdraw from the iran nuclear agreement, and the imposition of tariff increases on china, europe, and others."}
{"original": "at the same time, contrary to trump's relentless promotion of fossil fuels (coal, oil, and gas), the public favors investments in renewable energy and remaining in the paris climate agreement."}
{"original": "trump has tried to implement his radical agenda using three approaches. the first has been to rely on the republican majorities in the two houses of congress to pass legislation in the face of strong popular opposition. that approach succeeded once, with the 2017 corporate tax cut, because big republican donors insisted on the measure, but it failed with trump's attempt to repeal obamacare, as three republican senators balked."}
{"original": "the second approach has been to use executive orders to circumvent congress. here the courts have repeatedly intervened, most recently within days of the election, when a federal district court halted work on the keystone xl pipeline, a project strongly opposed by environmentalists, on the grounds that the trump administration had failed to present a reasoned explanation for its actions."}
{"original": "trump repeatedly and dangerously oversteps his authority, and the courts keep pushing back."}
{"original": "trump's third tactic has been to rally public opinion to his side. yet, despite his frequent rallies, or perhaps because of them and their incendiary vulgarity, trump's disapproval rating has exceeded his approval rating since the earliest days of his administration. his current overall disapproval rating is 56%, versus 38% approval, with strong approval from around 25% of the public. there has been no sustained move in trump's direction."}
{"original": "in the midterm elections, which trump himself described as a referendum on his presidency, the democratic candidates for both the house and senate vastly outpolled their republican opponents. in the house races, democrats received 54 million votes nationally, compared with 48.7 million for republicans. in the senate races, democrats outpolled republicans by 48.4 million votes to 34.4 million."}
{"original": "summing up votes by party for the three recent election cycles (2014, 2016, and 2018), democratic senate candidates outpolled republican candidates by roughly 120 million to 100 million. nonetheless, the republicans hold a slight majority in the senate, where each state is represented by two senators, regardless of the size of its population, because they tend to win their seats in less populous states, whereas democrats prevail in the major coastal and midwestern states."}
{"original": "wyoming, for example, elects two republican senators to represent its nearly 580,000 residents, while california's more than 39 million residents elect two democratic senators. democrats win more votes, but republicans win more seats."}
{"original": "without control of the house, however, trump will no longer be able to enact any unpopular legislation. only policies with bipartisan support will have a chance of passing both chambers."}
{"original": "on the economic front, trump's trade policies will become even less popular in the months ahead as the american economy cools from the sugar high of the corporate tax cut, as growing uncertainty about global trade policy hamstrings business investment, and as both the budget deficit and interest rates rise."}
{"original": "trump's phony national-security justifications for raising tariffs will also be challenged politically and perhaps in the courts."}
{"original": "true, trump will be able to continue appointing conservative federal judges and most likely win their confirmation in the republican-majority senate. and on issues of war and peace, trump will operate with terrifyingly little oversight by congress or the public, an affliction of the u.s. political system since world war ii."}
{"original": "trump, like his recent predecessors, will most likely keep america mired in wars in the middle east and africa, despite the lack of significant public understanding or support."}
{"original": "nonetheless, there are three further reasons to believe that trump's hold on power will weaken significantly in the coming months."}
{"original": "first, special counsel robert mueller may very well document serious malfeasance by trump, his family members, and/or his close advisers. mueller kept a low profile in the run-up to the election. we will most likely hear from him soon."}
{"original": "second, the house democrats will begin to investigate trump's taxes and personal business dealings, including through congressional subpoenas. there are strong reasons to believe that trump has committed serious tax evasion (as the new york times recently outlined) and has illegally enriched his family as president (a lawsuit that the courts have allowed to proceed alleges violations of the emoluments clause of the constitution)."}
{"original": "trump is likely to ignore or fight the subpoenas, setting the stage for a major political crisis."}
{"original": "third, and most important, trump is not merely an extremist politician. he suffers from what author ian hughes has recently called a disordered mind, filled with hate, paranoia, and narcissism. according to two close observers of trump, the president's grip on reality will likely continue to diminish in the face of growing political obstacles, investigations into his taxes and business dealings, mueller's findings, and an energized political opposition."}
{"original": "we may already be seeing that in trump's erratic and aggressive behavior since the election."}
{"original": "the coming months may be especially dangerous for america and the world. as trump's political position weakens and the obstacles facing him grow, his mental instability will pose an ever-greater danger. he could explode in rage, fire mueller, and perhaps try to launch a war or claim emergency powers in order to restore his authority."}

{"original": "republican senators fought back against democratic allegations that a supreme court featuring judge amy coney barrett would overturn the affordable care act, and along with it a mandate that insurance companies sell plans to those with preexisting conditions, during confirmation hearings tuesday."}
{"original": "democrats have been eager to cast the vote on coney barrett as a referendum on the affordable care act, citing a pending case texas v. california, in which republican attorneys general and governors from twenty states have argued the law should be declared unconstitutional and overturned."}
{"original": "they have pointed to a 2017 article in which judge barrett said that chief justice robert's 2013 decision to uphold the law pushed the affordable care act beyond its plausible meaning to save the statute."}
{"original": "sen. lindsey graham, a south carolina republican, urged judge barrett to distinguish the issues before the court when it upheld the law in 2013 and the issue before the court in california v. texas, and why her opinion of the previous ruling does not mean she would vote to overturn the law based on arguments in the pending case."}
{"original": "the 2012 case was decided on the question of whether the law's mandate that americans purchase health insurance was constitutional under congress' power to regulate interstate commerce. in a 5-4 decision, justice roberts concluded that the act was constitutional because the penalty associated with the mandate was constitutional as congress is given the power to levy taxes and not because of commerce-clause powers in the constitution."}
{"original": "in california v. texas, opponents of the law argue that because congress has since made the penalty for not buying insurance zero dollars, it can no longer be called a tax, thus eliminating roberts' justification for the law."}
{"original": "the issue now is that congress has zeroed it out, can it be called a tax, or is it now a penalty, barrett said. the second issue is if it is a penalty, can it be just cut out from the statute so that the rest of the statute, including protection for preexisting conditions stands."}
{"original": "a lot smarter people than me suggest that severability would be a hard challenge for those who were opposing the law, graham replied."}
{"original": "nevertheless, president trump campaigned on appointing justices that would overturn the law, and the 2020 republican party platform has argued that the law is unconstitutional and decisions upholding it should be reversed."}
{"original": "this is what president trump said, this is what your party platoform said: reverse the obamacare cases, said sen. sheldon whitehouse, a vermont democrat. why is it surprising for us to be concerned that you want this nominee to do what you want nominees to do?"}
{"original": "during an exchange with sen. chris coons, a democrat from delaware, barrett argued that the president's and the republican party's opposition for the law will not affect how with how she would judge cases related to the affordable care act."}
{"original": "i have not made any commitments or deals or anything like that, she said. i am not here on a mission to destroy the affordable care act. i'm just here to apply the law and adhere to the rule of law."}
{"original": "sen. graham pointed to legislation he proposed in 2017 that would have replaced obamacare with another law that would contain some protections for americans with preexisting conditions, though the bill was never brought for a vote."}
{"original": "senate democrats have decided to make the ongoing court battle over the constitutionality of the affordable care act the centerpiece of their argument against the nomination of judge amy coney barrett to the supreme court."}
{"original": "in her opening statement, sen. dianne feinstein, a democrat from california, pointed to repeated statements by president trump promising to nominate judges who would overturn the law, popularly called obamacare, during senate confirmation hearings monday morning."}
{"original": "health-care coverage for millions of americans is at stake with this nomination, feinstein said, noting that on nov. 10 the supreme court will hear arguments in the case california v. texas, wherein 20 republican-led states have sued to have the law struck down. the trump administration has declined to defend the law in court."}
{"original": "the president has promised any judge he nominates will overturn the aca, said sen. patrick leahy, a vermont democrat, in his opening remarks. judge barrett has already made it clear she considers the act unconstitutional, he added, referring to 2017 article she wrote that argued that chief justice roberts 2013 decision to uphold the law pushed the affordable care act beyond its plausible meaning to save the statute."}
{"original": "obamacare extended health care to millions of americans through an expansion of medicaid and provisions that denied insurers the right to deny coverage to those with pre-existing conditions and mandated that young adults age 26 or below could remain on their parents' insurance plans."}
{"original": "sen. chuck grassley, a republican from iowa, argued that it is impossible to know how barrett would vote on california v. texas. the left is suggesting that judge barrett's confirmation would be the demise of the affordable care act and the protection for preexisting conditions. that's outrageous, he said. as a mother of seven judge barrett clearly understands the importance of health care."}
{"original": "he also noted that several judges appointed by republican presidents have ended up siding with progressives on many issues, including justices john paul stevens, anthony kennedy and david souter. democrats and their allies shouldn't claim to know how any judge would rule in any particular case, he said."}
{"original": "democrats were also keen to make the threat of an overturned affordable care act personal, with senators highlighting individual constituents' stories and how their lives have been made better by the law."}
{"original": "sen. dick durbin, a democrat from illinois, shared the story of 7-year-old kenny murray from tinley park, ill., who was diagnosed, in utero, with multiple congenital heart defects, which required him to undergo three open-heart surgeries in the first 14 months of his life, costing more than $1 million."}
{"original": "durbin noted that kenny's father's health insurance, through his employer, had a million-dollar lifetime cap, before an obamacare provision banning lifetime caps on coverage went into effect in 2014."}
{"original": "without that provision, kenny's family would have gone bankrupt, durbin said. kenny is a real person whose life depends on the affordable care act."}
{"original": "despite his administration's opposition to the affordable care act, which prevents insurers from discriminating against preexisting conditions, president trump urged republicans to argue that they would institute as-yet unproposed laws that would keep the ban in place."}
{"original": "other republican figures, like doug andres, press secretary for senate majority leader mitch mcconnell, a republican from texas, criticized democrats unrelenting focus on the affordable care act."}
{"original": "senate republicans, meanwhile, attempted to make the hearings a referendum on judge barrett's catholic faith, referring frequently to sen. feinstein's remarks to barrett in a 2017 court of appeals nomination that the dogma lives loudly within you, in reference to fears that barrett's faith would impact her rulings on issues like abortion."}
{"original": "while democrats steered clear of statements referencing barrett's religion during monday's hearing, sen. josh hawley, a missouri republican, said feinstein's comments three years ago were picking up on the very terminology of anti-catholic bigotry current in this country a century ago."}
{"original": "he argued that any attempt to question how a potential judge's religious beliefs might impact their rulings is expressly forbidden by the constitution's prohibition on their being religious tests for public-office holders and an attack on religious liberty more broadly."}
{"original": "that is attempt to bring back the veto power of the powerful over the religious beliefs and sincerely held convictions of the american people, he said. that is what is at stake in this confirmation hearing."}
{"original": "senate republican leader mitch mcconnell said tuesday democrats will use a planned infrastructure bill to also pass tax hikes using a process that would keep republicans from being able to stop it in the senate."}

{"original": "the list of items included a $5,900 ivanka trump-brand pendant, politico reported, citing documents, including the police report, that pertained to the claim. the items were nabbed from the rented suv used by verma, who runs the centers for medicare and medicaid services and also oversees obamacare, when she gave a speech in san francisco over the summer."}
{"original": "the property was not insured, verma wrote in her filing to the health and human services department."}
{"original": "verma initially estimated the cost of her lost property as $20,000, according to the police report, before later revising the cost upward when filing her claim to the health department. verma's claim, which noted a jewelry appraisal sought after the theft, also included about $2,000 to cover the cost of her stolen clothes and another $2,000 for various items, including a $325 claim for moisturizer and a $349 claim for noise-cancelling headphones, politico said."}
{"original": "a spokesperson for the department of health and human services told the publication that the department has a policy of paying for certain goods when they are lost during a work trip, as long as they are not inherently for other uses, but that excludes jewelry. verma was ultimately reimbursed just $2,852.40, according to the report."}
{"original": "verma, who formerly served as a consultant to then-indiana gov. mike pence, trump's current vice president, has led cms since march 2017. her spending of taxpayer money has also been under scrutiny by the hhs inspector general, after reports earlier this year about her use of outside public relations consultants, some of whom worked to promote verma's personal brand."}

{"original": "inflation was held to extremely low levels in 2014 and 2015 largely because of a plunge in gasoline prices. yet somewhat higher gas prices and a sharp acceleration in what consumers pay for rent — they rose last year at the fastest clip since 2007 — have put more upward pressure on inflation."}

{"original": "to me, this is a classic case of investors' political biases getting the better of them, because a close analysis shows there's almost no chance of such legislation being enacted. that's why i believe this is a great opportunity to buy health care, one of the market's best sectors, at an attractive price."}

{"original": "a republican-controlled senate would prevent medicare for all from even getting a vote. but let's assume the democrats win a slim majority and a president bernie tries to ram through medicare for all. again, one of the reasons the aca passed was that president obama lined up the support (or at least neutrality) of powerful interest groups that in the past had opposed health-care reform: the american medical association, big pharma, the american hospital association and health insurers. according to opensecrets.org, the health-care industry made federal campaign contributions of $225 million and spent $563 million on lobbying in 2018. that buys a lot of politicians."}

{"original": "2. personal income data refute the stagnation myth: while the census data make more sense to me now, they still have lots of issues. most importantly, the census data are based on surveys asking a sample of respondents for the amount of their money income before taxes. so medicare, medicaid, food stamps, and other noncash government benefits — which are included in the personal income series compiled by the bureau of economic analysis (bea) — are excluded from the census series. in addition, the bea data are based on hard data like monthly payroll employment statistics and tax returns. bea also compiles an after-tax personal income series reflecting government tax benefits such as the earned income tax credit."}
{"original": "the bea series for personal income, disposable personal income, and personal consumption expenditures—on a per-household basis and adjusted for inflation using the personal consumption expenditures deflator (pced) rather than the cpi — all strongly refute the stagnation claims of pessimists and progressives (see fig. 2). all three measures have been on solid uptrends for many years, including from 2000 through 2016, rising 25.1%, 27.9%, and 25.9%, respectively, over this period. they often rose to new record highs during this period. there was no stagnation whatsoever, according to these data series. instead, there was lots of growth."}
{"original": "the standard critique of using the bea data series on a per-household basis is that they are means, not medians. so those at the very top of the income scale, the so-called 1-percent, in theory could be skewing both the aggregate and per-household data. that's possible for personal income but unlikely for average personal consumption per household. the rich can only eat so much more than the rest of us, and there aren't enough of them to substantially skew aggregate and per-household consumption considering that they literally represent only 1% of taxpayers, but almost 40% of the federal government's revenue from income taxes, as discussed below."}
{"original": "3. real hourly wages belie the stagnation myth too: another data series that refutes the stagnation claim of pessimists and progressives is average hourly earnings (ahe), reported in the monthly employment report and reflected in the bea income data. adjusting it for inflation using the pced shows that it soared during the second half of the 1960s through the early 1970s (see fig. 3). it then stagnated during the rest of the 1970s through mid-1995 as a result of what was then called deindustrialization. since december 1994, it has been rising along a 1.2%-per-year growth path. that's a significant growth rate in the purchasing power of consumers, as real ahe compounded to an increase of 37.2% from december 1994 through july of this year. that coincides with the high-tech revolution, which i've been writing about since 1993."}
{"original": "by the way, the hourly wage series used here is for production and nonsupervisory workers, which obviously doesn't include the rich. furthermore, these workers have accounted for between 80.4% and 83.5% of total payroll employment since 1964 (see fig. 4). so the real ahe series includes lots of working stiffs and isn't distorted by the 1-percent, let alone the top 20%-or-so of earners."}
{"original": "4. the cpi is very misleading: it is well known that the cpi is upwardly biased, especially compared to the pced (see fig. 5). since january 1964 through july of this year, the cpi is up 838.5%, while the pced is up 646.3%. as a result, while the pced-adjusted ahe has been rising in record high territory since january 1999, the cpi-adjusted version didn't recover to its previous record high during january 1973 until april 2020, which makes absolutely no sense (see fig. 6)! (an extremely flawed august 2018 study by the pew research center concluded that americans' purchasing power based on the cpi-adjusted ahe has barely budged in 40 years.)"}
{"original": "the fed long has based its monetary policy decision-making on the pced rather than the cpi. a footnote in the fomc's february 2000 monetary policy report to congress explained why the committee had decided to switch to the inflation rate based on the personal consumption expenditures deflator (pced)."}
{"original": "5. adjusting for household and family sizes makes a difference: the fun of making fun of the funny-looking census income data series continues when i adjust them for the average size of households and families in the us (see fig. 7 and fig. 8). both series have been on downward trends since the 1940s, especially the average size of households. households have always been smaller than families, and earned less, since the former include single-person households, which have increased significantly in recent years because young adults have been postponing marriage and older folks have been living longer, resulting in more divorced and widowed persons."}
{"original": "furthermore, data available since 1982 through 2019 show that the percentage of nonfamily households has increased to 35.7% from 25.1% over that period (see fig. 9 and fig. 10). so there are more of these households that tend to earn less than family households. no wonder that the census data adjusted for household size and for inflation using the pced shows less stagnation and steeper uptrends since the start of the data (see fig. 11 and fig. 12)."}
{"original": "6. the rich aren't like you and me: what about the 1-percent, who earn too much money, have too much wealth, and don't pay their fair share of taxes? the total number of all the tycoons on wall street, in silicon valley, and in the c-suites of corporate america — including everyone with adjusted gross income (agi) exceeding $500,000 a year — was 1.5 million taxpayers in 2017, exactly 1% of all taxpayers who filed returns that year, according to the latest available data from the internal revenue service (irs) (see fig. 13)."}
{"original": "collectively, during 2017 the 1-percent paid $625 billion in income taxes, or 26.7% of their agi. that amount represented 38.9% of all federal income tax paid by all taxpayers who paid any taxes at all (see fig. 14, fig. 15 and fig. 16). the rest of us working stiffs, the 99-percent, shelled out $980 billion, or 61.1% of the total tax bill. what should be the fair share for the 1-percent? instead of almost 40% of the federal government's tax revenue, should they be kicking in 50%? why not 75%? they would be less rich, but everyone else would be richer—unless the 1-percent decide to work less hard or leave the country if they lose their incentive to keep creating new businesses, jobs, and wealth."}
{"original": "7. trump this: love him or hate him, the standard of living did increase significantly during president donald trump's first term (until the pandemic hit), as it has done under many previous presidents, especially those who have championed pro-growth and pro-business policies, including tax cuts and deregulation."}
{"original": "8. time for progressives to declare mission accomplished?: progressives continue to claim that government policies need to be more progressively focused on raising taxes and redistributing income. until recently, they've relied on the census income series to prove their point, though these measures clearly leave out the positive impact that past progressive policies have already had through medicare, medicaid, food stamps, tax credits, and other noncash government social benefits."}
{"original": "progressives long have promised that their policies will create heaven on earth. arguably, they have succeeded in doing so for many americans with their new deal, great society and obamacare programs. these programs have reduced income inequality by redistributing income, which has been growing faster than progressives concede thanks to america's entrepreneurial spirit and capitalist system. progressives, who never seem satisfied with the progress they have made, run the risk of killing the goose that lays the golden eggs to pay for their programs. incomes can always be made equal by making everyone equally poor."}
{"original": "as confirmed by the latest available irs data, there is no denying that the rich got richer during 2017 and earned more taxable income than ever before. they undoubtedly continued to do so during 2018 and 2019. but now even the census data show that real median household income rose to a record high last year. most americans were more prosperous last year than ever before, though some more so than others. why does anyone have a problem with that?"}
{"original": "the bottom line is that just before the pandemic, american households enjoyed record standards of living. income stagnation was a myth. income inequality isn't a myth but an inherent characteristic of free-market capitalism, an economic system that awards the biggest prizes to those capitalists who benefit the most consumers with their goods and services. perversely, inequality tends to be greatest during periods of widespread prosperity. rather than bemoaning that development, we should celebrate that so many households are prospering, even if a few are doing so more than the rest of us."}
{"original": " how does the u.s. bring back the good times once the coronavirus pandemic is over so that americans can enjoy widespread prosperity again? we may not have to wait that long. "}
{"original": "9. a housing-led recovery: how does the u.s. bring back the good times once the coronavirus pandemic is over so that americans can enjoy widespread prosperity again? we may not have to wait that long. the pandemic has triggered a housing boom that could offset many of the ongoing woes in industries still plagued by the pandemic. de-urbanization is certainly weighing on urban economies, but suburban ones are booming because more and more city apartment dwellers are moving to homes in the burbs. there's increasing anecdotal evidence that millennials who've been renting apartments in urban areas are responding to the pandemic by buying houses in the burbs. housing-related retail sales of furniture, furnishings, and appliances have rebounded to record highs as both existing and new home sales are surging."}
{"original": "industries most likely to face a challenging recovery are the ones covered by the following categories of personal consumption expenditures: air transportation; hotels and motels; food services; amusement parks and related recreation; admission to special spectator amusements, and gambling. altogether, these categories added up to $996 billion (saar) during july, while housing-related construction and consumption totaled $862 billion. while the recent recovery in the former could stall until a vaccine is available, the latter is likely to boom in coming months (see fig. 17)."}
{"original": "furthermore, americans have $10.6 trillion in home mortgages. thanks to the fed's ultra-easy monetary policies, many are refinancing their loans at record low mortgage rates, providing a significant boost to monthly household incomes. those record low mortgage rates are also helping to keep home buying affordable even as home prices continue to rise. in addition, americans have a record $20.2 trillion in home equity. if they need it, they can use it to raise some cash through home equity loans or by selling their homes at record high prices. the glass is at least half full."}

{"original": "collins v. mnuchin, dec. 9 oral arguments."}
{"original": "this case will determine whether the structure of the federal housing finance agency is constitutional or not. the fhfa is the main regulator that oversees fannie mae fnma, +0.53% and freddie mac fmcc, +0.54% , the mortgage giants that buy a significant portion of the mortgages created nationwide and then package them into mortgage-backed securities sold to investors."}
{"original": "the agency was created in 2008 in the wake of the subprime mortgage crisis as part of the housing and economic recovery act, and the fhfa quickly thereafter placed fannie and freddie into conservatorship."}
{"original": "fannie and freddie shareholders brought the lawsuit in question. in 2012, the fhfa began sweeping the profits of the two mortgage giants to the treasury department to repay the funds the government used to bail them out. under the oversight of the agency's current director, mark calabria, the fhfa has winnowed down the profit sweeps to allow fannie and freddie to build back their own cash reserves as a buffer for any economic shocks. calabria has also said he would wipe out shareholders were fannie and freddie to hit hard times again in the future."}
{"original": "already the fifth circuit court of appeals has ruled that the fhfa's structure is unconstitutional, but the plaintiffs decided to appeal the case to the supreme court anyway to give the nation's highest court final say over the matter."}
{"original": "in many ways, the case mirrors one the supreme court has already decided. earlier this year, the court ruled in a 5-4 decision that the consumer financial protection bureau's structure was unconstitutional. like the cfpb, the fhfa has a single director, who as of now is appointed by a president for a five-year term, but cannot be removed by a subsequent president. in the cfpb case, ginsburg sided with the minority."}
{"original": "most observers, therefore, expect the fhfa suit to be decided similarly, with the court's conservative majority giving the president the right to fire the fhfa director. the court also has the option to decide whether the profit sweeps to the treasury department are constitutional, but most expect the court to make a narrower ruling and essentially ignore that issue."}
{"original": "if the court rules in this manner, its decision won't radically reshape the fhfa in and of itself. little has changed either in the directorship or direction of the cfpb since its governance was modified, said thomas wade, director of financial services policy at the american action forum, a nonprofit, right-leaning think tank."}
{"original": "what would make the decision influential is if former vice president joe biden wins the presidential election. if trump remains in the white house for another term, calabria is likely to remain at the fhfa. as such, the agency would move forward with its current plan to recapitalize fannie and freddie in the hopes of releasing them from conservatorship."}
{"original": "those efforts would likely end if biden assumes the presidency and removes calabria as fhfa director. if biden wins, that's all off, said brandon barford, partner at beacon policy advisors, an independent policy research firm. instead, biden would look to make fannie and freddie into a tool to help with racial justice and economic inequality, barford said, and have them refocus on achieving certain goals related to improving housing affordability."}
{"original": "whichever way the court decides, barford said the outcome is unlikely to have much bearing on housing-finance reform. that's ultimately up to congress, and lawmakers don't have much incentive to change the current status quo."}
{"original": "conservatorship, while politicians may profess to not like it, is actually the best of all worlds, because it allows government control over the two biggest financial entities out there and effective government control over the mortgage market, barford said."}
{"original": "democratic presidential front-runner joe biden was in work-from-home mode on monday, as he criticized president donald trump's coronavirus response in a webcast from his house in delaware."}
{"original": "the president needs to set the right priorities for economic response. our guiding principle must be to keep everyone paid through this crisis, said biden in his remarks, which were broadcast live on facebook and twitter."}
{"original": "unfortunately, as of last night, president trump and mitch mcconnell were offering a plan to let big corporations off the hook. they proposed a $500 billion slush fund for corporations with almost no conditions, the former vice president added, referring to the republican-run senate's majority leader."}
{"original": "democrats and republicans in washington have been working to reach a deal on a major congressional stimulus package to fight the economic impact of the coronavirus causing the disease covid-19, with negotiations continuing monday after a test vote on the massive package failed sunday night in the senate. republicans have sought to provide $500 billion for the treasury to make loans or investments to support businesses, while democrats want provisions such as expanding unemployment insurance to four months at 100% pay and increasing aid to hospitals."}
{"original": "biden said the gop plan would allow companies that receive aid to buy back stocks and increase executive pay if that's what the secretary of treasury decided, and corporations wouldn't have to make commitments to keep workers employed."}
{"original": "the former vice president appeared set to make these webcasts regularly. a biden donor asked him at a fundraising event on sunday if supporters could get more of him and less trump on our airwaves, and biden responded that his staff had converted a recreation room in his house into a tv studio and starting monday he would making his first presentation."}
{"original": "in monday's webcast, biden said trump is not to blame for the coronavirus, but he does bear responsibility for our response, and i along with every american hope he steps up and starts to get this right. he said the president's daily briefings should not be a place for political attacks, and he said it's just not accurate for trump to have said that nobody saw this coming."}
{"original": "my point is not simply that the president was wrong, biden said. my point is that the mindset that was slow to recognize the problem in the first place, to treat it with the seriousness it deserved, is still too much a part of how the president is addressing the problem."}
{"original": "trump's re-election campaign was quick to criticize biden's moves on monday, with campaign spokesman tim murtaugh tweeting that the democratic contender is saying he'd be quicker to respond to a pandemic, but it took him a week to set up a tv camera in his house. trump's team also highlighted a clip from the address that they said showed biden losing his train of thought during the speech and signaling to his staff."}
{"original": "in the battle to become the democratic party's presidential nominee, biden has 1,169 delegates vs. 860 for sen. bernie sanders of vermont, according to an nbc news tracker. the sanders campaign, which is facing pressure to end, held a virtual town hall on sunday night that featured the senator and three prominent congresswomen who support his white house bid — alexandria ocasio-cortez, ilhan omar and rashida tlaib."}
{"original": "before his webcast, biden sent a letter on monday morning to the trump administration and a number of state attorneys general asking them to drop their long-running lawsuit against obamacare. the letter noted that monday marked the 10th anniversary of former president barack obama signing the affordable care act into law, as it said that no american should have the added worry right now that you are in court trying to take away their health care."}
{"original": "this article was first published in may and has been updated with new hsa contribution limits for 2020 and other numbers."}
{"original": "put in some extra time when you next select your health insurance plan, and you may find you can pay much lower premiums while also reducing your health-care costs for the rest of your life."}
{"original": "whether you have health insurance through your employer or purchase coverage through an exchange set up through the affordable care act of 2010, the combination of a lower-cost, high-deductible health insurance and a health savings account may provide great advantages. you save on taxes immediately, the money can be invested for decades, and — unlike with an ira or 401(k) account — you may never have to pay taxes on any of it."}
{"original": "health savings accounts are different from flexible spending accounts"}
{"original": "people often refuse to consider opening a health savings account because they believe it is a flexible spending account. the two are very different."}
{"original": "a flexible spending account, or fsa, is offered through your employer's health insurance and allows you to set aside up to $2,700 in pretax money (the internal revenue service can raise the limit each year). that money must to be used for eligible out-of-pocket health-care expenses for you and your family that tax year or it is lost, except for $500 that the irs lets you carry over to the next year. so the fsa can be useful if you have a good idea how high your out-of-pocket expenses will be, and if you don't contribute too much."}
{"original": "read: how to make the most of your hsa — for now, and the future"}
{"original": "a health savings account (hsa) works differently. first, you're only eligible if you have a high-deductible insurance plan. second, you can shelter much more money from taxes. up to $3,550 (for an individual) or $7,100 (for a family) in pretax money is withheld by your employer (or set aside by you, especially if you buy your own health insurance) and placed in an hsa each year. (those are the 2020 limits. again, the amounts can change every year.)"}
{"original": "like the fsa, you can use money in the hsa to pay for out-of-pocket health-care expenses tax-free. but the hsa doesn't have a use it or lose it feature."}
{"original": "the beauty of this is that an hsa can work as another way to save money for retirement, especially health-care expenses in retirement. and because you can invest and let the money build up over the years, you can capitalize on the magic of compounding. that $3,550 or $7,100 you set aside this year could double in nine years if you earn a 8.9% average return — which has been the average compounded annual growth rate for the s&p 500 index spx, -0.16% over the past 15 years, according to factset."}
{"original": "of course, this assumes you have the ability to pay for today's out-of-pocket expenses with other funds."}
{"original": "an opportunity to increase tax-deferred savings may be especially important if you are self-employed or if no employer-sponsored retirement account is available to you. federal law allows a person with a 401(k) or similar employer-sponsored retirement account to put away up to $19,000 in pretax dollars (plus another $6,000 if you are 50 or older) each year. but the limit for individual retirement account (ira) contributions is only $6,000, plus another $1,000 if you are 50 or older. (those are the 2019 limits. the 2020 limits are expected to be announced in november.)"}
{"original": "if you buy your own insurance through an exchange, you might find a high-deductible health plan, known as an hdhp, much more affordable than a low-deductible plan. of course, the same might be true for health insurance arranged through an employer."}
{"original": "david mendels, director of planning with creative financial concepts in new york, said that for people buying an hdhp through an exchange, an hsa is an absolute no-brainer. you are going to get the tax deduction, you are still going to get the money, and you can get it out tax-free."}
{"original": "there's also the potential for free cash from your employer. many match contributions into an hsa up to a certain limit. in its year-end hsa research report, devenir (which provides investment services to hsa administrators) estimated that the average employer contribution to an hsa increased to $839 in 2018 from $604 in 2017."}
{"original": "here's how you avoid taxes when you take out the money"}
{"original": "once you are 65, you can withdraw money from your hsa for any purpose, rather than just to cover health costs. if you spend it on qualified health-related expenses, the withdrawal is tax-free, as it is at any age. if you take money out for another reason, you will have to pay income taxes."}
{"original": "you might even reimburse yourself, tax-free, for qualified medical expenses you had paid for out-of-pocket in earlier years. not tapping your hsa for out-of-pocket expenses now means you can enjoy the benefit of tax-deferred growth longer while still claiming the benefits of tax-free health-related spending."}
{"original": "unlike an ira or 401(k) account, there is no required minimum distribution from an hsa at age 70 1/2. considering how likely it is for you to have high medical expenses later in life, it is quite likely that some or all of the hsa money will never be taxed."}
{"original": "to participate in an hsa, you need to be enrolled in a high-deductible health plan, which means the annual deductible needs to be $1,400 for an individual and $2,800 for a family. the hdhp's annual out-of-pocket maximum cannot exceed $6,900 for an individual or $13,800 for a family. (those are the 2020 numbers)."}
{"original": "the higher deductibles and higher potential out-of-pocket maximum figures may be a little scary. however, this is where a potential opportunity lies."}
{"original": "here are questions you should answer as part of your hsa decision-making process:"}
{"original": "• how much would you save in premiums if you participated in a high-deductible health insurance plan instead of a more expensive plan with lower deductibles?"}
{"original": "• would this savings from lower premiums exceed the amount of the additional deductible?"}
{"original": "• if you add in your employer's contribution (if any) to an hsa, would that plus your premium savings exceed the additional deductible?"}
{"original": "• how much higher would the maximum potential out-of pocket potential expense be with the high-deductible health insurance plan than with the low-deductible plan?"}
{"original": "• finally, you need to think about your particular circumstances. do you or members of your family have serious ongoing medical conditions that might make the low-deductible plan the best one for you?"}
{"original": "mendels said it may also be important to think about treatments or doctors that may not be covered by your insurance. there is a much broader range of expenses you can cover with the hsa than would be covered by virtually any medical plan, he said. one example he named was a new jersey resident who has a doctor in new york not covered by her insurance plan."}
{"original": "once you answer these questions, you can decide for or against a hdcp/hsa combination."}
{"original": "if you are buying health insurance through an exchange, your decision points are pretty much the same, except that there is no employer contribution to the hsa."}
{"original": "ken roberts, an investment adviser with iwc asset management in carmel, calif., said that some people are reluctant to consider an hsa because they take a very simple approach: they want the lower deductible."}
{"original": "but, he added, i like the hsa because if you don't need it, it's still savings that didn't go to the insurance company. that gives you an edge."}
{"original": "dean mason, ceo of healthsavings administrators, prefers to call a high-deductible health plan a low-premium plan."}
{"original": "mason, a former ceo of unitedhealth group's unh, +0.20% optum health bank (a health savings account administrator), said many employers do a bad job explaining how much is coming out of your paycheck."}
{"original": "what you find in the low premium plan is that the savings you accrue on the premium tend to fully cover your out-of-pocket risk, he said. this is, of course, more likely if your employer matches some of your hsa contribution."}
{"original": "healthsavings administrators is based in richmond, va., has about $818 million in assets under management and runs hsa plans for employers and individuals. the company is held by bluffpoint associates, a private-equity firm in westport, conn."}
{"original": "once you decide on an hsa"}
{"original": "if you have an hsa through your employer, your contributions will probably be made with pretax dollars withheld from your pay, hopefully with a matching contribution from the employer. you can also choose to fund an hsa outside of work. this may be a good option if there is no matching contribution available or if you find your employer's hsa plan too expensive or that its investment offerings too limited."}
{"original": "if you qualify for an hsa when buying your own health insurance through an exchange, you will need to go to an hsa administrator on your own to make contributions."}
{"original": "on the most elementary level, just like with your 401(k), if you are going to participate, before you do, take a look at what the expenses are. a particular hsa may be so expensive that it is not worth doing, mendels said."}
{"original": "not only do you need to know about an hsa's administrative expenses, you need to know what investments, if any, will be available."}
{"original": "eric remjeske, co-founder and president of devenir, pointed to hsasearch, a website run by his company, where you can compare hsas' administrative expenses and investment choices. if you click all hsa providers on the top left, you can see that scores of providers have no administrative fees, but the majority also have no investment options available. this means you would be following a fsa-like save and spend model, possibly wasting some of the benefits of your hsa. the site has various other tools you can use to compare hsas if you are looking for your own provider."}
{"original": "if you enroll in an hsa through your employer, the plan administrator may place your money in a money-market fund (earning a very low interest rate) by default. one reason for this is that you may be required to build up a minimum cash balance before investing the rest of the money in mutual funds for long-term growth. this makes sense, because even if you are using your hsa a long-term investing vehicle, you may need to tap some of the money to cover out-of-pocket medical expenses at any time."}
{"original": "but the default choice means many participants will never change the investment selections for their hsas. this can lead to a tremendous loss of potential investment returns over the years, or decades. a phone call to your plan administrator to discuss your investment options, and their costs, is time well spent."}
{"original": "in its year-end industry report, devenir estimated that only 19% of hsa balances were invested as of dec. 31, with the rest sitting in cash. devenir also estimated that the number of hsa accounts increased by 13% during 2018 to 25 million and that total assets in hsa accounts grew by 19% to $53.8 billion."}
{"original": "hsa investment selections and fund fees"}
{"original": "mason touted the benefits of investment-focused hsas that allow participants first-dollar investing, rather than requiring a cash balance to be accumulated first. at healthsavings administrators, participants have no minimum balances and can invest in institutional-class funds right away, max out their contributions, and start accumulating assets, he said."}
{"original": "those initial dollars make a difference when treating hsas like the long-term investment vehicle they are, he added."}
{"original": "the emphasis on institutional share classes is an important one for investors seeking those managers who stock-pick, or what's called active management. note that active managers on average struggle to outperform funds that passively track an index, especially over multiple years."}
{"original": "your obvious path to the lowest expenses is to select broad index funds with low expense ratios. but if you want to diversify with active management, an institutional share class can have much lower expenses than a share class normally offered to individuals."}
{"original": "in addition to offering lower-cost institutional shares for actively managed funds, healthsavings administrators also offers some of the lowest-cost index funds through vanguard, including the vanguard 500 index fund's admiral shares vfiax, -0.16% , which have annual expenses of only four basis points."}

{"original": "the centers for medicare & medicaid services (cms) last week issued a rule that, among other things, adjusts the annual open enrollment period the affordable care act (aca), also known as obamacare, for 2018 to more closely align with medicare and the private market."}
{"original": "according to a release, the next open aca enrollment period will start on nov. 1, 2017, and run through dec. 15, 2017 and is designed, officials said, to encourage individuals to enroll in coverage prior to the beginning of the year. the new enrollment period in effect cuts last year's aca open enrollment period — which ran from nov. 1, 2016 to jan. 31, 2017 — in half."}
{"original": "of note, every year, medicare's open enrollment period is oct. 15 to dec. 7."}
{"original": "now some experts say the changes to aca's open enrollment period are politically motivated."}
{"original": "it could be a move to decrease the number of enrollees, said katy votava, the president of goodcare.com. the current administration has been quite up front about its desire to eliminate the aca."}
{"original": "then again, this shortening of the aca open enrollment period merely accelerates what was going to happen anyway in 2019. before these newest rules, the 2019 annual enrollment period was planned to contract in the same way, said votava. while some may justify the 2018 change in the category of 'it was going to change anyway.' it will be interesting to what the plan offerings are around the country this fall."}
{"original": "here's the real reason why u.s. health care is so expensive"}
{"original": "but no matter the motivation, experts say those who want to enroll in an aca insurance plan for 2018 should take steps now to avoid potential chaos later. i anticipate that this coming annual enrollment period will be more chaotic than last year's and that cutting the time frame in half will make things extra confusing for consumers, said votava."}
{"original": "for instance, she noted, that one added element of confusion between the aca and medicare this fall is that these enrollment periods are similar but not the same. medicare still starts oct. 15 and ends dec. 7. aca begins nov. 1 and now and dec. 15. so, for example, a person for medicare cannot apply on december 8 while an aca candidate still can, she noted."}
{"original": "for his part, mitchell clark, director of digital strategy and communications at the medicare rights center, offered similar advice: people looking to make changes to their marketplace coverage should start exploring their options earlier and make decisions sooner. learn more here."}
{"original": "and others warn that those who delay enrolling in aca later this year will face financial penalties. procrastinators will be hurt, said jae oh, managing principal of gh2 benefits and author of maximize your medicare."}
{"original": "oh also noted that non-payers of aca premiums will be hurt by the new rule. for instance, the final rule, according to the release: promotes personal responsibility by allowing issuers to require individuals to pay back past due premiums before enrolling into a plan with the same issuer the following year. this is intended to address gaming and encourage individuals to maintain continuous coverage throughout the year, which will have a positive impact on the risk pool."}
{"original": "know what you have and what you need"}
{"original": "whether you are in the marketplace or in medicare, clark also says you should be aware of what coverage you have and where you should make changes."}
{"original": "giving that the shopping and enrollment season will be cut in half this year it is ever more important to get organized ahead of time for the key things that folks need in a plan, said votava, who recommends putting together two lists. one, with the names and contact information for their doctors and health care providers, she said. the second with accurate medication names and dosage information."}
{"original": "start with your doctors. ask them what plans they will participate in, votava said. then look at those plans to see if and how much of your medications are covered. i recommend that people get organized early in the fall so that they can hit the ground running nov. 1."}
{"original": "are you eligible for special enrollment period?"}
{"original": "people will have to prove they are eligible for a special enrollment period in the marketplace, said clark. marketplace enrollees should take steps to manage all documentation related to their health coverage, he said. if they are eligible for a special enrollment period to enroll in a marketplace plan, they will need to know what proof is necessary to receive the special enrollment period and through what process they must go in order to enroll."}
{"original": "potentially higher cost sharing / narrower networks"}
{"original": "when weighing enrollment decisions, clark says it's important to read the fine print carefully while searching for aca plans. if you have specific questions, you can ask the plan directly, he says. make sure you record the name of the person you speak to at the plan as well as the time and date of the conversation."}
{"original": "as for medicare beneficiaries, tricia neuman, a senior vice president and director of the program on medicare policy at the kaiser family foundation, said her advice is the same as every year when it comes to medicare's open enrollment period."}
{"original": "as the medicare open enrollment period approaches, it is a good idea for seniors to review their options carefully, taking into account what matters most to them, whether choosing between medicare advantage and traditional medicare, or among the various medicare advantage or stand-alone part d plans offered in their area, she said."}
{"original": "neuman also noted that medicare advantage plans vary in a number of ways — not just premiums which are relatively easy to compare, but also in cost-sharing for different services, extra benefits, prescription drug coverage and in provider networks. prescription drug plans also vary, she said. seniors can sometimes save a bundle, and avoid unpleasant surprises, by comparing plans."}
{"original": "consider funding an hsa if able"}
{"original": "given the uncertainty, the one thing oh recommends to everyone who has a health savings account (hsa) is this: increase deposits as much as possible."}
{"original": "his rationale: either aca stays, and premiums increase due to the dying of the risk corridor, or aca doesn't stay, in which case, you'll need a lot more pre-tax dollars to be saved to pay for high-risk pool cost-sharing if you have a pre-existing condition."}

{"original": "think about the 2020 election, and what consumers would think in the event that apple confronts a holiday season this fall with tariffs in place."}
{"original": "think about the fact that trump is currently sitting on a -7 approval v. disapproval margin, according to real clear politics. several polls are much worse, and the only one materially better is rasmussen reports, rated c+ by fivethirtyeight for its inaccuracy, partisan lean, and methodological problems. rasmussen missed the generic party vote in last year's congressional races by nine points — in guess-which-party's favor?"}
{"original": "think about the fact that china's leadership, trump's negotiating opponent, faces no election, ever, and only indirect popular pressure."}
{"original": "think about the fact that the one edge washington politicos believe trump has in this fight is the perception, incomprehensible to most but persistent, that trump is an economic wizard. somehow, trump actually has a 54-41 approval margin on the economy. that swaying motion you feel is everyone who knows any economics shaking their heads."}
{"original": "finally, think about the fact that the standard & poor's 500 spx, -0.16% fell 2.4% monday and is down 5% since the president began his latest trade fight. and that the selloff is likely to persist as long as the tweets and tariffs do — because back to 2016 the book on trump has been that his tax-cut plans might stimulate the economy briefly, but his trade policies would more than undo the damage if implemented."}
{"original": "curiously, trump seems to become less popular when he actually tries to do his job and behaves less like the reality-show host he long was. his approval rating plunged during the 2017 fight over repealing obamacare, for example, and even dipped during the talks that led to the tax cut that december."}
{"original": "those two bills didn't cost many people real money, especially not in trump's own voting coalition. but an estimated 86 million americans carry iphones, which they replace often at prices up to $1,000. and trump responds to signals from the stock market — he's backed down from trade positions before due to market pressure, including reaching a face-saving deal with mexico and canada that hasn't been approved by congress."}
{"original": "do the math. the tariffs will be visible — and visibly paid by americans, eroding trump's already-controversial middle-class-tax-cut brand. the 0.5 percentage-point erosion in u.s. growth that oxford economics predicts if tariffs get fully implemented will cut into trump's economic-approval rating, the only political card he's got to reach beyond his base."}

(project syndicate) — president donald trump claims credit for the greatest ever economy, and constantly contrasts economic conditions today with the historically weak recovery under president barack obama. with growth this year over 3%, unemployment at 3.7%, and more job openings than unemployed people, the economy has greatly improved on trump's watch. the macroeconomic indicators are the best in decades."}
{"original": " although president donald trump is prone to hyperbole, he is not wrong to tout the strength of the u.s. economy on his watch. but while trump's regulatory and tax policies have been good for growth, his efforts to attach his name to the economy all but ensure that he will bear the blame in the event of a downturn. "}
{"original": "meanwhile, obama, too, claims credit for the strong economy, arguing that his policies prevented a far worse downturn following the 2008 financial crisis. neither trump's hyperbole nor obama's selective memory comes as a surprise."}
{"original": "american presidents, like star athletes in team sports, get both too much credit and too much blame from voters and historians for what happens on their watch. most presidential policies must be enacted by congress, which often alters or blocks them."}
{"original": "and many other factors are constantly at work, not least the federal reserve's monetary policy. so far, the fed's policies under its new chairman, jerome powell, have been spot on; but that hasn't stopped trump from publicly complaining that interest rates are rising too rapidly. while unusual, trump's griping pales in comparison to president jimmy carter's nationally televised admonition to the fed to lower interest rates in the midst of the raging inflation of the late 1970s."}
{"original": "of equal importance are economic and political events in the rest of the world, technological and demographic forces at home and abroad, and the policies of previous administrations, which can expand or constrain a sitting president's options."}
{"original": "for example, president ronald reagan inherited double-digit inflation from carter. president george h.w. bush inherited a latin american debt crisis and a savings-and-loan disaster that had been brewing for more than a decade. to their credit, reagan and bush both saw the problems before them and supported successful responses, despite the predictable political costs of the downturn that followed each episode."}
{"original": "for his part, president bill clinton inherited low inflation and a revived financial system. after the republicans captured both houses of congress in the 1994 midterm election, clinton worked with them to balance the budget and reform welfare."}
{"original": "then came president george w. bush, who inherited a legacy of insufficient national-defense spending. early in his presidency, the attacks of sept. 11, 2001, laid bare the need to rebuild the military and improve homeland security."}
{"original": "finally, obama inherited the financial crisis and the subsequent great recession. but he then presided over the weakest economic recovery since world war ii, owing partly to his attempts to re-engineer vast swaths of the economy."}
{"original": "these american examples are tame compared to others in recent history. in central and eastern europe, post-cold war reformers had to manage the transition from a decrepit centrally planned socialist system to a free-market economy. whoever eventually succeeds president nicolás maduro in venezuela will inherit the unmitigated economic and social disaster that is chavism."}
{"original": "returning to 2018, the trump administration's rollback of obama-era regulations and enactment of corporate-tax reform have both helped to promote growth. trump's trade policy, however, is risky. if it proves successful in opening up china's market and curtailing technology transfers from u.s. companies, then it will have been constructive. but if it precipitates a long-term trade war, it could do serious damage."}
{"original": "trump often takes presidential exaggeration to new heights with his common refrain that, nobody's ever seen anything like this. but this is not to say that past presidents have eschewed such hyperbole. for example, after repeatedly invoking shovel-ready projects to pass his february 2009 stimulus bill, obama later admitted there's no such thing as a shovel-ready project. and his pledge that obamacare guaranteed that patients could keep their health plan and doctor received four pinocchios, the worst possible rating, from the washington post fact checker."}
{"original": "obama has also claimed that nobody knew how bad the great recession was going to be. and yet, immediately after his election, i pointed out that, this recession is the real thing, far worse than the two brief, mild recessions of the last quarter-century. later, obama expressed regrets that he had not communicated earlier just how bad the recession would be and that if he had, perhaps he could have made the stimulus bill much larger. but if nobody knew how bad it was going to be, how could it have been communicated earlier?"}
{"original": "obama seems to have conveniently forgotten that his first-term budgets repeatedly estimated growth above 4% for the next several years. that is double what was actually achieved. clearly, his advisers either didn't have an accurate read on the economy, or they were wildly optimistic about the efficacy of his policies. since then, they have fallen back on a discredited theory of secular stagnation to explain the tepid recovery."}
{"original": "as a result, when trump came to office, he inherited a national debt that had doubled on obama's watch, rapidly rising interest rates, and unfunded social security and medicare costs. under these conditions, trump's biggest and boldest policy proposals will likely run into budgetary constraints. he has already ruled out any changes to social security. his and congressional republicans' attempts to replace the affordable care act (obamacare), and to curtail the growth in medicaid spending, have been unsuccessful. and a temporary increase in defense spending will revert back to insufficient levels after this fiscal year."}
{"original": "although the tax package that trump signed into law last december front-loaded tax cuts and is now helping the economy to grow, government revenue has yet to respond much to that growth. unfortunately, growing deficits mean it will be hard to make the legislation's personal tax cuts permanent any time soon."}
{"original": "in the event of a downturn, voters will be quicker to blame trump than they have been in giving him credit for today's boom. given all of the president's efforts to attach his name to the current economy, it will not be easy for him to shift the blame to the fed, democrats, or anyone else."}

{"original": "i usually ask them what they do about retirement savings plans and tax minimization. and i've been stunned by the results."}
{"original": "what's the difference between a 401(k) and a roth 401(k)?"}
{"original": "not once in many conversations has a single driver ever even heard of a solo 401(k) plan. none, in fact, had ever heard of a sep or self-employed ira. not one."}
{"original": "so they're paying way too much in taxes to uncle sam. and they're leaving money on the table. big time."}
{"original": "and then a research paper comes across my desk from the center for retirement research at boston college, pointing out that large numbers of workers in late middle age are working in these types of gig jobs, and because they don't have company plans many of them aren't saving for their golden years."}
{"original": "it is, naturally, very bad news."}
{"original": "your 50s and early 60s are a key time to save for your retirement, notes researcher matthew rutledge of crr. the children have flown the coop. college may even be paid off."}
{"original": "perhaps most important, it's also the time when so many wake up and realize they are way short of their retirement savings goals. this 15-year period is the last chance to try to catch up and fill in the missing gaps."}
{"original": "as a friend recently pointed out to me, there's now a giant cognitive dissonance in the american jobs market. we're being told more that entitlements are unaffordable and we're going to have to work till we're 70 or older. on the other hand, workers get laid off at 50 because, well, the idea that ageism is illegal is a giant joke. the law is hardly ever enforced. baby boomers (mostly now in their 60s or older) are handing over the reins to their millennial children (40 and younger). gen x, as usual, is just being x-ed out."}
{"original": "if everyone is going to be laid off at 50, but required to work until 70, an obvious mathematical problem arises."}
{"original": "i guess we could just freeze people in carbonite for 20 years. otherwise, they're going to be driving ubers, selling homemade tchotchkes on etsy etsy, -3.25% , and doing other self-employed gig jobs."}
{"original": "at which point, their best financial friends are going to be the self-employed or sep ira, and the solo or self-employed 401(k). but most of them, apparently, don't know these exist."}
{"original": "solo 401(k)s definitely should be on a gig worker's radar, says robin giles, a financial adviser at apex wealth management in katy, texas. i feel the solo 401(k) (especially) offers huge benefits, but is drastically underutilized by the self-employed."}
{"original": "[a]gree absolutely, says mari adam, founder and head of adam financial associates in boca raton, fla. we help clients open many small business accounts like simples [another type of self-employed savings vehicle], solo 401ks, and seps. very few know about them. the solo 401(k) is a fantastic account that should be used more extensively."}
{"original": "although sep iras may be easier to establish, freelancers should consider the feasibility of opening a solo 401(k). nearly all financial institutions offer simple, prototype solo 401(k) plans that offer more features and potentially more contributions compared with a sep ira."}
{"original": "when i was a freelance writer the solo 401(k) was by best financial friend. my tax rate collapsed. i ended up with more money in my pocket at the end of the year even from lower gross revenues."}
{"original": "the reason? i was able to shunt a chunk of money from my income straight into a tax-deferred 401(k) retirement account. do not pass uncle sam, do not pay $200."}
{"original": "then i was also able to shunt another 20% of my income, after business expenses, into the same account. that's because with a solo 401(k) you're able to contribute twice, once as the employee and once as the employer. (incidentally the irs says technically you can save 25%, but the calculations are complex, and financial planners say the real effective rate is 20%)."}
{"original": "for 2020 the 401(k) employee contribution limits are $19,500 a year. plus another $6,500 a year if you're 50 or older."}
{"original": "setting the plan up consisted of filling out one sheet of paper at a finance firm. this is not complicated."}
{"original": "less ambitious is the sep ira, which just lets you sock away the 25% as an employer. (you can have a sep ira even if you are working a side gig, and you have access to a company 401(k) at a main job.)"}
{"original": "sep iras and solo 401(k)s are great options for self-employed people and should be considered by anyone wishing to save for their future, says howard pressman, a financial planner with egan, berger & wiener in vienna, virginia. the sep ira is the easier of the two to set up and administer, he says, but has lower contribution limits. the solo 401(k) is a bit more cumbersome to open and administer, but allows much greater contributions, he adds."}
{"original": "jake northrup, a financial planner in bristol, rhode island, says he tends to recommend the solo 401(k). not only can you contribute more, he says, but there's an extra, hidden advantage: some institutions let you make your employee contributions — $19,500, or $26,000 if you're over 50—on a posttax or roth basis if you want."}
{"original": "we can wring our hands plenty about the absence or shortage of company benefits for the self-employed. but it's also worth pointing out that there are some great advantages to being self-employed too, including some tax maneuvers not open to the company schmuck. the problem is many don't know about them."}
{"original": "meanwhile, as the paper from crr notes, many of these workers are also struggling to get health insurance as well as to save for retirement. and that's a less easy problem to tackle on your own."}
{"original": "[o]lder workers ages 50 to 64…are both the largest cohort of workers in nontraditional jobs, and probably the group most in need of consistent health coverage and the ability to save for their imminent retirement, notes rutledge."}
{"original": "stunningly, his research finds about one-third of older workers in nontraditional jobs are uninsured, meaning they lack health insurance. lacking health insurance may be foolish in your 20s. in your 50s it is terrifying. most of those who do have health insurance get it through their spouse or from a past employer."}
{"original": "what of the rest? thank heavens for the much-maligned obamacare or aca, notes the crr report. it was weird that this was denounced at the time as so much communism, when one of the biggest beneficiaries was…the self-employed. obamacare made it much, much easier for individuals to buy their own health insurance plan, as well as paying states to expand medicaid. both, says rutledge, have been paying off for older workers in nontraditional jobs."}
{"original": "the percentage of these people buying their own private health insurance jumped from around 15% in the period 2002 to 2012, before the health care law really kicked in, to 30% by 2016. yes, really. it doubled. while the costs of health insurance continued to rise. meanwhile public health insurance coverage for these workers, mainly from medicaid, also doubled, from 8.1% before 2012 to 16.4% in 2016."}
{"original": "if the economy moves more toward gig work, portfolio careers, and self employment, as some believe, more workers are going to be relying on these public benefits and fewer on the traditional, old-fashioned company benefits from the old-fashioned company."}

(from march 2009's bottom, the market rose 82% through this date in 2011.)"}
{"original": "here's how trump is doing by some major indicators to judge the state of workers, and presidents:"}
{"original": "the 3.7% unemployment rate is the lowest since 1969. as trump notes, unemployment among african-americans, at 6%, is the lowest reading among data that go back to 1972. but trump deserves little credit, because unemployment had dropped from 10%, and nearly 17% among blacks, to 4.7% and 7.7% by the time he was sworn in."}
{"original": "grade: b+. you can't fault the level, but the effort lacks the originality of an a paper. it simply sustained most of what was already happening."}
{"original": "job growth under trump is slower than barack obama's second-term average of 208,000 a month. but this isn't bad. in mature expansions, job growth should slow as the economy nears full employment. in fact, i predicted in early 2016 that it would slow to about 160,000 a month, so 183,500 isn't disappointing."}
{"original": "grade: b. this is the opposite of trump's grade for the unemployment rate. there, he lost an a because he didn't contribute much to the good result. here, he's spared a c+ because mediocre growth has an extenuating explanation."}
{"original": "beyond brave talk about work's meaning, its real purpose is to bring in cash. something has to put labor day burgers on the grill, and few can count on trump's $400 million in tax-curated gifts and inheritances from dad to do the job."}
{"original": "real median household income has risen about $7,000 under trump to $65,000-plus, extending a run that began in 2014 after a seven-year decline, according to sentier research. it's actually rising faster than in late obama times, though the sharp upward movement began in 2014."}
{"original": "at the heart of trump's america-in-decline story was his boast that only he could fix manufacturing, which lost 4.5 million jobs under president george w. bush and another 1.1 million in obama's first year."}
{"original": "by raw employment numbers, trump beats obama's second term but trails the 2010-13 recovery in manufacturing. his 496,000 new manufacturing jobs compares to 385,000 in obama's second term and 530,000 from the february 2010 low to january 2013. hourly pay for line workers is up 8%, too, matching obama's second term."}
{"original": "grade: b/incomplete. so far, trump hasn't made much of a difference. but his trade policies have recently hammered manufacturers' profits, notably at general motors gm, -1.42% , and how much negativity trickles down to workers will play out between now and the election."}

{"original": "opinion:this is a health-care plan both republicans and democrats should agree on"}
{"original": "the minimum wage of $7.25 per hour is nearly 40% lower than in the 1970s, adjusted for inflation — and trump has done nothing to lift it. boosting it to $15, as most democratic politicians want to do, would raise pay for 33 million americans, according to the liberal economic policy institute. trump is also moving to strip unions representing federal workers of bargaining power, while appointing management-side labor lawyer eugene scalia as secretary of labor."}

{"original": "here's what you need to know:"}
{"original": "opening up an hsa involves taking more responsibility for your own health-care costs instead of relying on an employer or the government. the payoff involves some nice tax advantages."}
{"original": "hsas are gaining ground at a rapid clip. hsas held an estimated $53.8 billion in assets as of dec. 31, 2018, up 19% from a year earlier, according to the most recent survey conducted by devenir, an hsa investment provider. devenir expects those assets to reach $75 billion by the end of 2020. the number of accounts rose 13% to 25 million from a year earlier, and devenir expects 30 million accounts by the end of 2020. back in 2010, the employee benefit research institute reported that there were 5.7 million hsas with account balances totaling $7.7 billion."}
{"original": "under the affordable care act (obamacare), health-insurance plans are categorized as bronze, silver, gold, or platinum. bronze plans have the highest deductibles and least-generous coverage and are, therefore, the most affordable. platinum plans have no deductibles and cover much more, but they are much more expensive. in many cases, the aca has led to big premium increases even for those who prefer less-generous plans. however, having a not-very-generous plan might make you eligible to open up and contribute to an hsa with the resulting tax advantages."}
{"original": "for the 2018 tax year, you can make a deductible hsa contribution of up to $3,450 if you had qualifying self-only coverage last year or up to $6,900 if you had family coverage (anything other than self-only coverage). if you were age 55 or older as of dec. 31, 2018, the maximum contribution is increased by $1,000. and you have until april 15 to open an hsa and make a contribution that you can deduct on last year's return. who knew?"}
{"original": "for 2019, the maximum contributions are $3,500 and $7,000, respectively. if you will be age 55 or older as of dec. 31, 2019, the maximum contribution goes up by $1,000."}
{"original": "you must have a qualifying high-deductible health insurance policy and no other general health coverage to be eligible for the hsa contribution privilege. for 2018, a high-deductible policy is defined as one with a deductible of at least $1,350 for self-only coverage or $2,700 for family coverage. for 2019, the minimum deductibles are the same."}
{"original": "for 2018, qualifying policies can have out-of-pocket maximums of up to $6,650 for self-only coverage or $13,300 for family coverage. for 2019, the out-of-pocket maximums are $6,750 and $13,500, respectively."}
{"original": "if you are eligible to make an hsa contribution for the tax year in question, the deadline is april 15 of the following year (adjusted for weekends and holidays) to open an account and make a deductible contribution for the earlier year. so, as stated earlier, there's still time for an eligible individual to open an account and make a deductible contribution for the 2018 tax year, because the deadline for doing so is april 15, 2019."}
{"original": "more good news: the write-off for hsa contributions is an above-the-line deduction. that means you can take the write-off even if you don't itemize. still, more good news: the hsa contribution privilege is not lost just because you happen to be a high earner. if you are covered by qualifying high-deductible health insurance, you can make contributions and collect the resulting tax savings. even billionaires can do it. however, once you reach medicare eligibility age (generally age 65), you can't make any more hsa contributions."}
{"original": "key point: sole proprietors, partners, llc members, and s corporation shareholder-employees are generally allowed to claim separate above-the-line deductions for 100% of their health insurance premiums, including premiums for high-deductible coverage that makes you eligible for hsa contributions"}
{"original": "example: for all of 2019, you have qualifying family health insurance coverage with a $3,000 deductible. you will be 55 as of dec. 31, 2019, so you can contribute up to $8,000 to an hsa for the 2019 tax year (the normal $7,000 limitation, plus $1,000 extra due to your age). if your spouse is also 55 or older as of dec. 31, 2019 and is covered by the high-deductible family policy, another $1,000 can be contributed due to your spouse's age (total of $9,000). this assumes that your spouse has not reach medicare eligibility age."}
{"original": "hsa distributions used to pay qualified medical expenses of the hsa owner, spouse, or dependents are free of federal income tax. however, you can build up a balance in the account if contributions, plus earnings exceed withdrawals for medical expenses. any earnings are federal income tax-free. so if you are in very good health and take minimal or no distributions, you can use an hsa to build up a substantial medical expense reserve fund over the years while earning tax-free income all along the way."}
{"original": "if you still have an hsa balance after reaching medicare eligibility age (generally age 65), you can drain the account for any reason without a tax penalty. if you don't use the withdrawal to cover qualified medical expenses, you will owe federal income tax (and maybe state income tax), but the 20% tax penalty that generally applies to withdrawals not used for medical expenses will not apply. there is no tax penalty on withdrawals after disability or death."}
{"original": "alternatively, you can use your hsa balance to pay uninsured medical expenses incurred after reaching medicare eligibility age. if your hsa still has a balance when you depart this cruel orb, your surviving spouse can take over the account tax-free and treat it as his or her own hsa — provided your spouse is named as the account beneficiary. in other cases, the date-of-death balance of the hsa must generally be included in taxable income on that date by the person who inherits the account."}
{"original": "warning: hsa funds cannot be used to make tax-free reimbursements for medical expenses that were incurred before the account was opened."}
{"original": "an hsa can work a lot like an ira if you maintain good health and avoid big medical bills. even if you have to drain the account every year to pay for uninsured health-care costs, the hsa arrangement allows you to pay those expenses with pretax dollars. so if you are eligible for an hsa, starting one up and making annual deductible contributions might be a no-brainer. and you might even be able to claim a valuable write-off on your 2018 return even though 2018 is in your rearview mirror."}
{"original": "in some important ways, hsas are similar to iras. both have the same contribution deadlines, both need an account custodian or trustee, and both can theoretically offer the same investment options (stocks, mutual funds, bonds, cds, and so forth). that said, some hsa trustees may limit your investment choices to very conservative options, which is not necessarily a bad thing."}
{"original": "some health insurance companies and brokerage firms have pre-arranged deals with hsa trustees. for example, vanguard customers can move funds into hsas operated by a company called healthsavings administrators."}

{"original": "under the dreaded kiddie tax rules, part of young person's investment income can be taxed at the federal rates for trusts and estates, which can quickly rise to 37% or 20% for long-term capital gains and dividends (see below). compare those rates to the 10% or 12% rate that would typically apply to a young single taxpayer's ordinary income and short-term capital gains, or 0% for a young single taxpayer's long-term capital gains and dividends, in the absence of the kiddie tax rules."}
{"original": "even worse, the kiddie tax can bite younger taxpayers who are no longer really kids--potentially up until the year they turn age 24. however after the year a young person turns age 18, it can only bite if he or she is a student with at least five months of full-time school attendance during the year."}
{"original": "for 2019, the kiddie tax can only bite investment income in excess of the threshold amount of $2,200 (the threshold is adjusted for inflation every few years). investment income below the threshold is taxed at the young person's lower rates."}

(you're not required to take any withdrawals from any roth iras set up in your name.)"}
{"original": "please don't think you can simply ignore the required withdrawal rules without dire consequences. the irs can assess a penalty tax equal to 50% of the shortfall between the amount you should have withdrawn for the year and the amount you actually withdraw (if anything). that's one of the harshest penalties in our beloved internal revenue code."}
{"original": "the initial required withdrawal is for the year you turn 70½, but you can postpone taking that first one until as late as april 1 of the following year. the downside of choosing this option is that you must take two required withdrawals in that following year and pay the resulting double tax hit. for example, if you turn 70½ in 2019 and do not take your initial required withdrawal this year, you face a april 1, 2020 deadline for taking that initial withdrawal (that one is actually for the 2019 tax year). then you must take another required withdrawal (for the 2020 tax year) by no later than dec. 31, 2020. for each subsequent year, you must take an annual required withdrawal by december 31."}

{"original": "haven't subscribed yet to marketwatch's daily personal finance newsletter? sign up here."}
{"original": "over and over this fall, americans have told pollsters that one of their biggest concerns is the cost of health care. as premiums and deductibles continue to rise, out-of-pocket family costs continue to skyrocket as well, and all of the personal economic benefit that might have accrued thanks to the booming economy or the trump tax cuts vanishes as quickly and mysteriously as it appeared."}
{"original": "in the face of all of this, president trump's inability to repeal the affordable care act, or obamacare, stands out as one of the most glaring failures of his first two years in office. the president himself undoubtedly blames the late john mccain for this failure, but the fact of the matter is that the repeal attempt was half-hearted at best, offering no comprehensive roadmap for moving forward in a post-aca environment."}
{"original": "as many conservatives predicted way back in 2009 and 2010, in the heat of the obamacare debates, americans quickly became accustomed to the aca, and it now occupies the same position in political life as previously enacted entitlements. it is important to americans. they approve of it by a solid majority. and they would resent its repeal now, its manifest flaws notwithstanding. all of which leaves president trump and his fellow republicans in a tough spot."}
{"original": "if we assume that the democrats take control of the house next month – and that's an assumption that can change, but still appears more valid than not at this point – then we can also assume that the new house leadership will be excited to get to work on allaying their voters' concerns about the costs associated with health care. and president trump – a populist more than a conservative – will all but certainly see this popular discontent with the health care status quo as both a threat and an opportunity."}
{"original": "the problem that trump, democrats, and markets spx, -1.48% will face is that any of the potential, politically viable solutions both to american families' concerns and to the failures of the aca will cost money, a lot of money. and the bond markets are already in retreat, as federal spending continues to climb to unprecedented highs."}
{"original": "it is no coincidence that the start of the current uptick in interest rates began right about the time that the federal government announced (admitted?) that it added nearly $800 billion to the national debt last fiscal year. federal spending is at ridiculous non-recessional highs; politicians of both parties seem content just to spend more and more; and it was inevitable that the bond vigilantes would eventually have to do what the politicians wouldn't."}
{"original": "so, where does that leave us? where does that leave president trump and the presumably democratic house in the next congress? well, for one thing, this means that the democratic dream of universal care will be a non-starter, period. trump announced his vociferous opposition to such plans in a usa today op-ed last week. moreover, the democratic leadership – people like nancy pelosi and chuck schumer – have been around long enough to know that some fights are simply unwinnable and should therefore never be fought. once such fight would be against trump and the bond market tmubmusd10y, 1.696% over a program that could, in theory, double the national debt. it's. not. gonna. happen."}
{"original": "a second possibility would be something along the lines of medicare x, a proposal introduced last year by democratic senators michael bennet of colorado and tim kaine of virginia. medicare x would reincarnate the public option rejected during the aca debate, allowing people to buy into medicare and for it to compete for customers with private health plans."}
{"original": "a republican senate would (wisely, i think) reject such a plan out-of-hand. but donald trump – a populist who has already said that his re-election is the real election – might not be quite so eager to do so. as i've argued previously in these pages, trump just might be inclined to exercise his executive authority to triangulate his way to reelection. additionally, his public criticism last week was pointedly directed at plans that would eliminate private health insurance, which a medicare x-style plan might do in practice, but would not do in principle."}
{"original": "what could trump accomplish without the consent of congress? it's hard to say anything for sure. we can guess about the limits on his power, but since he has already reformed health care to some extent through executive action and since executive authority seems to have grown almost weekly over the course of the last three presidencies, there are no guaranteed limits at all."}

{"original": "the wall street journal editorial page declared that the most significant change brought by the first year of the trump presidency [has been] reining in and rolling back the regulatory state at a pace faster than even [that of] ronald reagan. this is a major reason for the acceleration of animal spirits and faster economic growth in the past year."}

{"original": "they all have a point: it's true that the trump administration has rolled back or blocked a number of significant regulations stemming from the obama era, and it aims to do more. the most effective thing may be simply to stop enforcing the rules already on the books, as trump's team has done at the consumer financial protection bureau."}
{"original": "how trump could spark a global trade war over steel"}
{"original": "yet cheerleaders and critics alike have overstated their cases. on the one hand it's just too early to see any economic impact from deregulation. and on the other hand the trump administration is finding that deregulating america isn't as easy as they thought it would be."}
{"original": "it turns out that the rigorous process that makes sure new regulations are well-grounded in the law and the science also requires that the process for repealing, rolling back or amending rules is just as rigorous and time-consuming."}
{"original": "and it's clear that the trump administration is very sloppy when it comes to rule making."}
{"original": "already, the courts have pushed back, most famously with the travel ban. and the labor department's political leadership reportedly censored the department's economic analysis of the proposed tip-pooling rule when it was clear the costs to workers would be in the billions. the environmental protection agency, meanwhile, cooked the books to ignore the benefits of the clean power plan and focus only on the costs, which the epa exaggerated."}
{"original": "the regulations that are in place are there largely because congress, the agencies and courts thought they were proper and reasonable. in fact, the benefits of reasonable regulations far outweigh the costs. the economy is stronger when it is well-regulated, as anyone who lost a job or a house in the great recession can tell you."}
{"original": "despite the white house photo opps, in the background, the regulatory machine is still functioning. the trump administration issued almost as many (3,222) rule documents in 2017 as the obama administration did in 2016 (3,449), and the pipeline of new rules is roughly the same as it was under obama, according to cary coglianese, a law professor and director of the university of pennsylvania's program on regulation."}
{"original": "the trump administration has repealed some major rules that were already in effect, such as net neutrality. and it's blocked others that were about to become effective, such as the environmental protection agency's clean power rules, the labor department's fiduciary rule for retirement savings and its overtime rules, and the occupational safety and health administration rules requiring companies to publicly report on workplace injuries."}
{"original": "contrary to the perception that they want to deregulate everything, the republicans running the government have also pushed for new rules, on the reasonable assumption that some regulations are needed (in their eyes) because they would make the economy more efficient, improve health and safety, or simply favor one industry or group that the regulators prefer over one they don't."}
{"original": "for instance, trump's travel ban on visitors from a few largely muslim countries was a major new regulation. likewise, the current push to restrict legal immigration would create significant new regulations (that would have a hugely detrimental impact on economic growth for decades, but which would make trump's base happy). new tariffs or trade restrictions would be new rules, as well."}
{"original": "some republicans want to tighten the rules for recipients of unemployment insurance, food stamps, disability and medicaid. the labor department has proposed a new rule that would allow restaurants and bars to steal the tips given to their employees, costing workers $5 billion a year, favoring profits over wages. the energy department tried to enact a rule that would have favored coal-fired energy generation plants over cleaner and cheaper fuels."}
{"original": "call it red tape for red states."}
{"original": "there's one more myth i want to demolish: the idea that trump's rollback of regulations was like a dam bursting to unleash the u.s. economy. where is the evidence for that? how did blocking a few rules that hadn't yet taken effect make the economy suddenly roar back to life?"}
{"original": "did the economy roar in 2017? not really. the economy under trump has been pretty much like the economy under obama. economic growth was a little faster in 2017 than in 2016, largely because business investment accelerated to take advantage of movement in energy prices."}
{"original": "if the surge in capital spending had been due to trump reversing obama's regulatory war on fossil fuels, then the price of energy should be falling, not rising, because of increased supply. this boom — if it is that — is being led by rising global and domestic demand, not by the supply of energy, which has been abundant, if underutilized."}

{"original": "the only thing that changed for the better in the past year was the perception that washington was suddenly business friendly. animal spirits can have a big impact on the economy, and can even be self-reinforcing. but if there's nothing concrete to support that optimism, then it's just a sugar high."}

{"original": "breaking news: the latest developments in campaign 2020"}
{"original": "america's older citizens — and we can add in most people who are old enough to imagine the possibility of their retirement — have one of the biggest stakes of any americans in this primary. social security, for example, is america's largest anti-poverty program, keeping more than 27 million people above the poverty line."}
{"original": "so it is worth looking at how these two candidates have stood and acted on these issues."}
{"original": "biden has supported cutting social security benefits on numerous occasions in his political career, most recently in 2013. but his support for such cuts goes back much further, to efforts in the senate in 1995 and even as far back as 1984."}
{"original": "sanders has been on the opposite side of that fight for decades, and has struggled in congress to expand social security benefits since he first arrived there in 1991. he was mostly alone until recently in advocating an expansion of benefits."}
{"original": "now that position has much more support from democrats, and biden has also proposed increasing benefits, although not nearly as much as sanders."}
{"original": "sanders and biden have also shown, to this day, a different understanding of the actual finances of social security and the challenges that it faces. this could be important in the political fights that we are likely to see over these issues."}
{"original": "for decades most americans have been convinced that social security was headed for serious financial problems, and that they would not see their promised benefits. sanders, unlike biden, has rejected this framework since the 1990s — and according to the data that is used by virtually all economists, he has been correct. the system will need more revenue in about 15 years, but the gap to be closed going forward is much smaller than what was easily taken care of in the past."}
{"original": "there is another issue that gives older americans a huge stake in this primary: medicare for all."}
{"original": "it's likely that millions of voters over 65 are not aware how much this program would change their lives, because they already have medicare. but the medicare for all that sanders is proposing is vastly superior to the current coverage provided by medicare."}
{"original": "for example, the kaiser family foundation estimated that the average person receiving medicare paid about $5,460 in out-of-pocket expenses in 2016; median income for medicare recipients was $26,200. there are a lot of medicare recipients — especially the poorer ones — who would gain considerably under sanders's plan, which would eliminate virtually all of these out-of-pocket expenses."}
{"original": "traditional medicare also does not cover routine dental care. as a result, almost two-thirds of people on medicare do not have dental coverage; about half have not seen a dentist in the past year. this lack of access to dental care can cause other health problems, as well as unnecessary suffering. medicare for all would provide dental care for everyone, including senior citizens."}
{"original": "other needs that medicare for all would pay for that are not covered by traditional medicare include eyeglasses and hearing aids; and perhaps most importantly, long-term care."}
{"original": "biden's plan does not offer these improvements for senior citizens on medicare. it is mainly an expansion of the affordable care act (obamacare), increasing subsidies for premiums and also providing a public option that people could buy into. he would also use this public option to expand medicaid (the federal/state health care program for low-income americans) to the 14 states that have refused to expand it under the aca."}
{"original": "americans who are not yet 65 and therefore not yet eligible for medicare also have a stake in medicare for all. if they end up having to purchase health insurance, the price goes up considerably with age, and there is no guarantee of affordability from an aca-like plan."}
{"original": "the vast majority of older americans would therefore appear to have a lot to gain from medicare for all, but you wouldn't know it from the polls. perhaps the relevant information has not been as widely available as it should be."}

{"original": "related:health stocks down after texas obamacare ruling, but analysts say it's better to buy"}
{"original": "the ruling by a federal judge in texas that the individual mandate in the affordable care act is unconstitutional — and therefore the entire law is invalid — whistles past a new economic reality. with or without the mandate, the insurance markets created by the aca are stable and providing coverage for millions of americans who otherwise would be courting financial ruin when a health crisis strikes."}
{"original": "it was originally thought this would be not be possible without requiring people to buy insurance. remember that the aca's market reforms were initially described as a three-legged stool. one leg mandated that insurers could not charge sicker people higher premiums nor deny them coverage. since that meant insurers needed larger numbers of healthy people paying premiums, a second leg — the individual mandate — compelled everyone to purchase health insurance or pay a penalty. but premiums can be unaffordable for many people, both healthy and sick, so the aca included a third leg — subsidies — that help people with low to moderate incomes pay their premiums."}
{"original": "judge reed o'connor ruled the individual mandate is unconstitutional because it lost its foundational authority based in congress' taxing power when congress zeroed out the mandate's tax penalty starting next year. further, he said that without one of its three legs, the stool can no longer stand. in legal terms, he ruled that the individual mandate is not severable from the aca, and therefore the entire law is invalid."}
{"original": "o'connor took a pretty narrow view of a law that in five years of operation has morphed from a three-legged stool into more of a bench with at least two sturdy brackets. we now know that while the mandate is indeed an important part of bringing people into the market and increasing the overall rates of insurance coverage, the federal premium subsidies have attracted enough healthy people to keep the market intact."}
{"original": "the congressional budget office has estimated that largely because of these subsidies, even with the end of the individual mandate penalty, these markets will continue to be stable in almost all areas of the country throughout the coming decade, albeit with higher premiums. recent reports suggest that aca sign-ups are down 12% from this same time last year, and the repeal of the mandate penalty for 2019 may have partially contributed to that downturn. but the markets have not collapsed."}
{"original": "this experience raises real-world questions about o'connor's opinion that the individual mandate, if it is in fact unconstitutional, is essential to and inseverable from the other provisions of the affordable care act."}
{"original": "read:supreme court to rule 'in 2020 at the earliest' after judge finds obamacare unconstitutional"}
{"original": "we don't have a mandate penalty in place for 2019, yet insurers are still participating and enrollees are still signing up. the stool may be wobbly without the mandate intact, but it has not toppled over. and it certainly hasn't knocked over its neighbors, making it even more of a stretch to make the case that without the mandate, the entire aca must go. yet that is precisely what judge o'connor has decided."}
{"original": "in the short term, the practical effects of this decision are minimal. it will be appealed. at first, there was some doubt about whether the federal government would continue to enforce the aca in the meantime. but the centers for medicare and medicaid services quickly and admirably squashed that uncertainty, noting that the exchanges are still open for business."}
{"original": "a law as sweeping as this shouldn't be subject to complete wipeout from the courts. and a decision this unfounded shouldn't be grounds to re-open the repeal-and-replace debate, as president trump has advocated. hopefully our elected officials, and the fifth circuit judges hearing the appeal of o'connor's decision, will not ignore the experience that we have had with the individual markets so far."}

{"original": "the obamacare legislation established a federal income tax penalty for failure to carry so-called minimum essential coverage. last year (2015) was the second year for the penalty, which can potentially be owed for any month that you did not have qualifying health coverage in force. the penalty for 2015 is higher than for 2014. (and the penalty for 2016 will be higher still — if you don't have qualifying health coverage in force for this year .)"}
{"original": "for 2015, the penalty is generally the greater of: (1) $285 per adult in the household up to a maximum of $975 per household or (2) 2% of household income above the applicable federal income tax return filing threshold. you don't have to worry about the penalty if you (and all members of your family, if applicable) had qualifying coverage for all of last year. in this case, simply check the box on line 61 of form 1040, and you're done. lucky you!"}

{"original": "if you obtained health coverage for 2015 through a state or federal health insurance marketplace, you may have been eligible for advance payments of the premium tax credit (ptc). if so, the advance ptc payments were sent to your insurance company to lower your monthly premiums. however, the advance payments were based on estimated information (such as your projected household income for last year), so the advance payments were probably different from the ptc amount to which you are actually entitled."}
{"original": "as a result, you must file a 2015 form 1040 if you benefited from advance ptc payments last year. you must file even if your income was low enough that you would not otherwise be required to file. with your 2015 return, you must include form 8962 (premium tax credit) to reconcile (compare) the advance payments sent to your insurance company with your actual allowable ptc amount."}

{"original": "retailer macy's inc. m, -4.97% has suffered mightily with a roughly 60% decline in shares over the last three years. there are obvious reasons for this trouble, as e-commerce competition has resulted in chronic revenue declines, but 2018 may be finally the year that shares find a bottom."}
{"original": "macy's will release its latest earnings on feb. 27, and despite recent troubles there is reason to be optimistic. holiday-season comps actually rose about 1% — nothing to scoff at for a store that has been perpetually challenged to find growth — and strong consumer metrics in 2018 should help this trend persist."}
{"original": "also, corporate tax reform is tailor-made for this retailer that books almost all its revenue within u.s. borders and paid an effective tax rate of about 36% in the last full fiscal year."}
{"original": "sure, the long-term charts are ugly. but back before the market hit a snag in late january, macy's stock was actually trading at eight-month highs and had surged 50% since early november."}
{"original": "there's good reason to think that these last few weeks of volatility sent investors scurrying for the exit prematurely and that the stock could revisit those recent highs. with a forward price-to-earnings ratio of about 8 and price-to-sales ratio of about 0.3, it's safe to say that a lot of negativity is already baked in."}
{"original": "hca healthcare inc. hca, +1.36% is a hospital operator with two big appeals in this troubled market. for starters, it has big-time scale with 170 hospitals and a $34 billion market cap. and secondly, it's in the recession-proof sector of health care, which sees strong demand regardless of business or consumer trends."}
{"original": "from a valuation perspective, things look great with a forward p/e ratio of less than 11. and that's in spite of a red-hot run in 2018 even as the market has melted down; hca stock is up almost 12% year-to-date while the broader s&p 500 is struggling to get out of the red."}
{"original": "the reason for the resilience is, in part, strong earnings reported in january. these included a 12% jump in revenue to top estimates, a beat on adjusted earnings and modest growth in both admissions and revenue per admissions. the icing on the cake was better-than-expected guidance and the institution of a 35-cent quarterly dividend payable in march."}
{"original": "when you see this kind of growth and this kind of momentum in a troubled market, it's a great sign. but when you see this along with a forward p/e that low, you need to act before the bargain pricing disappears."}
{"original": "of course, the health-care sector in general was undervalued last year for good reason as republicans talked of slashing medicare and repeal obamacare. but given failed health-care legislation in 2017 and with contentious midterms right around the corner, don't expect any big changes to disrupt the sector again anytime soon. the market discounted hca stock last year, and now is the perfect time to buy at bargain prices."}

{"original": "but with shares briefly breaking out of a rut over the last several months and with a great fourth-quarter report behind it, gm is worth a look. and given a forward price-to-earnings ratio that's less than 7, shares could be ripe for a breakout from these levels."}
{"original": "just last week, gm earnings beat expectations on the top and the bottom line — including a dramatic surprise on earnings per share, with an adjusted tally of $1.65 over the consensus estimate of $1.39 thanks to strong showing by revamped crossovers including the buick enclave and chevy equinox. equally important was a big 22% reduction in unfunded pension liabilities."}
{"original": "still, despite these results and a generous 3.6% dividend, investors haven't been interested. the stock still trades at its single-digit p/e. yet gm generated an enviable $17 billion in net operating cash flow last year, so this is hardly a company that's in dangerous territory."}
{"original": "sure, forward sales trends are challenged in the u.s. and the disruption of new autonomous driving technology creates uncertainty. but gm is still a bargain given its fundamentals and valuation, and worth buying on a pullback."}

{"original": "despite its relatively low profile, there's a pretty long list of things working for it right now."}

{"original": "but even if it carried out the threat, it wouldn't doom the health care law, said mit economist jonathan gruber. not that by a long shot, he said."}
{"original": "but it would mean higher premiums as well cost sharing for consumers, particularly in small markets where unitedhealth is a big player, he and other experts said."}
{"original": "that wouldn't affect those with subsidies—who make up the majority of the market—but for non-subsidized others it would be a double whammy of fewer choices, and higher premiums, gruber said."}

{"original": "the epipen is a very profitable product, which is why mylan ceo heather bresch has spent much of the past decade marketing and lobbying to make sure every consumer knows how important it is to have a couple of epipens, and to make sure that lawmakers know how important it is for every school in america to buy some, just in case they might be needed."}
{"original": "some of those who support mylan's decision to jack up the price of epipen are just as confused about capitalism as its critics are. they say that mylan (and other pharmaceutical companies) are justified in charging high prices for their lifesaving drugs and medical devices because large profits provide the only possible incentive for inventors and researchers to come up with the next big thing."}
{"original": "they say high profits are the only way pharmaceutical science can advance. they say that if mylan and others in the drug business didn't charge so much, innovation would stop, or even reverse, and pretty soon we'd all be wearing animal skins and using flint to start a fire."}
{"original": "high prices, you see, are good for you!"}
{"original": "but that view surely paints the results of the capitalist process in far too benevolent of a light."}
{"original": "the profit motive may give us the products we want (given what's for sale and what our income can buy) but it doesn't necessarily encourage the innovation that would give us the products that we need. otherwise, we'd have cured humanity's scourges — malaria, tuberculosis and tropical diseases such as river blindness — by now."}
{"original": "instead, we have multiple and nearly identical drugs to treat (but not cure!) erectile dysfunction, depression, hypertension, high cholesterol, ulcers and other ailments common among those with relatively high incomes."}
{"original": "time to sell mylan; two better picks"}
{"original": "most innovation by pharmaceutical companies consists of copying some other company's drug in an effort to take away some market share, or copying their own drug in an attempt to extend a patent. the goal is to gain a monopoly in a lucrative market, and to deny other companies their monopoly if possible. pharmaceuticals is not a competitive industry in any fashion."}
{"original": "the industry spends a lot of money reinventing the wheel, not pushing the frontiers of science forward. finding treatments for previously untreatable diseases just isn't a priority. if a disease could be monetized — the way mylan has monetized anaphylaxis — it probably already would have been."}
{"original": "there are other strategies besides the profit motive we could adopt if we wanted to advance science and technology."}
{"original": "we could expand the government funding that already finances almost all the basic drug research. or we could offer researchers a limited financial reward for successfully discovering truly novel and effective treatments and compounds. the prize for success would be high enough to encourage researchers and labs to take on the project on spec. once development costs were recouped, drugs could be sold for their marginal cost plus a reasonable rate of return. we'd save trillions of dollars a year, some of which could be put back into research and development."}
{"original": "the incentives in the capitalist system are very powerful, as we've seen in the case of mylan. the invisible hand of the market is marvelous at giving us the things we want and can afford, but it doesn't give us the things we need — like an affordable way to save a child from dying."}
{"original": "because saving children just isn't mylan's business."}
{"original": "u.s. stocks traded modestly lower wednesday as investors took a cautious stance ahead of federal reserve minutes that could reveal if a rate increase in 2016 is likely. the dow jones industrial average djia, +0.50% , was off 24 points, or 0.1%, at 18,528, the s&p 500 index spx, -0.37% , was 0.1% lower at 2,176, while the nasdaq composite index comp, -1.35% gave up 5 points, or 0.1%, at 5,221. minutes from the federal open market committee's july 26-27 meeting are set for 2 p.m. eastern time, and will be closely pored over for signs of the timing and pace of increases to key interest rates. additionally, st. louis fed president james bullard will speak about monetary policy at the wealth and asset management research conference at washington university in st. louis at 1 p.m. in corporate news, aetna inc. aet told the justice department that it would reduce its exposure to affordable care act exchanges, known as obamacare, if its planned merger with humana inc. hum, +1.92% , was blocked. meanwhile, shares of valeant pharmaceuticals international inc. vrx, +0.08% were soaring, up more than 11%, after morgan stanley issued a bullish research report on the embattled drug maker."}
{"original": "the potential changes that were proposed in an early version of the 2017 tax cuts and jobs act had many u.s. taxpayers concerned and confused about what the implications might be. taxpayers feared they would lose all sorts of deductions as result of the new tax laws and that, ultimately, the changes would result in money out of their pockets."}
{"original": "as it turns out, however, the final legislation, which passed on december 20, 2017 and was signed into law on january 3, 2018, ended up being much less scary than many americans had initially feared. and while the biggest impact may prove to be on businesses, there are some important changes that will impact the majority of american taxpayers."}
{"original": "1. your income may put you in a different tax bracket"}
{"original": "tax rates have changed a bit under the new tax law. taxpayers will want to note the changes and what they mean for those filing single and those filing jointly. take a look at all of the new tax brackets and tax percentages here."}
{"original": "2. a majority of american taxpayers will benefit from lower tax rates"}
{"original": "for example, single taxpayers earning between $38,701 and $82,500 will reduce their tax liability from 25% to 22%. meantime, those joint filers earning between $165,001 and $233,350 will get a reduction in tax liability from 28% down to 24%. for five additional tax brackets, there will be reductions of 3% or more. to illustrate the potential savings, consider that a family earning $233,350 would potentially reduce their tax liability by more than $9,000."}
{"original": "5 simple steps to reach $1 million"}
{"original": "3. the standard deduction goes up and the personal exemption goes away."}
{"original": "the new tax plan increases the standard deduction from $6,350 to $12,000 for individuals and from $12,700 to $24,000 for married couples. the personal exemption has been eliminated. the net effect is a modest increase in the overall tax savings for those taxpayers who did not previously itemize deductions. by way of example, before the 2017 act, a married couple without children would have been able to claim a $13,000 standard deduction and two personal exemptions of $4,150 each (total of $8,300), resulting in an aggregate offset of $21,300."}
{"original": "4. tax preparation fees are no longer deductible"}
{"original": "you can no longer write off your previous year's tax preparation fee. previously the fee you paid a professional to do your taxes was an eligible deduction."}
{"original": "5. you can no longer write off mileage if you are a w-2 employee"}
{"original": "previously, mileage had to exceed 2% of your adjusted gross income (agi) to write it off, but now even if that 2% is met or exceeded it cannot be written off against income."}
{"original": "6. taxes on business owners has changed"}
{"original": "if you own a business, you will now have a flat tax of 21%, instead of the 35% tax rate that was previously in place."}
{"original": "7. the child tax credit will go up from $1,000 to $2,000"}
{"original": "if you have a child living with you who was under the age of 17 at the end of the year you qualify for this deduction. this change also increases the income threshold at which the credit gets phased out to $400,000 for married taxpayers and $200,000 for others. this could mean significant savings for taxpayers with large families."}
{"original": "8. medical and dental expense deductions have been expanded"}
{"original": "while the percentage has gone up and down over the years, the most recent requirement was that your medical and dental expenses had to exceed 10% of your adjusted gross income (agi) to write them off against your income. now, they must only exceed 7.5% of your agi for you to be able to deduct them."}
{"original": "9. alimony is no longer deductible or taxable"}
{"original": "under the new tax law, alimony will no longer be deductible against income for the person paying it, nor will it count as taxable income for the person receiving it. this change is effective for divorce decrees signed after january 1, 2019."}
{"original": "10. entertainment expenses can no longer be deducted, but meals can"}
{"original": "the deduction for business-related entertainment has been repealed as part of the new tax plan. businesses can still generally deduct 50% of the cost of qualified meals."}
{"original": "11. there are lower limits on mortgage interest deductions"}
{"original": "securing a good home mortgage interest rate may matter more now, thanks to this change. that's because home mortgage interest for debt incurred after december 15, 2017 to acquire or improve a home, is now limited to the interest on $750,000 worth of principal. this is a decrease from the prior $1,000,000 principal limitation and applies to both primary and secondary residences. home loan debt acquired before december 15, 2017, is grandfathered and this change does not apply."}
{"original": "12. there is a limit on interest deductions for home-equity lines of credit (helocs)"}
{"original": "like primary mortgage loan interest, the interest on heloc loans has also been impacted by the new tax law. interest on these loans will no longer be deductible, regardless of when the loan was acquired, unless the funds are used explicitly for home improvements or acquisitions."}
{"original": "13. there are now limitations on property, state and local tax deductions (salt)"}
{"original": "taxpayers' state and local tax deductions will now be capped at $10,000 under the new tax legislation. meaning, if you itemize deductions on your taxes, you will be able to deduct your state individual income, sales and property taxes up to a limit of $10,000, but you'll have to choose between property tax and income or sales tax. all three cannot exceed that $10,000 amount."}
{"original": "14. the alternative minimum tax (amt) remains intact"}
{"original": "the original bill intended to eliminate the amt altogether. under the final legislation, however, the tax remains although the exemption has been increased to $500,000 for single taxpayers and $1 million for couples. this change is expected to result in fewer taxpayers being subjected to the amt."}
{"original": "15. the estate tax exemption is doubled"}
{"original": "the new tax law doubles the estate tax exemption to $11.2 million for single filers and $22.4 million for joint filers. this change will only affect the roughly 1% of the american population that pays estate taxes."}
{"original": "16. the obamacare tax is no more"}
{"original": "the new tax legislation eliminates the individual health care mandate penalty tax that was imposed by the affordable care act (aka, obamacare) beginning in 2019. however, the penalty tax will remain in effect for the 2018 calendar year."}
{"original": "like kind exchanges under section 1031 of the internal revenue code are now limited to exchanges of real property. they no longer apply to any other property, including personal property associated with real property."}
{"original": "18. education tax credits, student loan interest deductions remain"}
{"original": "many of the 44 million americans with student loan debt feared that these changes could be devastating. however, each of the credits (american opportunities, lifelong learner) live on in the new tax law, as does the ability to deduct student loan interest."}
{"original": "19. the use of section 529 accounts has been expanded"}
{"original": "this may be one of the most significant impacts of the tax reform on education. section 529 accounts, which are tax-advantaged savings and prepaid tuition plans designed to encourage people to save for future college costs, have been expanded. starting in 2018, these accounts can be used for tuition at public, private or religious schools in addition to college tuition. section 529 will be limited to $10,000 per student during any taxable year."}
{"original": "20. coverdell savings accounts have been eliminated"}
{"original": "the use of coverdell education savings accounts, which essentially enabled college tuition money to be put aside tax-free at a rate of up to $2,000 a year, is being phased out as part of the new tax plan."}
{"original": "ten years after the passage of the affordable care act, the trump administration is now asking the supreme court to overturn it. yet it's now clear that the aca has brought significant improvements to the lives of millions of americans. today, they enjoy more health-care coverage, with greater access, better outcomes and less cost."}
{"original": "one segment in particular gained the most: pre-medicare adults from ages 50 to 64. before the aca, the number of uninsured in that group reached 8.9 million people. insurance companies rejected more than one in five of their applications. those who remained uninsured received fewer basic clinical services. they were more likely to experience health declines."}
{"original": "but after passage of the aca, 5.6 million of them — 9% of the 62 million in the pre-medicare group — purchased coverage in the individual health insurance market. as a result, their uninsured rate fell from over 14% in 2013 to less than 9% in 2018."}
{"original": "now the new question: have there been improvements in the health status for the pre-medicare population? if so, they would likely be somewhat more resilient to covid-19. so both of us began to analyze data from the health and retirement study, and tracked changes in the group's well-being. we chose the years 2010 and 2016."}
{"original": "what we found was good news. on balance, middle-aged americans are better off now than before passage of the aca. key health metrics improved. reported levels of depression are down. smoking has declined. those who say their health improved over the prior two years rose from 12% to 16%. the number who say their health had deteriorated has diminished."}
{"original": "what's more, their use of hospitals and nursing homes over the period has lessened. given the high pandemic-related mortality rate among residents of nursing homes, this is a particularly critical finding."}
{"original": "to put it into perspective: the two-year incidence rate for the group's nursing home admission in the pre-aca (1.7%) and post-aca (0.7%) period is a drop of 59%. annually, that translates to 284,000 fewer admissions."}
{"original": "and far fewer deaths: some estimates suggest that ultimately, upwards of 20% of nursing home residents may die from covid-19."}
{"original": "so assume that roughly 15% of new admissions from this population are particularly frail and vulnerable and end up as residents with greater than two-year stays. this annual reduction in admissions would mean up to roughly 8,500 fewer deaths per year."}
{"original": "we also found that out-of-pocket medical costs for them was reduced by 11%, even though medical inflation increased by more than 25% during the period. fewer of them retired involuntarily – noteworthy, because declining health is a primary reason those between ages 50 and 64 leave the workforce. and fewer were living below the federal poverty line."}
{"original": "so what does this mean in the context of covid-19?"}
{"original": "the pre-medicare group is now at somewhat lower risk of a severe outcome due to the pandemic. with less use of hospitals and nursing homes, and more staying at home, they have reduced their risk."}
{"original": "with greater access to insurance, and lower out-of-pocket expenses, they are less likely to put off early treatment; cost is no longer a significant barrier. and because employment is no longer tied directly to health coverage, they may feel less pressure to work when they are ill."}
{"original": "social isolation can be problematic for those middle-aged and older, who often are lacking social support resources. the decreased rates of depression among the group is likely due to greater access to mental-health services. clearly, this helps mitigate the negative effects of the stay-at-home orders and the anxiety of a pandemic."}
{"original": "our findings suggest a continued need not only to safeguard the aca but to strengthen it — and keep millions of vulnerable americans safe and healthy. the trump administration's move to overturn the aca, particularly during this extraordinary time, will only add to our current challenges."}

{"original": "the greenback is on track to be the worst performing major currency this quarter, and it can't be blamed solely on the unwinding of the so-called trump trade. oil-price volatility also plays a key role, according to analysts."}
{"original": "over the last three months, the u.s. dollar has given up nearly all of the gains seen in the wake of donald trump's nov. 8 u.s. presidential election victory, which were fueled by the implications of what many saw as the arrival of the most business-friendly administration and congress."}
{"original": "the dollar's rise to a 13-year high swiftly followed in less than two months, on expectations that the federal reserve would be more aggressive in raising rates in 2017 and beyond thanks to fiscal spending boost promised by the new administration."}
{"original": "the ice u.s. dollar index dxy, +0.41% is now down 3% since the start of the year and has retreated 4% since peaking in december."}
{"original": "around the time of the presidential election, members of the organization of the petroleum exporting countries and some major non-opec crude producers reached an agreement to cut production, pushing oil prices above $50 a barrel, where it traded until early march."}
{"original": "the view was that economic growth and the accompanying inflation would accelerate, prompting the fed to speed up its normalization process."}
{"original": "but hopes for both economic growth and inflation were dented this month for the first time since the start of the year."}
{"original": "earlier in march, oil futures us:clm7 retreated sharply on rising u.s. crude supplies, with the u.s. benchmark now trading around $47 a barrel. that's dented expectations inflation can remain above the fed's 2% target."}
{"original": "on friday, house republicans withdrew legislation to repeal and replace obamacare after a revolt by conservatives and moderates within their own party. as a result, investors continued to revise expectations regarding the scope and timing of tax cuts and other fiscal proposals promised by trump."}
{"original": "the absence of infrastructure spending, deregulation and tax cuts wouldn't in itself change the already existing positive fundamentals of the u.s. economy, which grew at 1.9% pace last year. the fed, after all has been on the path of normalizing interest rates since 2015."}
{"original": "inflation has been running above 2% for more than a year, while fed-funds rate is still below 1%. the difference between the two is often seen as a rough proxy for real, or inflation-adjusted, rates. the fact that real fed-funds rate remains negative has been making a lot of traders nervous, according to neil mellor, chief currency strategist at bny mellon."}
{"original": "the presumption among currency traders was that the fed would remove the negative inflation gap, making the dollar attractive as a higher-yielding currency. but those hopes are now deflating, mellor said."}
{"original": "inflation has been boosted by the rebound in oil, which bottomed below $30 a barrel in february of last year. any renewed slide in crude prices could slow the pickup in inflation or potentially even turn into disinflation—a reduction in the inflation rate—which could prompt the fed to slow down the pace of rate increases."}
{"original": "inflation has been all driven by cost push, not demand. when growth rates and inflation rates are already low, it is difficult to normalize the rates, as an increase to fight inflation without corresponding growth risks denting the economy, mellor said."}
{"original": "a stronger greenback can also make life harder for foreign borrowers with dollar-denominated debt, as it makes servicing loans more difficult. such tighter financial conditions can slow global demand and growth."}
{"original": "most currency analysts still expect the dollar to rise in the long term, as the u.s. central bank, unlike its counterparts in japan and the eurozone, is in the process of tightening monetary policy."}

{"original": "health-care earnings begin in earnest this week. government insurance giant centene corp. reported on tuesday morning, and anthem inc., biogen inc., boston scientific corp. and swiss drugmaker novartis ag are all reporting on wednesday."}
{"original": "the past week has been a difficult one for health companies. health-care stocks are lagging the broader market by their largest margin since 2006, sparked by murmurs of a single-payer health system and proposals to tighten regulations around drug pricing. shares of unitedhealth group inc. tumbled last week despite the company reporting first-quarter earnings and revenue that beat expectations — a sign of investors' growing anxiety over the health-care regulatory climate."}
{"original": "with that in mind, here's what to watch out for during the next couple of days as health-care companies announce earnings."}
{"original": "centene cnc, +0.27% shares initially shot up 6.1% in premarket trade tuesday after the insurer reported first-quarter profit and revenue that beat wall street expectations, while raising its full-year outlook."}
{"original": "however, it seems that centene's strong first quarter wasn't enough to quell investor jitters, as the stock gave back all of its gains after the opening bell, falling 1.5%."}
{"original": "the company's net income rose to $522 million, or $1.24 a share, from $340 million, or 96 cents a share, a year ago. adjusted earnings per share (eps) was $1.39, above the factset consensus of $1.35. total revenue rose 40% to $18.44 billion, beating the factset consensus of $17.46 billion, with medicaid revenue jumping 54% to $12.61 billion and revenue from medicare rising 19% to $1.38 billion. commercial revenue rose 19% to $3.65 billion. the company, whose stock has fallen more than 16% so far this year, is the largest provider of plans through both the medicaid program and the aca marketplaces"}
{"original": "centene raised its full-year eps guidance to between $4.24 and $4.44 per share from $4.11 to$4.31. it also raised its revenue outlook to between $72.8 billion and $73.6 billion from $70.3 billion to $71.1 billion."}
{"original": "the health insurer agreed last month to buy competitor wellcare health plans inc. wcg, +1.35% for $15.3 billion, creating a managed-care giant in the business of government health programs and boosting centene's medicare market share. the deal, which dropped as health-policy threats came from both the left and the right, was seen by some as a bet on the future of the affordable care act (aca), also known as obamacare. whether the bet pays off will depend on what changes, if any, are made to the aca."}
{"original": "at this time, we believe there is no appetite in washington to revisit comprehensive health-care reform, chief executive michael neidorff said during tuesday's earnings call with analysts."}
{"original": "on wednesday, health insurer anthem antm, +0.22% will report first-quarter earnings before the opening bell. earnings are expected to come in at $5.89 per share, up from $5.41 in the year-earlier quarter, according to analysts polled by factset. revenue is expected to be $24.426 billion, higher than $22.342 billion a year ago."}
{"original": "shares of anthem are down 8.4% so far this year, reflecting the recent sell-off in health insurance stocks."}
{"original": "in 2017, anthem announced it would launch its own pharmacy-benefit manager, which the insurer said should generate around $4 billion in savings each year. the pbm, called ingeniorx, was initially slated to launch in 2020, but then anthem said in january the rollout would be pushed up to march, resulting in a boost in projected earnings for the year. management will likely give an update on the rollout on wednesday during its earnings call with analysts, so investors should keep their ears open."}
{"original": "biogen biib, -0.08% is also set to report first-quarter earnings on wednesday before the market opens. the drugmaker, whose shares are down 24% in the year to date, was dealt a severe blow this past quarter when it was forced to discontinue phase 3 trials of aducanumab, an investigational alzheimer's drug whose mechanism of action was based on the so-called amyloid hypothesis. shares plunged 28% at the time, and biogen said it would take a closer look at the data."}
{"original": "investors will want answers from management on wednesday about what went wrong with aducanumab, which analysts once thought would be the company's next big blockbuster drug. they will also want to hear an update on the drugmaker's collaboration with eisai co. ltd. esaly, +2.44% on another amyloid-based treatment for alzheimer's."}
{"original": "biogen is expected to report earnings of $6.83 per share, up from $6.05 a year ago, according to analysts surveyed by factset. revenue is expected to come to $3.385 billion, up from $3.131 billion in the year-earlier quarter."}
{"original": "medical device maker boston scientific corp. bsx, -1.37% will announce earnings on wednesday morning, as well. factset analysts expect the company to report earnings of 36 cents per share, higher than 33 cents in the year-earlier quarter. revenue should be $2.535 billion, up from $2.379 billion a year ago."}
{"original": "the food and drug administration ordered boston scientific and coloplast corp. clpby, +0.63% last week to remove their transvaginal mesh products, used to treat pelvic organ prolapse, from the market. shares of boston scientific fell more than 7% at the time, though shares are only down 1.8% for the year. investors will want to hear from management how the removal of the vaginal mesh products, a part of boston scientific's urology and pelvic health business and the subject of years of litigation against the company, will affect the bottom line."}

{"original": "congressional republicans are moving forward with a bill to repeal and replace the affordable care act, but the proposed bill doesn't do very much to improve on the flaws in obamacare. the republican plan doesn't solve any of our health-care problems, because it wasn't designed to."}
{"original": "instead, it tries (and fails) to solve a political problem."}
{"original": "what are the main complaints about obamacare? that, even with subsidies, health care is too costly, with rising premiums and high out-of-pocket costs. that, in some areas, there aren't enough choices for health insurance, and there aren't enough choices about doctors or other medical-care providers. that there's a mandate to purchase insurance, even if you're healthy."}
{"original": "paul ryan's replacement bill doesn't address any of those concerns. instead, it would drive costs up for almost everyone except the very healthy and the very rich, and would hit those in their 50s and 60s particularly hard. it would phase out expanded medicaid coverage, so millions of working-class americans would lose their insurance completely. it doesn't guarantee that you'll have more choices, and it maintains a mandate to buy insurance."}
{"original": "unfortunately, the bill's penalty for not buying continuous insurance coverage would create such perverse incentives that it would likely result in even fewer healthy people buying health insurance, which would in turn lead to higher premiums for sick people as the insurance pool becomes smaller and sicker, culminating in the very death spiral that supposedly killed obamacare."}
{"original": "so what is the republican bill all about? it's an attempt to square the circle politically. republicans have an intractable problem: people really like having health insurance and the care that goes with it, but republican lawmakers think the biggest problem with health insurance is that too many people have it."}
{"original": "as mike konczal writes: conservatives talk compassion, but they really believe that the problem with health care is too much coverage, too little risk for individuals and too much taxation."}
{"original": "or as my colleague caroline baum writes: republicans are getting a crash course on what they already knew, or should have known: once an entitlement, always an entitlement. in other words, republicans should go back to the principle that no one should get anything they can't afford. there's no free lunch, and no free health care."}
{"original": "as you can see, there is no way to square this. people want affordable health care, and republicans don't want to give it to them. so of course the bill is a mess, pleasing no one except those who foolishly think that the people wouldn't notice that the republicans had replaced obamacare with something much worse."}
{"original": "so how should we improve our health-care system? the first step is to identify what's wrong with it. several things:"}
{"original": "it's too expensive. americans pay more than twice as much for health care per capita as the average in developed countries, but we're not as healthy."}
{"original": "it's not as effective as it could be. too many resources are wasted doing things that don't improve outcomes. too many procedures, too many tests, too many pills, too much heroic care in the final stages of life. not only is money wasted, but thousands of people are killed by the mistakes of the health-care system every year."}
{"original": "it's inequitable. the richer you are, the longer you'll live, on average. people who don't have health insurance die earlier. which isn't a problem for the social darwinians among us, but thankfully we as a society decided long ago that everyone has the right to health care."}
{"original": "to fix those problems, we need to start by driving down costs and changing the incentives that encourage waste."}
{"original": "americans pay the highest costs for a couple of reasons. one, we spend too much on administrative costs. the insurance companies and the health-care providers hire a lot of people to fight over who should pay. when a hospital has twice as many billing clerks as beds, you know you have a problem."}
{"original": "to fix this, let's cut administrative costs to the minimum. a single-payer insurance system might do that. other reforms might be better, but we need to do something dramatic to reduce that dead weight."}
{"original": "second, health care is plagued with the sort of market failures you'd learn about in econ 202, such as adverse selection, moral hazard, asymmetric information, free riding, monopolistic behavior and externalities."}
{"original": "also from rex nutting:markets don't work for health care"}
{"original": "the right kind of health-insurance reform could fix some of those market failures. here's an idea: everyone should be insured, with the costs fairly divided among all of us. make it so."}
{"original": "we could control some costs by shifting the way we reimburse doctors and hospitals. instead of paying providers for every band-aid, every test, every second they spend with us, let's pay them for outcomes. let's pay them for keeping us healthy."}
{"original": "we should make sure that health-care providers don't benefit financially from the treatments they prescribe. doctors shouldn't get kickbacks from drug companies, or get paid extra because they steered us to the lab or the mri machine they own."}
{"original": "introducing more competition would drive down prices. let's create more supply to meet the increased demand that comes from covering everyone. let's train 1 million physician assistants and nurse practitioners to deliver primary care, breaking the monopoly power of medical doctors. and open up thousands of community clinics in urban and rural areas to break the monopoly power of hospitals."}
{"original": "next, let's take away the patents for drugs and medical equipment and establish alternative means of encouraging research, innovation and invention."}
{"original": "finally, we need more transparency about prices, as well as about the risks and benefits of the treatments recommended for us. prices ought to be posted on the wall of every waiting room and admittance office. why should i know more about my reuben sandwich than i do about my colonoscopy?"}
{"original": "we can design a better health-care system, one that delivers better care for everyone at a lower price. but we can't do it if we continue to pretend that the problem with health care is that some people don't deserve to have any."}
{"original": "on rainey street, one of austin's premier party districts, little brother bar propped up a sign just before the city's famed south by southwest festival was canceled. it read: went to sxsw & all i got was this coronavirus."}
{"original": "like so many other small businesses — and they don't come much tinier than little brother, with room for just eight customers — the spread of the virus knocked a hole in its bottom line."}
{"original": "eric silverstein, the owner of austin's peached tortilla, was glum about the impact of the virus on his catering business. and rebecca charles, who tends bar for special events, put a plaintive post on facebook. she was out so much money that i don't even want to say it. because she doesn't work at a regular bar, without the events, we have no work."}
{"original": "the spread of the virus has rocked industries from airlines and cruises to apple and applebee's. the only economic question now is how deep the damage to the economy will go. and the big political question is whether the virus will do to president donald trump what the ukraine and russian investigations did not: erode his impregnable base. could this be his hurricane katrina moment, multiplied a thousand times over?"}
{"original": "that's why the plight of silverstein, charles and so many other small-business people throughout the country is so important. if it were up to operators of small businesses, the guardian reported, trump would easily win reelection. a poll just last month found that trump enjoyed an approval rating of 64% among members of the group, as high as it had been since his election. almost two-thirds of those responding expected higher revenue in 2020."}
{"original": "but that was before the virus sent stock prices plummeting and consumer anxiety sky-high. it was also before the virus set the table for a quick push for so many of the social welfare issues that the democrats had championed for years, from family and medical leave to health care for the uninsured. the question is which way small-business owners and gig-economy workers will go."}
{"original": "it's one thing for big companies like amazon, facebook, microsoft and google to ask their employees to work from home. but for many owners of small businesses and their employees, that isn't an option. it just doesn't work to run a bar from home."}
{"original": "employers with fewer than 20 workers make up 89% of all businesses in the country. firms with fewer than 500 employees account for almost half of all payrolls. in one analysis, gig economy workers who have struck out on their own now are one of every six employees, though estimates range from 10% to a third of the workforce. the trump administration has quietly been cultivating those who employ these workers. that strategy now finds itself at a crossroads: will the administration provide aid to these companies and programs for their workers?"}
{"original": "opinion:here's how congress should respond today to the covid-19 recession"}
{"original": "trump's base has proven bulletproof to everything that's come his way. but this time it could be different, for two reasons. first, it's one thing to call the ukraine inquiry a hoax or complain that the democrats are marketing fake news or tweet that nothing is shut down, life & the economy go on. it's quite another when the kids' school is closed, the purell disappears off the shelves, and grandma's nursing home sends out special bulletins."}
{"original": "it's impossible for trump to tweet his way out of that. there are millions of americans directly affected—and millions of jobs at risk in an economy where some people can't work in front of a computer screen. the pressures for help will be overpowering."}
{"original": " this sets up the battle that could well define trump's chances for a second term. "}
{"original": "second, the virus anxiety is quietly stoking the democrats' campaign for programs they want to expand. it's one thing to tell the kids to stay home from school, but another to ask who will take care of them when parents don't have family and medical leave. it's one thing to promise virus tests for everyone, but another to ask who has the insurance to pay for testing and for follow-up care if the test comes back positive. it's one thing to pledge protection for pre-existing conditions, but it's another when those pre-existing conditions make some parts of the population more vulnerable to the flu."}
{"original": "president trump is pledging help for small businesses and paid leave for employees who can't skip work. but if he gives it during the crisis, how can he take it away when it's over? and once he gives in on programs the democrats have clamored for in recent elections, how can he avoid feeding their campaign against him?"}
{"original": "the answer could be that trump could make a quick pivot by pulling the electoral rug out from under the democrats. he could proclaim himself the champion of small-business owners—and the millions of americans who work for them and in the new gig economy—and steal the democrats' issues away from them. this could even trump his repeal and replace pledge for obamacare."}
{"original": "read:don't discount the support for bernie sanders in trump country"}
{"original": "that would require trump to convince queasy republicans and some of his own aides to embrace big-government ideas they had long resisted. it could be, though, that this trip might not prove quite so far, if the stock market continues to spiral and the economy shows signs of tripping. after all, many of these same officials had been lifelong opponents of big deficits and yet came around to the idea of the tax cuts that have sent the federal deficit to $1 trillion this year and beyond."}
{"original": "so this sets up the battle that could well define trump's chances for a second term: embracing the small business and gig economy workers and finding just the right programs to reassure them or feeding the democrats the very ammunition they've been looking for to finally win support for their favorite programs."}

{"original": "the crux, from their perspective, is that americans should have choices when it comes to their health care. but with those options come sacrifices."}
{"original": "mrs. groovy signed us up for obamacare for 2020 and stumbled upon an obamacare wrinkle that we've never seen before. apparently, members of a family need not all be covered by the same plan. in other words, obamacare allows a husband and wife to have different plans."}
{"original": "what i'd like to do now is show how this wrinkle works. once that's done, i'll explain why i'm so happy mrs. groovy stumbled upon it."}
{"original": "in order to choose a different plan for me, mrs. groovy had to divide our family group into two groups. one for me, and one for her. once that was done, she was able to assign a different plan to my group and thus me. here are the steps she followed:"}
{"original": "2. select a plan for 2020. (mrs. groovy picked the silver enhanced 800 plan because that's the plan that worked best for her.)"}
{"original": "3. after a plan is selected, a screen will appear showing your family as one group with each family member having the same plan selection. this screen will also have a button labeled change groups. if you want to have more than one group and the ability to assign different plans to different family members, click this button. (since i preferred a bronze 6900 plan to the silver enhanced 800 plan, mrs. groovy clicked the change groups button.)"}
{"original": "4. the change groups screen allows you to create two or more groups. how many groups you need is determined by the number of plans you need. if you, your spouse and your children can get the coverage you prefer with two plans, you'll only need to create two groups. if you need three plans to get the coverage you prefer, you'll need to create three groups. once the groups are created, you assign whatever family members you want to each group. (mrs. groovy created two groups. she then assigned me to group 1 and her to group 2.)"}
{"original": "5. finally, once the groups are created, you'll have the option to select (or change) plans for each group. (mrs. groovy selected a bronze 6900 plan for group 1 and a silver enhanced 800 plan for group 2.)"}
{"original": "why the two-plan option works best for us"}
{"original": "i have few if any health-care needs and don't mind risk. i therefore find high-deductible plans that are hsa-eligible very attractive. instead of throwing money at premiums for health-care services i don't currently use, i'd rather throw money at an hsa for health-care services i will surely use several years from now — and aren't covered by medicare (e.g., eye care and dental work)."}
{"original": "mrs. groovy, on the other hand, has a handful of health-care needs and is risk-averse. she thus prefers a low-deductible plan. and because i think a husband should accommodate the security concerns of his wife, i have lovingly submitted to mrs. groovy's desire for a low-deductible plan ever since we enrolled in obamacare three years ago."}
{"original": "but now, because of the obamacare wrinkle that mrs. groovy stumbled upon, we both get the plans we desire, and we save even more money."}
{"original": "our obamacare subsidy is the same regardless of plan, so this eliminated our monthly premium cost"}
{"original": "for 2020, mrs. groovy and i are entitled to a monthly premium subsidy of $1,582. this amount is subtracted from our combined monthly premiums, and we have to pay the difference."}
{"original": "in previous years, our combined monthly premiums exceeded our monthly premium subsidy and we had to pay a nominal amount each month ($115 in 2017, $123 in 2018, and $25 in 2019)."}
{"original": "if we did what we did the previous three years under obamacare and remained in one group with one plan — the silver enhanced 800 plan — the monthly premium for each of us would have been $928.11. times that monthly premium by two and you get $1,856.22. subtract our premium subsidy of $1,582 from $1,856.22 and you get $274.22."}
{"original": "by today's standards, $274.22 a month for decent health-care insurance is still an incredible bargain. but it's more than 10 times what we paid last year. the horror!"}
{"original": "but thanks to the obamacare wrinkle, we won't be paying $274.22 a month for health-care insurance. we'll be paying zero. and that's because my monthly premium under the bronze 6900 plan is only $625.20. add $982.11 to $625.20 and you get $1,553.31. our combined monthly premiums are thus less than our monthly premium subsidy. here's a screenshot from healthcare.gov showing our premium tax credit usage for 2020."}
{"original": "hsa contributions will lower our adjusted gross income"}
{"original": "our monthly premium subsidy of $1,582 is based on an estimated income of $30,000 for 2020. if we make more than $30,000 in 2020, we'll have to reimburse the feds a portion of 2020's total premium subsidies. in 2017, for instance, we had a fairly large capital gain and this pushed our adjusted gross income (agi) over our estimated income by more than $4,000. we had to reimburse the feds nearly $600 when we filed our tax return."}
{"original": "but now, because i'm eligible for an hsa and hsa contributions are deducted from your agi, we'll have a lot more wiggle room. consider the following:"}
{"original": "• my government pension amounts to $19,750 for the year."}
{"original": "• interest and dividends from our taxable accounts usually amount to $10,000 for the year."}
{"original": "this is why we estimate our income for obamacare purposes to be $30,000 annually."}
{"original": "now suppose for the moment that mrs. groovy and i sell $25,000 worth of bonds in 2020 to replenish our cash bucket. and let's further suppose that this sale generates a capital gain of $2,000."}
{"original": "without access to an hsa, this capital gain would leave us with an agi $2,000 greater than our estimated income. we would owe the feds money."}
{"original": "but now, because i'll have access to an hsa thanks to the bronze 6900 plan, i can contribute $2,000 to my hsa in 2020 and make sure our agi equals our estimated income."}
{"original": "the hsa contribution limit for 2020 is $4,550. this means mrs. groovy and i will be able to exceed our estimated income by up to $4,550 next year and not incur a dime's worth of reimbursement liability."}

{"original": "today, black americans face lower life expectancies than their white counterparts and remain at greater risk for conditions including stroke, heart disease, hiv, cancer, mental illness and diabetes, to name a few. worse, when racial minorities seek medical attention for these concerns, survey data show they do not always receive the same quality of care as their white counterparts. a 2018 government report found that black-, hispanic-, asian-, and pacific-islander americans reported worse experiences in receiving health care than white americans in several metrics."}

{"original": "medicare advantage is built on a focus of primary care, with care teams that often include not only a primary care clinician, but care managers who help patients navigate an often-complex system that is not so user-friendly. this offers support to patients, particularly those with chronic conditions, whose care teams manage their well-being over time and offer more personalized care — building that essential trust between beneficiary and provider."}
{"original": "unlike traditional medicare, medicare advantage — or ma — plans are able to address social determinants of health, like food insecurity, lack of transportation and lack of social supports. they offer supplemental benefits including vision, dental and hearing services, and other services not covered by traditional medicare, such as meal delivery, transportation to clinical appointments, and support for care givers."}
{"original": "this may be a reason increasing numbers of racial minorities are actively choosing medicare advantage for their health-care needs. 57% of hispanic medicare beneficiaries, for example, enroll in ma and higher proportions of african-american seniors are choosing medicare advantage over traditional medicare."}

{"original": "but exits from the marketplace aren't quite earth-shattering, according to kaiser's report, which was released the day before unitedhealth's tuesday news."}
{"original": "the aca marketplaces are still relatively new and insurers have only recently had sufficient information on who is enrolling and how much health care they are using in order to set accurate premiums, it said. premium changes and the exit of insurers that are not able to offer competitive and profitable plans is to be expected."}
{"original": "in 2019, seven u.s. states tried an innovative experiment to improve the affordable care act (aca) by operating reimbursement pools, which pay back aca insurers a specified portion of their expensive health-care claims."}
{"original": "these pools significantly lowered premiums for individual policyholders in these seven states and generally upped the level of insurance enrollments. moreover, these pools met a cost-benefit test: benefits from these premium reductions almost always exceeded a state's costs to finance these reimbursements."}
{"original": "to enhance the effectiveness of the aca, all other states should look carefully at requesting federal approval to start reimbursement pools. as shown by the experiments in the seven states, these pools have proven to be a win-win for both health insurers and individual policy holders. given the congressional stalemate on the future of the aca, democrats and republicans in state legislatures should do whatever they can to make the current healthcare system work better."}
{"original": "the seven states were alaska, maine, maryland, minnesota, new jersey, oregon and wisconsin. they were motivated to try reimbursement pools because they had few insurers offering policies on their aca exchanges and/or the premiums on individual policies were rapidly rising. most of these states reimbursed insurers for 50% or more of the cost of annual claims between a specified minimum and maximum dollar amount, though alaska and maine linked their reimbursements to claims for enumerated health conditions."}
{"original": "in each of the seven states, insurers sharply reduced their aca health-care premiums — on average, almost 20% less than they would have charged without these reimbursement pools. these lower health-care premiums were offered on all individual policies in the state, both policies offered on aca exchanges and other policies in the individual market (i.e., not through employers or group plans). under the aca, there must be a single risk pool for all individual health-care policies within a state."}
{"original": "to understand how these state reimbursement pools work, let's consider the example of minnesota. in 2019, the state agreed to reimburse aca insurers 80% of annual claims between $50,000 and $250,000 per policy holder on its aca exchange or in its individual market. in return, the aca insurers reduced the average annual premiums for minnesota's individual health-care policies by 23% in 2019 — $1,964 lower than insurers would have charged without the state's reimbursement pool."}
{"original": "the cost of minnesota's reimbursement pool was financed partly by a pass-through payment of $84.7 million from the federal government to the state in 2019. this payment represented the reduction in federal subsidies, required by the aca to be provided to low and moderate-income families buying health-care policies on the aca exchange in minnesota. since the premiums on aca policies declined sharply due to minnesota's reimbursement pool, the federal subsidies for health-care policies bought on its aca exchange were significantly reduced."}
{"original": "in other words, the cost of this federal pass-through payment to minnesota was effectively zero. this $84.7 million payment was a dollar-for-dollar transfer of the federal savings on aca subsidies to families in the state. on the other hand, minnesota did have to appropriate $132 million to complete the funding of its reimbursement pool for aca insurers."}
{"original": "did the benefits to minnesota residents exceed the state's cost of $132 million? we began by examining the benefits to unsubsidized state residents who purchased their health-care policies off the aca exchange in minnesota's individual market. as mentioned above, state residents received an average premium reduction of $1,964 per year because of the reimbursement pool. as a result, minnesota received another significant benefit — the number of unsubsidized policy holders increased to 75,983 from 67,932 in 2019. thus, 75,983 unsubsidized policy holders in minnesota received total premium savings of $149 million. this benefit of $149 million for individual policies purchased off the aca exchange alone exceeded minnesota's $132 million cost for operating its reimbursement pool."}
{"original": "the calculation of the benefits of a state's reimbursement pool to subsidized policy holders on its aca exchange is more complex. under the aca, low- and moderate-income families pay only a prescribed percentage of their income (based on income level and family size) for policies bought on aca exchanges. this percentage is calculated on the assumption that these families will buy a middle-level silver policy, rather than a gold policy with more health-care benefits or a bronze policy with fewer benefits. accordingly, lower premiums resulting from minnesota's reimbursement pool did not reduce the actual premiums paid by such families if they purchased silver policies on the aca exchange; they always paid the same predetermined percentage of their income."}
{"original": " reimbursement pools in these seven states significantly reduced premiums in each state's market. "}
{"original": "by contrast, if subsidized families purchased gold health-care policies on aca exchanges, they would pay out of pocket the extra premiums required for gold instead of silver policies. in 2019, about 14% of subsidized families bought gold policies on aca exchanges in minnesota. we estimate that these families saved roughly $12 million in out-of-pocket costs because of the lower average premiums resulting from minnesota's reimbursement pool."}
{"original": "if subsidized families purchased bronze policies on aca exchanges, they would receive discounts on these policies representing the lower premiums on bronze than silver policies. in 2019, about 54% of subsidized families bought bronze policies on aca exchanges in minnesota. we estimate that these families received discounts worth roughly $7 million because of the lower average premiums resulting from minnesota's reimbursement pool."}

{"original": "5 more states to establish reimbursement pools"}
{"original": "in six of the seven states, the total premium reductions for all individual policies significantly exceeded the state's costs to finance the reimbursement pool. in the seventh state, oregon, these total premium reductions were slightly less than the state's appropriation for the reimbursement pool. impressed by these results in 2019, five more states (colorado, delaware, montana, north dakota and rhode island) will establish reimbursement pools in 2020 with similar structures to the minnesota example."}
{"original": "in short, the reimbursement pools in these seven states significantly reduced premiums in each state's market. the premium reductions went mainly to the purchasers of individual policies outside of the aca exchanges and, to a lesser extent, the subsidized purchasers of gold- and bronze policies on aca exchanges."}
{"original": "before politicians push to replace the aca, every u.s. state should seriously consider establishing reimbursement pools, which have consistently improved health-care systems by delivering lower premiums and higher enrollments at reasonable costs."}

{"original": "we can thank former president ronald reagan and former british prime minister margaret thatcher for our current state of affairs. the neoliberal reforms of the 1980s were based on the idea that unfettered markets would bring shared prosperity through a mystical trickle-down process."}
{"original": "we were told that lowering tax rates on the rich, financialization, and globalization would result in higher standards of living for everybody. instead, the u.s. growth rate fell to around two-thirds of its level in the post-war era — a period of tight financial regulations and a top marginal tax rate consistently above 70% — and a greater share of the wealth and income from this limited growth was funneled to the top 1%."}
{"original": "instead of the promised prosperity, we got deindustrialization, polarization, and a shrinking middle class. unless we change the script, these patterns will continue — or worsen."}
{"original": "fortunately, there is an alternative to market fundamentalism."}
{"original": "through a pragmatic rebalancing of power between government, markets, and civil society, we can move toward a freer, fairer, and more productive system. progressive capitalism means forging a new social contract between voters and elected officials, workers and corporations, rich and poor."}
{"original": "to make a middle-class standard of living a realistic goal once again for most americans and europeans, markets must serve society, rather than vice versa."}
{"original": "unlike neoliberalism, progressive capitalism is based on a proper understanding of how value is created today. the true and sustainable wealth of nations comes not from exploiting countries, natural resources, and people, but from human ingenuity and cooperation, often facilitated by governments and civil-society institutions."}
{"original": "since the second half of the eighteenth century, productivity-enhancing innovation has been the real driver of dynamism and higher living standards."}
{"original": "the rapid economic progress inaugurated by the industrial revolution, following centuries of near stagnation, rests on two pillars. the first is science, through which we can apprehend the world around us. the second is social organization, which allows us to be more productive working together than we ever could be on our own."}
{"original": "over time, institutions such as the rule of law, democracies with systems of checks and balances, and universal standards and norms have strengthened both pillars."}
{"original": "on brief reflection, it should be obvious that these are the sources of material prosperity. and yet wealth creation is often confused with wealth extraction. individuals and corporations can become rich by relying on market power, price discrimination, and other forms of exploitation. but that does not mean they have made any contribution to the wealth of society."}
{"original": "on the contrary, such behavior often leaves everyone else worse off overall. economists refer to these wealth snatchers, who seek to grab a larger share of the economic pie than they create, as rent-seekers. the term originated from land rents: those who received them did so not as a result of their own efforts, but simply as a consequence of ownership, often inherited."}
{"original": "such harmful behavior is especially prevalent in the u.s. economy, where more and more sectors have come to be dominated by just a few firms. these mega-corporations have used their market power to enrich themselves at the expense of everyone else. by charging higher prices, they have effectively lowered consumers' living standards."}
{"original": "with the help of new technologies, they can — and do — engage in mass discrimination, such that prices are set not by the market (finding the single price that equates demand and supply), but by algorithmic determinations of the maximum each customer is willing to pay."}
{"original": "at the same time, u.s. corporations have used the threat of offshoring to drive down domestic wages. and when that hasn't sufficed, they have lobbied pliant politicians to weaken workers' bargaining power further."}
{"original": "these efforts have proved effective: the share of workers who belong to unions has fallen across most advanced economies, but especially in the u.s., and the share of income going to workers has declined precipitously."}
{"original": "while advances in technology and emerging-market growth have certainly played some role in the decline of the middle class, they are of secondary importance to economic policy."}
{"original": "we know this because the same factors have had different effects across countries. the rise of china and technological change have been felt everywhere, but the u.s. has significantly higher inequality and less social mobility than many other countries, such as norway."}
{"original": "likewise, where financial deregulation has gone the furthest, so have financial-sector abuses such as market manipulation, predatory lending, and excessive credit-card fees."}
{"original": "or consider trump's obsession with trade agreements."}
{"original": "insofar as u.s. workers have been ill-served by policy makers, it is not because trade negotiators from developing countries outsmarted u.s. negotiators. in fact, the u.s. usually gets almost everything it asks for."}
{"original": "the problem is that what it asks for reflects the interests of u.s. corporations, not of ordinary citizens."}
{"original": "and as bad as things are now, they are about to get worse. consider america's income inequality."}
{"original": "already, artificial intelligence and robotization are being hailed as the engines of future growth. but under the prevailing policy and regulatory framework, many people will lose their jobs, with little help from government to find new ones. autonomous vehicles alone will deprive millions of their livelihood."}
{"original": "at the same time, our tech giants are doing what they can to deprive government of the ability to respond, and not just by campaigning for lowering taxes: they are demonstrating the same genius in avoiding taxes and exploiting consumers that they previously showed in developing cutting-edge innovations."}
{"original": "moreover, they have shown little, if any, regard for people's privacy. their business models and behavior are effectively exempt from oversight."}
{"original": "still, there is hope in the fact that our economic dysfunction is the result of our own policies. some countries facing these same global forces have adopted policies that have led to dynamic economies in which ordinary citizens have prospered."}
{"original": "through progressive-capitalist reforms, we can start to restore economic dynamism and ensure equality and opportunity for all. the top priority should be to curb exploitation and encourage wealth creation, and this can best — or only — be done by people working together, especially through government."}
{"original": "whatever form wealth-snatching takes — from the abuse of market power and information asymmetries to profiting from environmental degradation — there are specific policies and regulations that could both prevent the worst outcomes and yield far-reaching economic and social benefits. having fewer people die from air pollution, drug overdoses, and deaths of despair, will mean having more people who contribute productively to society."}
{"original": "regulation has had a bad name since reagan and thatcher made it synonymous with red tape. but regulation often improves efficiency. anyone living in a city knows that without stoplights — a simple regulation governing the flow of cars through an intersection — we would live in perpetual gridlock. without air quality standards, the smog in los angeles and london would be worse than the air in beijing and delhi."}
{"original": "the private sector would never take it upon itself to curb pollution. just ask volkswagen ch:vw ."}
{"original": "trump and the lobbyists he has appointed to dismantle the u.s. government are doing everything they can to strip away regulations protecting the environment, public health, and even the economy."}
{"original": "for more than four decades after the great depression, a strong regulatory framework prevented financial crises, until it came to be seen, in the 1980s, as stifling innovation. with the first wave of deregulation came the savings and loan crisis, followed by more deregulation and the dot-com bubble in the 1990s, and then the global financial crisis in 2008."}
{"original": "at that point, countries around the world tried to rewrite the rules to prevent a recurrence. but now the trump administration is doing what it can to reverse that progress."}
{"original": "so, too, the antitrust regulations implemented to ensure that markets work like they are supposed to — competitively — have been stripped back. by curbing rent-seeking, anticompetitive practices, and other abuses, we would improve efficiency, increase production, and spur more investment."}
{"original": "better still, we would free up resources for activities that actually improve well being. if fewer of our best students went into banking, perhaps more would go into research. the challenges in both are great, but one is focused on taking advantage of others, the other on adding to what we know and to what we can do."}
{"original": "and, because the burden of exploitation tends to weigh most heavily on those at the bottom of the economic pyramid, we would reduce inequality and strengthen the fabric of american society."}
{"original": "as the term implies, progressive capitalism recognizes both the power and the limitations of markets. it is simply a fact that, left to its own devices, the private sector will always produce too much of some things, like pollution, and too little of others, like basic research, which is the taproot of innovation and economic dynamism."}
{"original": "government has a central role to play not just in restraining the private sector from doing what it shouldn't, but in encouraging it to do what it should. and through collective action — through government — we can do things that we couldn't do alone and which the market on its own won't."}
{"original": "defense is the obvious example, but the large-scale innovations — such as the creation of the internet and the human genome project — are examples of public expenditures that have transformed our lives. nor will the private sector ever provide many of the universal services that are the basis of any decent society."}
{"original": "the reason the u.s. government created social security, medicare, medicaid, and unemployment and disability insurance is that entrepreneurs and corporations would not provide these essential services, or did so with unacceptable costs and restraints (such as denial of health insurance to those with pre-existing conditions)."}
{"original": "and in many of these areas, the government has proved to be more efficient than the private sector. social security's administrative costs are a fraction of those for private retirement plans, and social security covers a broader array of risks, such as those associated with inflation."}
{"original": "the kind of common sense regulations and reforms i have described are necessary to restore growth and to bring a middle-class life back into reach for most americans and europeans."}
{"original": "but they are not sufficient. what we need is a new twenty-first-century social contract to ensure that all citizens are guaranteed access to health care, education, security in retirement, affordable housing, and a decent job with decent pay."}
{"original": "many countries have already shown that discrete elements of this social contract are achievable."}
{"original": "the u.s., after all, stands alone among developed countries in not recognizing health care as a basic human right. ironically, while the u.s. spends more on health care — both per capita and as a share of gross domestic product — than any other developed country, its predominantly private system delivers worse outcomes. u.s. life expectancy is barely higher than that of costa rica, a middle-income country with one-fifth the per capita gdp of america."}
{"original": "the u.s. pays a high price for these failures, the costs of which will most likely continue to grow over time."}
{"original": "the labor-force participation rate for prime-age men is at historic lows, and the rate for women has begun to decline, too. many of those who have left the labor market are suffering from chronic health problems and are taking prescription pain medications, contributing to the opioid crisis that has come to define trump's america."}
{"original": "with 21% of american children growing up in poverty, persistent underinvestment in public education will undoubtedly weigh on future productivity."}
{"original": "from a progressive-capitalist perspective, the key to delivering a new social contract is through a public option for services that are essential to well being. public options expand consumer choice and spur competition. competition, in turn, will lead to lower prices and more innovation."}
{"original": "many hoped that the 2010 affordable care act (obamacare) would include a public option for health insurance. but, in the event, industry lobbyists succeeded in getting it dropped it from the final bill. that was a mistake."}
{"original": "beyond health care, the u.s. also needs a public option for retirement accounts, mortgages, and student loans."}

{"original": "this would not only be more efficient than paying into a private supplemental plan; it would also protect citizens from exploitative wealth-management firms. in fact, many of these firms have lobbied against having to abide by any fiduciary obligations at all, effectively arguing that if they can't fleece their clients, then they can't make enough money to justify their existence."}

{"original": "moreover, because u.s. banks now claim that they can't take on the risk of underwriting mortgages, roughly 90% of all home loans are backed by the federal government. but if taxpayers have already assumed nearly all of the risk while the private sector continues to reap all of the profits, there is no reason not to have a public option."}
{"original": "the government could start offering a conventional 20% down 30-year mortgage to anyone who has paid taxes for five years, at a rate just a little above the rate at which it borrows money. and, unlike private mortgages, which were virtually designed to ensure that millions would lose their homes in the financial crisis, a public option could be devised to enable workers to stay in their homes when they faced a temporary hardship."}
{"original": "most of these proposals are no-brainers; yet the economic reforms we need will face serious political challenges because of the influence of vested interests. that's the problem with severe economic inequality: it inevitably gives rise to and reinforces political and social inequality."}
{"original": "when the original progressive movement emerged during america's late-19th-century gilded age, its main objective was to wrest democratic governance from the great monopoly capitalists and their political cronies."}
{"original": "the same goes for progressive capitalism today. it requires that we reverse the republican party's systematic effort to disenfranchise large segments of the electorate through voter suppression, gerrymandering, and other anti-democratic techniques. it also requires that we reduce the influence of money in politics, and restore proper checks and balances."}
{"original": "the trump presidency has reminded us that such checks are indispensable for the proper functioning of democracy. but it has also exposed the limits of existing institutions (such as the electoral college, through which the president is chosen, and the senate, where a small state like wyoming, with fewer than 600,000 people, has the same vote as california, with nearly 40 million), underscoring the need for structural political reform."}
{"original": "at stake in both america and europe is our shared prosperity and the future of representative democracy. the explosion of public discontent across the west in recent years reflects a growing sense of economic and in political powerlessness on the part of citizens, who are seeing their chances of having a middle-class life evaporate before their eyes."}
{"original": "progressive capitalism seeks to curb the excessive power of concentrated money in our economy and our politics."}
{"original": "but there is even more at stake: our civil society and our sense of identity, both as individuals and collectively. our economy shapes who we are, and over the past 40 years, an economy built around a core of amoral (if not immoral) materialism and profit-seeking has created a generation that embraces those values."}
{"original": "it doesn't have to be this way. we can have a more compassionate and caring economy, built around cooperatives and other alternatives to for-profit enterprise. we can design better systems of corporate governance, where more than just short-run profit matters. we can and should expect better behavior from our profit-maximizing firms — and proper regulation will take away some of the temptations to misbehave."}

{"original": "the federal government has reopened — but congress faces another government shutdown in less than three weeks unless it can remake immigration law for the first time in almost 32 years. by feb. 8."}
{"original": "liberals are clutching their pearls over the deal to end the three-day government shutdown, arguing that it gave president donald trump a win by reopening the government without making an immigration deal now. but it really sets the stage for trump to take a humiliating, defining defeat if democrats know how to play poker."}
{"original": "the only real way the democrats can screw this up in three weeks is giving trump dime one for the wall along the mexican border he has promised since launching his campaign. regardless of what else trump's opponents may give or get in talks before the next showdown/shutdown, it's time to tear down trump's wall once and for all."}
{"original": "to give trump his wall, as many congressional democrats were prepared to do this week, is to validate the key tenets of trumpism: first, that trump himself is always dominant over politicians and other weaklings, and can (and will) deliver for constituencies other politicians can't or won't help. it also says modern american commerce and society are threatened by a freer flow of immigrants — a view that was anathema to republicans as recently as ronald reagan and makes no economic sense now."}
{"original": "the best way to see trump gelded by this year's congressional elections, and sent packing in 2020, is to assure the country keeps thinking he is an idiot, a liar, and incompetent, to use the top three responses to a december poll asking voters to describe trump."}

{"original": "sometimes personality and ideology are one, an integration of trump and trumpism that voters disparage. his ramblings about a wall he says, alternately, that mexico will pay for and that has to be transparent to prevent law-abiding americans from being conked on the head by bags of drugs mexicans will toss over the wall before climbing it are the best example. the policy is offensive, and the case he makes for it stupid."}

{"original": "so it's time, in poker terms, to call trump's bluff."}
{"original": "dreamers' presence in the u.s. is a civil violation, not a crime, and by simply working and going to school they more than earn their keep. letting them stay, and to keep doing what young people naturally do, is good for an economy that faces a shortage of young workers as baby boomers retire — and where slow growth in demand for housing and consumer spending argues that we need all the young families we can get."}
{"original": "that and the common-sense notion that there's little reason to send law-abiding young people back to countries they barely know are why americans favor letting dreamers stay in the u.s. by a 7-1 margin, according to a quinnipiac poll."}

{"original": "but squash the wall now. because the wall feeds the illusion that makes trump possible. handing it back to him as rubble is the path that demonstrates the president is as weak as he is bellicose."}
{"original": "it's often reported that underfunded public employee pension systems create barriers to state and local governments' ability to provide ample public services like education, parks, and libraries. too often overlooked, however, is another looming fiscal challenge: the rising costs of paying for health insurance for america's retired public employees."}
{"original": "the federal reserve estimates that the long-term liability for providing medical coverage (technically called other post-employment benefits, or opeb) for retired public workers is over $1 trillion. these retirement benefits vary widely across the country but can cover early retirees who are ineligible for medicare as well as older retirees on medicare. the costs of this coverage constrain what governments can do to address pressing problems and have even contributed to a few cities filing for bankruptcy."}
{"original": "the good news is that a few states have tackled the opeb problem—and they provide lessons for others. consider north carolina. the state had run up a staggering opeb liability of $34.4 billion—or $3,200 per resident. in 2017, the state treasurer's office found that pensions and retiree health care were approaching 20% of the state's general fund budget—effectively crowding out other critical services. since the general accounting standards board (gasb) now requires state and local governments to report these liabilities in their annual financial reports, officials were worried about the impression this gave about the state's fiscal health."}
{"original": "rather than wait for a crisis, north carolina took steps to phase out its retiree medical costs in an orderly and predictable fashion. first, in 2006, it raised the required years of service to qualify for retiree health care from five to 20 years. second, in 2017, the state eliminated health insurance benefits for retirees hired after jan. 1, 2021."}
{"original": "the result will be a steady decline in the number of workers qualifying for opeb over the next two decades until it reaches zero in 2041. the state will begin to realize budget savings over the next decade and can then either spend those savings productively or return them to taxpayers. either bodes well for north carolina's fiscal sustainability and economic climate."}
{"original": "north carolina demonstrates that the politics of reforming retiree medical coverage can be overcome. the problem is that to reform opeb and the fiscal drain it represents, governments or workers must make greater financial contributions to the plans, or benefits must be cut. yet neither governments nor workers want to pay more—and of course workers don't want their benefits cut. reform has thus proved intractable in many states."}
{"original": "north carolina's approach was especially effective because it eliminated benefits only for new hires. current workers are not losing anything that was promised to them when they were hired, which helped the state avoid a confrontation with public employee unions."}
{"original": "furthermore, cutting retiree health benefits is hardly as draconian as it sounds. first, few workers actually stay on the job long enough to qualify for these benefits. in other words, retiree health care is a promised benefit that few workers ever enjoy. second, many employees who retire before they are eligible for medicare now have alternatives through the obamacare exchanges—and some may be able to secure coverage through their spouse or new employment in the private sector."}
{"original": "third, alternatives to government health care plans exist to allow employees to keep their benefits. public employees or their unions could create retiree medical trusts (rmts), which are defined-contribution plans for medical benefits. these trusts would be run by and for their beneficiaries, thus offering greater autonomy and control. police and firefighters in several west coast states have already initiated such programs."}
{"original": "north carolina's experiment can serve as a model for other states in similar fiscal and political circumstances. states that are home to high retiree medical liabilities and relatively weak public sector unions are especially well-positioned to emulate north carolina's opeb reforms. these include alabama, georgia, south carolina, and texas."}
{"original": "state and local governments should consider the trade-off of retiree health care. only a small slice of employees spend their entire careers in public service in the same state to qualify for benefits, and there is limited evidence that these benefits help governments attract and retain a high-quality workforce. meanwhile, by reducing and ultimately eliminating these benefits, states and localities will be able to provide better services to their residents, improve their bond ratings, and enhance their business climate. the benefits of opeb are clearly outweighed by its outsize cost. other states should look to north carolina and stop putting off this critical reform."}

{"original": "health experts said then, as now, that such a policy could contribute to a decline in comprehensive health coverage, and make those that remain much more expensive."}
{"original": "the idea is that younger, healthier individuals would flock to cheaper plans that cover fewer things, while older or sicker persons would face higher premiums for fuller coverage."}

{"original": "association health plans, which already exist, have never been very popular. there have also been cases of them going bankrupt or being charged with fraud."}
