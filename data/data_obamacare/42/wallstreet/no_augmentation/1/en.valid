more importantly, overruling would also likely be seen as breaking the filibuster without voting to get rid of the filibuster. if a provision can be brought into reconciliation bill, ruled out of order by the parliamentarian and then be allowed on a simple majority vote, that is no different than passing the same thing outside of reconciliation with 51 votes, the argument goes. the counterargument is overrides could still be stopped with a supermajority, making it different from scrapping the filibuster.

trump's insistence that climate change is a hoax has put the world economy and the viability of the planet in further danger. he says that the wildfires ravaging the american west are the result of poor forest management. he has depreciated american soldiers' heroism and sacrifice, and has no appreciation or understanding that the economy needs people's heroism to dream up new ideas and risk investing in their development and market entry.

that's a tactic where the party in power would add extra seats to the nine-person supreme court and fill those new seats with their own appointees.
his populist rhetoric has not translated into better pay for less advantaged workers or victims of discrimination. he has sought to erase any sense of economic justice. he cares nothing about the appallingly low wage rates for those at the bottom or about the terrible living standards that these wages afford. and he has done nothing to support the eradication of statistical discrimination—racial, gender, and lgbt+.
the tuition coverage also fell in line with starbucks' history of offering generous health insurance and other benefits to its baristas — a move that helped them attract and retain talent. but by 2014, when the company announced the program, obamacare had made access to health insurance more of a norm for a wider swath of workers. the asu program helped to keep starbucks at the top of the heap when it came to benefits packages, the company's then-ceo howard schultz told the atlantic in 2015.

beef prices finally began to subside last year after soaring almost 20% in 2014 to record highs. buying a beef roast cost 7% less than the year before.
a close look at the democratic platform draft as well as biden's website and interviews with analysts suggests that biden wants to tackle several major challenges confronting those in the second half of life. it lays out the kind of policy framework president obama had, but several initiatives take it a step farther — perhaps an additional two to three steps.
you can make it very clear very soon how you feel about being cut out of this supreme court nomination process, harris said in her address at shaw university in raleigh, n.c.
today, a great many people support biden on these grounds and others. trump stands in the way of the nation regaining a sense of flourishing, equity, and social harmony.
for example, biden wants to roll back trump's 20% long-term capital-gains tax on investments and restore the 39.6% top tax rate for anyone making over $1 million. he'd also close loopholes that wealthy americans avoid taxes on capital gains altogether and raise estate taxes back to the historical norm, according to the draft platform.

infrastructure: probably. while biden has indicated infrastructure will not be a part of his initial package aimed at easing the economic pain caused by the pandemic, it may be in a second round of reconciliation this year. a surge of spending on infrastructure – but limited to five or ten years like the bush tax cuts to avoid the byrd outyear deficit prohibition – could pass parliamentary muster, if written correctly, experts say. it's not a slam dunk, though — the nature of highway trust fund spending, which is not quite appropriations and not exactly direct spending, could be a problem.
but even with these kinds of supports, bergeron suggests potential students weigh whether their degree would provide them with a bigger economic boost if they earned it another way.
who is this parliamentarian and why do they matter?

the estimated 40 million-plus unpaid family caregivers would also get a financial boost. among the ideas biden backs is an annual tax credit of up to $5,000 for informal caregivers to reimburse expenses. unpaid family caregivers would also be able to accrue social security benefits for the time they spend caregiving. and they'd be allowed to make catch-up contributions to retirement accounts, even if they're not earning an income.
some experts think even that's a little high. the kaiser family foundation's analysis suggests that enrollment would be, at most, 15 or 16 million, and that's only if all state enrollment rates matched those of the top 10 states now.
over the past year or so, thousands of people have become eligible to attend college at low or no-cost — and that's not thanks to a new government policy or a sudden drop in tuition levels.

sometimes, it isn't until after the interview that an employee gets a real sense of the company's culture. take into consideration how you fit in and what you're doing to get there. this could take a negative turn for your new job, unfortunately, but that's okay, salemi said. people can become numb to unpleasant situations, such as a rude coworker, which can create workplace conflicts. it's better to be honest about these situations, and take note of what you like and don't like about the place for when you're looking for your next job. if after a few months you don't plan to stick it out, be honest with future interviewers about your values, what you want out of a job and what you can give. you want to be vigilant in the first 100 days, and self-aware, salemi said.
the global coronavirus death toll has now passed 1 million, according to johns hopkins university, which united nations secretary-general antónio guterres described as an agonizing milestone. many regions around the world are still reporting rising numbers of infections, also fueling fears over the impact of a second wave.
so what does merely incidental mean?
which brings us back to the markets and the economy, of course. obamacare, bank bailouts, reckless spending, infrastructure investment and anything else the u.s. government wants to do is a lot easier to do and has a temporarily positive effect on the economy so long as the government can borrow money at close to 0%. and whatever clinton or trump spend our future generation's money on by borrowing trillions will probably seem to work well at least while rates are this low.

today, that competitive pressure is more urgent than ever.
although the trump administration has tried to repeal the aca — obama's signature legislation —and made it less comprehensive, biden would expand the aca with the goal of lowering americans' health care costs. if costs fell, that would be a boon to those in the second half of life and not yet eligible for medicare.

by 2020, 50% of workforce will be remote. here's how.
finally, americans are living with the virtual stagnation of the economy since the early 1970s (interrupted for about a decade by the information revolution). this continuing malaise lies behind wage earners' increased frustration over their relative standing in wage distribution—a sentiment that, more than anything else, accounted for trump's rise. there can be no question that a president biden—unlike president trump—would want to restore the economy to its former glory.
south carolina offers 54 delegates of the 1,991 needed to win the democratic nomination on the first ballot at the party's convention in july. ahead of saturday's primary, sanders led in the delegate tally, followed by buttigieg, biden, warren and klobuchar, according to a tracker by nbc news.

harris didn't answer pence's question. harris and biden say they want to build on obamacare by adding a public health insurance option and lowering the medicaid eligibility age to 60 from 65.
and here's where it gets weird. while many focus on the size of a budget impact — would a $50 million change in revenues over 10 years be merely incidental in a $2 trillion reconciliation bill? — experts warn that the test is not just about the size of fiscal change but also its relation to the policy involved.
phrma and bristol-myers declined to comment, while abbvie, j&j, merck and pfizer didn't respond to requests for comment.
biden is also attentive to the existential threat of continuing climate change. there is a vast litany of problems, such as the burning of fossil fuels causing increased levels of carbon dioxide and rising temperatures. addressing these problems will require government intervention and international cooperation, such as that mandated by the 2015 paris climate agreement, from which trump withdrew the u.s.
health care: the health care proposals are really trying to take obamacare to the next level, says ornstein. it's probably the next thing obama would have done if he could have a third term. the affordable care act [aca] was always a step toward robust universal coverage.
tuition reimbursement programs have been essentially ubiquitous at major employers for years. but those programs, which provide workers with money for tuition after they've already paid it, have relatively low participation rates and are typically geared towards white collar workers looking to improve their skill set, including through earning a graduate degree.
no one can doubt that, if elected, biden would be eager to play a central role in the resumption of the battle against global warming.
this proposal recognizes, if you're going to be serious about home-based and community services, it will take real dollars, says ruth katz, senior vice president for public policy/advocacy at leadingage, the association of nonprofit providers of aging services.
between a coronavirus pandemic that had infected 7.6 million americans as of friday and a high-stakes supreme court case just weeks away, health insurance for people with pre-existing health conditions is on the minds of many.
and there are several ideas to lower prescription drug costs that democrats have pushed for years — including some trump has supported. medicare would be free to negotiate prices with drug companies; makers of medicare-covered prescriptions wouldn't be allowed to raise prices by more than inflation and consumers could legally buy prescription drugs from other countries.
white house conflicts with business are not uncommon. presidents have often been critical of big businesses or how they operate. more recently drugmakers have come under fire for raising prices, for example, and other firms have been assailed for moving their headquarters outside the u.s. in a process known as a corporate inversion.
data-mining software company palantir technologies , and workplace collaboration and planning software provider asana are expected to go public on wednesday via the first direct listings of 2020, according to reports.
they'll use a process called budget reconciliation, not to be confused with talk of unity and political reconciliation. it has been used often for high-profile legislation, including massive tax cuts in 2001, 2003 and 2017 and 2010's affordable care act, also known as obamacare.
they are among the hardest working people, yet the lowest paid workers, says eric kingston, professor of social work at syracuse university. the emphasis on caregiving is long overdue.
the biggest relief, of course, came at the gas station.

while we retain a fairly pro-risk stance in our asset allocation, volatility is likely to remain elevated in the near term — risk assets might continue to be stuck in a 'fat and flat' range, the investment bank's portfolio strategy research team wrote in a note late on monday.
breaking news: trump bestows 'blessing' on proposed oracle-walmart deal for tiktok's u.s. operation
first, biden understands that in america there is still a crushing disparity between the wages of the seriously less-advantaged and those paid to middle-income people—and payments for single mothers do not change that.
obama did not criticize staples again publicly.
so let's look at obama's track record to find evidence of anti-colonial mindset, itself a phrase devoid of much meaning but for argument's sake will translate as anti-western populism.
the same could not be said for insuring vehicles. forget all those funny tv ads about cut-rate plans: auto insurance jumped 5.7% last year.
to hear the current mayor of london, and possibly future prime minister of britain tell it, president barack obama harbors a dislike of the u.k. because of an anti-colonial mindset developed by having a kenyan father.
going all the way back to the early 1900s, presidents have shied away from singling out specific companies. they usually stick to more general, if infrequent, industry criticism and use milder language unlikely to roil stock markets.
for example, walmart recently added purdue global, an all online arm of purdue university that was created when the school acquired kaplan university, a for-profit college, to its list of schools where employees could earn their degrees.
biden's appeal to moderates includes his pledge to build on the affordable care act, or obamacare, named after the president he served under for eight years. long popular with african-american voters, the former vice president has also proposed creating national standards for home appraisals, as part of an effort to stamp out racial discrimination in the real-estate industry.
it remains to be seen whether eight justices will hear the case or nine justices will decide the matter.
shares in abbvie are down 13% this year, astrazeneca is off by 1% and bristol-myers has lost 11%.
what's unprecedented about trump's criticism of amazon.com inc. amzn, -3.44% , however, is the frequency and intensity of his attacks and an apparent personal animus toward company owner jeff bezos.
these are programs that are designed to be revenue generators, whether we call it profit or excess revenue it's basically the same thing, said kinser, the penn state professor.
another large household expense, medical care, also accelerated. the cost of going to the doctor's office or the hospital rose 2.9% in 2015 to mark the fastest increase in three years, the cpi report showed.
the trade group is the pharmaceutical research and manufacturers of america, also known as phrma, and the seven companies are those that were invited to a february grilling by the senate finance committee — abbvie inc. abbv, +0.53% , astrazeneca plc azn, +2.62% azn, +3.64% , bristol-myers squibb co. bmy, +0.83% , johnson & johnson jnj, +0.59% , merck & co. inc. mrk, +0.76% , pfizer inc. pfe, +1.19% and sanofi sa sny, +1.42% san, +1.35% .
trump is following the playbook of other enemies of democracy—here's how to stop him
the authors of the study, john graham and campbell harvey, finance professors at duke's fuqua school of business, also considered and rejected a number of hypotheses to explain the gap between the cost of capital and the return cfos want. for example, it isn't that small companies involve higher risks; large companies actually set a higher hurdle rate than smaller ones.
blanchflower said underemployment is not caused by obamacare because it is so prevalent around the globe.
some employees certainly do benefit from the programs. but the limits on where the perk can be used, what workers can study and how challenging it can be for employees to make it through school while working at the same time mean that the companies have probably run the numbers and know that offering the benefit is not going to be super costly, cappelli said.
this story was published on june 15, 2019 and updated on september 24, 2019.
but that cost could take some time to change the behavior of consumers, since they'll only pay the penalty the following year, alongside their taxes, she said.
but that's not the prime motivation of obama. brexit has emerged as the number-one economic concern for the globe. that was clear from the spring meeting of the international monetary fund, and it's been made by policy makers from tokyo to berlin.
to put a stop to that, byrd proposed a senate rule that was later codified into law. the rule has six thou shalt not provisions about what cannot be included in reconciliation bills. the most prominent are prohibitions against changes to social security, increasing the budget deficit in the so-called out years, years beyond those mentioned in the instructions to the committees, and any changes that have only a merely incidental effect on revenues or spending.
part of the motivation for launching walmart's education benefits program was to help employees continue to build their skills so they're prepared for a long career at the company, malashock said. the company chose to add 14 degree offerings focused on technology to the program last month in part because like many retailers, walmart is becoming more and more of a technology company, malashock said.
these programs are likely poised to grow
for a tool that's been mostly used for partisan purposes for the last 20 years, its name does sound odd. it stems from the technical purpose in the law creating it, that the bills that receive protection from the filibuster are meant to reconcile current law and pending bills in congress to the fiscal targets in the budget resolution.
reading through the draft democratic platform, the cumulative effect is that the federal government would take on a bigger role in everything from retirement security to health care to sustainability. a core idea: animating the greater government activism with policies to improve the general welfare and social connectedness.
it's a focus on the common good and sharing risk and strengthening the safety net, including the retirement safety net, says norm ornstein, political scientist and resident scholar at the american enterprise institute.
a prolonged slog for the nomination would raise the possibility of a contested convention, in which no candidate will win the magic number of delegates on the first ballot at this summer's convention in milwaukee. the last time the democrats' convention went past the first ballot was 1952.
older americans who buy long-term care insurance and pay for it from their retirement savings would get a generous tax break, too.
caregiving, caregivers and long-term care: the most striking part of biden's platform — to me — is its emphasis on supporting the professional long-term care workforce serving older adults in nursing homes, assisted living facilities and in homes, as well as assisting family caregivers.
so far this year, pharma's lobbying spending is staying sizeable. phrma spent $9.91 million to influence washington in the first quarter, according to a disclosure filed in late april. and the q1 total is $10.01 million when the trade group's subsidiaries are included, says a tally from opensecrets.org.
also on the up and up in 2015 was the cost of renting or buying a home. rents climbed 3.7%, the biggest increase in eight years.
in 2015, obama criticized the office superstore staples for supposedly cutting pay for workers and keeping their hours down to avoid health-care costs associated with the law commonly known as obamacare. staples countered by saying the president appears not to have all the facts.
last night as i was closing my computer before taking care of my medically fragile (but less so than ever) daughter, amaris, i saw a picture of donald trump and hillary clinton on a headline on scutify. my happiness about playing with and feeding my daughter was momentarily suspended, as i felt myself stress out about this election once again. long-time readers know that i'm committed to my stance against ever voting for anyone in the republican-democrat regime, but this post isn't about politics. and the point of this intro is that i think it's finally be time to hedge our portfolios for some election-stress discounts coming into the markets.
i think aca supporters should be concerned, bagley told nbc news. not panicked: the lawsuit is weak and the supreme court is unlikely to endorse it. but a small risk of a bad thing is worth worrying about.
either way, the process is opaque, even for the often-byzantine senate. no written decision is formally issued and sometimes even the staff can be unsure why the parliamentarian ruled the way they did or how much weight as a precedent a call has.
on roe vs. wade, the landmark 1973 ruling on abortion, barrett said in 2013 that the public response to controversial cases like roe reflects public rejection of the proposition that [precedent] can declare a permanent victor in a divisive constitutional struggle rather than desire that precedent remain forever unchanging. court watchers embrace the possibility of overruling, even if they may want it to be the exception rather than the rule.
sanders held a rally saturday in warren's home state of massachusetts, and projected confidence as that state's voters prepared to go to polls tuesday. if we have the largest voter turnout in the history of the massachusetts primary, we can win here in massachusetts, we can win the democratic nomination, we can defeat donald trump and we can transform this country, sanders said in boston, according to the boston herald.
after launching the asu-starbucks partnership in 2014, edplus, an institution within asu that designs online courses and degree programs for the school, was able to use that as a model to work with other companies to offer similar programs, said sean hobson, chief design officer at edplus.
in other words, cfos are setting a 14% hurdle rate for new investment even the cost of borrowing money in the bond market, and the imputed cost of borrowing money from investors through the equity market, was around 6% or 7%.
the trump administration is waging a legal fight against the affordable care act, also known as obamacare, arguing that it must be scrapped a decade after its overhaul of u.s. health care xlv, -0.06% . the supreme court is slated to hear arguments on the matter on nov. 10.
it's possible a coronavirus infection would become a pre-existing condition without the aca, according to levitt. he also noted that trump's executive order on pre-existing conditions carries no force of law, and he has never released a plan to replace the aca or protect people with pre-existing conditions.
the lowest-income americans would be automatically enrolled in the public option without health care premiums; they could opt out at any time.
trump listed the tasks he plans to accomplish in his first 100 days of president before he was elected, during a speech in gettysburg, pa. in it, he said he intended to impose term limits on congress, introduce 10 pieces of legislation that would repeal obamacare, fund the construction of the southern border wall, and rebuild military bases, among other priorities. thus far, he has pushed to repeal obamacare — but support came up short and therefore the affordable care act is still in place — and asked congress for a little more than $4 billion to begin building the wall. as of april 18, trump's approval rating was 42% — down from 45% when he was inaugurated, according to gallup.
the tax cuts and jobs act and subsequent efforts to get extenders and clarifications passed have been big drivers in the rise in lobbying spending since 2016, said jeff hauser, founder and director of the revolving door project, which aims to track corporate political influence and is part of the center for economic and policy research, a left-leaning think tank. there also has been considerable lobbying around drug pricing, tariffs and other trade issues, immigration and big tech fdn, -0.36% matters.
the draft platform backs a national minimum wage of $15 an hour for the caregiving workforce. in addition, they'd get up to 12 weeks of federally provided paid family and medical leave.
pence didn't answer the question, though, at another point in the evening, he said the trump administration has plans to improve health care and protect pre-existing conditions for every american.

joe biden's running mate also criticized trump and the republican-led senate's decision to ignore the late liberal supreme court justice ruth bader ginsburg's final wish to hold off the nomination to replace her until after the next president is chosen — and asked voters to make them pay on nov. 3.

she and her husband, the 2012 republican presidential nominee mitt romney, have some two dozen grandchildren, in addition to their five sons. she said that her book includes confessions to a few really, really bad parenting moments but that she and her husband live for their kids' kids:
the disclosed outlays by these enterprises to influence washington climbed to a total of about $70 million in 2018, the second-highest level ever behind their spending of $87 million in 2009, when obamacare was beginning to shake up the health-care sector. that's shown in the adjacent chart and based on data from opensecrets.org, a website tracking money in politics that's run by the nonpartisan center for responsive politics.
we'll have to continue to freshly analyze the economy, cycles and markets regardless.
the paper argues that the labor department doesn't do a good job in measuring underemployment. its current measure of part time for economic reasons does not ask how many hours the underemployed want to work.
the attacks on amazon, along with a spate of new white house tariffs, have clearly unnerved investors. the dow jones industrial average djia, -0.46% sank on monday after trump hinted that the post office contract could be reworked in a way that would be more costly for amazon, and after a recovery on tuesday, fell once more on wednesday.
in total for the first quarter, the trade group and the seven companies spent about $25 million, suggesting they could set a new record this year.
at issue is full employment, the level where the unemployment rate can't go lower without resulting in higher inflation.
the white house didn't stop there. the justice department, led by robert kennedy, probed the price increases and reportedly sent fbi agents to interview steel executives at their homes. the defense department also shifted some submarine contracts to smaller steelmakers that declined to raise prices.
the draft platform says democrats will cap out-of-pocket drug costs for seniors, but doesn't offer a dollar amount for the cap. it also talks about ensuring that effective treatments for chronic health conditions are available at little or no cost, but doesn't explain how that would happen.
the idea for the program came from talking to the company's employees and learning that many had a desire to finish college, but couldn't afford it, said noelle novoa, a senior manager for social impact communications at the company. starbucks officials realized they could help, she said.
there are 54 million non-elderly adults with a pre-existing condition that would have resulted in coverage denial without the aca, according to the kaiser family foundation.
here's what you can do to make your first 100 days on the job count:
but the first 100 days can give new employees a false sense of security, too. once you get the hang of it and are in a routine, you don't take the time to take stock and pause, said vicki salemi, a career expert for jobs site monster.com. it's important to do that while things are still fresh.
improve social security's long-term solvency (its trust fund is expected to be depleted by 2035 or perhaps sooner due to the pandemic) by having americans with high wages pay the same social security payroll taxes that middle-class families pay. the platform didn't offer specifics, but biden has said he'd require people to pay social security taxes on income over roughly $400,000. today, employment earnings of up to $137,700 are subject to social security payroll taxes.
'president trump and his party and judge barrett will overturn the affordable care act. and they won't stop there. they have made clear that they want to overturn roe vs. wade and restrict reproductive rights and freedoms.'

big pharma is clearly feeling the heat, said the campaign for sustainable rx pricing in a statement on phrma's first-quarter lobbying. that campaign, which regularly criticizes drugmakers, is backed by health insurers, hospital operators, physician groups, the aarp and pharmacy benefit managers, a sector that also has drawn flak on capitol hill for its role in pricing.

the biggest change here would convert tax-deductible contributions to 401(k)s, which favor higher-income families, into tax credits equalizing the tax break for all income levels. ghilarducci thinks this would lead to most people eligible for 401(k) plans putting at least some money into them.

when there's a question of whether a provision would be successfully challenged on the floor via the byrd rule, the issue is usually argued first in the parliamentarian's office by staff from the two parties. the parliamentarian may rule then or withhold a ruling until the issue is brought up on the floor.
immigration reform: sort of. some parts of a plan similar to what was proposed by a bipartisan group of senators in 2013 would squarely be within the bounds of reconciliation, experts say. but some other portions, particularly those without any revenue or spending effects, would not be, leaving the possibility of a swiss cheese immigration bill with loopholes.
new york (project syndicate)—commentators have offered many reasons why one should vote in november for joe biden, the democratic nominee for u.s. president. yet the economic dimension of the election has been of little interest to pundits, and few, if any, economists speaking on the subject have bothered to highlight how the outcome bears directly on people's welfare.
the steel industry backed down, but the standoff frightened wall street much like trump's attacks on amazon today. the dow began to slide in 1961, but it sank another 20% after the steel standoff.

one reply from pence in particular could leave millions of americans with pre-existing health conditions wishing for more.
companies are starting to have a better understanding of this trend and the skills required from their workers to meet their business needs — and they're willing to pay for workers to meet those needs, said jaime fall, the director of upskill america at the aspen institute, an employer initiative promoting training and advancement opportunities for workers.
a recording that surfaced last week sheds light on some current approaches to washington lobbying, even as it mostly got attention for its implications in trump's ongoing impeachment trial. the tape — which was released by a lawyer for lev parnas, an indicted associate of rudy giuliani — features donors to a trump super pac making requests such as backing for a 500-mile highway that would be used just by self-driving trucks, a new york times report said. another donor pushed the president to further limit steel imports.
climate change: while a concern for americans of all ages, a next avenue reader survey of our 50+ readers taken before the pandemic found climate change was the no. 1 election issue for them.
the spinoff bills — a tax bill, a spending bill (or a combined deficit-increasing or deficit-reducing bill that includes both tax and spending changes) and debt-ceiling bill — are immune to the filibuster in the senate, meaning they can be passed with 50 votes and the vice president's vote as the tiebreaker. but if parts of the bills stray from budget-related issues, they can get stripped out individually and require a supermajority, usually 60 votes, to retain.
trump's disregard for this fiscal profligacy has set a precedent for unnecessary deficits in future administrations. (of course, the deficit incurred more recently in responding to the pandemic was unavoidable and, under the circumstances, beneficial.)
even though the unemployment rate is at historic lows in many countries this still does not suggest that these country's labor markets are anywhere close to full employment, the paper said.
you all have the knowledge and expertise to solve these problems. we lack that knowledge and expertise, but if you don't solve it, we will, said burgess, the ranking member of the house energy & commerce committee's health subcommittee. he added that the companies probably won't like lawmakers' solutions. the hearing was titled lowering prescription drug prices: deconstructing the drug supply chain.
for all these reasons, it is vitally important that the people vote for the biden-harris ticket. trump has gravely weakened the nation's economy, while biden has shown over his life that he cares about people's chances for prosperity and rewarding lives—for achieving the american dream.
michelle malashock, a walmart spokeswoman, said the company isn't yet comfortable sharing the amount of money it's spending on the program, but she described it as a significant investment.
even better, the cost of buying groceries to prepare meals at home actually fell for the first time in six years and only the second time since 1976.
biden's platform also embraces state medicaid home- and community-based care for low-income adults. its $450 billion initiative targets getting 800,000 people off waiting lists for community care.
first, the house and senate have to agree to a budget resolution, something that happened regularly until the late 1990s but now only happens when both chambers are held by the same party. in that resolution, lawmakers lay out tax, spending and deficit targets for the years ahead and give instructions to specific committees to write legislation to hit those targets.
european stocks also fell, as political uncertainty and fears of a second wave of the coronavirus pandemic concerned investors. the pan-european stoxx 600 xx:sxxp was 0.3% lower in early trading, after enjoying its best one-day advance since june 22 on monday. asian markets were mixed overnight despite wall street's gains.
trump's misguided crusade to reduce the harmless trade deficit has shrunk world trade, thus worsening the efficiency of resource allocation at home and abroad.
companies are forming to help facilitate partnerships between businesses and colleges. one is denver-based guild education, which was founded in 2015 and works with companies like walmart to streamline the system students use to access the programs, offer support services and the process by which companies pay the tuition.

americans were also able to pig out more cheaply, as size of the u.s. pig herd hit the highest level since the government began keeping track in the late 1980s. the cost of pork fell 7%, mainly because of the cheapest ham prices in several years. shoppers can buy fresh hams for $2 a pound or less in stores now.
meanwhile, our lives, jobs, the fed, the e.u., the currency wars, energy, tech, innovation, and everything else that makes up these cycles, these economies, these societies we live in will go on.
it's become pretty trendy for these big corporations to offer higher education benefits, tuition benefits, degree programs, things along those lines to help students, said kevin kinser, a professor at penn state university and head of the school's department of education policy studies. it clearly represents the anxiety around attending college particularly for lower-income individuals that many of these companies seem to be targeting for employment.
set up routine meetings with the boss
one expert said a republican proposal to split the ninth circuit of federal courts — a long-sought goal of conservatives who see the circuit as dominated by liberal judges — was dropped after the senate parliamentarian indicated that even though the change would have fiscal impact and include the autopilot direct spending reconciliation is used for, the budget impact would be seen as incidental to the policy change involved.

more than 100 million people also had health conditions that, without the law, would possibly result in higher premiums and coverage limits, wrote larry levitt, executive vice president for health policy at the foundation, which focuses public health matters.
there's just such an increase in activity from lawmakers that it's really not surprising to see an increase in lobbying activity as well, lindsay bealor greenleaf, a former registered lobbyist for drug manufacturers, told marketwatch. she is currently director of policy at consulting firm advi health, where drugmakers and physician groups are among her clients.
in some cases, the employers acknowledge these challenges. over the course of offering its program, starbucks realized that roughly one in five of its employees had an academic history that would mean they couldn't get into asu, novoa said. in response, they launched a program in 2017 called pathway to admission, which offers employees who don't meet asu's admissions standards the opportunity to take up to 10 courses for free to qualify.
over the past several years, demographic trends have caused the number of high school graduates to drop. that means colleges have fewer students to pull from and some are struggling to balance their budgets amid enrollment challenges.
in other words: future economic growth isn't expected to benefit poor people, which will accelerate the aca's overall costs.
in addition to being a great recruitment tool, cappelli's research found that tuition assistance can also help retain employees. workers stick around while they use the benefit in order to finish their degree, which often takes many years because slugging through college part-time while working can be a slow process, the research found.
meanwhile, abbvie laid out $2.68 million during this year's first three months, astrazeneca spent $1.06 million, bristol-myers paid $1.2 million, j&j shelled out $1.46 million, merck ran through $2.76 million, pfizer disbursed $4.2 million and sanofi, $1.67 million.

if president joe biden cannot gather enough bipartisan support for his $1.9 trillion covid-19 relief plan, democrats will look to another way to get at least some of it through on a simple senate majority with 51 votes.
biden also favors bipartisan legislation offering greater protections for older workers against being workforce discrimination due to their age.
a public health jobs corps might be an option for experienced workers looking for encore careers.
in attacking institutions from the fbi to the centers for disease control and prevention, trump is hollowing out the governmental structure. in imposing pointless obstacles that lead to trade wars, he has alienated america's allies. in his admiration for dictators and authoritarian leaders, he is helping them to establish 21st-century fascism. and his chronic lying from the office of the president undermines the people's confidence in their government.
the report released thursday projected 2016 enrollment of 12 million, one million less than the agency's projection of 13 million just two months ago, and significantly less than a 21 million estimate a year ago.
obama is concerned with a near-term global economic shock from a u.k. withdrawal from the european union, which would be felt mostly keenly, of course, by big corporations.
$15 minimum wage: probably not. mandates have a speckled history in reconciliation in general and even then the size of a minimum wage hike on the federal budget would likely make it too small to be more than merely incidental. a broader analysis of its economic impact could show a larger effect but that would be similar to republicans' failed effort to use dynamic scoring to show a smaller revenue loss from tax cuts in 2017.
now, more than 12,000 starbucks employees participate in the program and nearly 3,000 have graduated, she said.
the outlays to influence the federal government hit $3.47 billion in 2019, the biggest total since 2010's spending of $3.51 billion. the annual figures, shown in the chart below, come from a center for responsive politics analysis of lobbying disclosures filed through last week.
when asked to comment on its recent lobbying spending, a sanofi spokeswoman said the company regularly engages with policymakers to promote public policies that support patient access to the medicines they need and an environment that promotes and rewards innovation and scientific advancement.
the growth in online education over the past 15 or so years had made it much easier for companies to offer these programs at scale to workers across the country and even around the world. companies are typically partnering with at least one institution with online programs in offering this benefit.
a related hangup is that a reconciliation change must make a change in outlays or revenues or the terms and conditions under which outlays are made or revenues collected, with the meaning of terms and conditions not always clear.
the plan falls well short of universal long-term care coverage, though.

why would they do that? it turns out that many cfos are simply overestimating their company's cost of capital. for example in one survey the average cfo told duke that his company had to pay 10% for its money, even though his own calculations, and public data from the stock and bond markets, meant that the number was only around 6%.

but nicholas bagley, a university of michigan law professor, is among the experts who have argued that it's not clear how trump's supreme court pick, amy coney barrett, would rule in the suit, which he said is significantly weaker than a past challenge to the aca.
biden's draft platform would give everyone the option of choosing a public health insurance option like medicare. intriguingly, it also proposes lowering the medicare age from 65 to 60, for those who want to enroll earlier than they can today. that would benefit early retirees, whether they were laid off or voluntarily left employment, perhaps to start their own businesses.
the president first started bashing amazon on twitter in december 2015 after polls showed he was the frontrunner to win the republican nomination. the editorial page of the washington post, acquired by bezos a few years earlier, became an early and frequent critic of the future president.
after climbing 410 points on monday, the dow jones industrial average djia, -0.39% was 0.6%, or 166 points lower in late morning trading. the s&p 500 spx, -0.16% slipped 0.5% and the nasdaq comp, +0.09% was 0.2% down.
the first 100 days of a new job are crucial for both employer and employee. for the employer, those days set the stage of an employer's work ethics and productivity. for an employee, it helps gauge if this was the right move — executives and human resources staff say new hires tend to know if they're going to stay with a job for the long haul within the first six months. plus, keeping track of your work and progress builds good habits.
retirement security and savings: here, the approach is pragmatic rather than bold. the democratic draft platform doesn't favor universal retirement savings plans (an idea floated by various republican and democratic administrations since president carter). i was looking for the word to delink pensions from employers, said ghilarducci. i don't see it.
in a new paper, david blanchflower, and david bell, an economics professor at the university of stirling, argue that, in the wake of the great recession, underemployment is a better measure of labor-market health than the unemployment rate. the fact that millions of workers want to work more hours means that the labor market still has plenty of slack.
kaiser's cox noted that there could be some uptick in the enrollment rates in the next or following years, since a phased-in penalty on being uninsured reached its cap this year. (households will pay $969 on average for remaining uninsured in 2016, according to a kaiser family foundation analysis.)
you might think somebody cynical would say, 'they're just staying until they get a degree' — and so what?, he said.
what employees/potential students should keep in mind
joe biden decisively won south carolina's democratic presidential primary on saturday, according to projections, giving the former vice president his first victory in the 2020 nominating battle and a burst of momentum ahead of the critical super tuesday contests next week.
people have talked about it for a long time, says katz.
biden's campaign may enjoy only a short-lived boost, however, as he faces a steeper test on super tuesday. sanders is topping polls of states including california and texas, and is the front-runner in national surveys, according to realclearpolitics.
the cost of putting food on the table also eased after a big runup in the previous year. food prices rose just 0.8% in 2015 — the smallest gain since 2009 — with most of the increase coming early on. prices had jumped 3.4% in 2014.
companies, now that the labor market is tight, are trying to figure out what's a smart way to attract and, especially, retain employees, said peter cappelli, the director of wharton's center for human resources at the university of pennsylvania. and these programs tend to work in that regard, according to a study conducted by cappelli. he found that offering tuition assistance allows companies to hire better quality and more productive employees, making the cost worth it.

i think maybe crazy bernie has it, trump said about sanders at a rally in north charleston, s.c., after asking audience members to cheer for the democrat they thought he could beat the easiest in november. sanders has called trump the most dangerous president in modern u.s. history.
the aca, also known as obamacare, outlawed health insurance carriers from increasing prices or denying coverage for people due to their pre-existing conditions.
we know the workforce is changing and we believe that our associates want to be in the position to come along on the ride with us, she said.
despite that, it's often seen as a black box — what is allowed under it isn't always clear. that's because, according to experts, it actually isn't clear. the limitations are vague and subject to the whims of the senate parliamentarian, who doesn't provide written guidance.
primers exist from a variety of sources, including congressional research service, the committee for a responsible federal budget, the liberal center on budget and policy priorities and the conservative heritage foundation.
• immigration. one could make the argument that obama's policies, which encourage or at least don't discourage latin american migration, are anti-western. but they sure aren't populist, as corporate titans overwhelmingly support increased migration.

in fact, biden is calling for increases in social security benefits and no benefit cuts, says teresa ghilarducci, professor of economics at the new school for social research and the director of the schwartz center for economic policy analysis. no sneaky cuts as a result of raising the retirement age.
left unsaid by johnson, of course, is that states as diverse as texas and massachusetts share that authority, not always happily. and the u.s. has ceded authority to international institutions, notably the world trade organization, on key economic issues.
south carolina was widely seen as a must-win for biden, who is aiming to be the moderate alternative to self-described democratic socialist sanders.
arguably the first major example of these programs is a partnership between starbucks sbux, +2.24% and arizona state university that began in 2014. when the program initially launched, the company paid for starbucks employees working an average of 20 hours per week to finish up the last two years of their degree for free through asu's online program. in 2015, the company expanded the program to cover four years of tuition.
so how does the increase in lobbying spending square with president donald trump's promise to drain the swamp?
the parties typically able to negotiate a deal whereby employees have their entire tuition bill covered. under more traditional tuition reimbursement plans, the company money functioned as sort of voucher that offset the cost partly, but not completely. but this new setup also means that to receive the benefit, employees have to attend specific schools and in some cases earn specific credentials.
the focus is less on starting with what universities have, but more on starting with the actual problem the organization is facing, and translating that into how a university can help the employer, the employee and the community, he said.
i'll buy another tranche of these same puts if the stock markets rally another 2%-3% in the next couple of weeks. i'll still be net long overall in my personal portfolio, as i have plenty of long revolution investment stocks that i want to hold steady. but i'd rather start hedging while our portfolios are through the roof, especially given the current setup for the stock market and the election.
firm profitability, or survival, is taking precedence over worker's hours preferences, the paper said.

the federal reserve is making a huge error in believing that labor markets are so tight that interest rates must move higher, a leading academic said monday.

and as for a dislike of british empire — the u.k. turning more inward by exiting the european union is surely the most anti-empire move of all.
the new rash of tuition help is geared towards a different audience — low-wage workers who may not have a college degree. they're also typically structured differently. with these new initiatives, the company often pays the employee's tuition directly to the school through an agreement the two parties have worked out. in some cases the programs are facilitated through a third party that processes the tuition payments and allows workers to access the courses and degrees offered relatively seamlessly.
after the financial crisis, former federal reserve chairman ben bernanke pushed zero interest rates and quantitative easing to get companies to invest more in the economy. he figured that zirp and qe would drive down the cost of capital for corporations. they did. but he, and everyone else, has been baffled that this hasn't unleashed quite the flood of new investment that you'd expect. and now we know why.
the team said it would take more investor optimism around growth for stocks and other risky assets to breakout in a more sustained way. that would likely require falling uncertainty around the u.s. election and positive vaccine developments, said the strategists, led by christian mueller-glissmann.

another important part of the first 100 days is to create a network of people you can talk to — get to know people, be friendly with everyone around you, whether they're above or below you on the ranks, and build relationships, larssen said. these friendships help employees feel connected to their jobs — about two-thirds of 716 full-time workers with six or more workplace friends said they loved their company, and 55% said work relationships were very to extremely important to their quality of life, according to a 2014 workforce mood tracker report conducted by employee recognition firm globoforce.
for example, it doesn't include much to benefit middle-income recipients of long-term care and their families, howard gleckman, senior fellow at the urban institute, recently wrote for forbes. these are the millions of people who are not poor enough to be eligible for medicaid, but do not have sufficient resources to purchase assistance on their own, he said.
the biden-harris bernie sanders-inspired, socialist health care agenda would bankrupt u.s. taxpayers and eliminate quality access to health care for millions of americans, said ken farnaso, deputy national press secretary. president trump has fought to safeguard patients with pre-existing conditions, lower prescription drug prices, lower premiums, and will always put the health of patients first. the choice couldn't be more clear in november.
highlights and analysis of the draft democratic party platform:
the covid-19 pandemic is about to enter its most treacherous phase
one week after election day, the supreme court will hear arguments in a case filed by an array of republican attorneys general seeking to strike down the aca, known an obamacare. with the individual mandate penalty now at $0, the entire law falls apart, they argue.
this report was first published on jan. 27, 2020.
whether that is a reason for the u.k. to stay is another matter. but the very last thing obama should be accused of is populism.
it's because major employers from mcdonald's mcd, -0.27% to disney dis, -1.28% have launched or expanded programs that allow some of their employees to attend certain colleges and take certain courses on the company's dime. walmart wmt, -0.03% announced in june that the retail giant would extend its educational assistance benefits program to high school students. through the program, teens working at walmart will have access to flexible schedules, free standardized test prep and up to seven hours of free college credit.
oh, and that new big-screen hdtv? prices of televisions tumbled 15%.
trump on friday night urged republicans to vote in south carolina's democratic primary, and pick who he described as the weakest candidate. the state's open primary means voters may participate in any contest. south carolina's republican party canceled its primary, one of just a handful of states to scrap gop nominating contests this cycle.
i am definitely going to be involved in the hearings and performing my role and responsibility on the senate judiciary committee, harris said.
the federal government's efforts to rein in pharmaceutical prices have included bills that aim to deter pharma companies from blocking or delaying generic competition, as well as a trump administration plan to curb rebates that have gone to pharmacy benefit managers. in addition, another bill would require drug makers to justify large price hikes and high launch prices.

in our call of the day, goldman sachs gs, -1.25% strategists said they remained 'pro-risk' but warned risky assets may be stuck in a 'fat and flat range' unless election uncertainty eased.
ask your boss for regular meetings, where you can both track progress, larssen said. people tend to wait until the boss says now is the time to check in, she said, but being proactive is a better choice, she added. employees who had routine meetings with their managers were almost three times as likely to be engaged in their jobs than those who didn't have meetings, according to a 2015 gallup survey. also, if anything is in fact misaligned with your job description or what was discussed during the interview, talk about that too — just make sure to bring solutions to the problems you want to bring up, salemi said. and always mention how what you want or need can help the business.
balancing work and school often means students may struggle to make it through the program in a timely fashion. in addition, achieving success through online programs — what many of these partnerships offer — can be particularly challenging for students who have traditionally struggled in higher education.
health care was the leading issue among south carolina's democratic voters, according to the associated press. sanders' agenda includes medicare for all, canceling student debt and reducing income inequality, and president donald trump has been eager to paint the vermont senator and other democrats as a threat to american prosperity and the u.s. stock market djia, -0.39% , even as it reels from the coronavirus outbreak. stocks just wrapped up their worst week since 2008.
sure, you wouldn't ok a project unless it offered a healthy return over your cost of capital. you want to make a profit, and you want a margin of safety. but demanding a return that's twice your cost of capital is quite something.
one facet of obamacare is that it expanded medicaid eligibility. the cbo now expects a bump in medicaid sign-ups — up to 11 million enrolled this year and 15 million by 2026, per the report — citing new economic projections and a decrease in the share of future wage growth projected to go to lower-income people.

lower fuel costs also led to a 3% decline in the price of airfare.
on tuesday, the company went even further, saying workers could apply for one of seven bachelor's degrees and two career diplomas in health-related fields. the degrees include health science and healthcare management through purdue university global, southern new hampshire university, bellevue university and wilmington university. the career diplomas are for jobs as pharmacy technicians and opticians.

donald trump's washington? no. try the kennedy administration during a 1962 standoff with the u.s. steel industry.
still, analysts like gleckman applaud biden for grasping the need for better long-term care support and services.
biden, having grown up in the steelmaking region of pennsylvania, can hardly be blind to the deprivations and pain of low-paid workers. so, if elected, we would have a president responsive to legislative initiatives for subsidies designed to pull up these workers' meager compensation.
with the eyes of the world set to be on trump and biden later on tuesday, the goldman strategist said the first debate could be an important catalyst for investors to assess risks.
and indeed, novola said the tuition assistance is attractive to prospective employees. roughly 60% of new hires said they're interested in learning more about the program and 17% of applicants said the perk is the driving reason they applied to work at starbucks.
ideally, tuition benefit programs are designed in a way that address a skills gap within an employer's workforce or other challenge a company may be facing, said vivek sharma, the chief executive officer of instride, a company launched out of arizona state university this year that helps employers design and manage these programs.

in the early 1980s, democratic sen. robert byrd of west virginia, already suspicious of anything that allowed bills to bypass normal senate rules, was alarmed by the number of extraneous measures his fellow senators were trying to stuff into a reconciliation bill. (according to one expert consulted for this article, bipartisan policy center senior vice president bill hoagland, it was a provision dealing with coast guard user fees that a senator had been previously unable to pass that drew byrd's ire.)
for workers without access to employer-sponsored retirement savings plans, biden would offer employers incentives to create automatic 401(k)s for employees.
underscoring washington's interest in lowering drug prices, white house press secretary sarah sanders on april 30 said president donald trump and top democratic lawmakers agreed during a much-anticipated infrastructure meeting that they should get together again in the near future to discuss prices for prescription medicines. trump feels drug prices should be much lower than they are today, sanders also said.
it's not like i'm changing my stance, but the time to hedge is when you can and not when you have to. but the election looms, and those who want clinton or trump and think that their candidate will be best for the stock market will become increasingly worried about the possibility that their candidate will lose.
companies that offer these programs say they're a valuable investment in their workforce. disney, launched its aspire program last year with an initial investment of $150 million over five years and plans to add up to $25 million more each year. thousands of employees are taking classes through the program, bob iger, disney's ceo told shareholders in march. nothing would make me happier than if we had 100% of our eligible cast members take full advantage of this opportunity, he said.

this is an absolutely classic error, it is the kind of error that ends recoveries, blanchflower said, in an interview.
for evidence, the authors note that wage growth remains relatively paltry in this expansion. underemployment reduces wage pressure.
so what's behind the growth in these programs and what does it mean for students, colleges and companies? we break it down.
the fed's latest estimate for full employment is a range between 4.1% and 4.7%. the unemployment rate stood at 3.9% in july.
but there is also a positive argument for supporting biden.
