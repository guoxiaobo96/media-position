republicans opposed the legislation from the start, saying it infringed on individuals and businesses as it aimed to insure millions more americans and control spiraling medical costs. texas and other gop states, which joined the national federation of independent business in the first obamacare suit known as nfib v. sebelius, have continued to challenge provisions of the law.
now, the question remains if mccarthy – who has a close relationship with trump – would be able to overcome his past obstacles.
you're correct. the state department advises against travel in that particular part of the region right now. it is dangerous. people need to be cautious. and we do what we can to ensure the safety of americans who travel. that part of the world right now is obviously a very, very challenging situation.
the term carpet bombing dates back to world war ii, when the allies bombarded broad swaths of nazi germany and japan, killing thousands of civilians. as technology advanced, enabling the military to conduct more precise airstrikes, the united states shifted towards narrowly targeted attacks. during the gulf war, the united states used smart weapons systems designed to carry out attacks with surgical accuracy.
this provision could take longer to roll out since it's an entirely new benefit.
campaigns and super pacs are not allowed to coordinate on advertising, but the unified front against trump comes just one week before the iowa caucuses and continue cruz's theme of painting the new york billionaire as out-of-touch with iowa values.
the executive order, which also paused the us refugee program and halted the entry of syrian refugees indefinitely, set off mass protests around the country. within 24 hours, judges were hearing arguments against it. now, after seeing it blocked in multiple venues, trump will have to decide if he wants a supreme court showdown or to go back to the drawing board.
so, in a word, it is turnout, getting these younger and newer voters out to caucus in about an hour-and-a-half's time -- wolf.

and in an ironic twist, los angeles mayor eric garcetti (among others) pointed to a 2012 supreme court case to explain why they're so confident. the ruling in nfib vs. sebelius, which allowed states to reject medicaid expansion without the threat of losing pre-existing funds, set a precedent trump's opponents say will prevent him from using federal money as a tool to coerce local governments.
now, with the foot soldiers of his republican majority under siege in their home districts, the blustering outsider who chalked up his predecessors' failures to their lack of will or guile, is seeing his own challenged daily.
ellison grabs the single-payer torch: minnesota rep. keith ellison, the dnc deputy chair, is the new lead sponsor of the house single-payer health care bill, taking over the title from former rep. john conyers. the house allowed the largely symbolic switcheroo by unanimous consent on wednesday, but it was an important one for folks who didn't want the legislation attached to conyers' name after his resignation amid sexual harassment allegations last year. the movement carries on, ellison said in an interview that afternoon. i remain a staunch advocate of the aca, but we can imagine a world in which we can have universal health care styled on a 'medicare for all' bill.

several democratic sources pointed out that there has been no significant opposition effort mounted to the plan -- no big outside spending to attack the plan, no unified push by gop campaign or advocacy groups to puncture the growing bubble of momentum.
now, the tables have turned. democrats are piling on trump, accusing him of breaking his campaign promise not to touch the federal health care program for the elderly.
yet, there is a body of academic literature to suggest that the court does respond to public opinion. that is, the court is directly influenced by the public.
and i think what he is trying to do is that he is taking a new approach to what is usually a traditional process, which is trying to build up a whole lot of buzz, trying to get a whole lot of free media, and then build a new coalition, some evangelicals, some independent voters, new voters that he expects to come and support him, because he is a very untraditional candidate, someone who can challenge the status quo.

i learned based on the polling data that they want everything that's in the plan, biden said. not a joke. everything that's in the plan.
– asked if congress should get more involved in the process, he said: absolutely, absolutely, absolutely. i will credit trump, which i very rarely do, to put his finger on a real problem. i do not want to see the continued de-industrialization of the loss of good paying jobs, whether it's steel, aluminum, or any other industry. we need serious legislation.
you know, i said everyone would say they oppose obamacare, but there's actually one candidate on that stage – well, actually technically speaking now not on that stage – who doesn't say that, cruz said. donald is entitled to have that view. you might even call that view a new york value. you know, as donald might observe, both he and bernie sanders are native new yorkers.

the decision came after an internal debate about how to proceed in the wake of a december court ruling that invalidated the entire affordable care act. trump's justice department moved to back the court's decision. but that decision – while important in terms of keeping a campaign promise to the president's base – has highlighted the administration's lack of health care policy going forward.
i'm a glass-half-full person so i prefer to emphasize the hopes and the dreams. i look at where we are today and where citizens of america are today and i hope that we can move forward positively so that it's tomorrow and the day after are always a better day. and that would be job-wise, opportunity-wise, because there are opportunities. hopefully everybody can have those.
another complication for ginsburg was that in late spring she had fallen on the marble floor of her bathroom and cracked several ribs. there was nothing to be done except to work through the pain.
and of course, the bernie sanders camp is hoping to get the young people in, those first-time caucus goers to cast their vote.
the campaign that never ends: sanders on friday told cnn's jake tapper that superdelegates should be eliminated entirely. in a statement on the dnc's moves saturday, hillary clinton praised other reforms but didn't mention superdelegates at all.
that was, in part, because of the presence of conservative challenger danny tarkanian in the race.

trump's short saturday swing through las vegas was aimed largely at bolstering heller, who is running for re-election in a state hillary clinton won in 2016. just before his speech to the state gop, he held a backstage fundraiser for heller.
but the defeat shed light on the hurdles progressives will face in passing a $15 minimum wage legislation and a new path forward is unclear. an unlikely option is to introduce a separate bill and try to get enough senators on board to clear the 60-vote threshold, but democrats are not fully united behind the proposal. an even more difficult option would be to eliminate the filibuster, which would lower the 60-vote threshold, and therefore require fewer votes to pass the minimum wage legislation.
beto o'rourke says he supports universal health care, but he wants to take a different path to get there than many of his more progressive rivals for the 2020 democratic presidential nomination.
the president hailed obamacare for reducing the uninsured rate from 16% in 2010 to 9.1% in 2015 and providing more comprehensive coverage for millions of americans. he also credited health reform for helping slow the growth rate of health care costs in recent years.
but his four fellow conservatives believed that if the individual mandate was going down, it should take the whole law with it. they believed all the pieces were interlocked. roberts thought the individual mandate was entwined with only two other provisions, those known as the community rating and guaranteed issue. the community-rating section prevented insurers from charging some individuals higher premiums than others based on health status. the guaranteed-issue section required insurers to cover people regardless of pre-existing conditions.

the ballot measures come a year after maine's residents gave the thumbs up to expansion by a 59% to 41% margin in a first-of-its-kind referendum. however, it has yet to go into effect there as republican governor paul lepage continues to resist implementing it. the maine supreme judicial court last week ordered the governor to submit an expansion plan to the federal government.

the evening's theme, per the white house, was spring's renewal, drawing upon nature and florals for inspiration. tables covered in white tablecloths were adorned with white and green floral arrangements, tall white candlesticks, and white house china (it was not immediately clear which administration's table setting was used sunday evening).
in a memo to senior white house staff detailing several recent public polls, mike donilon, one of biden's closest advisers, said of the opposition: rather than being cost free, this approach has been quite damaging to them.
trump claimed in michigan that real median household income had increased by $10,000 during his presidency.
cruz: well, look, there isn't a rift.
there were 70 local television appearances by senior administration officials and surrogates during a three-week period. an oval office meeting between biden and a bipartisan group of governors and mayors garnered major local coverage.

even before today, there was speculation. obviously there are ambitions out there, one gop member told cnn, speaking anonymously to discuss the state of the race freely. scalise and mccarthy had already been positioning themselves for the next leadership race. they're already doing favors for members, hosting members, doing fundraisers for members, helping members get legislation through.

in late august, mcconnell announced that he would appoint a bipartisan committee – referred to as a gang – to make recommendations on how to commemorate the late senator's legacy. mcconnell's office has not yet responded to a cnn request for comment this week as to whether the committee had ever been appointed and, if so, what work it has done so far to move toward the goal to memorialize mccain.
bernie sanders' plan will save people thousands of dollars. that's completely changing the health care system and that's just indicative of the way he looks at the economy in general and again, it's a political revolution and people are thirsty for that. they really understand that the system is corrupt and they want to change that, and bernie sanders represents a movement.

scalia and the other conservatives were livid at the development. scalia believed the taxing-power possibility had never truly been discussed in court, calling it a fly-by-night briefing. kennedy thought roberts had presented his interpretation as judicial modesty, when it amounted instead to a vast judicial overreaching.

the public knows them as co-ops. they're officially called consumer operated and oriented plans in the health law. eleven are still in business, but four in oregon, ohio, connecticut and illinois will disappear by fall due to financial insolvency. oregon's health co-op and connecticut's healthyct were told to close by their state's regulators last week. tuesday, the land of lincoln mutual health insurance co. in illinois was ordered to close by state regulators.

two: as the legal fallout from the flynn plea agreement rattles the west wing, the timing also could impact administration morale – which in turn can have an impact on personnel decisions. working in the white house or other major agencies is exhausting in normal circumstances. then there's the first year factor, and the fact that team trump has not fully staffed many offices and agencies. it all adds to the burden of those who are on the job. we are already seeing a trickle of departures, and the end of the year is the traditional time for people to decide to move on.

shortfalls in anticipated levels of federal funding contributed, too. at the end of 2014, for example, insurers got blindsided when money they had counted on to offset losses was cut sharply from the obamacare's risk corridor program. that program transfers funds from participating insurers with high profits to those with high losses. the move disproportionately hurt small insurers, according to the nonpartisan commonwealth fund.

trump has spent the entire first two years of his presidency playing to his hardcore base – and, seen through that lens, the decision to re-litigate the aca fight makes some sense. but trump won't win a second term solely on the strength of his base. and by picking the obamacare scab, trump is energizing and inflaming democrats and many independents. and that is a major political mistake.

yet if you think about the fact that cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death, followed by cancer, it would not be surprising that the leading cause of death goes down when you give people health insurance, he said. we know very clearly that again, even in the medicaid program, that if you give people coverage, mortality goes down.

just across first street from the capitol, the us supreme court was set to hear arguments in three cases that many gay rights supporters felt would dictate the level of protection they'd receive under the 1964 civil rights act and title vii's employment rules.
you know, it's kind of sad, really, actually, that donald trump, you know, wants to do name-calling and invective and insults and thinks that that's really effective. and i just don't think -- i think the voters of iowa are just kind of sick of that behavior.
the decision was revealed on june 28, the last courtroom sitting of the 2011-12 session. as roberts began reading his opinion from the bench, he tried to speak steadily, but he was nervous. about 13 minutes into the 20-minute announcement, after he had summarized various legal rationales, he misstated the overall judgment. few noticed the slip because he had already laid out the reasoning.

if it's more than 170,000 people, the clinton campaign, i'm told, believes that that is essentially or close to being out of reach for them. to put it in some context here, this would be in between the 2004 turnout and the 2008 turnout, when there were some 240,000 people here. but the sanders campaign is doing something new.
trump afirmó que el manifestante era «desagradable como el infierno» y acusó al hombre de intentar pegarle a los agentes de seguridad que le forzaron a salir de la concentración, aunque no parecía que el hombre estuviera peleando contra esos agentes.
tasini: well, frankly, and with all due respect, the media did not catch this. it's very simple: bernie sanders is calling for political revolution. he is running against somebody who represents the status quo.
dnc moves to curb superdelegates: the fight over exactly what role superdelegates should play in the 2020 nominating process won't be resolved until this summer – but the democratic national committee voted over the weekend on a big-picture goal: reducing them. the full dnc accepted a recommendation to revise the role and reduce the perceived influence of superdelegates. what that means, exactly, will be sorted out by the rules and bylaws committee ahead of a june deadline to prepare a final proposal for the august dnc meeting.
it's a big risk for trump because voters are hungry for health care solutions.
on thursday, the president did a fox news interview, delivered a speech in michigan nominally about the new us-mexico-canada agreement, and held a campaign rally in des moines, iowa. he was dishonest in all three venues, repeating some of his favorite falsehoods in rapid succession.

we need to start with the basics, which is, first of all, identifying who are enemy is, understanding that this war cannot be won, this enemy and threat cannot be defeated unless we understand what's driving them, what is their ideology. and the fact is when you look at what is happening today, we have over 40 different islamic extremist terrorist groups going by different names. you look at the vast majority of terrorist attacks that are being committed around the world, there's one common element here and it is this radical islamist ideology. and in order to defeat it, we have to do so militarily but simultaneously, it has to be an ideological defeat as well as a political solution that's offered.

as insurers finalize plans for participating in the 2018 exchanges, policy experts have speculated that the uncertainty surrounding the affordable care act will lead insurers to continue to pull back from some markets or exit them altogether, leaving a growing number of people with fewer, pricier options.

such headaches are helping to drive the early stages of the presidential race and help suggest why trump, while currently vulnerable on the issue, could reap some political advantage with a serious effort to address the crisis.

the situation now is more decentralized, more diffuse, and frankly more complex, in that terrorist organizations such as isil or al qaeda in the arabian peninsula use the internet, use social media to communicate and to inspire acts of terrorism in individuals' home countries.
i heard the interview with senator cruz, the peshmerga, that is the fighting wing of the kurds, the iraqi security forces, other regional actors. i think we've just got to be candid. we cannot police a region that won't police itself and so the ground troops need to be from the region but the united states' strong support via the air campaign, via training and equipping, via helping guide, via air campaign to make that effective, that's what we should do. that's what we are doing and we can do more of it.
and i think that's why ted cruz has made such an aggressive play to go to those 99 counties, to pick up and win the places that huckabee and rick santorum have won before. he has been very up front saying that i want to be the candidate that conservatives coalesce behind.

a growing barrier to 'the wall'
donald trump held two campaign rallies today, which is a bit of an unorthodox move for a candidate on caucus night. and we're also expecting him to appear at some caucus sites. which ones, we don't know. and the same goes for his children. they have been all over the state today, doing some retail stops. and they too will appear at caucus sites.

in the midterms, 41% of voters said health care was the most important issue facing the country. three-quarters of that number said they supported democrats. obamacare, so long an albatross for democrats during the previous administration, is now much more popular than it was, despite its failure to provide all middle-income americans with affordable options.
bash: so people should feel you have got it covered?
at tuesday night's concession speech, cruz touched on a wide array of issues, from obamacare to national security, but he avoided one topic: donald trump.
voters in ohio and iowa voted twice for barack obama to be president, and then switched to donald trump in 2016, helping push him to his electoral college victory.
so that is one sort of benchmark that bernie sanders wants to beat, that howard dean crash here in iowa.
but first, the bill has to go back to the other side of the capitol, where the house -- which already passed its own version of the bill -- is scheduled to vote tuesday to approve the changes made in the senate. that vote is expected to succeed on a party line, as it did in the senate, with a narrow democratic majority.
in pennsylvania, 625,000 people enrolled in the expanded medicaid program. close to 300,000 came from rural areas, said andy carter, president of the hospital and health system association of pennsylvania.

cooper: the thing that she has, the part of the obama coalition she has in other states, because there is not as big an african-american population, is african-americans in south carolina and elsewhere, as we have talked about. the question is young people.
as harvard law school professor michael klarman has noted, many of the larger social changes inflicted by the court only occurred when public opinion on the issue changed. he points to brown v. board of education coming after the desegregation of the military, civil service and baseball. polling at the time indicated that a majority of americans were for the decision. when it came to same-sex marriage, the supreme court only legalized it when public opinion shifted in its favor.
cruz christened trump's health care plan as trumpcare, saying it is effectively no different from the plan of democratic candidate bernie sanders.
we realized there is a lot of energy around health care, she said. so many people had a parent, sibling or co-worker fall into the coverage gap.
for the rest — which all posted annual losses in 2015, according to the national alliance of state health co-ops — survival is job no. 1. some are diversifying to serve larger employers, no longer limiting themselves to their aca mandate to offer health plans to individuals and small businesses. a maryland co-op has sued the federal government to avoid paying millions of dollars to other insurers under the aca's complex formula to keep premiums stable by balancing risks among insurers and helping ailing ones. other co-ops are trying to renegotiate contracts with hospitals and other providers.
cruz: it doesn't make sense to -- to negotiate with terrorists.
arizona sen. kyrsten sinema, one of the eight democrats who voted against sanders' amendment, said in a statement that she is open to having a separate debate in congress over the minimum wage, just not through this reconciliation process being used to pass covid relief.
cooper: you think a lot of carson supporters would go to cruz?
while many americans like the idea of expanding medicare, their support drops when they hear private insurance would be eliminated, according to polling by the kaiser family foundation. medicare for america would address those concerns, said jen tolbert, the foundation's director of state health reform.

flake's upcoming visit to new hampshire next weekend is stoking speculation that flake is considering being that republican challenger to trump in 2020. the senator will address the new hampshire institute of politics at their politics & eggs event on friday, which has become a popular stop for potential presidential contenders.
the previous longest shutdown took place during former president bill clinton's time in office – lasting a total of 21 days.
but the bill came after mandatory across-the-board cuts, known as sequestration, were enacted that slashed defense spending. taking into account the lower levels under the sequester, paul's plan actually increased spending on the military.
after the speech, trump was headed to a roundtable with heller, gubernatorial nominee adam laxalt, labor secretary alex acosta and local business leaders focused on the gop's tax bill, for which heller claimed credit.

walker was serving as a law clerk at the time of the 2012 blockbuster ruling and was infuriated at its resolution. he has continued to reveal disdain for the decision written by chief justice john roberts and offer details about his inside dealings with justice anthony kennedy, one of the dissenters.
president donald trump's relationship with russian president vladimir putin is remarkable on a number of levels but none more so than this one: for a man who is ready, willing and able to attack anyone, trump never has a bad word to say about putin. and for a man who appears to have the attention span and message discipline of a toddler, trump is somehow able to stick to his say-nothing-bad-about-putin strategy.
it is the biggest job-killer in this country, cruz said. millions of americans have lost their jobs, have been forced into part-time work.
over the summer, a conservative group called the center for medical progress released undercover videos and accused planned parenthood of performing partial birth abortions and selling fetal tissue.
everyone is in the same place, one house democratic lawmaker told cnn. there are things we want fixed, but we aren't aggressively opposed. it is the president's first major package, and there are a lot of people who feel like this is his first ask, so for all those factors people are not aggressively threatening not to vote for it.

when ginsburg found out about roberts' new position, her first thought was, it ain't over till it's over. she understood that the process could continue to be fluid, especially in such a monumental case.
he had to be thinking he did the right thing, stevens said in a 2016 interview in his chambers, because he certainly made himself very unpopular with the conservatives.
going forward, the chief justice would be viewed with skepticism by conservatives, despite also having taken the lead on limiting racial remedies and voting rights, helping roll back campaign finance regulations and voting for stronger second amendment gun rights.
so, i introduced a resolution in september authorizing limited military action against isil but congress wouldn't vote on it before the mid-term. and then i pushed it after november and i was able to get a vote in the senate foreign relations committee defining this mission in a limited way. we voted out a bill in the senate foreign relations committee in december but the house hasn't even been willing to talk about this in a committee.

(cnn) democrats' slim majorities in both the house and senate are testing president joe biden's ability to get his priorities through congress, as lawmakers turn their attention to legislative work beyond relief from the covid-19 pandemic.
meyers did ask him about his 2020 prospects, and what he would say about the attacks on him from the right calling him the hollywood candidate. we do have more kardashians than anywhere else, but most of us are not kardashians … so i can relate to that conversation on a local level with the mayor in dayton, a mayor in columbia, south carolina, mayor in south bend, indiana, like mayor pete (buttigieg) … and we speak the language i think of america. it's washington that's that swamp and it's only getting swampier.
do you think that the u.s. should just arm the ukraine over the objections of the germans?
so that is our position. the next question then is, how much does it cost? he said. what's the value that we will get from having people be able to have affordable insurance? what's the value? and what this data help to provide in that conversation is that, 'yes it matters.' 
in regions with just one insurer, monthly premiums were $451 or higher in half of the benchmark silver plans on which premium subsidies are based. in contrast, in areas where six or more insurers offered plans, monthly premiums were much lower for comparable coverage: half were $270 or less.
the supreme court eventually reversed its own decision and reinstated the death penalty.
in the 14th week of protests, joaquin phoenix and martin sheen were among the stars who found themselves in custody, as capitol police verified scores of people were charged with crowding, obstructing or incommoding.
in the private dealings of his family business, trump's decision-making went unquestioned – at least publicly. but the presidency is ruled by a different calculus, one its new resident, three weeks into his four year term, is struggling to command.
but under that, sanders beats her heavily.

in the senate, republican leaders are expected to make the case that the process of writing the bill has been flawed. while the bill went through house committees, it's expected to go straight to the floor in the senate.
asked whether the white house has a proposal for replacing obamacare in the event the law is struck down in court, a senior white house official told cnn not as of yet. the official pointed to the proposal from sens. lindsey graham of south carolina and bill cassidy of louisiana, the previous obamacare repeal bill which was ultimately unsuccessful.

recientes encuestas en iowa y new hampshire muestran a clinton en una posición cada vez más precaria. una encuesta de des moines register / bloomberg política colocó a clinton a solo dos puntos en iowa la semana pasada. una encuesta realizada por la universidad de monmouth en new hampshire puso a sanders por delante con una ventaja de 14 puntos.
we've got great people in our audience, trump said. she's surrounded by doctors – no thanks to obamacare.
after the chief, conservative justices antonin scalia, anthony kennedy and clarence thomas offered their views. like roberts, they thought congress' commerce authority did not cover an individual's decision to forgo -- rather than obtain -- health insurance. there were thus four immediate votes cast to invalidate the mandate. no one at the table was surprised, based on the questions during oral arguments and word from law clerks inside the building circulating intelligence among the justices' chambers.
put another way, the court doesn't lead as much as it follows.
«en los viejos tiempos», añadió trump, los manifestantes eran «sacados en camillas».
breyer and kagan had voted in the private march conference to uphold the new medicaid requirement, and their votes had been unequivocal. but they were pragmatists. if there was a chance that roberts would cast the critical vote to uphold the central plank of obamacare -- and negotiations in may were such that they still considered that a shaky proposition -- they were willing to meet him partway.
this is a manager job and donald trump is not a manager, bloomberg said.
one conservative source told cnn that they viewed the seven-month window for the leadership race as a major advantage for conservatives in the house freedom caucus who might have time to organize and leverage themselves. the source told cnn that the right flank of the party might not put forth a candidate for speaker, but could do something like trade votes for speaker for assurances that one of their own would be placed in a leadership slot.
the more important april jobs report is coming on friday.
the texas senator, who has never served in the military, has used the carpet bombing line several times over the course of the campaign. during the cnn gop debate in december, moderator wolf blitzer asked cruz if he would carpet bomb the isis-held city of raqqa.
cruz said, you would carpet bomb where isis is, not a city, but the location of the troops. you use air power directed and you have embedded special forces to direct the air power. but the object isn't to level a city. the object is to kill the isis terrorists.
perhaps health care will come up. perhaps, trump said at the annual governors' dinner.
as soon as someone says well i don't like donald trump, you ask them well, why don't you like donald trump? don't you like the stock market going well? don't you like unemployment where it is? don't you like that walmart had to raise their starting wage? is that because of the tax cut or is that because the pool of labor is drying up? in either case, that's a great thing. it's so easy to argue for donald trump with the facts.
3. energy in spotlight: several u.s. energy firms will publish results on thursday. apache (apa), occidental petroleum (oxy) and chesapeake energy (chk) are all scheduled to report before the opening bell.
roberts did not want the entire law to fall. a pro-business conservative, he understood the importance of the insurance industry to us businesses, and he was genuinely concerned about invalidating an entire law that had been approved through the democratic process to solve the intractable health care problem.
the trump campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
calling the law a fixture of the american health-care system donald verrilli, a lawyer for the house, urged the justices in legal briefs to review a remarkable lower court decision that threatens profound destabilization of the health care system.

so bernie supporters are mainly in these -- a lot of them in these college towns, right? the college towns, you could have 500 people. you will not get -- even if you win it, you don't get as many delegates as if you have maybe 300 people back home. so he has been telling his students go home and caucus. don't stay in your college town.
two gop senators who also ran in 2016, sens. rand paul of kentucky and marco rubio of florida, have not ruled out a repeat presidential run and both are viewed as likely to do so again. paul, however, is running for reelection this year, hoping to use the senate as a springboard to a possible future candidacy – while rubio is quitting the senate at year's end, planning to stay visible outside of government.

this is where to the degree labor union fight will play out here in polk county. barack obama won it big eight years ago, hillary clinton was actually third, just behind john edwards. hillary clinton needs to turn the des moines area, the dark blue, and she needs to compete with bernie sanders out here in the east.
that has carried on through the opening weeks of the administration. since february 5, the team has met with house and senate leadership multiple times a week, directly with 33 house members and held talks with more than 100 key congressional staffers.
but let's check our numbers again. there are 209.3 million americans aged 25 and older, according to the 2014 census, and 142.4 million of them have not attained a bachelor's degree or higher. that's 68% of americans, not 74%.
due to problems with the va database, some of those records include people who died before the va had even started its health care enrollment system, or people who did not apply for health care benefits specifically. to say definitively that 307,000 people have died waiting for health care may be a stretch, so we rate her claim as it's complicated.

i don't believe it is necessary to put american boots on the ground if we are arming the peshmerga. they're fighting there. just today, they didn't ask us for boots on the ground, but what they did say is they need the weaponry to stand up and destroy isis. and the peshmerga on the ground, combined with overwhelming american airpower, can take out isis.

in a surprise move last week, the department of justice said it agreed with the december ruling of a federal judge in texas that invalidated the health reform law. the case is now in federal appeals court.
and i think it's because the senate has become a proving ground of sorts, where people can show where they are on the positions and prove to voters where they stand.
the fact trump himself was the genesis for the $1,400 direct payments included in the democratic proposal is also not lost on republicans, multiple officials said.
cruz has been very up front in the race, saying this is between me and donald trump. if you don't vote for me, a candidate who has a chance of at least slowing down his momentum, you're voting for...
while biden's hope for gop support on capitol hill has all but disappeared in the last several weeks, his enthusiasm for the proposal -- and his view that despite its high price tag it will only serve to bolster democrats as they remain unified -- has hardly waned.

at that time, senate majority leader mitch mcconnell would not commit to renaming russell for mccain, saying the senate should consider many options, including potentially naming a committee room used by the senate armed services committee after him, as mccain was the chairman of the committee.
things trump has insulted on twitter more than putin (a partial list):
coming up, the latest polls in iowa show bernie sanders just barely behind hillary clinton. her lead within the poll's margin of error. that's why tonight is so fascinating, so important. the question is can sanders pull out a victory in the heartland? i'll speak with someone who wrote the book on him, next.
at one point, after jabbing at wacky jacky and pocahontas, trump claimed that rosen and warren don't know how to say nevada. the two say nev-ah-da, a pet peeve for the state's residents, rather than the correct nev-ad-a, trump claimed.
it should be noted that the actions that the president's resolution would legalize were already underway and will continue whether or not congress votes on this draft.
house speaker nancy pelosi also may not have been able to believe her luck – as the administration handed her a way out of her dilemma of how to balance the apparently inconclusive outcome of the russia probe with demands by a small but vocal faction of her caucus for impeachment.
it's not clear that they've actually laid the groundwork in the arab world or in the middle east at all for this kind of a speech, which is going to be a very significant statement. there's a possibility, too, that it could actually violate some un security council resolutions that do not recognize the sovereignty of israel.
white house senior adviser cedric richmond said during a cbsn interview on monday that the white house will keep pushing for the $15 minimum wage increase and that biden believes he can work with both sides to get work done, preferring not to change filibuster rules.

we all know what happens with single payer. you get -- you get lower quality, higher costs, less choices, less innovation; and it costs lives and money. and so that's his -- those are donald trump's words.
law enforcement capabilities. we have come a long way since 9/11. but this also requires working with the public in campaigns through if you see something, say something, working with state and local law enforcement, the cop on the beat working in the communities, which is why we're working more closely now with municipal police departments, county sheriffs, state law enforcement, through fusion centers, task forces, and so forth.
(cnn) mike bloomberg's rivals tore into his claim to be the best candidate to defeat donald trump in november by branding him as a misogynistic, obamacare-hating, soft-on-wall-street bully -- basically the rough equivalent of that other new york billionaire.

police officers pepper spray protesters before the inauguration of president-elect donald trump in 2017.
it's actually somewhat amazing when you think about it. which is what this tweet from david gelles, executive producer of cnn's political programming, got me to do over the weekend:
rogers: i even think smaller amounts cause trouble. and remember, this is those hard decisions but that -- is that one person at risk really if you do this do you put -- how many other people do you put at risk? how many other americans do you make targets on their head who (ph) were operating in that region? that's the problem. and so it is horrific because you get to know this person but think of the people who are exposed if you make these ransom payments.
mcconnell has declined to publicly respond directly to the president, instead telling reporters that he isn't a fan of the daily tweets.
there is simply no evidence this happened. biden's campaign says it didn't, and trump's campaign did not respond to a request to identify the event he was talking about.
his record at the time is clear – but it's not what he claimed thursday night at the debate.

the greatest words you can hear from justice kennedy are: 'you're hired,' walker said at a march 13 investiture ceremony for the district court position he currently holds. and the worst words are: 'the chief justice thinks this might be a tax.'
the campaign in idaho began when two high school friends and one's wife toured the state last summer in a bright green 1977 dodge camper – with medicaid for idaho emblazoned on the side. they were trying to raise support for medicaid expansion by talking about those who earn too much to qualify for the safety net program but can't afford coverage on the obamacare exchanges. the trio, along with many volunteers, collected double the 56,000 signatures needed, said emily strizich, co-founder of reclaim idaho, which led the effort.
merkley 'keeping the option open': oregon sen. jeff merkley told local radio station koin he is keeping the option open for a potential 2020 run – but that his planned march 24 trip to new hampshire doesn't mean he's in. my main focus is the fight for 51, to get a democratic majority in the senate that can stop some of the worst of trump's policies and also the packing of the courts, merkley said.
brown: only in a good way, anderson. and that's one of the reasons they think the turnout is going to be so high tonight. it's because it's a nice day here. it's not even that cold here in iowa. the snowstorm hasn't set in yet. and so as one person we spoke to said, there is no excuse for people not to come out and caucus here, particularly in this precinct.

during the senate's consideration of walker for the us trial court spot in 2019, he was guarded about his aca views.
i remember them walking around in their bright orange caps. remember that? and so a lot has been learned from the mistakes of howard dean by the bernie sanders campaign. what was interesting about what jeff was just saying is that they're figuring it's around 160,000 that they need to get out.

trump prodded heller – who famously helped tank trump's effort to repeal obamacare last summer – saying his re-election bid was a little bit shaky at the beginning.
why do you think she's wrong?
i would be glad to do that. i think, you know, russell was a powerhouse here but most people don't know who he was. and mccain? mccain was a hero whether you liked some of his approach is or not. i liked them and i'd be for that, hatch said.
cruz: look, the vice president, i thought, gave an effective speech, but i have got to tell you, in the room, what everyone kept saying is, interesting speech. we have no confidence that president obama is listening to the vice president.
while the numbers cruz cited of naval power are correct, the decline of ship power took place over the course of two decades and multiple presidential administrations, and not just the past seven years, as cruz posited.
it hasn't been for a lack of trying. trump over his first 21 days in office has issued a barrage of executive actions aimed at delivering on a range of policy pledges – including many of his most aggressive and controversial. but the january 27 travel ban has become a millstone on the neck of a young administration that has spent the last two weeks digging deeper into a legal battle that now seems destined for the supreme court.
during an interview wednesday, ryan said he had thoughts on who should succeed him, but he wouldn't weigh in yet.
as for unemployment benefits, the senate and house bills differ on the provisions.
for o'rourke, the proposal's appeal is that he thinks it moves the country to guaranteed health care more quickly than the alternatives, including the signature medicare for all proposal from vermont sen. bernie sanders, an independent who is also vying for the democratic nomination. that's in part because it would maintain the private insurance industry, which is a deal breaker among progressives.
the survey was commissioned by the john a. hartford foundation, the california health care foundation and cambia health foundation. (california healthline is an editorially independent publication of the california health care foundation.)
6. mitch mcconnell: can you believe that mitch mcconnell, who has screamed repeal & replace for 7 years, couldn't get it done. must repeal & replace obamacare! (8/10/17)
patients want their primary care doctors to have these conversations, and the poll shows that physicians recognize that it's their responsibility, said dr. sandra hernández, president and ceo of the california health care foundation and a physician who treats hiv patients. it's wonderful that medicare is reimbursing for these discussions. now, physicians need more skills and training.
blitzer: so how bitter is this relationship? now they used to have a so-called bromance. but it's really deteriorated.
trump did not get the veterans choice program passed, nor had there been an unsuccessful 52-year effort to get it passed. the program was signed into law by president barack obama in 2014 . in 2018, trump signed the va mission act, which expanded and changed the choice program.

cooper: the clinton campaign says they have learned the lessons of 2008. they have focused -- they have taken iowa a lot more seriously. they have had a lot of small meetings in smaller groups where they felt she really shines as a candidate. she has said she is a different candidate.
senator cruz and mr. trump both respect the veterans and hold them in the highest regard but senator cruz respects the process and we are calling on mr. trump to do the same and debates are the purest form of democracy, the donors said in a statement. iowans – and americans – deserve to hear from the front-runners in this 'two-man race' one last time.
it's notable that trump is proposing even larger spending reductions for medicare than he has over the past two years. in fact, his first budget barely touched the program at all.
several days of protest over the nomination of kavanaugh to the us supreme court yielded hundreds of arrests, but many of them came on a single day, as lawmakers reviewed an fbi report outlining allegations against the would-be justice.
johnson: as long as we're on a continuing resolution, we are, first of all, restricted to last year's spending levels. but we are not allowed to fund new initiatives, new initiatives for border security, for example, new initiatives to hire more secret service agents for the coming presidential election cycle, new initiatives to fund grants.
trump's budget also includes other provisions – such as medical liability reform and drug industry changes – that would indirectly affect medicare and bring federal savings down to roughly $515 billion, goldwein said.

the national security agency's bulk collection of american telephone metadata, which included the telephone numbers that originate and receive calls, as well as the time and date of those calls but not their content, has proven controversial. there has been robust debate as to whether it has actually contributed to the prevention of terrorist attacks.
blitzer: yes. and the hillary clinton campaign is doing that social media, new development as well since then. all right, jeff, thanks very much.
at the same time, roberts began incorporating arguments that would invalidate the medicaid expansion. this was a strange turn. none of the lower courts that had taken up the aca had rejected the medicaid expansion, and it wasn't seen as controversial in terms of constitutional debate and public controversy.

we're on a continuing resolution right now, which, as you point out, expires on february 27, which is less than 20 days at this point. and, as long as we're on a continuing resolution, that, in and of itself, creates uncertainty about how we go about our homeland security missions.
what to watch: the 21-member unity reform commission recommended a 60% reduction in superdelegates – binding dnc members to their states' results on the first ballot but allowing elected officials and former presidents and vice presidents to retain their unpledged status. vermont sen. bernie sanders' allies are pushing to go further – doing away with unpledged delegates altogether, at least on the first ballot.

private insurance, however, would continue to be an option. large employers could keep providing benefits, though they can also help their workers buy medicare for america coverage. employees can also choose medicare for america coverage over their work-based plan. and folks could opt to buy private policies through a medicare advantage-type plan or decide to keep their children on their work-based polices.
the present case represents yet another effort by litigants who disagree with the policy judgments embodied in the aca to use the courts, rather than the democratic process, to undo the work of the people's elected representatives, the filing states.

bash: senator, you mentioned it's been six months, which is kind of hard to believe, since the airstrikes have started. it's been happening without a new authorization from congress, which you have been calling for since day one. we now think that it's actually going to at least -- the wheels are going to start moving this coming week.
to finance the program, the plans calls for undoing the republican tax bill, imposing a 5% surtax on adjusted gross income above $500,000, and increasing the medicare payroll tax. also, there would be levies on investment income above a certain threshold, tobacco products, beer, wine, liquor, and sugar-sweetened drinks. states would also have to contribute an amount equal to what they currently spend on medicaid.

i just wish he didn't use social media quite as much as he does. otherwise i think he's on the right track. i hope he gets it done. tax reform is significant in trying to recreate the medical industry as far as, you know, coverage for people, trying to get more people included with better coverage. that's a mess right now. obamacare i think is not on the right track. there's too many loose ends that aren't being addressed.
trump has said he won't participate in fox news' debate on thursday because of alleged bias of one of the moderators, megyn kelly. but the latest pitch for a face-off with cruz came not from the candidate himself, but from the families of toby neugebauer and robert mercer, who together have invested $21 million in super pacs supporting cruz.
factoring in this change, medicare spending would be $575 billion lower, said marc goldwein, senior vice president at the committee for a responsible federal budget, a think tank.
what now? we are in the middle of a very critical national conversation and we're going to incorporate into the next iteration that which we learn – so we expect the bill to get better, with more flesh on the bones, he said. (the text of the bill remains unchanged.) you can also expect republicans to use ellison's title with the dnc – which is also mostly symbolic – to allege the party is moving too far left. it's worth noting, though, that single-payer is a long ways away from being adapted by a dnc platform committee.
mcauliffe told the crowd he expected they would have the greatest nga meeting in the history of nga meetings and offered a toast to the president.

sen. ted cruz (r), texas: well, what she said at this conference is that she did not believe there was any prospect for ukraine to be successful in defending itself against russian aggression. i think that's mistaken. but, at the same time, i think chancellor merkel's position is not surprising, given where president obama's position is.

it's deplorable what he said, isakson told georgia public broadcasting on wednesday afternoon when asked about a series of critical comments trump has made about mccain. that's what i said on the floor of the senate seven months ago. it will be deplorable seven months from now if he says it again and i will continue to speak out, he said.

their plight has hardly been eased by the gop, which wasted two years of ultimately futile efforts to completely repeal obamacare when it enjoyed a monopoly on power in washington.
the obama administration said monday the exchanges are serving 11 million people and have brought down the uninsured rate to the lowest on record.
the shutdown ended after senate majority leader mitch mcconnell and senate minority leader chuck schumer made an agreement that the senate would take up legislation to deal with individuals who were part of the deferred action for childhood arrivals program, which trump has sought to end. a permanent solution for daca has yet to come to fruition as the program has been in legal limbo.

the expectation among many democratic aides and members is that the $15 minimum wage, which is currently the biggest obstacle to getting the bill across the finish line, won't be allowed under the guardrails of reconciliation, a budget process that requires each provision to adhere to a strict set of rules but that could ultimately allow democrats to pass the legislation on a party-line vote.
an adp research institute study had similar findings. one reason may be that the economy has been improving. some companies interviewed by adp said they may increase their part-timers' hours to retain talent and reduce training costs.

renee adams, hog farmer in monticello, iowa: 'he has actually helped agriculture so far. now with nafta, that's another story'
his remarks on the floor prevented the senate from passing the legislation by the midnight deadline, but the shutdown only lasted mere hours as president donald trump eventually signed the legislation later that day.
sanctuary cities no harbor for trump's policies
in each of these cases, trump would say he is responding to being attacked – whether directly (as is the case with de niro) or indirectly (nfl players kneeling). they hit him. so he hit them back.
the trip shows the extent to which trump and heller have repaired their relationship.
meanwhile, the need for reliable health care remains pressing. conditions such as heart and lung disease (pdf) are widespread in rural areas. addiction to the prescription painkillers known as opioids is acute. nationally, the medicaid expansion offered a bit of stability for some rural hospitals at risk of closure.
sciutto: well, i spoke to the precinct chair, and he says they're expecting a record turnout tonight. in fact, they're prepared to accommodate as much as twice as many voters as they had just four years ago. it doesn't mean they'll get there. but they're prepared for it.

by the time biden took office, his legislative affairs team -- made up of several former capitol hill hands who brought with them significant bipartisan credibility from their past staff work -- was already deeply engaged in the process.
governor greg abbott today held a press conference in houston on the importance of election integrity legislation this session. the governor named election integrity as an emergency legislative item during his state of the state address in february. governor abbott was joined for the press conference by senator paul bettencourt and representative briscoe cain, who have both filed several pieces of legislation to enhance election integrity in texas
one: special counsel robert mueller's spending comes into public view in the days ahead. you can be sure some trump allies will make the case that enough is enough, and that it's time to wind down and stop spending taxpayer money.
and doctors who received their medical training years ago say they rarely focused on how to talk to patients about end-of-life care, although medical education is improving in that regard.
so, let's talk about the jihadists overall. americans looking at this, looking at the fighting, you know, probably constantly saying, how does this affect me, how does this affect the united states, and say, why does it matter?

trump said at the iowa rally of the electoral college margin in the 2016 election: we got 306 to 223.
unlike the relief package congress approved in december, this legislation should be signed before any laid-off workers run out of benefits, and there are far fewer changes than in the prior bill, said andrew stettner, senior fellow at the century foundation. still, some states will wait until the us department of labor releases all the necessary guidance to reprogram their systems.
trump indicated tuesday that he planned to take that view head-on: the republican party will become 'the party of healthcare!' he tweeted.
house freedom caucus chairman mark meadows said wednesday that the freedom caucus needed a seat in leadership.
many insurers found enrollees have higher health care needs than expected, forcing them to hike rates. a recent kaiser study found the benchmark silver plan premiums are projected to rise 10% for 2017, on average, for a 40-year-old consumer in 14 major cities. that's double the 5% increase for 2016 policies, but it could change since state regulators often reduce insurers' rate requests.
and when we come back, we are going to talk about politics back home. and, believe it or not, there is another potential shutdown of part of the government looming. senator cruz is part of this debate.
ge's stock rose 2.2%, along with the rest of the market.
the announcement comes as several republican senators are speaking out in defense of mccain's legacy in the wake of a fresh round of attacks by president donald trump directed at the arizona senator who died last year after a battle with brain cancer.

and with demonstrators flooding town hall meetings to rail against republicans' health care plan, or a convincing lack thereof, full repeal seems a long ways off.
just this past friday, there were arrests of five individuals who were providing material support, allegedly, to isil. so, our law enforcement community does what i believe is a pretty good job of tracking these individuals. and we work with them to track the travel of individuals of suspicion.
two months later, roberts had shifted on both.
claiming that the united states military has been dramatically downgraded during the obama administration, cruz said that when the first gulf war began in 1991, the united states had 529 ships. today, we have 272.
they were encouraged by the president's own outreach directly to republicans and a high-profile oval office meeting where biden invited 10 republicans to discuss their own ideas directly with him.

delivered days before the travel ban, this too set off an avalanche of protest, both in the streets and among mostly democratic leaders in major urban centers like new york, chicago and los angeles. smaller cities like new haven, connecticut, and austin, texas, have also threatened to fight back in court.
nutter: the reality is that senator sanders has run a philosophical campaign. he wants an ideological debate about a lot of things.
walker in march remarked that it was still the worst thing he ever heard from kennedy. it was not the first time walker had referred to the 2012 deliberations in a highly public way. he spoke about the experience in 2018 when he was backing kavanaugh as a successor to retiring justice kennedy.

president donald trump gave a toast to the nation's governors at the white house on sunday evening, offering a preview of policy discussions slated for monday.
and i think the king believed he couldn't wait any longer. and this was, in an odd way, his permission to engage in the very plans he's been laying out. he understood probably more than any other leader in that region the danger of this extremist group and what it meant to all of the leadership to simulate (ph) (inaudible).
at the urging of trump and trump's 2020 campaign manager brad parscale, tarkanian dropped out of that campaign to run for the 3rd district house seat instead.

the house and senate bills call for increasing the credit to $3,600 for each child younger than 6 and to $3,000 for each child between 6 and 17 in 2021. it is currently a $2,000 credit for kids between the ages of 6 and 16.
bash: ...there's a lot of gray area there of what that actually means. i know that you support only having boots on the ground in limited circumstances.
and though many in the party establishment don't like cruz, some top republicans argued that the texas senator would have been a better general election nominee than trump. not only is he a disciplined candidate with views more in line with traditional republicans, but there would be a silver lining, they believed, if he lost: it would be hard for cruz to revive his political career.
reality check: santorum on americans without college degrees
i don't think it is a wise policy to be negotiating with terrorists. the obama administration has gone down that road. for example, in the negotiations for sergeant bergdahl, it released five senior taliban terrorists. there are now multiple reports that one or more of them have returned to actively fighting against americans, trying to -- trying to kill americans.
another [limitation] is that we looked at cardiovascular diseases as a whole, so we sort of lumped everything together: heart attack, stroke, arrhythmias, et cetera. because any one cause of death causes very few deaths in individual counties, which was our level of analysis, we're not able to say which specific disease is responsible for these changes, he said.
speculation had mounted during the trial whether roberts would act, as democrats hoped the chief could help them force the republican majority to allow witnesses to be called. a chief justice had previously settled senate ties in an impeachment trial -- back in 1868 -- senate minority leader chuck schumer, a new york democrat, noted.
'those at the top are not doing their part:' wh looks to raise taxes on wealthy
in a february, kaiser family foundation poll on the aca, 50% approved of it while 37% disapproved. in fact, since president barack obama left office in january 2017, his signature legislative accomplishment – and the one that bears his name – has grown steadily more popular. since may 2017, according to kaiser data, more people have approved of obamacare than disapprove – a sea change from most of the previous five years, when the law was consistently underwater in terms of approval. many of the provisions of the law that have long been the most popular – allowing kids to stay on their parents' insurance through age 26, no discrimination by insurance companies because of a patient's preexisting conditions – remain in effect. the least popular provision – the individual mandate that forced everyone in the country to have some sort of health care – was effectively eliminated by congressional republicans (and trump) in their 2017 tax law.

what we learned from 365 days of trump polls
the steep cuts to medicaid and medicare unveiled in trump's 2020 budget unveiled this month only bolstered the attacks of eager presidential candidates.
all right. we're getting closer and closer to the big moment right now.
manu raju, cnn senior political correspondent: that's right. in addition to that, wolf, he has also dispatched hundreds of volunteers to make thousands of phone calls to uncommitted voters. and what the campaign is hearing back is good news, according to campaign officials that i speak with.
the senate office building that schumer is proposing to re-name is currently named for richard b. russell, a former democratic senator from georgia who served from 1933 to 1971.

these would take longer for federal agencies to implement so it could be several weeks, or even months, before americans receive them.
i think we all can agree that something has to be done (about daca and the dreamers). and that's what he's trying to do and what he's trying to do is to do it the right way. he's not trying to just strong-arm it and make it happen without involvement of the senate and congress. but he's trying to make this thing happen sort of just right for the children that are here in this country.
washington, dc - may 08: u.s. president donald trump announces his decision to withdraw the united states from the 2015 iran nuclear deal in the diplomatic room at the white house may 8, 2018 in washington, dc. after two and a half years of negotiations, iran agreed in 2015 to end its nuclear program in exchange for western countries, including the united states, lifting decades of economic sanctions. since then international inspectors have not found any violations of the terms by iran.

actor jane fonda's fire drill fridays produced numerous arrests -- many of them celebrities -- in late 2019 and early 2020, as the ex-wife of cnn founder ted turner took her anger over climate change inaction to the capital.
uniontown, about 15 miles away, is also in fayette county. it has 175 beds — more than double highlands — but no behavioral health services to treat problems like addiction. frick, another small rural hospital about 12 miles away, technically serves neighboring westmoreland county. for more serious conditions, and trauma care, university hospitals are about an hour away — in pittsburgh on one end, and morgantown, west virginia, on the other. patients in extremis often get stabilized at the local hospitals before transfer.
as he returns to capitol hill after ending his presidential campaign, cruz has grown more powerful and influential with core gop voters, giving him a major platform to upend his party leadership's most carefully constructed plans. and as congress prepares to deal with major national issues – including a rescue plan for puerto rico requiring immediate action and government funding in the fall – many believe cruz could use his new bully pulpit to wreak havoc on capitol hill should he want to.
i mean, what is your reaction when you hear this kind of breach? because the public is also -- is obviously saying, how does this kind of thing...

obama's plea comes just days after house republicans took the first step toward dismantling the aca – aka obamacare – with the narrow passage of the american health care act last thursday. it also comes on the verge of the republican-controlled senate beginning its own consideration of a plan to repeal and replace obamacare.
the bill would also need to be approved by the senate before becoming law.
and it's notable where marco rubio is going tonight. he is going into polk county. that's here in des moines, that county a very populous part of the state in which they believe they need to do very well here in order to get that strong third-place finish.
during the speech, trump listed off several of his administration's accomplishments, notably the passage of tax cuts and repealing the individual mandate under obamacare.
cooper: explain that, because that's very confusing.
the new research contributes to the limited knowledge on how medicaid expansion affects health outcomes, said dr. olena mazurenko, an assistant professor in the richard m. fairbanks school of public health at the indiana university-purdue university indianapolis campus, who was not involved in the research.
in effect, bloomberg is asking democrats to overlook the fact that he hardly touches the party's heart -- and may be an imperfect messenger for grass roots energy that is moving to the left. he's implicitly arguing that only he can beat sanders and oust trump from the oval office.
oil prices have dipped below $50 per barrel in recent days as optimism over a production cut strategy agreed between major producers has faded. the idea was that production cuts would get rid of excess supply and help support prices. american producers, however, have increased their activity.
six officers were injured, and police deployed pepper spray after, cnn reported , bursts of chaos erupted on 12th and k streets as black-clad 'antifascist' protesters smashed storefronts and bus stops, hammered out the windows of a limousine and eventually launched rocks at a phalanx of police lined up in an eastbound crosswalk. officers responded by launching smoke and flash-bang devices, which could be heard from blocks away, into the street to disperse the crowds.
i think i'm going to see you roaming the halls of congress, looking for some kind of solution to your funding problem in the next couple of weeks.
later in april, roberts tried another path. he began exploring whether, as the obama administration had argued, the individual mandate could be upheld as a tax. (cbs's jan crawford reported earlier on roberts' reversal on the mandate, but the full story of roberts' switch, including on medicaid expansion, and the changed votes of two liberal justices is detailed now for the first time.)

gerald retzlaff, regular political debater at darrell's diner in monticello: 'he's playing three-level chess versus everybody else playing checkers'
i think it's important for us as a country, as leaders of this nation, to not allow ourselves to be terrorized by these radical extremists, not allow ourselves to fall into the trap that they are trying to set up. and understand that when these very difficult things happen, just as we've seen most recently in jordan, that we must strengthen our resolve, we must strengthen our focus and commitment, understanding exactly who our enemy is, why they are perpetrating these horrific acts and then come up with an effective strategy to defeat them.

bash: senator, let's just quickly drill down on the content of this resolution. there are differences over how specific congress should be about the question ever boots on the ground because...
washington (cnn) lawyers for the democratic-led house of representatives as well as california and other democratic-led states asked the supreme court friday to immediately step in to decide the fate of the affordable care act.
if the measure is approved, it would be a big win for president trump, who made repealing obamacare one of the central promises of his campaign.
senator, i want to bring it back home to the stalemate in congress over homeland security funding. the government again, that part of the government, runs out of money in just a few weeks. republicans are looking at you and wondering what is your end game here because this is a strategy crafted by you, the idea of holding up funding for the department of homeland security in order to try to stop the president and his executive order on immigration.
plus, the hospital is connellsville's second-largest single employer (pdf), after the school district. it contributes an estimated $15 million to the local economy, andursky said. that's in a town where unemployment's already at 7.6 percent — up from last year and higher than the state and national averages.

and here in the united states this sunday morning, there is deep skepticism over the isis claim that the u.s. hostage kayla mueller was actually killed by a jordanian airstrike inside syria. a spokesman says her family remains hopeful.
however it plays out, what's clear now is that trump's december 2015 announcement calling for a total and complete shutdown of muslims entering the united states until our country's representatives can figure out what is going on is a long way off – and even more measured versions have significant challenges ahead.
but he has enjoyed the longtime backing of mcconnell, a louisville family friend who persuaded trump to nominate walker. mcconnell has been an unyielding partner to trump in stocking the federal bench with conservatives.
obama, however, clearly feels these are extraordinary times. while he worked hard publicly to ensure that the handoff of power to trump was orderly and respectful, it's obvious that obama not only disagrees deeply with his successor's worldview but that he also regards trump's approach and actions as potentially very dangerous to the country.
a big question for cruz now is whether he'll run for reelection for a second senate term in 2018. while he would be heavily favored to win in texas, he'd have to intensify his focus on local issues over the next two years and build a war chest in case a threat to his seat emerges.

i think he's taken on a difficult job – a job that not so many people would want because it's very difficult. and he's been scrutinized every second of the way. i think he's a man who literally and honestly tries his hardest and i think that people should give him slack. … it's as if he doesn't sleep, he's just constantly working for all of us. he took this job today to work hard for us and he didn't accept a single dime. his first year as president, he's just been giving it away and he's just doing an amazing job and i think that's what we should focus on.
something terrific, trump said during a july 2015 interview with cnn's dana bash, who asked what he would push in place of obamacare.
trump's comments followed a lunch meeting with mcconnell, and come after the president's former chief strategist, steve bannon, has pledged to wage a war on the republican establishment and cited the senate majority leader by name.

so, in terms of providing more arms and assistance to the kurds, that's something that we should do. we should be building up the capacity, especially of the kurds and the iraqi security force, and also sunni tribal leaders in iraq because we've been able to kind of slow the advances of isil in iraq but we have to push back and then move on to the tougher aspect of how to take the fight to isil in syria.
i think i got elected largely because we are strong on the border, trump said.
trump's own aides, many of whom are tasked with working with congress to turn trump's campaign promises into legislation, have privately lamented that the president's attacks against members of his own party – most importantly mcconnell – have made it more difficult to win over skeptical lawmakers.
the gradual shift to a government-run program is very similar to a proposal from the center for american progress, a moderate left-leaning think tank. it provides the most politically viable path to universal coverage, while respecting those who like their employer coverage, said topher spiro, the center's vice president for health policy.
jonathan tasini, political strategist: well, look, i think the reality is that we're sort of getting into the weeds with iowa. there's 44 delegates at stake. we feel very confident about the work that's been done. but this fight is going all the way to the convention.

retaining private insurance plans, however, is unlikely to win the plan many fans in the health care industry. it's still a stepping stone to a single payer system, which eliminates consumer choice and does little to address costs, said lauren crawford shaver, executive director of the partnership for america's health care future, a coalition of insurance, pharmaceutical, hospital and doctor groups, which opposes all medicare for all-type plans.

wolf, this is a shrewd move. a lot of people have said will donald trump supporters turn out? going out to caucus is not the same as going to a rally, where donald trump is the entertainment. but by fanning himself and his children out to these caucus sites, they're guaranteeing some celebrity appeal, at least at a couple of the precincts around the country, wolf.
a fair compromise, is how team trump advocates of such a move characterize it. it allows the president to edge closer to his campaign promise to relocate the embassy but stops short of a move that would anger palestinians – and upend years of us policy treating jerusalem as a so-called final status issue to be settled by the israelis and palestinians through negotiation.
washington, dc - may 2: new york governor andrew cuomo holds a news conference at the national press club may 27, 2020 in washington, dc. following a closed-door meeting with president donald trump at the white house, cuomo leveled criticism at republican senators and other politicians that he said want to limit federal aid for new york to combat and recover from the coronavirus pandemic.

it is my fervent hope and the hope of millions that, regardless of party, such courage is still possible, obama said while accepting a profile in courage award at the john f. kennedy library in boston. that today's members of congress, regardless of party, are willing to look at the facts and speak the truth. even when it contradicts party positions. i hope that current members of congress recall that it doesn't take a lot of courage to aid those who are already powerful.

and if she wants me to stop, i'll stop on a dime.
some 31 states plus the district of columbia have already expanded medicaid, which broadens coverage to americans with incomes up to 138% of the poverty level, or about $17,000 for an individual and $35,000 for a family of four. virginia will join the club in 2019, after lawmakers there approved expansion earlier this year.
i think the market will stabilize, and perhaps aetna and united will come back, said jost. but the market really needs support for another few years until it does, and since the majority in congress is rooting for [the affordable care act] to fail, it seems unlikely that the support will be forthcoming.
i can't understand why the president would, once again, disparage a man as exemplary as my friend john mccain: heroic, courageous, patriotic, honorable, self-effacing, self-sacrificing, empathetic, and driven by duty to family, country, and god, romney tweeted on tuesday.
payment for such discussions was initially included in the affordable care act, but removed because of the controversy over so-called death panels. medicare ultimately changed its policy, independently of obamacare, to allow reimbursement for the end-of-life planning sessions.
but although he can implement some of his health care plans with the stroke a pen, other issues he campaigned on -- like instituting a government-backed public option and increasing federal premium subsidies -- will take congressional action. that will be a challenge since biden can't afford to lose a single democrat in the senate -- and few in the house, after his party lost seats in the chamber.
ted cruz and his allies hoped to escalate their attempted game of chicken on wednesday night, offering trump a $1.5 million prize and extending him a formal invitation to come debate cruz one-on-one in the final nights before the iowa caucuses.
[18:47:25] blitzer: the iowa caucuses are about to get under way, the first big test for the presidential election and for senator bernie sanders. the question tonight is whether he can overcome what seems to be hillary clinton's razor-thin lead over him in the polls in iowa.
for the 2017 enrollment season, most co-ops have proposed increasing premiums, often by at least 10%. but raising premiums is only part of the solution.

the individual mandate, which required americans to obtain health insurance, was indeed a key part of obamacare -- but trump hasn't killed obamacare, essentially or otherwise. he has not eliminated obamacare's expansion of the medicaid insurance program for low-income people, the federal and state marketplaces that allow people to shop for coverage, or the consumer subsidies that help many of them make the purchases.
when it comes to medicaid, trump once again floats huge spending reductions as compared to current law, though it's hard to decipher the exact amount since some are interconnected. but the budget also serves as a menu of longtime republican visions for the program, including repealing medicaid expansion and obamacare subsidies and giving states a fixed sum of money, known as a block grant, instead.
while 75 percent of doctors said medicare reimbursement makes it more likely they'd have advance care planning discussions, only about 14 percent said they had actually billed medicare for those visits.
even prominent democrats who advocate the decriminalization of the act of illegally entering the country, such as massachusetts sen. elizabeth warren, do not support completely unrestricted migration, as trump regularly suggests.

but many struggled early — and their problems became part of the highly politicized debate over the law on capitol hill. either they increased enrollments too fast, and then could not keep up with rising health costs, or they could not gain enough members to help spread their costs.
an ill-timed move by the justice department to back the invalidation of the entire affordable care act offered a huge opening to democrats and inadvertently revealed a gaping political vulnerability for trump on tuesday.

in the jama article, obama made several other recommendations for improving obamacare. he called on the 19 states who have not expanded medicaid to do so and on congress to increase financial assistance to make obamacare coverage more affordable. and he said congress should help reduce the cost of prescription drugs by requiring drug makers to disclose their production and development costs, increasing the rebates manufacturers must give for drugs prescribed to certain medicare and medicaid beneficiaries, and allowing the federal government to negotiate prices for certain high-cost medications.

his guarantee that the mexican government would foot the bill, which could, according a reuters report out thursday, cost more than $20 billion, had been one of the pitch's key selling point. but their president, under pressure at home, has balked and dismissed it out of hand. when the white house floated a 20% tariff on mexican imports to cover the upfront costs, there was a rare bipartisan meltdown and the trial balloon was quickly deflated.

medicare currently pays hospital outpatient departments more than doctors' offices for certain services. the trump administration wants to eliminate that differential. it also wants to slow the growth of payments for skilled nursing, inpatient rehab facilities and home health services, said tricia neuman, director, program on medicare policy at the kaiser family foundation.
gergen: won't we get two sets of results tonight? we will get a delegate count, plus we will get a voter count?
the demonstrations were largely peaceful. protesters scarcely argued with the officers arresting them, who in most cases declined to even employ handcuffs in taking the women into custody. several democratic lawmakers -- including sen. tammy duckworth, who arrived with her infant in tow -- showed up to express their support for the demonstration.
new failures are piling up among the member-run health insurance co-ops carrying out one of obamacare's most idealistic goals, leaving just seven remaining when the health law's fourth enrollment season starts in the fall.

daniel martin, a 28-year-old highlands patient who also works in the rafting trade said he uses his new coverage for his monthly blood medication. a trump voter, he hadn't realized that coverage now could be in jeopardy.
he added, obviously, i've shown interest in the past at moving up. i've enjoyed being in leadership. i feel like i've had a strong influence on some of the things that we've done, and i've helped put together coalitions to pass a full repeal of obamacare.
a new conservative court could follow the party line when it comes to abortion. on the other hand, they will be aware of the public backlash that would follow. facing a potentially similar backlash in 2012, supreme court chief justice john roberts, who many have said might turn into the new swing justice in kennedy's absence, went against his conservative tendencies when deciding the fate of the affordable care act (obamacare). in arguably the biggest case before the court this decade, roberts chose to uphold it.
like aetna, a growing number of insurers on the obamacare exchanges are voicing concerns about the viability of the program as they run up big losses. many say that their premiums were too low and didn't cover the cost of care because their consumers are far sicker than anticipated.
cruz appeared more willing than ever to needle trump from the stage, saying that trump had not been in the fray during the seven big conservative fights of the past three years. and cruz repeated belittled trump as a fragile soul.
garcetti on late night: los angeles mayor eric garcetti was on late night with seth meyers on tuesday and spoke about his passion for local politics – and slammed national politicians in washington, which is something he's been repeatedly doing through his stops and visits around the country in early primary states. he specifically called out washington for not acting on the issues of homelessness and daca – both of which strongly impact his city.
and yet: the us intelligence community has unanimously concluded that russia sought to interfere in the 2016 election – a move that seems like a direct shot at, well, democracy itself. and trump remains silent on putin and the country he rules. hmmm.

kneedler said the federal government now maintains that the law's individual mandate is constitutional, but even if the court disagrees, it should sever the mandate and allow the rest of the sprawling law to stand. such a move would maintain the status quo, as the penalty associated with the mandate has been brought down to zero.

given how entrenched obamacare has become, he is also in the position of looking like a leader trying to eradicate benefits – not provide new ones.
wow, the supreme court passed @obamacare. i guess @justiceroberts wanted to be a part of georgetown society more than anyone knew. — donald j. trump (@realdonaldtrump) june 28, 2012
remember, in the foley case, the amount of money was something like $132 million, if my memory serves me correctly. that is not a realistic number for negotiation. they really never intended to turn foley over. they were using all of this for propaganda and that, i think, adds also to the difficulty.
once the systems are updated, those who already have affordable care act policies could return to the exchange to see if they now qualify for assistance or larger subsidies. also, the uninsured have until may 15 to enroll in 2021 coverage on the federal exchange, healthcare.gov, and have extended sign-up periods in most states that run their own marketplaces. biden directed the reopening of the federal exchange through an executive order in late january.

since there is little prospect of serious health care reform – possibly with the exception of a bipartisan bid to lower the cost of drugs – in the current divided government in washington, health care is sure to dominate the 2020 campaign.

planned parenthood has said that money it accepts for fetal tissue is used to cover costs, not to generate profit. in october, the group announced that it would no longer accept any reimbursements for fetal tissue used for research.
the medicaid expansion occurred only a few years prior; it was too early for studies to reliably determine the effect of medicaid expansion on clinical measures of health status and, certainly, too early to determine the impact on any long-term outcomes, mazurenko said.
the law also expanded medicaid benefits to a wider range of needy individuals. the money for about 90% of that expansion would come from the federal government. but it would come with a strict condition: if states did not broaden their programs as dictated they would lose all medicaid funds.
others, like mccain's longtime best friend in the senate, sen. lindsey graham also proposed naming the capitol visitor's center, within the capitol complex, after him.

the affordable care act, which president-elect donald trump has vowed to repeal, threw a number of life-savers to these vital but financially troubled centers. and its full repeal, without a comparable and viable replacement, could signal their death knell.

trump's 2020 campaign website boasts about promises kept – including the repeal of obamacare's individual mandate requiring the purchase of health insurance. but the listed achievements include plans like the multi-billion dollar effort to combat opioid abuse, which though worthy, does not come close to an explanation of how the health care system would work if the aca is finally killed off.
mike rogers, cnn national security commentator: it's a very difficult circumstance, obviously for the mother. i think she is distraught. she is trying to find rational thought in something completely irrational, the beheading of her son. that's set aside.
physicians in large medical systems may find more support than those in private practice. at kaiser permanente in northern california, physicians receive training in end-of-life discussions and have time to carry them out, said dr. ruma kumar, the hmo's regional medical director of supportive care services.

but among his top priorities is first saving the affordable care act, on which his health care promises rely.
retired neurosurgeon ben carson had a lot to say about the far-flung reach of the federal government.

the idea of defunding planned parenthood and repealing obamacare was so unpopular that, just before the legislation came to a vote, a usa today/suffolk university poll found that only 12% of americans supported trumpcare.
mazurenko was first author of a paper published last year in the journal health affairs that found expansion to be associated with increases in coverage, service use, quality of care and medicaid spending.
i'm not arguing here that public opinion will definitely sway the justices. it may not. but given the coming ideological makeup of the court, public pressure might be one of the only barriers standing in the way of the of the court overturning roe.

kavanaugh, as a dc circuit judge in 2011, had taken up a separate obamacare dispute that became something of a litmus test among conservatives examining kavanaugh's record.

and the torrent of new ads continued all day, with a new keep the promise spot monday evening that targeted trump on a different vulnerability: his support for obamacare, or as the ad christened it, trumpcare.
it's a baffling move for trump, who spent most of monday basking in the glow of a series of conclusions, according to attorney general bill barr, in special counsel robert mueller's report that were about as favorable as the president could have hoped for: that the special counsel did not establish that anyone in trump's campaign conspired with the russian government in 2016 election interference, and that there was not sufficient evidence for barr to establish an obstruction of justice charge against the president.

eight years ago, during the supreme court's heated deliberations over the constitutionality of the aca, the five conservative justices, including roberts and kennedy, believed that the individual insurance mandate exceeded congress' power to regulate interstate commerce. but roberts thought the invalid provision could be separated from much of the sweeping law.

this study is absolutely in keeping with that, benjamin said, but he added that a closer look at the research is needed to confirm that the correlation between reduced cardiovascular deaths and medicaid expansion is truly driven by the aca and not other factors.
it stands in sharp contrast to the multi-group, multi-million dollar efforts put together by democrats as they sought to sink former president donald trump's top legislative priority -- the repeal and replacement of obamacare in 2017.

cooper: but to bill's point earlier, the fact that if you have all these younger voters, if they're voting by their college, that's not a good thing. or if they're caucusing by their college, that's not a great thing for bernie sanders. he has got to get them to go to their home districts.

as roberts spoke, he occasionally looked out at the spectators. among them was retired justice john paul stevens, who later said he thought the chief had shown integrity.
trump successfully ran for president by demeaning his enemies and rallying his base to deride his opponents. those habits have followed him to the white house, and mcconnell has regularly been that punching bag.
trump said at the iowa rally: we are protecting people with pre-existing conditions, and we always will the republican party.
la concentración del lunes de trump viene en la víspera de las asambleas electorales de nevada, y trump usó mucho tiempo de su discurso instando a sus partidarios para que se dirigieran a las asambleas electorales para darle lo que sería su tercera victoria consecutiva en las primarias del partido republicano.
in the dc circuit case, kavanaugh rejected a challenge to the aca on procedural, rather than substantive, grounds. yet kavanaugh commented on obamacare at length, calling it unprecedented and deeming the administration's justification for the individual insurance mandate jarring. he said it could extend to other mandatory purchases such as of college savings accounts and disaster insurance.
people living in sparsely populated areas who shopped for coverage on the obamacare exchanges in 2017 frequently had just one or two insurers from which to pick and often faced significantly higher premiums than did people in more urban areas, according to a new study.

reality check: rubio on cruz's budget votes
cnn's tami luhby contributed to this report.
texas sen. ted cruz, a republican, helped lead the charge in october 2013 to shutdown the government as part of a protest over the affordable care act, more colloquially known as obamacare. cruz's efforts were met with no success though, as both the senate and the presidency were controlled by democrats.
still, millions of people could be at risk of missing out because the irs does not know how to reach them. an estimated 8 million eligible people did not get the first stimulus payment, worth up to $1,200, which was approved last year and delivered over the spring and summer. while most people received the money automatically, very low-income people who don't normally file tax returns may have to take an extra step to register online or file a 2020 tax return.
related: health care spending expected to climb as america ages
still, part of cruz's ability to rebound depends on whether he helps unify the gop or keeps his distance from trump after a bitter campaign. while cruz plans to be active as a surrogate in down-ticket races, he could anger trump supporters if he declines to help the party's presumptive nominee.
other moderate democrats agreed. the argument was that the white house could move the package in two steps. but in conversations with biden's team, including chief of staff ron klain, the reality of the situation began to come into focus. separating out the bills could take time and potentially take the pressure off republicans to back the larger package altogether.
ted cruz needs to copy the santorum map if he is to beat donald trump in iowa tonight. then you look for trump. number one, can he steal some of this? romney won a few of them, but can ted cruz -- ron paul won a few too. that's the light orange here.
as house democrats prepare to push through the legislation next week, with senate democrats set to follow suit in short order, it's a moment that underscores a confluence of factors on politics, policy and quiet, but wide-ranging, behind-the-scenes work that has nearly all gone biden's way.
on monday, the trump administration said the entire affordable care act should be struck down, in a dramatic reversal. the justice department said in a filing with a federal appeals court that it agreed with the ruling of a federal judge in texas that invalidated the obama-era health care law.
well, as anyone knows who's been listening to me, i'm very much against the government being involved in every aspect of our lives, carson said. last year, there was an additional 81,000 pages of government regulations. if you stack that up, it would be a three-story building. this is absolutely absurd.
king: so, we watch those lines outside. then, we get the early entrance polls, and we get a little sense of the composition of the electorate, how many young people turned out, how many evangelicals turned out. and then, anderson, finally, after all this talking, the wall will start to fill in with the results.
i've been pretty candid with him and all of you that i'm not a fan of the daily tweets, he said earlier this year.
and i think this next election, 2016, is going to be a fundamental fork in the road. and i believe the american people are looking for a new path. they want to get back to the free market principles and constitutional liberties that were part of the foundation of this country. and so it's something that i'm looking at very seriously. and i'll tell you, the support we're seeing both on the grassroots level and also among the donors has been extraordinary, really has been encouraging.

two of the biggest megadonors behind cruz's presidential ambitions offered personal donations to trump's favorite veterans' charities if the businessman agreed to face the texas senator. the dare comes on the eve of the next republican debate in des moines, iowa, which trump has pledged to not attend.
tonight, they're neck and neck. and because senator sanders holds a big polling edge in new hampshire, it really puts a lot of pressure on secretary clinton to secure a victory tonight.

and there was another dynamic at play on wednesday that suggests that even uninspiring debate performances will not fatally hole bloomberg's campaign for weeks to come.
fewer than one-third reported any formal training on end-of-life discussions with patients and their families.
this is a job where you have to build teams. he doesn't have teams so he makes decisions without knowing what's going or the implications for what he does. we cannot run the railroad this way, he said.
gergen: and it does really raise questions. will -- the obama coalition of 2008 and 2012 depended heavily on the youth vote.
the president also mocked calls for an apology for using the term.
bash: and senator, are you talking to those senate democrats?
jim sciutto, cnn national security correspondent: how you doing, anderson? we're at notaway (ph) valley high school. this is the southwestern corner of iowa. it is rural. it is agricultural. corn is king, they say, here.
bash: we will continue this discussion for sure. we'll be right back.

lgbt protesters perform a sit-in outside the us supreme court.
this hospital all my life has been here, said keller, now retired. [it] helps a lot of people who don't have adequate health care coverage — and i don't know what they would do without it.
today, women are the most potent political force in this country. the women's march sparked a movement, and an unstoppable one at that. we're changing everything: our policies, our culture and our media – and come november, we're going to change our representatives in office.
still, infrastructure is widely seen as the most likely area where the two parties could strike a deal.
it began in philadelphia with protesters from several groups marching 150 miles south to stage a sit-in on the capitol steps, denouncing the influence of big money on politics and congress' refusal to reverse it. on a single day of the lengthy protests, capitol police arrested more than 400 people for unlawful demonstration activity, and they were charged with crowding, obstructing and incommoding.
he said bloomberg backed stop and frisk -- throwing close to five million young black men up against a wall.
56:51 - source: cnn watch the entire donald trump news conference
as washington was inundated with the impeachment trial of biden's predecessor, the white house took pains to make clear they both weren't involved and weren't paying attention. it wasn't entirely true -- biden was kept abreast of the trial and took to watching highlights each night, two sources said.
we don't know the -- her fate. but, big picture, do you think it should be the position of the united states to negotiate in order to get aid workers or americans who are hostages of groups like isis? because, currently, it is not.
sen. dianne feinstein, the senior democrat on the senate judiciary committee, asked walker in a written question about his praise of kavanaugh for providing a roadmap to strike down the aca's individual mandate and about walker's own assertion in a 2018 article that the supreme court's ruling was an indefensible decision.
the perils of the high-wire act of relying solely on democrats in the senate was put on display friday, when sen. joe manchin, a west virginia democrat, announced he would oppose biden's pick to lead the office of management and budget, neera tanden. if tanden is unable to secure republican support -- something democrats have been exceedingly skeptical of up to this point -- manchin's no vote would effectively kill the nomination.

criticism on the right -- from insiders and outsiders -- was swift, including from the wall street journal editorial page, which described the decision as shot through with confusion.
the arrests began mid-afternoon with 293 people arrested for unlawfully demonstrating in a senate building and nine more arrested later in another senate building, a capitol police spokeswoman said. all were charged with crowding, obstructing or incommoding, the department said
bash: have you been workings behind the scenes to try to get those senate democrats to buck their president, to vote with you all and pass a bill that stops his executive action?
rubio sought to discredit the national security record of his republican colleague sen. ted cruz by claiming the only budget that ted has voted for is a budget that rand paul sponsored that brags about cutting defense spending.
so fiorina's claim that the bill has passed through congress is false.
the white house has no fresh plan to replace the affordable care act, despite the administration backing a district court ruling striking down the full law earlier this week, a senior white house official told cnn wednesday.
he isn't stopping – particularly with the health care system that bears his names in peril. if the senate wants to repeal and replace obamacare, obama seemed to be saying sunday night, they're going to have to go through me.
but nothing fresh from the white house yet, the official conceded.
4) a big year one priority slips to year two
a police officer charges forward during black lives matter protests in front of the white house.
perhaps roberts' move was born of a concern for the business of health care. perhaps he had worries about his own legitimacy and legacy, intertwined with concerns about the legitimacy and legacy of the court. perhaps his change of heart really arose from a sudden new understanding of congressional taxing power. however the chief would explain it -- and he has not explained it beyond his written opinion -- the case added a new dimension to a man who insisted that he always decided cases based on the law.
aside from trump's dubious characterization of the result as an electoral college landslide -- the winning candidate has earned a larger share of electoral votes in 45 of 58 presidential elections, the new york times has noted -- it's not true that people haven't seen such a margin of victory in a long time. obama had a bigger margin in both of the two previous elections.
el favorito del partido republicano también incrementó sus ataques contra el senador ted cruz, refiriéndose a su rival presidencial republicano como «enfermo».
with cruz widely expected to run again for president in 2020 if donald trump loses a general election match-up with hillary clinton, the texas freshman could once again use his fights with senate republicans as the basis of his run. and that is enough to unnerve many republicans.
and so their campaign attacked congressman king today. it went over like a lead balloon. it was just not well-received by the iowans, who were there, actually, to see donald trump.
aetna, which had 838,000 exchange customers at the end of june, said its policyholders are turning out to be sicker and costlier than expected. the company, along with its peers, has criticized the federal program designed to mitigate those risks.
those numbers explain why house democrats ran hundreds upon hundreds of tv ads during the 2018 midterm elections making the case that republicans, if they had their way, would have eliminated obamacare altogether. republicans will do absolutely anything to divert attention away from their votes to take away americans' health care, then house minority leader nancy pelosi (d-california) said in the days leading up to the midterms. and, following democrats' takeover of the house in 2018, pelosi was just as clear; health care was on the ballot, and health care won, she said.
switching the spotlight of the national debate from russia to health care so quickly would be risky under any circumstances but is particularly problematic given that a) the past five elections have shown that people care deeply about and vote on the issue of health care and b) getting rid of obamacare is not a broadly popular view with the american public.
trump wasn't my first choice. however he is doing a hell of a good job. … the things that he's done – there's a lot of confidence in the economy. i.e. the jobs coming back. wages have gone up. stock market is going up. the whole attitude has changed. there's a can-do attitude that's building up here.
trump had not set a record for total judges appointed as of this point in a first presidential term; jimmy carter had appointed 197 judges by late january of his fourth year in office, according to data from russell wheeler , a visiting fellow at the brookings institution who tracks judicial appointments. wheeler said trump has appointed 187 judges by traditional counting methods -- two supreme court justices, 50 appeals court judges and 135 district court judges -- but that it's possible to get to a total of 191 judges by adding trump's three appointments to the court of federal claims and his designation of a sitting judge on that court as chief judge.
for instance, families may not see the boost in the child tax credit until the summer.
cooper: mayor nutter, you're a clinton supporter.
cruz: oh, look, of course we all understand the agony of the families.
much of the emerging image of dysfunction has been painted by trump's own staff. the calls are coming from inside the white house – and they are going to reporters, who have been flooded with accounts of a frenetic and angry president, who bounces from political frustration to personal grudge – often in his bathrobe, according to a new york times account disputed by the white house – in the space of a few minutes.
and senator, i want to start with what appears to be the question of the day, ground troops. do you believe that there should be ground troops in iraq to go after isis, as many as 10,000 as some are calling for?
our sunlen serfaty is in des moines at cruz headquarters tonight.
that was one of the findings of the independent panel. and i thought that their work was fair and thorough. and so we're looking at a new permanent director. and i think we will have one pretty soon.
it's a dynamic the white house is keenly aware of -- biden and his team have stayed in close contact with manchin and his aides in recent weeks.
i mean, barack obama had 239,000 people turn out in 2008. so they don't need anything like, they believe -- this is their analysis -- what obama had to beat hillary clinton last time around.
you can do all the advertising you want, all the rah-rah-rah rallies. when it comes to election day, it's all over. and if you don't have the old gotv, people, they know -- you have to know who your voters are. and you have got to get them out. it's as simple as that.

in addition to the health law's risk corridor program, which partially reimburses insurers for extreme losses, another provision requires insurers to make payments to competitors with sicker and costlier members. that is a sore point for evergreen. the co-op, which has about 40,000 members, sued the government in june, alleging that the risk-adjustment system is flawed because it does not adequately measure risk. the lawsuit is pending in federal court and a decision is expected this summer.
president donald trump said monday he feels closer than ever before to senate majority leader mitch mcconnell, a man he's publicly criticized for his handling of the gop agenda and on whom the president is relying for getting a legislative accomplishment in the first year of his term.
ted cruz is holding a pre-caucus rally right now at a baptist church in marion, iowa. he is counting on a big evangelical turnout this evening, but not a high overall turnout. a lot of experts believe that would mean a surge of first-time caucus-goers who would be expected, many of them at least, to go with trump.
john (sic) steinbach, who is the fbi's counterterrorism division head, told cnn's pam brown about an example of why it should matter. listen to this.
former president barack obama had a blunt message for his successor on sunday night: i'm not letting the affordable care act go down without a fight.
and, again, it's going to come down to turnout. i think that rallied ted cruz voters to go out and grab a friend and bring them to the poll. i'm not sure that was helpful in that round of attacks. but beyond that, donald trump did something pretty interesting. about a few weeks ago, started having smaller group meetings where he was walking people through exactly, his campaign team, taking those new voters and walking them through exactly what to expect, how you go into a caucus, how you vote and how it works, because that can be very intimidating if you have never participated in politics to any degree.
for now, the conference will remain in a holding pattern, a kind of political purgatory that members aren't sure is sustainable long-term as they begin gearing up for the midterms and chart their agenda for a congress after ryan.
gergen: she is more experienced. but there is a fascinating generational split here...
china spent $25.9 billion on american agricultural products in 2012, according to figures from the department of agriculture. in 2017, the year before the trade war began, china spent $19.5 billion. in 2016, it was $21.4 billion. chinese purchases plummeted to $9.1 billion in 2018.

y trump, quien ha criticado el proceso de las asambleas electorales desde que perdió frente a cruz en iowa, le dijo a sus partidarios que se olvidaran del proceso –un poco más arduo– de las asambleas electorales, el cual implica que los votantes se reúnan en una ubicación para la asamblea y que escuchen discursos para cada candidato antes de emitir su voto.
johnson: yes, it is that big of a deal.
given that, what should the u.s. responsibility be to go in and get hostages?
asian markets finished the trading session mixed.
chairman rogers, how effective do you think donald trump's attacks against ted cruz have been just in the last couple weeks? ted cruz was higher up in the polls, according to a lot of different polls. he then went after -- donald trump suddenly pivoted, went after him on the canadian birth issue and other issues.
in the latest blow to obamacare, aetna is vastly reducing its presence on the individual exchanges in 2017.
another question remains whether republicans will even hold the majority in 2018 and need to draft a speaker at all.

he knows where you shop, what you do, who you're likely to vote for, whether you go to church every sunday or just twice a month. he is so data-driven. and that will in the end i believe help him if he is close to trump. (crosstalk)
joseph biden, vice president of the united states: given russia's recent history, we need to judge it by its deeds, not its words. don't tell us; show us, president putin.
the data back up pelosi's position. more than 4 in 10 voters in 2018 said that health care was their top priority in the election, according to exit polling. democrats won those health care voters by 52 points. 52!
at various points, the biggest threat to democratic unity was the desire among some members to fight for bipartisanship. many rank-and-file members sought to hold onto the idea that there was a middle ground, potentially willing to reshape the ultimate direction of the bill. biden himself had made clear before he took office that, as a 36-year veteran of the senate, he would seek bipartisan consensus.
photo: shefali luthra/khn john andursky, cfo of rural highlands hospital, says that making ends meet is a daily struggle.
so far, the incoming trump administration hasn't released its health plan to replace obamacare. but, experts say, it is likely to give the states less federal money for treating the poor. it is unclear how rural hospitals will compensate for the financial benefits they are likely to lose — or how many more rural hospitals will fall.
and it sends a strong signal that the 44th president isn't going to simply sit on the sidelines as the 45th president takes apart his signature legislative accomplishment. he's going to not only defend the law but also make the affirmative case for it.
but i think they feel like they are in a good spot heading into this night. as you know, though, better than anyone here, it all just depends on who shows up tonight. and there is no guarantee until they open those doors at the caucus sites, wolf.
trump said at the iowa rally: we got rid of the individual mandate, the most unpopular thing, which essentially killed obamacare.
some 91,000 residents would qualify for coverage if idaho expands, and the state will receive $368 million in federal funds for expansion in fiscal 2021, its first full year, said strizich, citing an actuarial report done for the idaho department of health and welfare. (the federal government picks up at least 90% of the tab.)
the rhetoric harkens back to earlier this decade when republicans lashed out at former president barack obama for including similar provider payment cuts in the affordable care act, saying that he was hurting the elderly.
jeff zeleny, cnn senior washington correspondent: wolf, in a word, it is turnout again, which is even more important in these caucuses than the elections.
also, the senate legislation provides a full premium subsidy through the end of september to laid-off workers who want to remain on their employer health insurance plans through cobra. the house bill would require them to pay 15% of the premium, which could still prove costly.
the legislation, however, isn't as generous as the medicare for all proposals, which essentially provides all care at no cost. enrollees would have to pay up to 9.7% of their monthly income as premiums, though the poor would pay nothing and subsidies would be available for the middle class. there would also be deductibles and co-pays, with an annual limit of $3,500, or $5,000 for families.
at the same time, the message directly from biden was clear: bipartisanship would be ideal, but it wasn't a necessity, particularly given the bill's perceived popularity outside of washington.
the credit would also become fully refundable for the year and may be paid out monthly, rather than as a lump sum at tax time.
the gift to the veterans' organizations would only come if the two debated on or before this sunday in iowa; if it only featured trump and cruz; if the moderator was picked by the candidates; and if the event lasted for one hour, the super pacs, together called keep the promise, said.
even though i was a bernie supporter, you know he's still my president. i'm not going to be anti-trump just because he got in. i'm still hoping for the best. we'll see down the road. you know, it's not instant with the tax reform. defunding obamacare, that's going to be interesting to see how that goes moving forward.
still, democratic leadership has worked closely with members in an effort to try and build a coalition of support. schumer has been having one-on-one conversations with individual members, trying to do the work ahead of time on what they need to support the bill.
bash: now that senator ted cruz has given us his take on homeland security and the war on isis, let's get a democratic perspective from the senate. senator tim kaine of virginia is also a member of the senate armed services committee.
bernie sanders seemed to escape the debate without a significant blow to his now front-running campaign -- and had the advantage at least four other centrist rivals arguing he's too radical to beat trump but who have failed to slow him down.
first lady on trump: we'll help in any way
here's how those numbers stack up against presidents obama and george w. bush at similar stages of their first terms:
a little more than a week before his inauguration, trump declared at a wild press conference in new york that russia, china, japan, mexico, all countries will respect us far more, far more than they do under past administrations.
we have a venue. we have a time. all we're missing is a candidate, cruz told a ballroom crowd. it's not that he's afraid of me. he's afraid of you. he doesn't want to answer questions from the men and women of iowa about how his record doesn't match what he's selling.
but it's also, is age going trump -- or is it going to overtake the question of her being a woman, being the first woman? and the younger voters don't seem...
el intercambio fue un momento de gran tensión, en un escenario ubicado muy cerca de la iglesia en charleston donde un autoproclamado supremacista blanco mató a nueve afroamericanos en un tiroteo el año pasado.

aside from providing health care to a largely poor population, it provides hundreds of jobs in a town that locals say never recovered after industries such as coal mining and glass manufacturing disappeared.

all the problems seem to be very strongly correlated with the size of the population, said linda blumberg, a senior fellow in the health policy center at the urban institute, who co-authored the analysis. if you've got a big population, more insurers are coming in to compete for that business.
tyler: well, ted cruz has said over and over again he likes donald trump. he has not returned the invective. in fact, he never has. lots of people called him lots of names, because he doesn't want to get along with washington. he wants to change washington. but he never returns it in kind. so i think that speaks to the character of ted cruz.
la decisión de clinton de unirse tan estrechamente a obama podría ser arriesgada si clinton gana la nominación y llega a enfrentarse a los republicanos. mientras que los índices de aprobación del presidente son muy altos entre los demócratas, la mayoría de los estadounidenses todavía desaprueba el trabajo que está haciendo, por lo que los acontecimientos en la economía y en todo el mundo podrían dejar a clinton vulnerable por la asociación con su legado.
walker has called roberts' 2012 opinion indefensible. in his recent remarks at the march investiture, he further revealed an us-versus-them mindset. after thanking mcconnell, kavanaugh and other supporters, he referred to his nomination's opponents, including, he said, the american bar association.
on monday night, the trump administration announced that it now supports a ruling from a texas judge that would invalidate the entire affordable care act – aka obamacare – a move that almost certainly will push the fight over how health care is delivered in this country to the supreme court.
obama's willingness to wade into the national conversation – and offer not-so-oblique criticisms of trump – is something of a break from presidential tradition. typically, ex-presidents largely avoid any sort of engagement on the policies of their successor. george w. bush, for example, virtually disappeared during obama's term. (worth noting: bush's vice president, dick cheney, was an early and active critic of obama.)
i was with king abdullah earlier this week. very emotional after the death of this jordanian pilot in a horrible way. even (ph) he said this fight against isil, it is our fight. it is the region's fight. the u.s. can help us but you can't do it for us. we've got to speak out against the regional terrorism and it's up to us to do it.
that decision, which caught even many trump allies by surprise, again thrusts the health care issue to the center of the political debate, and virtually ensures that the 2020 election – like the 2018, 2016, 2014, 2012 and 2010 elections before it – will turn on the aca.
cruz: well, dana, the premise of that question is not true, and it's frankly ridiculous. this is a strategy that came from republican leadership. this is the cromnibus strategy.

other measures in the package, however, are new or involve larger changes to existing programs — including temporary enhancements to the child tax credit and federal premium subsidies for affordable care act plans, as well as for cobra policies for laid-off workers who want to keep their employer health insurance coverage.
partial birth abortions are illegal, and planned parenthood has repeatedly denied that it performs partial birth abortions, or that it has participated in any illegal activity. on monday, a texas grand jury investigation into planned parenthood cleared the group, instead indicting two members of the center for medical progress who secretly recorded planned parenthood members.

mcconnell responded to bannon's criticism by citing past republican primary challengers who failed to make it into the senate and stressing his relationship to trump.
during the speech, president also returned to his familiar criticism of arizona sen. john mccain, saying a little early-morning surprise by one of our own – referring to mccain's dramatic thumbs-down vote on an obamacare repeal bill – tanked the effort to undo former president barack obama's signature legislation.
the trump-mcconnell meeting comes as pressure on the senate intensifies to pass tax cuts and give trump at least one major legislative victory before the end of the year. the senate will move this week to pass a budget, the first step in its effort to overhaul the tax code.
rural hospitals have long operated on the edge. in the past six years, more than 70 such facilities have closed, citing financial duress. almost 700 more have been deemed at risk of following the same path.
the peshmerga have been our allies. they have been our friends. and they're actually fighting every day to stop isis. now, dana, what makes no sense whatsoever is, the obama administration is refusing to directly arm the kurds. we need to arm the kurds now because they are our boots on the ground.

the medicare for america legislation was introduced last year by reps. rosa delauro, a connecticut democrat, and jan schakowsky, a democrat from illinois. but unlike most of the other medicare for all-type plans, it doesn't have a senate version that's supported by other candidates.

federal judges the trump administration and congressional republicans have repeatedly put forward bills and filed lawsuits that would weaken obamacare's protections for people with pre-existing conditions. trump is currently supporting a republican lawsuit that is seeking to declare all of obamacare void.

but the sanders campaign in particular is using a lot of out-of-state volunteers, as well as in-state volunteers, to go back and redouble up their effort here. the specter of 2008 is not hanging over them. a tiny specter of 2004 is hanging over them. that was howard dean. we famously saw him crash in the iowa caucuses.

but democrats argue it's easy to defend themselves on legislation that gives people direct checks, access to paid leave, an extension of unemployment insurance and doesn't create new or controversial programs. much of the bill is bolstering or a continuation of programs that many republicans already voted for.
a recent kaiser family foundation survey found that in 21% of counties in the nation, a 40-year-old earning $50,000 would have to spend 10% of their income just to pay for aca premiums.
importantly, none of the limited number of published studies reported poorer outcomes as a result of medicaid expansion, she said. with more time, researchers will have the opportunity to determine the effects of medicaid expansion on population health more comprehensively.
it could also explode into the most heated months of the 2020 presidential showdown if obamacare's fate – for the third time – ends up before its previous savior, chief justice john roberts and his supreme court.
biden's stop in western pennsylvania was not just a stump speech, but an opportunity to offer a glimpse of how he'd approach 2020 if he runs for president again: by working to rebuild a democratic coalition that includes white, rural, blue-collar voters. he slammed trump for the tax bill, saying it would lead to cuts in medicare and social security, and tried to appeal to voters dissatisfied with the president in a district he won by 20 points in 2016.
and so i'm on the hill every day stressing the importance of a fully funded department of homeland security, separate and apart from riders to try to defund our efforts to reform the immigration system.
i understand that the role of an academic and a citizen engaged in the political process is different than the role of a judge or a judicial nominee, walker wrote. the canons of judicial conduct preclude me, in my role as a judicial nominee, from going beyond what i said in the 2018 article.

there's also a strong evangelical streak here, which would seem to break in favor of a ted cruz, perhaps a donald trump with a falwell endorsement. but other candidates not leaving it to chance. darrell issa, who's a surrogate for marco rubio, he's come all the way down here to the southwestern corner of the state to speak here tonight to try to peel away some of those cruz and trump supporters to go the way of marco rubio.
given that, are they feeling that pressure over at clinton caucus night headquarters?
kennedy, however, joined by fellow conservative justices antonin scalia, thomas and samuel alito, believed the individual mandate was interconnected to other provisions of the new law and would entirely sink it. law clerks at the time portrayed walker as vigorously arguing the mandate central to provisions such as those guaranteeing coverage for pre-existing conditions and expanding medicaid coverage to needy people.
viewed only through a judicial lens, his moves were not consistent, and his legal arguments were not entirely coherent. but he brought people and their different interests together. his moves may have been good for the country at a time of division and a real crisis in health care, even as they engendered, in the years since, anger, confusion and distrust.
and i'll tell you what offends me about this. we've already lost american service members lives in this operation and we've done it without congress being willing to do the job of having a vote. if we're going to ask people to risk their lives, then congress ought to do our job and put our thumb print on this mission and say, it is in the national interest.

infrastructure has been viewed as a bipartisan opportunity by both sides, but the issue faltered during the trump administration. talks around an infrastructure plan with trump and republicans broke down in 2019 and the repeated claims by the white house that the coming week would be infrastructure week became a running joke for democrats and republicans alike. the former president tweeted at the beginning of the pandemic that he was open to an infrastructure package to boost the economy, but the house passed a $1.5 trillion infrastructure bill in july with only three republicans supporting it and the measure stalled in the then-gop controlled senate.
last february, the white house proposed a resolution which asked congress to authorize the limited use of the united states armed forces to fight isis alongside the anti-isis coalition, but did not go so far as to authorize putting american soldiers on the ground.

cruz is wrong in his characterization of the gulf war bombing campaign. the air attacks conducted during the gulf war were precision-targeted, with laser-guided bombs designed to hit enemy fighters and minimize collateral damage. that is the mirror opposite of carpet bombing, which is an indiscriminate attack blanketing an area with explosives. the united states hasn't engaged in attacks that could be described as carpet bombing since the vietnam war. in 1977, the geneva conventions adopted a protocol that banned indiscriminate air attacks of cities and towns with large concentrations of civilians.

the petition filed by supporters of the law is a long shot bid because the supreme court does not usually like to take up an issue until it has made its way through the lower courts. but if the necessary four justices agree to hear the case and expedite it for this term -- it would mean that the justices would render a decision concerning the fate of the controversial law this spring, just as the presidential election gears up.

no vote had been taken related to congressional taxing power. it did not seem to matter, because the individual mandate was going to be struck down. the only uncertainty was whether any of obamacare would survive.
they are not essential for the success of the affordable care act, but they do offer an important alternative to commercial insurers, said timothy jost, a law professor at washington and lee university in virginia and an expert on the health law.
eliminating obamacare could leave roughly 20 million more people without health insurance, according to a recent report from the urban institute, an economic and social policy think tank. the president said this week that he will not push for a replacement plan until after the 2020 election.
the aca, signed by obama in 2010, followed decades of failed attempts in washington to control spiraling medical costs and provide americans with higher-quality health care. it created a marketplace where the uninsured could buy coverage and protected people from being unable to get health insurance because of pre-existing conditions such as diabetes, cancer and other chronic illnesses. to support the system and draw in the healthy as well as the sick, the law required that most uninsured people obtain coverage (the individual mandate) or pay a penalty, to be collected as part of an individual's annual taxes -- a provision critical to the final ruling.
insurers, including aetna, have been pressuring the federal government to make changes to the risk programs meant to help insurers that cover high-cost patients. the program requires insurers with healthier-than-average customers to fund payments to peers with sicker-than-average enrollees. aetna had to pay into the risk adjustment program in 2014 and 2015.

as a 36-year veteran of the senate and former vice president, biden has maintained that he will work with both sides of the aisle. although the president has already taken a flurry of executive actions , some priorities need to be cemented with legislation to avoid possible reversal by his successors.
biden's legislation faces an uphill climb in a narrowly divided congress, where house speaker nancy pelosi has just a small margin and senate democrats do not have the 60 democratic votes needed to pass the measure with just their party's support.

neither the senate nor the house brought the resolution up for a vote – and it is still sitting on capitol hill.
the former new york city mayor has been beset by accusations that he made sexually suggestive comments in the 1990s, and that bloomberg lp was a hostile workplace for women. his campaign has said that he sometimes made comments that did not reflect his values and that his company has always elevated women.
it did not just distract from the president's attempt to make political capital out of an apparently favorable result from special counsel robert mueller's russia investigation, at least according to a summary by attorney general bill barr. it must also have irked trump that he was still being forced to deal with obamacare itself.

travel ban and a reckoning with the courts
the health care law expanded medicaid to tens of thousands of previously uninsured patients, providing new revenue streams for rural hospitals, which often serve a poorer, sicker patient population. the law also created a program that allowed some of these facilities to buy prescription drugs at a discount, though highlands qualified for that program independently of obamacare.
the insurer will stop offering policies on the exchanges in 11 of the 15 states where it currently operates, according to a press release it issued monday evening. aetna (aet) will only sell obamacare products in delaware, iowa, nebraska and virginia.
rep. mark walker, the chairman of the gop study committee, also warned against making predictions in a speaker's race that appears to be months away.
given how the homeland security challenges we face are evolving, it's becoming all the more important to do that.
wacky jacky is campaigning with pocahontas, you believe this? in your state! can you believe this? trump said at the nevada gop convention. when you see that, that's not the senator you want.
in fact, obamacare is not a job-killer, according to the 2015 kaiser family founation/health research and education trust survey released in september 2015.
on friday, he signaled both options remained on the table. and more pointedly, doubled down on his argument in favor of some kind of ban.
maybe we're actually going to get something in the next year, before the midterms, on infrastructure. the administration has got a goal, i'm hearing, of something like early summer, warren said. what i'm hearing from capitol hill is some complaints that the administration's a little vague, not entirely clear about what they want. general idea is, though, more flexibility to states – and that means of course more money to spend on roads, bridges, these sorts of things.
and no, i'm not talking about donald trump, i'm talking about mayor bloomberg, said warren, who drew gasps from the audience and debated with the desperation of a candidate fighting to save her campaign.

republicans ultimately caved after 16 days in their efforts to strip funding for the health care plan, and agreed to fund the government at its current levels, in addition to a small change regarding income verification for health care subsidies.
to get on the ballot, advocates in each state had to gather tens of thousands of signatures. early polls show voters back expansion, they say.
in a recent move, walker issued an opinion related to drive-in church services and the louisville mayor's social-distancing order, without hearing first from the mayor. on holy thursday, an american mayor criminalized the communal celebration of easter, walker declared as he opened his opinion.
we fund in excess of $2 billion a year in grants to state and local law enforcement for homeland security, for surveillance equipment, for communications commitment. and, as long as we're on a c.r., i cannot fund those new initiatives, which should be of serious concern to sheriffs, police chiefs, mayors, and governors.

between 2010 and 2016, counties in states where medicaid expanded had 4 fewer deaths per 100,000 residents each year from cardiovascular causes after expansion, compared with counties in non-expansion states, according to the research. the findings were presented at the american heart association's scientific sessions on friday. enrollments for insurance under the aca began in 2014.

bash: ok, senator, we're going to take a quick break.
on your point about the democrats, yes, they are holding up the bill. they're not allowing debate, but in the reality that if there were a debate, this bill still wouldn't pass and, again, when i say this bill, it's funding the department of homeland security but also stopping the president for his executive action on immigration.

but after a group of senate republicans came out with a roughly $600 billion proposal that didn't include any direct state and local funding, many democratic senators immediately torpedoed the proposal, forcing even the moderates to evaluate how hard they ultimately were willing to push for bipartisanship or wait for it, and whether there was too much of a risk of losing votes on the progressive side of the caucus.

all these rural hospitals are operating on thin margins. the removal of any income source or coverage, or expansion of bad debt, is going to create significant financial hardship, said alan morgan, ceo of the national rural health association.
cruz: you know, unfortunately right now, dana, the democrats are working as a unit to filibuster funding for the department of homeland security. and it's one of the patterns we've seen the last six years that's really unusual, is that senate democrats have consistently been unwilling to take on the president. it's part of why harry reid and the democrats shut down the senate. and i got to say it's unprecedented.

so i think the right answer -- and there is a difference of opinion about this, but the right answer is only combat troops in limited circumstances, and then there's some other differences of opinion, too, that we're going to have to work through in hearings in the foreign relations committees.
and then there's the question of whether debates matter that much anyway. it could be that the cacophony of multiple, fierce attacks from a presidential field piling on will only underscore bloomberg's argument to centrist voters that he's different.
we've essentially gutted it anyway, trump said.

soon after, roberts began trying to persuade kennedy to find that the unconstitutional insurance requirement could be severed from the rest of the law. but kennedy -- often a swing vote on high-profile cases -- was firm in his position. he was puzzled, and then put off, by roberts' view that the aca provisions could be severed.
between 2010 and 2016, cardiovascular-related deaths rose from 141.9 to 142 per 100,000 residents each year in the counties in expansion states, while cardiovascular-related deaths rose from 176.1 to 180.6 per 100,000 residents annually in the counties in non-expansion states, the data showed.

insurers are requesting premium increases of 9%, on average, for the benchmark silver plan -- upon which federal subsidies are based -- in major cities in 16 states plus the district of columbia, according to the latest review by the kaiser family foundation. but this masks substantial variation, with requests ranging from a drop of 13% to an increase of 25%. states still have to review the requests and could change them.
but rain and snow, combined with mountainous terrain and limited public transit, mean traveling even short distances poses hardship. it is still challenging to have to travel even 20 miles to get your care, said lisa davis, director of pennsylvania's office of rural health and outreach associate professor of health policy and administration at pennsylvania state university. it could take you all day to get to a one-hour appointment.

biden jabbed bloomberg over a controversial policing tactic when he was new york mayor, for which he later apologized.

heller was a trump critic during the 2016 election. last summer, he famously stood with brian sandoval, nevada's popular outgoing moderate republican governor, and declared his opposition to trump's bill repealing parts of obamacare.
the early word is that the president will state publicly that the united states is officially recognizing jerusalem as the capital of israel, but is holding off, for now, on moving the us embassy from tel aviv.
borger: but the republican caucuses are much more straightforward.
he was just warming up tonight. we fully expect mike will continue to build on tonight's performance when he appears on the stage in south carolina next tuesday, the campaign said.
we were at a distance of some 10 miles from the southern gates of mosul. we heard, saw multiple detonations. the sound of fast-moving aircraft overhead was pretty constant, this as kurdish fighters on the ground are really digging in and holding defensive lines a small distance away from that city.
clinton advirtió que el plan de sanders de un medicare para la atención universal aumentaría los impuestos a la clase media, reabriría el amargo debate con los republicanos y podría poner en peligro el obamacare.
raju: they believe if they have a third-place finish and are much higher than the other establishment type favorites in this race, the governor specifically, if they are 10 points, 15 points higher than them, they will have a very strong message to tell out of iowa and they can go into new hampshire trying to be that unity candidate. we will see if they're able to do that just in a few hours -- wolf. .
mccain was a frequent critic of the president while he was alive and the president often lashed out at the senator, once famously saying that mccain – a vietnam war veteran who was held as a prisoner of war for more than five years – was not a war hero.
tyler: because he has said that he would -- he would fund single- payer health care system, which is where obamacare is leading to. and senator cruz didn't say he supports obama care. he said he supports an obamacare-like system of where obamacare is taking us, which is single payer.
florida sen. marco rubio then pushed back against bush, saying, the authorization that barack obama asked for was not against isis, it was against (syrian president bashar al-) assad. john kerry described it as attacks that would be unbelievably small. i don't think the united states should be engaged in symbolic military activity. it was not against isis, it was against assad.
bash: people who are in contact with isil living in the u.s. right now. how many are we talking about?
despite some state and local governments increasing their minimum wages, the legislative drive to increase the wage has stalled in congress, where democrats were in the minority in either the house or senate, or both, from 2010 until this year.
one new proposal is requiring able-bodied, working-age medicaid enrollees to work. the trump administration is promoting work mandates and has approved requests from eight states to add it to their programs. but his budget would make work requirements mandatory nationwide, said robin rudowitz, associate director for the program on medicaid and the uninsured at the kaiser family foundation.
and in the course of the campaign, look, tad devine and jeff weaver are real pros. they know this. and the clinton people know it too. but enthusiasm, as you said, gloria, is great. and bernie's got it. but that's not enough.
for the candidate himself, i think that it's no coincident that his last formal event before coming here to this rally later is about evangelicals, speaking and rallying evangelical voters at a baptist church nearby. this is where he needs to perform well tonight. he has always been about appealing to evangelicals.
kaine: congress needed to weigh in.
when kennedy and the other justices declined to sever the individual insurance requirement from the rest of the law, roberts turned to congress' taxing power as grounds to uphold the mandate, which carried a penalty for people who did not buy insurance. roberts was joined by the four liberal justices to uphold the law.
nutter: i love that. great spin. (crosstalk)
poco después de ese incidente, la campaña de trump comenzó a hacer un anuncio al principio de sus manifestaciones mediante el que instaba a los partidarios a no lastimar a ningún manifestante, sino que en lugar de eso, gritaran: «trump, trump, trump» y que esperaran que los agentes de seguridad acompañaran a los manifestantes hasta afuera.
murray: when donald trump was holding his rallies earlier today, he said he wanted to emerge victorious. he has made it clear that he really wants to win this state. but i would say that he and his team are cautiously optimistic right now. they know that the poll numbers look good for them. they feel confident in their ground game, even though they have been really tight-lipped about it. it's been very much behind the scenes.
and if bernie has got it, he wins tonight. but just one other quick point. as complicated as the democratic caucuses are, it's even more complicated than we learned, because they're weighted. so based on the turnout the last time, if you have 200 people at once caucus, you don't get as many delegates as you do if you have 200 people at a different caucus.
it's important to remember that securing the white house compound, the protection of the first family and other national leaders is a balance between providing for their physical safety, but we live in democracy where people want transparency, they want access to their national leaders and the buildings and the structures of government. and so it means striking the appropriate balance.
kaine: well, i think that congress in both parties would significantly support it. you heard senator cruz. he's not the only republican who has
anyone can qualify for medicaid based on income, household size, disability, family status and other factors, but the aca allows states to expand medicaid eligibility so that residents can qualify based solely on whether their household income level is a certain percentage below the federal poverty level.
as controversy still rages over his administration's handling of immigrant families at the southern border, trump said he sees the issue as immigration as a winner for republicans in the midterms.
and i think, again, going back to my last point, the king of jordan when he was here just a few days ago, he made that point that this is about having a decisive military strategy coinciding with and ideological war that's existing now within islam. and this is something the king of jordan said has been going on now for the last 1400 years. and it's time for leaders to step up and take action.
i also want you to look at the calendar to -- so people understand how close we are to the deadline for that happening. it's february 27. here we are, just a little more than two weeks away, and we should note that, by the way, congress is out of town. they're not working for one of those weeks, so it makes it incredibly difficult.
republicans in congress had been fighting the law dubbed obamacare at every turn for two years, and all the gop presidential candidates in 2012 had vowed to repeal it. and now roberts, a nominee of president george w. bush, had saved it.
families could receive half their total credit as a periodic payment starting in july and running through the rest of the year, according to the legislation. they could then claim the remaining half on their 2021 tax returns.
medicare now reimburses doctors $86 to discuss end-of-life care in an office visit that covers topics such as hospice, living wills and do-not-resuscitate orders. known as advance care planning, the conversations can also be held in a hospital.
president obama joined the chorus of democrats calling for the creation of a government run health insurance program as obamacare is facing growing problems.
trump ran against it as a presidential candidate and his administration is still seeking to void the law, which after a decade has affected nearly every corner of the health care system.

a quick look on amazon shows the kindle version of bush's 2013 book, immigration wars: forging an american solution, goes for $11.99. the hardcover is priced at $18.78 and the paperback is $13.17. however, you can get a used copy for as little as 50 cents.
kaine: well, partly because the congressional leadership went to the administration in july. both houses in both parties and i'm sad to say this, dana, but the leadership went to the white house and said, do what you need to do. we would rather not take this up before a mid-term election.
americans who would qualify for the relief package's heftier federal premium subsidies for affordable care act policies would need to wait until the new regulations are programmed into the obamacare exchanges, which might take a few weeks.
obama said in 2009 that increasing the us share of trade with asia from 9% to 10% could mean 250,000, 300,000 jobs, but he was not specifically attributing that estimate to the potential effects of a trade deal with south korea.

asked what he learned from his efforts to sell the proposal at a cnn town hall in wisconsin earlier this week, biden didn't hesitate.
it's a position with which republicans disagree. there has been little hesitation from even moderate republicans to reject biden's plan, and the unbending nature of the white house's posture has led many gop senators to question whether biden was ever serious about bipartisanship to begin with.
roberts posited in a draft opinion that congress had in effect held a gun to the head of the states by conditioning all medicaid money on the expanded coverage. yet he was not prepared to find that the expansion had to be scrapped altogether, only that states could not be forced to join through the leverage of losing all medicaid funding.
fighting against a bank bill tuesday, after the vote to advance the legislation, she retweeted a list of democrats who backed it, adding: senate republicans voted unanimously for the #banklobbyistact. but this bill wouldn't be on the path to becoming law without the support of these democrats. the senate just voted to increase the chances your money will be used to bail out big banks again.
i am very familiar with that opinion, because i served as kennedy's law clerk that term, walker wrote. i can tell you with certainty that the only justices following a roadmap from brett kavanaugh were the ones who said obamacare was unconstitutional.
success still isn't guaranteed. a handful of moderate members have made it clear privately and in public statements that they can't support legislation that includes raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour, and schumer will need every single one of his members to back the bill in order to pass it.

today, roe is supported by a majority of the public as it was in a louis harris & associates poll in 1973 after the decision was first reached. and although the question wording used by harris was slightly different than that used by kaiser, support for the decision seems to have risen a little bit.
but the justice department changed the shape of the health care debate and allowed democrats off the defensive. they again stressed the mantra that trump is bent on ripping health care away from americans.
the 37-year-old walker, who was a university of louisville law professor before becoming a us district court judge last fall, has drawn opposition because of his limited legal experience and for his firebrand conservatism even after donning the robe. the american bar association rated him not qualified for his current judgeship.
that's partly because trump is now the personification of the government – he bears responsibility for the state of the health care industry and the struggle many americans are facing in affording spiraling costs of treatment.
and then in the central part of the state, again, obama won in ames, which is where you fin the college towns right there. he was huge. that's about 3 percent. and you find traditional democrats. they tend to be for hillary clinton, older democrats, people involved.
the president concluded his toast by inviting virginia gov. terry mcauliffe, a democrat and the chairman of the national governors association, to give a toast. he described mcauliffe as a friend and a very good guy, but also said, i just destroyed his political career.
by lunchtime, trump's electoral antennae were twitching as the return of obamacare as a driving political issue trampled all over his end-of-the-mueller investigation victory party and hinted at trouble ahead.

policy experts are urging more end-of-life conversations not just to accommodate patients' desires, but to save money on aggressive medical interventions that patients and their families don't want and that won't prolong life.
usually the clerks are extremely circumspect about their time working on cases, said josh blackman, author of the 2013 book unprecedented: the constitutional challenge to obamacare and a professor at south texas college of law. i was very stunned about how cavalier he was with that issue.
a year after the women's march, i wish i could find my flight attendant friend and ask her what she thinks. i hope she's seen for herself the power of women standing up and taking charge. i hope she exercises her own power to vote. and i hope she knows that when she does, she won't be alone.
sanders, por su parte, estuvo mucho más cómodo en el ataque a clinton que en sus anteriores encuentros, y la noche en charleston, carolina del sur, fue notable más por sus enfrentamientos personales que por los ataques contra los republicanos. él se defendió de clinton insistiendo en que obama era su amigo y le dio un golpe a la precandidata por sus relaciones con wall street desde que dejó el departamento de estado.
from a political perspective, the administration's revival of the health care debate was a disaster.
kentucky sen. rand paul said, the bulk collection of your phone data, the invasion of your privacy, did not stop one terrorist attack. i don't think you have to give up your liberty for a false sense of security. when we look at this bulk collection – the court has looked at this – even the court declared it to be illegal. if we want to collect the records of terrorists, let's do it the old fashioned way. let's use the fourth amendment.
the votes aren't there to pass that, right?
clinton and congressional republicans disagreed over federal spending, and republicans refused to sign a bill in an effort to get democrats to cut funding for medicare and medicaid.
you are somebody who actually has been there. you were in combat in iraq. do you think it is the right thing to be sending in as many as 10,000 ground troops that some are calling for in order to just try to completely annihilate isis once and for all?

sahil kapur of bloomberg discussed how democrats are debating what is worth the most effort – and whether they are prepared to withhold their votes, and perhaps trigger a government shutdown, if they can't get what they want.
now, with narrow majorities in both chambers and biden in the white house, democrats are renewing the push. vermont sen. bernie sanders' proposal to get a federal $15 minimum wage increase from $7.25 back into biden's covid relief bill failed last week, with eight democrats siding with republicans to vote down the amendment. the senate parliamentarian had ruled the hike could not be included in the measure under the strict rules of budget reconciliation.

front-row seat to the court's obamacare drama
in a visit to boost one of the nation's most vulnerable republican senators ahead of this fall's november election, president donald trump unveiled a new nickname for the democrat running to unseat sen. dean heller.
the status quo is something that nobody in the democratic circles really likes, and doesn't want to embrace. the status quo represents the banks that we have to break up, the health care system that isn't working for people, and trade agreements that aren't working for people.
the bill to which fiorina is referring, the veterans affairs management accountability act of 2014, would give authority to the secretary of the va to fire about 400 senior executives for poor performance. the bill passed the house in may 2014 but has since been sitting in the senate.
the financial data billionaire also drew on his own professional heritage to try to defuse the attacks and to present himself as the antidote to the chaos ripping through washington.
we borrowed a ream of paper from the newsroom copier (500 sheets) and measured it to be two inches thick. the average building story height is 10 feet. so, if you do the math, a three-story building would be about as tall as 90,000 sheets of paper. that's pretty close to the height of an imaginary stack of new regulations.
beck criticó a trump por amenazar a los manifestantes en las concentraciones anteriores, y señaló que trump emitió un tuit amenazante el lunes dirigido a la familia ricketts, la cual ha sido activa en el área política en los ciclos recientes.
so it is a pretty significant shift that they're now kind of downplaying expectations. ted cruz himself today, you can sense a little bit of doubt in his voice today. he said he is at peace where he is in iowa. he's saying, although he does feel good, he went on to say this is in god's hands. this is in voters' hands. he says if donald trump wins here tonight, he will happily congratulate him and then move on -- wolf.

johnson: it is a more complex situation, very clearly.
republicans will oppose the bill for a series of reasons, from the topline cost on down, but the combination of a party still finding its way in the wake of trump's loss, along with a series of proposals that have maintained popularity, has stunted the force of the opposition, the official said.

between taunts about ted cruz's eligibility to serve as president donald trump on sunday showed off a softer side.
the department of health & human services is starting to make changes, including taking drug utilization into account. last week, it said it will propose modifying the risk adjustment program to absorb some of the cost for claims above a certain threshold, funded by payments from all insurers.
instead, obamacare funded the creation of non-profit co-op insurers to provide consumers with alternatives. but more than half of them have failed since their debut in 2014, undone mainly by enrollees' unexpectedly high medical use. other insurers -- particularly unitedhealthcare (unh) -- have announced they are pulling out of obamacare, further restricting consumers' choices.
we found a new strategy for expanding medicaid in states where politicians simply refuse to … going over their heads and straight to voters, said jonathan schleifer, executive director of the fairness project, which provides funding and guidance to grassroots campaigns.
rep. john yarmuth, chairman of the house budget committee, said tuesday that democrats will use every option available to them to pass the upcoming infrastructure bill, but the hope is they will be able to build a bipartisan package that can be passed without using reconciliation. that would mean the legislation would need to garner at least 10 republican votes in the senate.

but even on the issue of abortion, it could be argued that the court energized the anti-abortion groups and polarized the issue across partisan lines. that was the argument that none other justice ruth bader ginsburg has offered. she noted back in 2013 that her criticism of roe is that it seemed to have stopped the momentum on the side of change.
rubio's claim that cruz supported paul's budget – which was advertised as reducing the size of the military, but which actually increased defense spending – is true. but his assertion that cruz hasn't supported other measures is false, since he supported rubio's own bill that increased spending.

democrats flipped 15 seats in the virginia house of delegates. eleven of those races were won by women, including the first openly transgender state legislator, the first vietnamese-american legislator, and the first two latinas to serve in the house of delegates.
that finding was based on a review of 77 previously published studies on medicaid, but only 16 examined quality of care and health outcomes.
when roberts cast the decisive vote to uphold the landmark health care law in 2012, he linked its penalty for people who refused to obtain insurance to congress' taxing power. roberts' final decision, which came after multiple changes in his reasoning, saved obamacare but generated intense friction inside and outside the court.
(cnn) the biden administration told the supreme court on wednesday that it should uphold the affordable care act, reversing the position of the trump administration that had urged the justices to strike down the entire law amid the coronavirus pandemic.
rubio's claim harkens back to a 2013 amendment introduced by paul that would have set defense spending levels at what, on paper, was a lower level than in previous years.
but biden also faces an existential challenge to his candidacy from bloomberg, who is essentially arguing that he's better placed to fulfill the mission around which the former vice president has anchored his campaign beating trump.
paul, who has warned against big government and overspending, did tout the measure as a way to shrink the military.
«todos dicen que trump va a ganar mañana. solo suponemos que vamos a quedar empatados», le dijo trump a sus partidarios el lunes por la noche.

if they're going to impose this on us, we better prepare to protect the state from it, rubio said, referring to efforts in florida to create a cap-and-trade program. i have never supported cap-and-trade, and i never thought it was a good idea, and i was clear about that at the time.

gop sens. susan collins and mitt romney lead a group of 10 fellow republican senators out of the west wing after meeting with president joe biden and vice president kamala harris at the white house earlier this month.
what we needed today with regard to ukraine was presidential leadership that stood up and said, we're going to honor our treaty commitments. we're going to provide defensive weaponry for the ukrainians who are fighting to defend their own nation, to stand up to russian aggression. that's a message that would be heard by our allies.
borger: here is the fascinating thing about ted cruz. here is a man who was against nsa surveillance. and he is the most data-driven candidate, bar none, even including barack obama. this is somebody who knows everything about every voter in all of the 99 counties of iowa.
bash: ok. well, people are looking for bipartisanship on capitol hill. we saw some here just this morning. unlikely bipartisanship in opposition to ground troops but we heard it nonetheless. senator, thank you so much for your time. appreciate it.
schumer: is the chief justice aware that in the impeachment trial of president johnson, chief justice chase, as presiding officer, cast tie-breaking votes on both march 31 and april 2, 1868?
let's put forward somebody who is actually a democrat.
trump said at the iowa rally: we've ended the war on american energy. the united states is now the number one producer of oil and natural gas anywhere on earth, by far.
gergen: right. but won't we know sort of how many votes were cast and who they went for? one person could win the delegate count and somebody else could win the popular count on that basis.
the exhausting first year of donald trump's presidency
after that, the turnaround time -- between it being a more than 600-page bill and money in people's pockets -- could be relatively quick. people could start seeing the $1,400 stimulus payments hit their bank accounts within days of biden signing the bill -- which is expected to happen soon after the house votes on tuesday.
regarding medicaid, all four liberals voted to uphold the program, and roberts joined them. at the same time, he expressed some tentativeness.
gergen: but that suggests it's going to be a much lower turnout overall.
the ads use identical quotes from trump's 1999 interview on meet the press in which he declares i am pro-choice in every respect.
«¿acaso me perdí la parte en la que donald desafía nuestros hechos?», le dijo la portavoz de cruz, catherine frazier, a cnn. «él no puede, porque nuestros anuncios hablan la verdad… él no es un verdadero conservador. él no puede defender su historial, así que como un niño frustrado, él recurre a los insultos».
blitzer: i remember. i agree with you. six, seven months ago when he announced, it would have been amazing if somebody had made those predictions. so, what do you attribute to that success?
the law doubled the amount of estate value that is exempt from the estate tax, but the law did not eliminate the tax entirely. and there is no basis for his suggestion at both events that small farmers and small businesspeople would especially benefit from his changes; few paid the tax even before. you can read a full fact check here
the effort to sell the proposal started early in the process with biden's transition team regularly consulting with top democratic lawmakers as they constructed their plan. key elements, like the emergency expansion of the child tax credit -- a potentially transformative plank of the plan -- came directly from legislation drafted by democrats that held wide-ranging support in their congressional ranks. there was a recognition, multiple people directly involved said, that the cascading crises meant now was the moment to go big.

a source close to scalise pointed to those public comments, suggesting that ryan's wednesday decision was something people were still digesting before making any new moves.
cruz: at a time of growing national security threats across the world, that's irresponsible.
it was equal parts an inside- and outside-the-beltway effort by the white house, aided by congressional democrats involved early, and often, on both the substance and politics of the proposal. supporters were boosted by a continuous run of positive public polling -- which white house officials and congressional leaders made a point of regularly putting in front of their members -- all as they sought to capitalize on state and district-level officials and advocacy groups they knew would hold sway on capitol hill.
at the end of that speech, obama promised: i won't stop; in fact, i will be right there with you, as a citizen, for all my days that remain.
«este individuo está enfermo, hay algo mal con este tipo», dijo trump.
can you believe that mitch mcconnell, who has screamed repeal & replace for 7 years, couldn't get it done, trump tweeted in august. must repeal & replace obamacare!
kyung lah, cnn national correspondent: well, dana, everything that we have been told by people who are in touch with the family is that they still do not have confirmation. they do not know the status of their daughter.
trump's decision to pick this fight at this moment is, therefore, tough to understand. there's no question that his base hates obamacare and would like to see it gone. and that he believes that at least part of his 2016 victory – and maybe his chances at re-election in 2020 – hinge on him making good on removing the most visible footprint of his predecessor. at rally after rally during the 2018 campaign, trump re-told the story of john mccain's decision to vote against the so-called skinny repeal of obamacare, a line that always drew boos and jeers directed at the late arizona senator from the crowd.
trump said at the iowa rally that, under a deal with south korea about sharing the cost of the us troops in the country, they gave us $500 million a year more.

the new bill builds upon the previous versions of the vawa by providing grants and support to various groups that work on issues relating to sexual assault, domestic violence and prevention, expanding protections, among other things.
cruz: well, i think it's a good talking point for people who want to shift blame. let's be clear, the cromnibus was leadership's plan. i said at the time it is a bad plan and it is a plan that is designed to lose.
a provision that would close the  boyfriend loophole , prohibiting dating partners convicted of assault or stalking from purchasing firearms, has been a sticking point between democrats and republicans. the new bill would prohibit those convicted of misdemeanor stalking from buying a firearm and makes it illegal for a person to transfer or sell a firearm or ammunition to a person they believe has been convicted of misdemeanor stalking.
in the house, gop leadership has urged their conference to vote no on the package, pointing out a series of issues with abortion-related language and the bill's overall effect on the federal deficit.
the report showed that only 4% of employers with at least 50 employees said they shifted some staffers to part-time hours so they wouldn't qualify for health care, and another 4% said they were reducing the number of full-time employees they planned to hire because of the cost of health benefits. kaiser found that 10% of employers reported that they were changing workers from part-time to full-time status to enable them to obtain coverage.
obama did, in fact, go to congress in august 2013 to ask for authorization to strike the government of assad in retaliation for a chemical weapons attack. that resolution was never passed by either chamber but was presented to the senate after passing through a senate committee.

the trump administration unveiled a budget monday that would reduce spending in medicare as well as medicaid, which provides coverage for low-income americans, by hundreds of billions of dollars compared to current law.
he went on to propose giving the florida department of environmental protection a mandate to design a cap-and-trade, or a carbon tax program, and bring it back to the legislature for ratification. months later, rubio presided over a unanimous vote in the florida house to do just that, according to the tampa bay times.
we have a great economic growth right now. industries are booming everywhere. in this area, no, but i feel like there are small businesses that are starting to pick up. they feel comfortable with bidding and doing work because the economy is good. the stock market's solid. unemployment is down. these are huge things for if i were to go into business i would want to do it in a situation like this.
immigrant advocacy groups are urging the biden administration to move quickly, and the white house announced last month an immigration bill that would provide an eight-year path to citizenship for millions of immigrants already in the country and provide a faster track for undocumented immigrants brought to the us as children. biden's proposed bill, if passed, also would remove the word alien from us immigration laws, replacing it with the term noncitizen.

women in pink hats and t-shirts flooded town hall meetings, demanding answers. members of congress couldn't handle the heat and started avoiding their own constituents. an avalanche of angry callers bore down on the congressional switchboard. an analysis by democratic pollsters lake research partners examined the usage of the popular app daily action, which directly connects people to their representatives, and showed that 86% of calls made to lawmakers in the months immediately after the march were coming from – you guessed it – women.
last night in federal court, the justice department of the trump administration, you'd think they'd have more to do, decided not only to try to destroy protections for pre-existing conditions, but to tear down every last benefit and protection the aca affords, pelosi said.
another central tenet of his campaign, the ban – proposed at first to target all muslims, then reframed after his swearing-in to focus on citizens from seven majority muslim nations – has been the administration's most controversial initiative so far.
trump said at the iowa rally that democratic presidential candidate joe biden drew a speech crowd so small that the campaign turned it into a roundtable discussion, roping in unwitting attendees to answer questions like, what do you think of socialism?
large insurers aren't the only ones running into trouble. more than half of the co-op insurers, created and funded by the health reform law, have failed. this means consumers in a growing number of areas have only one or two insurers to pick from.
the supreme court in theory is immune from the majority will. justices have lifetime appointments.
trump said in michigan: but we had a tremendous, landslide electoral college victory, like people haven't seen in a long time.
what it says is, if you like your employer-sponsored insurance, you like the network that you're in, you like the doctors that you can see, you're happy with that, you can keep it, o'rourke said thursday in portsmouth, new hampshire. in response to an audience question. if you do not like your employer-based insurance and want to enroll in medicare, you can. if you have no insurance whatsoever or if you are under-insured today, you can enroll in medicare as well.
pamela brown to biden: why not carve out time to answer tough questions?
zeleny: well, one of the things that they're trying to do is just sort of the supporter-to-supporter network. there are so many volunteers here from outside of the country for all campaigns.
thursday's debate also revealed another irony of the democratic race that could come down to a battle between sanders and bloomberg.
it seems increasingly clear that big, national insurers are having trouble competing in the obamacare marketplaces and making money, said larry levitt, senior vice president at the kaiser family foundation. some insurers are still doing well, particularly those that historically served medicaid beneficiaries.
but here at home, we do a pretty good job of tracking these individuals. and we have, in a number of instances, arrested people for material support, for attempting to travel to syria, for example.
dr. ivor benjamin, president of the american heart association, called the new research exciting and said the association has gone on the record with its support of affordable, accessible and available health care.

as was his prerogative as chief justice, roberts chose to write the majority opinion, giving him the ability to shape what the court would ultimately say. senior liberal justice ginsburg was ready to write for the dissenting foursome.
this isn't officially included on this list. it isn't the fairest comparison, given that half a century has passed and the country looks markedly different than it did in 1971. but the may day protests against the vietnam war have been described as the largest mass arrest and largest mass acquittal of demonstrators in us history.
we rate bush's claim as true because congress did not bring the resolution up for a vote.
a recent study found nearly 40 percent of american patients dying with cancer received at least one chemotherapy treatment in the six months before they died, more than in six other countries studied. an average of about $18,500 was spent on u.s. hospital costs for patients in their last six months.
georgia republican sen. david perdue defended the building's current namesake after schumer initially raised the idea.

this was an icon in the united states senate. he was lyndon johnson's close adviser. they did the great society together. so, people would criticize richard russell for maybe being on the wrong side of the integration movement, but my goodness he turned around and got the school lunch program done. he did that himself, perdue said at the time. russell was a segregationist who was opposed to the civil rights act.

we have been friends for a long time, trump said from the white house rose garden with the kentucky republican at his side. we are probably now, despite what we read, we are probably now, i think, at least as far as i am concerned, we are closer than ever before and the relationship is very good. we are fighting for the same thing, we are fighting for lower taxes, big tax cuts, the biggest tax cuts in the history of our nation. we are fighting for tax reform as part of that.
the largest single-day arrest count from the protests, however, came in september, when demonstrators -- many of whom, reuters reported, were in wheelchairs (most of them belonged to a disability rights group ) -- delayed a senate hearing. capitol police began rounding them up en masse.

in one tweet over the weekend, the president attacked mccain for opposing a republican effort to repeal obamacare, describing it as a stain against the late senator.
it's important to study health policy in a more quantitative manner, and i think we're seeing an increasing number of research studies on these kinds of topics, he said. this research just sort of fits in with a growing trend of research in this area.
a lot of people have already discussed [the tax changes], openly stating that it's going to benefit the top 1%, which it will. they're mostly going to gain from it. however, the middle class people are going to receive child tax credits. that's big. that is big for a family. also we're going to see a little alleviation from the taxes – they say we're going to start seeing it on our paychecks very soon. … i honestly believe that trump is doing this to bring corporations back to america. i think he's trying to make it easier for these big companies with the money to say, hey we could do this in the united states for a lesser price now because he's given us this tax back.
that's true. there were 12.3 million manufacturing workers in the u.s. last month, down from 17.3 million at the start of 2000, according to the federal bureau of labor statistics.
to the memory of pocahontas, i apologize, he said.
more broadly, women are shaking the foundations of our culture. since day one of this administration, women have been persisting, reclaiming our time and saying once and for all that #timesup. the radical power of the #metoo movement has demonstrated that we are done accepting the status quo. it's time. an america where everyone has an equal shot at success means our country is more likely to live up to its promise.
i'd name the capitol after him, if i could, graham told reporters last year, noting though that an important piece of this was the mccain family's input in how they wanted to see mccain memorialized.
signed by president barack obama, who later embraced the obamacare name, the affordable care act required all americans to obtain coverage and created a marketplace for purchasing insurance. it also expanded medicaid for poor people and protected diabetics, cancer patients and other individuals with pre-existing conditions from being denied coverage.
trump's promise to build a wall on the southern border was a consistent crowd-pleaser during the campaign. congressional republicans have vowed to finance its construction, but have been short on the how and when details.

cooper: that's right. caucus sites around the state of iowa opening at the top of the hour. coming up next, john king lays out what to look for as the night unfolds. the crucial clues that could spell victory or defeat of a candidate.

kevin, in terms of, you look at donald trump. you look at ted cruz. they have campaigned so differently in iowa. ted cruz has gone to all 99 counties, really reached out to evangelicals, reached out to local officials. donald trump has had big events there, obviously. he has been spending more time there lately, but has not spent the time that ted cruz has and has not really advertised until just the last couple of weeks.
those of us who follow the facts, like i couldn't be happier with what he did in this past year. and he, to me, is a man of his word and that is the most important thing to me. i don't want another suave-suit politician. i'm sick of it. i want someone to keep their word. i want them to love this country like i love this country. i want them to put americans first for a change.
women aren't only affecting policy; they are determining election outcomes. in the two most closely watched races since the 2016 election, women of color turned out and made history. the democratic sweep in virginia and the election of sen. doug jones in alabama – after a race in which his opponent was accused of sexually abusing young women (allegations he denied) – defied what many believed was possible a year ago.
and that's what is going to be put to the test, is whether or not -- it think this is a big test on whether or not momentum is going to be able to beat grassroots infrastructure.
when the court tries to get ahead of public opinion, it can inflict a major backlash. the most noticeable example is when the court outlawed the death penalty in 1972. although the public's favoring of the death penalty was dropping at the time of the decision, more americans were for it than against it. after the decision, support for the death penalty climbed by about 15 points and states passed measures challenging the court's decision.
all of that has contributed to a firm sense inside the white house that the politics are firmly in their favor, several aides made clear. and not just that supporters would be rewarded politically, but that those who opposed it -- congressional republicans -- would take a hit.
washington (cnn) judge justin walker , now nominated to a powerful federal court dubbed the second highest in the nation, remains bitter that the supreme court upheld the affordable care act eight years ago.
he won -- finished third place. he was soaring for so long and crashed. but all the sanders advisers believe that so much is different now, because the social media, how we communicate is different now.
i'm starting to get an inkling of why he uses twitter in the way he does. because if all he had to rely on was what people say about him, oh my god, i might not like the guy. and i love the guy, i love the job he's doing.
that figure appears to be correct, according to the navy's naval history and heritage command website, which tracks the size of the navy going back to the 19th century.
after a meeting with a bipartisan group of senators and biden, vice president kamala harris and transportation secretary pete buttigieg last month , sen. jim inhofe, an oklahoma republican, told reporters it was a very good meeting and that there are mutual interests among both sides as long as no one tries to take the bill hostage.

under the program, customers' health status is based on diagnoses of chronic costly conditions, such as diabetes and hiv. but insurers argue that enrollees' use of prescription drugs, particularly expensive specialty drugs, should be included in the formula.
but we're not seeing leadership from the administration to get that done. instead, they continue to send weaponry to baghdad, who doesn't pass it onto the peshmerga, and it doesn't get put to use effectively.
enrollees would pay no more than 8.5% of their income towards coverage, down from nearly 10% now. also, those earning more than the current cap of 400% of the federal poverty level -- about $51,000 for an individual and $104,800 for a family of four in 2021 -- would become eligible for help. the provision, which is retroactive to january, would last for two years.
when congress passed the last relief bill extending the unemployment programs, some of the jobless had already started exhausting their pandemic benefits, which were created last march.
a year ago, when more than 20 co-ops were up and running, about 1 million americans were insured through these plans. by contrast, the alliance says the seven co-ops that will remain in 2017 have about 350,000 members. their supporters continue to tout them for cost-effective coverage, pointing to sources such as a recent report by the government accountability office that found co-ops' average monthly premiums in 2015 were below the averages for other plans in most areas.
mexico has deployed around 27,000 troops, but trump exaggerated how many are being stationed near the us border in particular. cnn reported on november 2 that the mexican government had reported the following: nearly 15,000 troops are deployed to mexico's northern border, where they've set up 20 checkpoints. ... at the southern border, 12,000 troops are deployed and have set up 21 checkpoints. you can read a full fact check here
as to whether employers are cutting jobs because of obamacare, it's nearly impossible to determine from labor department data since the economy is recovering and adding jobs. the number of people who can only find part-time jobs has declined in recent years, signifying companies are hiring more full-time workers.
nebraska organizers also collected far more signatures than they needed using similar tactics. some 90,000 residents will gain coverage, more than two-thirds of whom work but their jobs don't provide health insurance, said meg mandy, campaign manager for insure the good life, which is promoting expansion in the cornhusker state. also, expansion will bring the state $1.1 billion in federal funding over four years and sustain 10,000 jobs, many of which are in rural areas.
if you believe the old line that timing is everything in politics, the timing of the michael flynn plea deal interesting – in at least a couple of ways.

in order to build consensus quickly, aides and members say that a decision was made early to write a bill that tracked very closely with biden's own american rescue plan. the thinking from the start was that beginning from the ground up in committees could take too much time and potentially result in unnecessary democratic infighting in a moment when unity was paramount.
trump repeatedly claimed that electing rosen to the senate amounts to backing house minority leader nancy pelosi and senate minority leader chuck schumer.
numerous media outlets, including cnn , have provided comparisons between the arrests during wednesday's siege and those made during the summer's black lives matters protests in the capital.

i just also want to point out that, in your own contingency plan in 2013 if there were a shutdown then, nearly 90 percent of border patrol agents would still have to work, 85 percent of ice agents, and 93 percent of tsa officials. they would have to come to work without pay, but they would have to come to work.
trump said at the iowa rally: drug overdose deaths have declined for the first time in nearly 31 years.

one year ago, i took a flight from miami to washington, hoping to arrive in time for the women's march the next morning. our flight attendant leaned over to me and asked, do you think it's going to make any difference, this march? she wore a pin commemorating her 20 years of airline service, and i could hear the skepticism in her voice. i understood her uncertainty – was the anger and passion shared by so many women across america in the wake of the 2016 presidential election enough to inspire real change?

washington (cnn) as senators decided thursday whether to call witnesses in donald trump's impeachment trial, the president did what he usually does: say numerous things that aren't true.

listen, what we needed here and what we have needed for six years is strong american leadership. the obama-clinton-kerry foreign policy has been consistently wrong. it's been wrong on russia. it's been wrong on isis. it's been wrong on iran.
