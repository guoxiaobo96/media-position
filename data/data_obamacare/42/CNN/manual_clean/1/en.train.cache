It's also misleading to suggest that the estate tax had been a particular burden on small farms and small businesses; very few of them were paying the tax even before Trump's changes came into effect. According to the Tax Policy Center, a mere 50 farms and closely held businesses were among the 5,190 estates to pay the estate tax in 2017, before Trump's tax law. The Center wrote on its website: The Tax Policy Center estimates that small farms and businesses will pay $20 million in estate tax in 2017, one-tenth of 1 percentage of the total estate tax revenue.

BASH: Governor Kasich, let's get back to Social Security. You told a voter in New Hampshire to quote, Get over cuts to Social Security benefits because you have a reform plan and that is just the reality you say that is out there. Why is cutting Social Security payments the solution?
KASICH: Well, thank you. You know, I look in the faces of people all across this country, and I know they want to be hopeful. And many are hopeful. Look, I can take conservative policies to the White House, to Washington, to restore the strength of our economy. But I also want to transfer power, money and influence to where you live, because I believe the strength in this country rests in the neighborhoods, the families, the communities and our states.
Some parts of Obamacare I don't think will work, I don't think is fair, I don't think is intelligent, whatever. But I don't have a better answer other than let's try this, Bloomberg also said.

All told, states get hundreds of billions of federal dollars each year in Medicaid funding to cover a total of more than 70 million people, mainly low-income children, parents, senior citizens and those with disabilities.
For Biden, who as a candidate branded himself the Democrat best positioned to break Capitol Hill gridlock, the story of his presidency could well be written over the coming weeks, as the work of crafting the bill and wrangling votes for it begins in earnest. But even in the face of Republican opposition and Democratic anxiety, Biden is betting on himself and a team of seasoned negotiators to deliver not only a massive aid package, but also a victory that would vindicate one of the core premises of his political life -- that there is always room and reason to negotiate with partisan foes.
Last weekend, Trump attacked McCain in several tweets that targeted his ties to the controversial Russia dossier and his vote against repealing Obamacare. He also referred to McCain as being last in his class at the US Naval Academy.

Donald Trump could not care less about the health and well-being of the American people. He has no attachment to good governance, professional ethics, or public service. He doesn't like independent watchdogs because they're inconvenient for him ; he prefers lapdogs. And so he is exploiting the pandemic to sack anyone who might point out just how terribly he has mangled the response.

Strong initial sign-ups, however, don't necessarily result in record enrollment. Last year, many consumers rushed to pick policies in November and December, particularly after President Trump was elected.
The reason: let's say Republicans are filibustering HR1, the voting rights legislation that passed the House. If enough GOP senators are willing to talk they could take turns and go all through the night for days and days.
Biden shot back at Sanders, saying that Obama did not praise the Cuban government. Biden then accused Sanders of not condemning the Cuban government.
Though Trump has largely leaned on stock market gains, boosted take-home pay and record low unemployment as major highlights of his presidency, his full record on the economy is mixed at best. Many those economic achievements dissipated when the coronavirus hit.

Those comments come after a weekend in which Trump repeatedly attacked McCain, who, in case you forgot, is deceased, for graduating last in his class from the Naval Academy and for allegedly sending the so-called Steele dossier to the media. (Trump offered zero proof that McCain had leaked the dossier, put together by a former British intelligence agent, to the press.)
CONSUEGRA: No, no, a couple of them, yes. They were big, too. Yes, real big, big guys.

In general, what I hear from the conservative base in Wisconsin is, why aren't you guys supporting Trump? Where's the funding for the wall? But specifically, why didn't you fix Obamacare, Johnson said. The problem we had – and this wasn't the leader's fault – we had Republican senators who didn't honor their promise to repeal it.

While we don't yet have an analysis of the Senate's plan, it is clear that if signed into law, the bill would fall well short of Trump's broad promises to insure everyone. According to the CBO, under the House bill that passed in May – which is similar to the Senate bill – 23 million Americans who already have insurance would lose their coverage within a decade.
Steyer, who has spent $14.7 million on ads in Nevada to Sanders' $1.9 million, also came up frequently in interviews with Latino voters, with a majority of people saying they had seen or heard an ad from the campaign.

There are some pretty significant outstanding questions that we never got answers to. For example, we all now know about the June 2016 meeting between Trump operatives and family members and the Russian operatives. And we also know that there was a phone call made shortly thereafter between a member of the family and a blocked number. We've been trying to determine the source of that number for quite some time, but we received no cooperation either from the witnesses or from the majority party. And I'm just using that, Don, as one example of where we may be able to follow up and provide some information that is relevant to this investigation.

PENDERS: I think they're behaving like a bunch of spoiled children, like a bunch of five-year-olds throwing temper tantrums especially the Republicans. Yes. They need to get over it. The Affordable Care Act is law. It was upheld by the Supreme Court. It's law. It went into effect October 1st. And the Republicans just need to deal with it, stop that point shoulder and get us back to work. I feel like I'm being held a hostage by the Republicans.

One thing that likely prompted more Americans to sign up for coverage was a hike in the tax penalty for staying uninsured. Those without health insurance in 2016 will have to pay as much as $695 per person, up from $325 last year.
This is not merely a matter of semantics. During the House impeachment process, Republicans complained that Trump was being denied constitutional rights afforded to criminal defendants -- wrongly suggesting to the public that the House process was tantamount to a trial.

We're going to have insurance for everybody, he said in an interview with The Washington Post. There was a philosophy in some circles that if you can't pay for it, you don't get it. That's not going to happen with us.
TILLERSON: The president would say, well, here's what I want to do, and here's how I want to do it. And I'd have to say to him, well, Mr. President, I understand what you want to do, but you can't do it that way. It violates the law.

But the President is looking at the Mueller investigation coming to a conclusion perhaps sometime in the next few months. The President is looking at a situation where he's already done a tax cut into a full employment environment.

It is going to be a tough sled for any chief of staff for any White House in this next Congress, I think.
SCARAMUCCI: You're being an establishmentarian because you're taking about once against the sclerosis and the centralization and the bureaucracy, all of the things that the people of the United States do not like about Washington, D.C., and all of the reasons why the president was elected to come down here and try to disrupt it.

As a senator, Biden sponsored the Violence Against Women Act, legislation that aimed, in part, at improving how prosecutors and police worked to combat domestic violence.

Here's what I also know: There are certain things that are right and certain things that are wrong – whether you are a Democrat, a Republican or somewhere in between. And attacking a dead man who spent five years as a prisoner of war and another three decades serving the country in elected office, is simply wrong. That's true if Barack Obama, George W.

So, what we're saying is that's really kinda not fair to the -- to the man or woman who is working at a job that doesn't get health insurance offered to them. Let's equalize the tax treatment of health care and give people the same kind of tax benefit to go buy health insurance if they don't get it from their job. And giving a person a monthly portable tax credit gives them the ability upfront to go buy health insurance of their choosing.
So he considers this to be a bit of a success. The concern here is that you have many paths by which this escalation of rhetoric could actually escalate out in the real world. And that's why the atmospheric test, I think, would be a significant issue, because it would -- it would raise very high the question of whether the U.S. should try to take out a North Korean missile, if this all was coming -- was being prepared for launch. And that's how you get on the pathway to a larger conflict.

Facts First: Trump has set at least one important record on judicial appointments -- he has appointed more appeals court judges than any other president at this point in a term -- but not every record.

China reported 6.1% GDP growth in 2019, its slowest rate since 1990.

New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who has been attacked on his stewardship of the Garden State, bragged that in 2015, New Jersey has had the best year of job growth that our state has ever had in the last 15 years.
But so far, as the midway point of the term approaches, the public has been left with hardly any clues concerning the direction of the court. That's because the justices appear to be moving more slowly than in recent years, having issued only four opinions since October -- a 50% decrease from this time last year.
Our focus with our Healthy Adult Opportunity program is to change the whole paradigm and to reset the framework of how we're working with states, Verma said.

The attorney general secured a $575 million settlement that requires Sutter to change some of its practices.
RUBIO: Well, first let me say that one out of four calls to our office is about a veteran here in Florida that's struggling with the V.A. my brother is a veteran. He's struggling with the V.A.
I think one thing that should be distinguished here is that the media is always taking Trump literally, he said. It never takes him seriously, but it always takes him literally.
Chris Christie and I disagree on more stuff than we agree on. In fact, we were going at each other with the Giants versus the Cowboys at the press conference. I don't have that much to defend right now at 0-6, but --

Still, Tanden, the president of the liberal think tank Center for American Progress, is in the slightly unique position of seeing her support fray on the right and the left -- a scenario that led some observers to register surprise when she was nominated.
Now we hear the President saying, I'm not going to negotiate. They either take my position or not. And the President has not been one that for reasons of personal character like smooching with politicians which is helpful, if it comes time to negotiate.

SEN. SHERROD BROWN (D), OHIO: Good to be back. Thanks, Dana.
LONG: Unfortunately the U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico both have very fragile power systems. After Irma we had 90 percent of the power back on in Puerto Rico. I think we will see the majority of it knocked off not only in Puerto Rico but power will remain off in the Virgin Islands for a very long time.
From the jump, Trump has employed a cadre of Wall Street veterans (the same globalists Bannon derided and did battle with during his time at the White House) and pursued economic policies in line with establishment Republican dogma. The tax cuts he signed last year were the logical end point, giving massive, permanent breaks to corporations and, well, a mixed bag to individuals and lower-earners.
On Tuesday, he continued his criticism, telling reporters at the White House that I was never a fan of John McCain and I never will be.
Samantha Vinograd pointed out that the US had three months to get ready for the crisis: Whether it's sharing his 'hunch' that the coronavirus death rate is lower than 3.4%, saying that the United States had contained the spread of the virus from China back in February, claiming that cases are going down, muddying the waters on vaccine development and more, pointed out that the US had three months to get ready for the crisis: Whether it's sharing his 'hunch' that the coronavirus death rate is lower than 3.4%, saying that the United States had contained the spread of the virus from China back in February, claiming that cases are going down, muddying the waters on vaccine development and more, the President is a walking, talking, tweeting disaster when it comes to the communications strategy required during a complex crisis like this one.
One of the things I came to Congress for was to get to universal health care, said House Budget Committee Chairman John Yarmuth of Kentucky, who sponsored the spending outline for Biden's proposal. The closer we get to that, I'm thrilled.
Facts First: Trump's approval rating among Republicans has crept up to : Trump's approval rating among Republicans has crept up to around 95% in some polls, but even 95% would not be a record. George W. Bush hit 99% in Gallup polling after the 9/11 terrorist attacks of 2001. Also, we could not find any major poll around the day of this tweet in which his overall approval rating was 53%.

It includes humanitarian assistance, more law enforcement, drug detection at our ports, closing loopholes that enable child smuggling, and plans for a new physical barrier, or wall, to secure the vast areas between our ports of entry.

So I think that returns us to the judge universe of candidates, the Paul Watford's, the Sri Srinivasan's, the Jean Kelly's, not the politicians, even though I think it would be a good idea to have some politicians on the Supreme Court again. They used to be on the court all the time.
I want to build on the momentum that we saw here in 2018, Klobuchar told reporters Saturday in Wisconsin. No one ever thought that the Democrats were going to be able (to defeat) Gov. Walker, but we did it, and we did it in a smart, Wisconsin way with a grassroots campaign with (Democratic Sen.) Tammy Baldwin at the top of the ticket, and we can do it in the presidential, as well.

I endorsed him at his request, and I gave him the kind of funeral that he wanted, which as President I had to approve. I don't care about this. I didn't get thank you. That's OK. We sent him on the way. But I wasn't a fan of John McCain, Trump said during a speech Wednesday at a tank factory in Lima, Ohio.
BROWN: Thanks, Dana, always. Thank you.
I am running because I see that sense of community is getting fractured, Klobuchar said on Sunday in Iowa. It's getting fractured by someone in the White House who gets up every morning and tweets whatever he wants but doesn't respect the amendment that allows him to do it.

Explicación completa: no fui al acto en Florida, pero he estado en muchos, muchos mítines de Trump, y como he intentado hacerle entrevistas a la audiencia, he notado que los creyentes de Trump tienen dos cosas en común. Una es una sospecha en contra de los periodistas. Siempre quieren saber qué medio represento y qué preguntas probablemente haría. Una vez que la entrevista ha terminado, por lo general dicen lo mismo: «¿Por qué los medios de comunicación odian tanto a Donald Trump?». Respondo que estamos haciendo nuestro trabajo haciendo preguntas de la misma manera que lo hacemos con todos los políticos. Pero no hay forma de escapar a la idea de que los medios de comunicación tienen una inclinación institucional.

The Affordable Care Act cut California's uninsured rate from 17% in 2013 to about 7% last year due largely to the Medicaid expansion, which added more than 3.7 million adults to the state's Medi-Cal rolls. But that has not ensured access to health care for millions of suburbanites, said Alina Schnake-Mahl, a doctoral candidate at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health in Boston, who was lead author of the Health Affairs study.
TAPPER (voice-over): Great news. Panda Cam is back. More importantly, the federal government is open for business.

CHENEY: Well, you're not going to be surprised, Jake. I'm not going to negotiate about it this morning on your show.

President Donald Trump's second Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh, will almost certainly be confirmed by Senate Republicans and, depending on how the confirmation hearings unfold, a few red state Democrats.

It also maintains state regulators' oversight of these policies. This allows them to retain some say in what benefits are offered and to monitor the financial health of the plans, depending on how the associations are set up.

Whereas, in my case, I can say, hey, I was governor of a state when we had eight hurricanes and four tropical storms. No one -- no one blamed the state of Florida for its response. That we created the most ambitious school choice programs. That we took on lifetime employment protections for government workers. I've got a story to tell and he doesn't. And that's the difference.

As President Trump celebrated himself in front of a crowd of global corporate leaders at the recent World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, we're reminded who his government really cares about. Whether you're from a shithole country, or are simply not a multimillionaire, the bottom line is that you're disposable.
Many people dream of making an early exit from the work-a-day routine. But making that dream a reality can be a challenge. The reason is simple. By retiring at 55 instead of, say, 65, you not only have 10 fewer years of saving and investing to build a nest egg, that nest egg also has to support you through an extra 10 years of retirement. That double-whammy of fewer working years to save and more retirement years to spend is what makes early retirement so tough to pull off.

The GOP bill, titled the American Health Care Act, would eliminate the enhanced federal funding for Medicaid expansion and cap federal support of the entire program.

In his speech Thursday night, Biden said he would like to work with members of both parties to enact his American Rescue Plan, indicating that he wants to go the traditional route, which would require the backing of at least 10 Republican senators.
BASH: The president's power play is forcing some Republican lawmakers to make a tough choice: support their principles or their president.
The credits will range from $2,000 for 20-somethings to $4,000 for those in their early 60s. The credits will also have an income cap.

The House will vote on the legislation, called the American Health Care Act, on Thursday. Republican leadership has already made several changes to placate both conservatives and moderates, but a number of members in both chambers remain concerned. So a lot may change before it reaches President Trump's desk.
Hunter Biden was appointed to the board of Burisma in 2014 . At the time, he was a lawyer at the firm Boies Schiller Flexner, an adjunct professor at Georgetown University's foreign service program, chairman of the board of World Food Program USA, and chief executive officer and chairman of Rosemont Seneca Advisors, an investment advisory firm. He also served on other boards.
And the question is whether he can continue to perform his duties while he is trying to litigate these very serious claims.

Most of the questions on Monday will come from New Hampshire voters, an electorate which prizes its position as the first-in-the-nation primary and is often known for asking discerning and pointed questions.
TRUMP: No, we're asking for 5.6. Somebody said 2.5. No, look, this is national security we're talking about. Just like we talk about the military, just like we're talking about Syria or Afghanistan or all these different places. I mean, we spend in Afghanistan more in one month than what we're talking about for the wall.

Apple will pay up to half a billion dollars to settle a class action lawsuit alleging it used software updates to slow down older phones. The proposed settlement agreement requires Apple to pay the owners of certain iPhone models $25 per affected device. The two-year-long lawsuit has inspired global backlash, with some suggesting Apple intentionally diminished their devices' performance to force users to upgrade. Apple says it was just trying to address issues with older lithium-ion batteries. iPhone users in the US can file settlement claims if they owned an iPhone 6, 6 Plus, 6S, 6S Plus, 7, 7 Plus or SE device bought before December 21, 2017.

Trump claimed twice that he had reversed an Obama-era decision that had impeded testing for the coronavirus. On the first occasion, Trump said, The Obama administration made a decision on testing that turned out to be very detrimental to what we're doing.

We are doing numbers that no one would have thought possible just 3 years ago.

In the House, the margin for error is also small. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi would only be able to lose a handful of votes both on the budget resolution and the final bill. While the expectation is the budget resolution passes easily, factions of her caucus are already laying down markers of what they think the package should ultimately look like. Minnesota Rep. Ilhan Omar led a group of 50 House progressives in sending a letter to Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris on Thursday asking them to prioritize recurring direct checks in the next Covid-19 relief package. Members of the bipartisan Problem Solver's Caucus, a moderate group, has been talking with White House officials about their own concerns on making the final relief bill more targeted.
They said that the Republican National Committee was cooking the books, they were not fair to him, and conversely, he has also been criticized by non-Trump loving Republicans for being too nice to Donald Trump, for being too accepting.

TRUMP: We're going to do something that's right. We are talking to the tall ban, we're talking to a lot of different people but here's the thing because you mentioned India. Andria as there. Russia is there. Russia used to be the Soviet Union. Afghanistan made it Russia because they went bankrupt fighting in Afghanistan. Russia. So, you take a look at other countries. Pakistan is there. They should be fighting. But Russia should be fighting. The reason Russia was in Afghanistan was because terrorists were going into Russia. They were right to be there. The problem is it was a tough fight. And literally they went bankrupt. They went into being called Russia again as opposed to the Soviet Union. A lot of these places you're reading about now are no longer a part of Russia because of Afghanistan. But why isn't Russia there? Why isn't India there in we there and we're 6,000 miles away? But I don't mind. We want to help our people, help other nations. You do have terrorists, mostly Taliban but is. I'll give you an example. So tall ISIS is an enemy. We have an area where Taliban is here, ISIS is here and they're fighting each other. I said why don't you let them fight? Why are we getting in the middle of it? I said let them fight. They're both our enemies, let them fight. Sir, we want to do it. They go in and end up fighting both of them.

Third, racial healing requires more than anti-racist hashtags from corporations, sports teams, philanthropists and public officials.

To conservatives who've been fighting for health care reform, this is so exciting. And so what's happening now is members realize this the chance. This is the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.
SCARAMUCCI: OK, so let's step back for a second. The reason the president is saying that is it if you lock at the macro-features of what's going on, the Republican Party for seven-and-a-half years has called for the repeal and replacement of Obamacare. Moreover, what we know from free market principles is that when you make something a little bit freer and you decentralize it, you get two positive benefits to the consumer and the patient. You get lower cost of delivery and you get better service. That happened in the airline industry, Chris. It happened in telecommunications when it was deregulated and made freer.
KASICH: Now I will tell you, I don't believe that we need to make China an enemy. They are a competitor. But I want to go back to three things they should do. We should have the heat on them to work in North Korea to get rid of that guy and the things that he's doing, number one.

And, sadly, no candidate even bothered to identify US interests in the Middle East -- the first step toward crafting policies to protect and advance them.

I think Democrats, especially in Iowa, will love it. Iowans, God love 'em, hate negative campaigning. That's why negative ads in the 2020 Democratic Caucus campaign are about as common as synchronized swimmers in a Sioux County cornfield.

As of February 11, 2020, companies had promised to create 14.6 million opportunities -- but many of these opportunities are internal training programs, not new jobs. Also, as CNN has previously reported , many of the companies had already planned these opportunities before Ivanka Trump launched the initiative.
A lot of our members through our feedback -- we had seven member listening sessions in February, four conferences, getting feedback from our members on this draft of this legislation, getting their ideas. And one of the concerns was, we should cap this credit. So, like a millionaire, that doesn't get health care from their work, but is a millionaire, doesn't get a tax credit.
Candidates, you have one minute and 15 seconds to answer each question, and 45 seconds to respond to followups or for rebuttals if your name is invoked. That's longer than you've had in previous debates.
There was one call, which was perfect, and then there was a second call -- I guess, a couple of months later -- which was perfect. The President of Ukraine said it was perfect. The Foreign Minister of Ukraine said it was perfect. So if we have a transcription, we have the call, and we have the person on the other side of the call saying it was good. -- January 22 press conference in Davos, Switzerland
Additionally, there were more unhealthy air days for sensitive groups in 2018 than in 2016 -- 799 days across the 35 American cities surveyed by the EPA, up from 702. Though there were significantly more unhealthy air days in Obama's first term than there have been in Trump's, the lowest amount of unhealthy air days -- 598 -- occurred in 2014 under Obama.
President Donald Trump is all about the bark – bold, aggressive promises.

BROWN: No, I don't think you think -- as a potential president, I don't think any candidate or sitting president should think, well, these are the big problems, I'm going to go after them with a national emergency -- as a national emergency.
Of all the President's policy legacies, his judiciary appointments promise to be the most enduring: He successfully appointed hundreds of federal judges and three Supreme Court justices, ensuring a strong conservative influence for decades.
If they save money by saying to a hospital or a doctor or a health care provider, What is this going to cost me? Where's the best value for my money? If we can bring that consumer pressure to bear in health care, we can dramatically enlist the support of millions of Americans to help us fix this health care problem.
[08:00:00] ALISYN CAMEROTA, CNN ANCHOR: CNN's Rafael Romo is going to join us live now from Fajardo on Puerto Rico's east coast. Rafael, what are you seeing?
CNN TONIGHT'' with Don Lemon, starts now.
Recently, three powerful former members of the Office of Solicitor General, a small cadre of top-notch appellate lawyers who argue the government's position before the Supreme Court, have made clear that there are times when the head or acting head of the Office should not shy away from a change of position.
And it's not me. It's usually the municipal government, the police because I don't have guards all over these stadiums. I mean, we fill up stadiums. It's usually the police - and, by the way, speaking of the police, we should pay our respects to the police because they are taking tremendous abuse in this country and they do a phenomenal job.
WASHINGTON, DC - MAY 08: U.S. President Donald Trump announces his decision to withdraw the United States from the 2015 Iran nuclear deal in the Diplomatic Room at the White House May 8, 2018 in Washington, DC. After two and a half years of negotiations, Iran agreed in 2015 to end its nuclear program in exchange for Western countries, including the United States, lifting decades of economic sanctions. Since then international inspectors have not found any violations of the terms by Iran. (Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)
The move to intervene, however, is largely symbolic. The case is now working its way through the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals.
I mean, this is stuff that's crazy.
COOPER: Well, the man behind that video that set of protests in Egypt and elsewhere was in federal court today. We'll tell you why when 360 continues. (COMMERCIAL BREAK)
CUOMO: Well, nuance to people on questions of spirituality is not always a great way to go, certainly the primary. But I think it's worth -- do we have time to play the Kasich argument against Obama or should I just summarize it? All right. Let's listen to it, because it was a really intelligent one. Go ahead.
But that often happens behind the scenes and at a court where no cameras are allowed. Now Roberts will be in the national spotlight as never before, presiding over the Senate trial of President Donald Trump before an audience of millions.
I am running because I see that sense of community is getting fractured, Klobuchar said on Sunday in Iowa. It's getting fractured by someone in the White House who gets up every morning and tweets whatever he wants but doesn't respect the amendment that allows him to do it.
LEMON: Yeah. As I said, you and Gilda were original cast members on Saturday Night Live, SNL as it's been come to known now. Whenever I see old clips, you guys seem to be having so much fun. What was it like back then working with Gilda?
China dumps everything that they have over here. No tax, no nothing, no problems, no curfews (ph), no anything. We can't get into China. I have the best people, manufacturers, they can't get in. When they get in, they have to pay a tremendous tax.
There's a name being floated. The source confirming that CNN the Republican Nevada Governor Ryan Sandoval is being vetted by the White House. Now the news, comes even as Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is saying there will be no hearing for anyone President Obama choses.

Additionally, a spate of negative headlines about Klobuchar's demanding management style have trickled out around her 2020 announcement.
In front of factory workers at the Ohio plant on Wednesday, Trump dedicated a considerable amount of time in his speech to disparaging McCain.
The most egregious false claim: Pre-existing conditions
Now I talked to his top adviser yesterday who said that he would be going against Trump, and Marco Rubio fulfilled that promise, I would say, last night.
Quote: We owe this process to keep an open mind and we owe this process to fully listen to our colleagues across the aisle — unless they get too bushy-tailed, We owe this process to keep an open mind and we owe this process to fully listen to our colleagues across the aisle — unless they get too bushy-tailed, he said at the end of the second day of trial . We owe the process to hear everything out and then go from there.

Do you think Republicans in Congress can convince President Trump to sign off on about $2 billion for border barriers, or are you more skeptical? Do you think we're headed for another shutdown?
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The Graham-Cassidy bill is the right solution at the right time.
Asked by interviewer Geraldo Rivera what he was referring to in a tweet accusing former special counsel and former FBI director Robert Mueller of having lied to Congress, Trump said, Well, he said in Congress that he never applied for the job of the FBI director and now it's been proven that he did. -- February 13 radio interview with Geraldo Rivera
CUBA: Thank you Senator Cruz. Mr. Trump.
Here's what I also know: There are certain things that are right and certain things that are wrong – whether you are a Democrat, a Republican or somewhere in between. And attacking a dead man who spent five years as a prisoner of war and another three decades serving the country in elected office, is simply wrong. That's true if Barack Obama, George W. Bush, Millard Fillmore, Franklin Pierce or whoever the next president will be did it. (None of them would have said what Trump did about a man with as decorated a past as McCain but the point still holds.
There's no doubt the law has succeeded in terms of the first of those three pillars: access. Obamacare provides financial assistance for people who otherwise would be unable to afford health insurance; it mandates that people with pre-existing conditions cannot be denied insurance; and it allows parents to keep their children on their policies until they reach the age of 26. The president noted that the uninsured rate has declined by 43% since the law was passed, and the Department of Health and Human Services has reported that an estimated 20 million people have gained health insurance since the ACA went into effect.
They reimburse taxpayers for the money that we, as taxpayers, spend subsidizing their employees. That will make a fairer tax system. And we won't -- we won't see these companies coming into communities and just ask -- demanding huge tax breaks in order to locate there.
Klobuchar is markedly more centrist than many of the other Democrats running for President, including some of her colleagues in the Senate. Klobuchar has a liberal voting record, but she does not support abolishing the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency or Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders' Medicare-for-all bill – instead pushing to lower the age when people are allowed to buy into the government health care program.
But we must reject the politics of revenge, resistance, and retribution – and embrace the boundless potential of cooperation, compromise, and the common good.
Why are many Republicans vaccine skeptics? Keilar rolls the tape
Everything that has come since – our triumph over communism, our giant leaps of science and discovery, our unrivaled progress toward equality and justice – all of it is possible thanks to the blood and tears and courage and vision of the Americans who came before.
DAVID SANGER, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST: Well I think the biggest development here, Chris, is actually the threat of an atmospheric test, which American officials have been concerned about privately for some time. And it was very interesting that the foreign minister of North Korea gave voice to that just around the time that Kim Jong-un did that somewhat remarkable direct attack on President Trump.
BASH: Thank you, Mr. Trump. Senator Cruz, you advocate allowing younger workers to put some of their Social Security taxes into personal accounts. What do you say to critics who say that market volatility means that this is a disastrous proposal?
But among them was Rafael Garcia, who made up his mind to vote for Biden that day. This man has done so much for this country, Garcia said.
As for farm products, the Office of the US Trade Representative says on its website: U.S. domestic exports of agricultural products to the EU totaled $13.5 billion in 2018. The EU countries together would rank 3rd as an Ag Export Market for the United States. The same website says the US exported $27.7 billion worth of optical and medical instruments to the EU in 2018.
He also blamed McCain for wars in the Middle East.
This is not the place for a MAGA rally, Van Hollen told CNN. This is a place where you at least attempt to bring the country together to unify us behind common purposes. Instead, we have a President who's a megalomaniac.
Additionally, a spate of negative headlines about Klobuchar's demanding management style have trickled out around her 2020 announcement.
CUOMO: But then, why do you have governors of your own party coming up and saying that's not true? That even though you're going to give me the money and I like the control, you're going to cut the amount of money that I have, and in fact, those block grants are going to go away altogether at some point in the future, so there's going to be less money in the system which you like because you want to take money out and use it for tax reform, or whatever you want to do it. But if you take money out, you can't cover as many people.
So just how close were Bloomberg and Obama?
TAPPER: Tom Schatz is president of citizens against government waste.
It's still the clash, the warm and cold. It's snowing in the black hills. It's snowing feet of snow in the black hills, Wyoming 24, 46 inches of snow and wind blowing at 40 miles per hour with this storm. So yes, it's a big weather setup. There is warm weather here, severe weather here and tornadoes on the front. South Dakota parts of Nebraska. It even snowed in Boulder, Colorado that had the flooding a couple weeks ago.
Many of Trump's meetings have focused on his political future -- including his strategy going into the 2022 midterms and planning around if he runs for president again, the source said. While Trump continues to flirt with a 2024 bid, his focus now is on payback against those he believes crossed him. His advisers are in the process of identifying pro-Trump candidates to challenge Republican state officials in Georgia, Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney, who voted to impeach the former President, and others.
The death toll is rising in Puerto Rico. At least nine people are dead after Hurricane Maria. First responders caution that number is preliminary. They are shocked there isn't massive loss of life.
CAMEROTA: Yes, of course, Governor. It's just hard to really wrap our heads around what's happening in Puerto Rico this morning. We're looking at the video. I mean, whole neighborhoods and towns are underwater. Can you give us a sense for what the conditions are for the 3.5 million people there?
On Tuesday, Trump falsely accused McCain of misleading the White House over how he would vote.
Dramatic video. The chase and the gunfire, steps of the Hill, with the woman behind the wheel of the car and a child in the back. Police opened fire on that vehicle. Latest on the driver who was killed by police coming next.
Meadows qualified that there weren't any conversations right now about a new speaker but added there are certainly conversations that would involve new leadership. He stressed that the difference was that he was awaiting Ryan's next move on immigration, saying, we need leadership to actually lead.
Stone's legal team challenged the juror on a tweet she issued, featuring hearts, fists and a link to a Facebook post that is no longer available, in the hours before the jury announced its guilty verdict on November 15, 2019. The foreperson said under questioning, I don't know what this was in reference to and that she was absolutely not celebrating the coming verdict. Regardless of what she meant, though, a tweet is not the same as a juror jumping up and down screaming in court as Trump suggested.
Facts First: Democrats were not going away on vacation, and Pelosi was not suggesting they were. Asked on Monday, March 9 if her goal was to have the House pass a coronavirus relief bill this week, Pelosi : Democrats were not going away on vacation, and Pelosi was not suggesting they were. Asked on Monday, March 9 if her goal was to have the House pass a coronavirus relief bill this week, Pelosi said , I don't know that we can be ready this week, but we can introduce this week, we can introduce it and we may be ready this week, depending on CBO (Congressional Budget Office), depending on (the House Office of the Legislative Counsel) and how quickly they can get something back to us.
He is responsible for paying the hospital at least $1,400 of the bill and it may be more pending meeting his insurance company's strict requirements. Worries that they will confront bills like his will deter many from seeking appropriate care and put more people at risk.
Trump has moved from denying the severity of the pandemic and agitating to open the economy to a recognition of how bad things could get.
Governor Greg Abbott today held a press conference in Houston on the importance of election integrity legislation this session. The Governor named election integrity as an emergency legislative item during his State of the State address in February. Governor Abbott was joined for the press conference by Senator Paul Bettencourt and Representative Briscoe Cain, who have both filed several pieces of legislation to enhance election integrity in Texas
Let's talk about him. You know what he did? He called you on the phone. And he said, Mario, I got a problem with you. Or whoever it was I have a problem with you. Here it is.
We must move to universal health care. And I am so proud of the work we did as a party to protect the Affordable Car Act, Klobuchar said Sunday. We are to the point now where Obamacare is more popular than the President.
COOPER: And Jeff, where do you stand on the sort of the precedence of this? Because I mean -- again, the president today said, Look, this is not something that written in the constitution that a sitting president in the last year, can't nominate, in fact that he is saying this is part of his duty.
Bloomberg's presidential campaign spokesman Stu Loeser told the Post that Mike simply did not say the things somebody wrote in this gag gift, which has been circulating for 30 years and has been quoted in every previous election Mike has been in.
This raises fresh concerns about the possibility of steep rate hikes for 2017 and of insurers leaving the Obamacare exchanges.
Cigna said the court order was procedural, but it added that it will continue to respect the terms of the merger deal until the court further reviews the case. The next hearing is scheduled for the week of April 10.
The bottom line is that Warren's talking point was accurate. But the men on the stage actually won more elections than they've lost over the years, undercutting Warren's electability argument. And some of their losses at the polls were decades ago, so it's not clear how relevant they are to the 2020 race.
Allowing kids under age 26 to remain on their parents policies. The Republicans want to keep this Obamacare provision, which has helped insure young adults. By one estimate, seven million people get coverage as a result.
At his 2017 inaugural address, Trump invoked a dark nightmare of American carnage. Now he's selling The Great American Comeback.
CUOMO: That's optics. That's optics. Leadership would suggest that maybe you go to them and say go work a deal with the Democrats. Go take it to committee.
I am running because I see that sense of community is getting fractured, Klobuchar said on Sunday in Iowa. It's getting fractured by someone in the White House who gets up every morning and tweets whatever he wants but doesn't respect the amendment that allows him to do it.
I know I can be too tough sometimes and I can push too hard, she told MSNBC earlier this month. That is obvious. But a lot of it is I have high expectations for myself and I have high expectations for people who work with me.
Facts First: Brown did not drop out of the presidential race: he : Brown did not drop out of the presidential race: he never entered the race at all. While Brown did embark in January 2019 on a so-called listening tour of states that vote early in the Democratic primary, a sign he was thinking about a run, he announced in March 2019 that he would not go ahead with a candidacy.
On Monday, McCain said she genuinely feel(s) bad for (the Trump) family and that she can't imagine having a father who does this on the weekends.
We must move to universal health care. And I am so proud of the work we did as a party to protect the Affordable Car Act, Klobuchar said Sunday. We are to the point now where Obamacare is more popular than the President.
Trump fired FBI Director James Comey and publicly railed against his successor, Chris Wray . He fired Attorney General Jeff Sessions and late last year, his successor, Trump loyalist Bill Barr, resigned less than two months before the end of the presidential term after publicly splitting with the President on several high-profile issues.
The president has a very unique communications style. I would argue people will say I'm being sycophantic, I'm not. I'm just being objective.
Facts First: Stone officially worked for the Trump campaign until August 2015, about a month and a half after Trump announced his candidacy, when the campaign announced he had been fired. (Stone : Stone officially worked for the Trump campaign until August 2015, about a month and a half after Trump announced his candidacy, when the campaign announced he had been fired. (Stone said he resigned . Regardless, he could not have been ousted if he had never been on the campaign in the first place.) Stone remained an informal adviser after that -- and communicated with top Trump campaign officials in 2016 about the activities of WikiLeaks, according to witness testimony and phone records presented at Stone's trial. Stone also communicated in 2016 with Trump himself.
A Fight for $15 victory in Birmingham could show that workers can win a victory anywhere, even in Alabama, says Richard Rouco, another of the plaintiffs' attorneys.
CRUZ: Common Core is a disaster. And if I am elected president, in the first days as president, I will direct the Department of Education that Common Core ends that day.
There was an increase of nine points in Trump's Gallup approval rating between September 30 and January 29; Trump went from 40% to 49%. Trump's increase is much smaller, however, if you look at an average of polls. According to FiveThirtyEight's average , Trump went from 42.1% on September 30 to 43.2% on January 28 (and 43.3% on February 21).
There's no direct comparison to where the party is right now, but the closest parallel you can draw is back in 2013 when then-freshman-Sen. Cruz led his party to shut down the government. The base was with Cruz. The leadership was not. And the saga that unfolded left the party splintered for years -- it was a moment that left Republican rank-and-file members who hadn't stood with Cruz forced to explain to their voters how shutting down the government wasn't going to end Obamacare. It wasn't possible, but it didn't mean that some members didn't face the ire of the electorate.
Some Republican plans to scrap and replace the Affordable Care Act don't include a Medicaid expansion. Republicans have argued for years that the Medicaid program is broken and non-disabled adults who gained coverage under the expansion should not be covered.

A new legislative director takes over
LEMON: I heard you were going to flip to a Democrat and run for President. Is that true?
CARPER: Mm-hmm. Well, believe it or not, we have other issues that we are working on, tax reform is just one of many of them, budgets and stuff like that. So we don't spend every minute of every day looking at what's going on in the election in Alabama.
TAPPER: Is that a fair analogy?
Cigna said in a statement posted early Thursday that it intends to carefully review the opinion and evaluate its options.
We're going to have insurance for everybody, he said in an interview with The Washington Post. There was a philosophy in some circles that if you can't pay for it, you don't get it. That's not going to happen with us.
Spokesmen for Sens. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana and Rick Scott of Florida, two of the Republican senators Trump listed as being part of the group, said the senators have continued to have conversations with the President and their colleagues about healthcare issues, but made no mention of a working group.
All the while, a growing number Republican members of Congress have been publicly pushing back on Trump's comments, defending McCain.
RACHEL FENION, UNDECIDED REPUBLICAN VOTER: I really don't think he can, no. I think he's too divisive.
Office workers are seen in the Bloomberg campaign headquarters near Times Square on January 30, 2020
My guess is that that would be an incredibly provocative act that could well change the administration's own calculus about its need for preemptive action.
But Trump's decision to swerve away from NAFTA withdrawal also signaled the extent to which Trump is running up against the realities of governing as he attempts to implement his bold campaign promises.
MARQUARDT: And the Mueller's team response was someone who spent this much time heading up an intelligence agency in the military at this highest level of U.S. government should know that.
Klobuchar has admitted that she can be too tough on her staff in response to the stories.
And I think this is not a third world country, this is United States of America and we need to stand up and say, We need to take care of everyone regardless of their age. And make sure that we are taking care of each other.
Good morning and welcome to EARLY START. I'm Dave Briggs.
Wood: The state's Republican lawmakers have been critical of the Affordable Care Act since Day 1 and made it clear early on they weren't going to bite on the federal incentives to fully expand Medicaid. After the SCOTUS ruling making expansion optional, the legislature passed a law prohibiting the governor from adopting expansion without their approval, and subsequently rejected the governor's own expansion plan, colloquially known as Healthy Utah.
This new era of cooperation can start with finally confirming the more than 300 highly qualified nominees who are still stuck in the Senate – some after years of waiting. The Senate has failed to act on these nominations, which is unfair to the nominees and to our country.

I want to build on the momentum that we saw here in 2018, Klobuchar told reporters Saturday in Wisconsin. No one ever thought that the Democrats were going to be able (to defeat) Gov. Walker, but we did it, and we did it in a smart, Wisconsin way with a grassroots campaign with (Democratic Sen.) Tammy Baldwin at the top of the ticket, and we can do it in the presidential, as well.
Isn't it a beautiful day in the neighborhood, waiting for these two guys to kill each other off and be the last man standing. At some point, there is going to be one last man standing against Donald Trump.
Here's what Starr actually said : The evidence, whether it's circumstantial or direct -- and I think it's virtually entirely circumstantial -- has to be overwhelming; not just beyond a reasonable doubt, overwhelming to the American people who aren't sitting in a courtroom and listening to every witness testify and drawing inferences and so forth. When you read the abuse of power article in the Nixon impeachment, a fair-minded person looks at that, reads it, hears it and says he had got to go. That's just not the case here.
The President's comments about the senators amounted to the latest attempt by the White House to reassure the public that it will have a replacement plan ready by the time the courts render a final judgment.
Klobuchar spent the lead-up to the town hall with a trip through Wisconsin and Iowa, building on her campaign theme of retaking Midwest communities that have drifted away from Democrats in recent years. Klobuchar, a three-term senator from Minnesota, is pitching herself as a pragmatic lawmaker who is willing to work with those who oppose her to get things done.
The case, argued on November 10, is now pending before the justices.

SANGER: Well, it is colorful. I saw last night that dotard was among the most searched terms last night. I confess I had to go back and refresh my memory, as well.
Congress wasn't able to do it properly, and a six-month arbitrary timeline Trump set came and went. The courts have temporarily iced his plans to end it. Washington has been trying for more than a decade, with presidents from both parties and majorities from both parties, to pass comprehensive immigration reform, but neither the pressure of Trump's DACA threat nor his family separation zero-tolerance gambit have yet changed the calculus. Moderate Republicans in the House seemed close to a revolt against the status quo over DACA, but it appears to have fizzled for now.
BRIGGS: Senator Graham went on to say he can no longer do business with Saudi Arabia if the, quote, crazy crown prince is still running the country.
The increased interest in Obamacare policies is not necessarily all good news. Usually, the sickest consumers are the ones who rush to secure coverage. Insurers are concerned that younger and healthier people will forgo enrollment for 2018 amid all the uncertainty and negativity coming out of Washington D.C. That could prompt carriers to raise premiums in the future.
The President's comments about the senators amounted to the latest attempt by the White House to reassure the public that it will have a replacement plan ready by the time the courts render a final judgment.
As a result of his action, the Department of Health and Human Services is set to reopen enrollment on the federal Affordable Care Act exchange between February 15 and May 15.
So there is a great number of criticism of the administration for essentially having to count on a news report to break thins story and bring it to light.
Opportunity was everywhere. My dad studied engineering at Case Western Reserve University just down the road from where we are now. Because in 1968, the world's high tech capital wasn't just one city.
– Despite repeated roadblocks, Republicans aren't finished trying to dismantle Obamacare. GOP leadership plans to repeal the individual mandate, a key piece of the former president's crown achievement as part of their tax reform bill. Here's what repealing the mandate means.
This is the most significant legislation for working people that has been passed in decades, Senate Budget Committee Chairman Bernie Sanders of Vermont told CNN's Anderson Cooper on Monday, arguing that although the measure was about alleviating the economic and educational consequences of the pandemic it also went deeper.
Cindy McCain touted her husband's work since that health care vote, citing his defense bill and a human trafficking proposal he sponsored that passed Tuesday.
Cillizza: Voters approved expansion with 53% of the vote. And yet, lawmakers took up – and passed – a measure that restricts that expansion. What was the stated reason for this?
Repeal the Obamacare subsidies. The GOP's plan would eliminate the Obamacare subsidies, which are advanceable refundable tax credits based on a person's income and cost of coverage in their area. More than eight in 10 enrollees on the Obamacare exchanges receive this assistance, but individuals making more than $47,500 and families of four earning more than $97,200 do not qualify. This provision would take effect in 2020.
Social distancing is the new catchphrase for how we are advised to behave. By all accounts, staying away from other people is the best tool everyday people have to flatten the rising curve of contagion and lessen the potential impact on hospitals and caregivers.
'Those at the top are not doing their part:' WH looks to raise taxes on wealthy
There's a lot that has to happen before Biden's plan -- which is chock-full of measures long favored by Democrats -- becomes law. And even though Democrats will soon control the White House and both chambers of Congress, that doesn't mean lawmakers will follow Biden's suggestions to the letter.
SANTORUM: It is hostile to the private sector. It plays class warfare no matter how beneficial those things are. And it's not going to be beneficial --
MADDEN: No, I think your right.
BASH: they're absolutely could be, I mean there are always, there's always second guessing in situations like this, but I believe given the route that she took from to very important places of power with very -- with a lot of security and law enforcement protecting people and particularly after what happened in 9/11 and the scare even most recently at the Navy Yard, I think everybody was, I know everybody was on high alert. Of course, they're going to do an investigation to see what exactly happened, but so far there doesn't seem to be any second guessing.
That means by 2034, the combined trust funds for Social Security — which help fund the old age and disability programs — will run dry. At that point Social Security will be able to pay only 79% in promised benefits to retirees and disabled beneficiaries.
Let me show you what flying debris has done to the lobby. They broke the glass above me, and right now the lobby is taking great amounts of water. And the reason why I am here, Alisyn, is because our team, ourselves, had to be evacuated because conditions were so dangerous and precarious at one point.
Both Republicans and Democrats claimed the other side was basically destroying the country. Not really all that different from any other week, except this week focused primarily on Obamacare.
MORGAN: And they shuts down tomorrow.
The US vaccination effort has ramped up in meaningful ways in recent weeks. Nationwide, we've maintained a seven-day average of about 1.6 million doses per day.
There are about 400,000 confirmed coronavirus cases and more than 12,800 dead -- and those numbers may be significant underestimates. Without effective oversight -- and there is no reason to believe that Glenn Fine would not have provided it -- it will be impossible to tell if the stimulus package is being used efficiently to help as many people as possible. Without immediate, unflinching feedback on how Health and Human Services is managing this crisis, it will be harder to know the ways to improve the stimulus in real time and stem the tide of disease, death and financial ruin.
That same year of the Supreme Court's Bush v. Gore case, Roberts and his wife adopted two infant children, separated in age by about five months. Adoption had been a long-held hope of the couple who had married in 1996, both 41 years old at the time, and Jane has spoken openly about the adoptions in the years since.

He's taken people -- he's basically fired people that help people get on insurance that could get -- that could get subsidized insurance and be in the exchanges, that could get to Medicaid. Government needs an all-in in helping people get on Medicaid.
The tough new zero tolerance immigration policy enacted by President Donald Trump has led to a general outcry about how the US treats undocumented children, separating them from their parents at the border.
Rep. Jayapal on Sen. Johnson: Stunning that a senator would say these things
BASH (voice-over): There's something a little different in the hallways of Congress and on the campaign trail. Women leaders are starting to feel less like the exception and more like the rule.
Trump made 67 false claims from February 17 through February 23; that was the 11th-highest total of the 34 weeks we've fact checked at CNN. He added 48 false claims from February 24 through March 1; that week ranked 25th out of 34. As usual, many of the false claims were ones he has uttered before.
He was prepared to fly back to DC to vote for the package but after conferring with House leadership they told him they had reached a bipartisan deal and his vote wasn't necessary, Lipinski's office spokesman Phil Davidson told CNN in an email Monday. He definitely would have been a yes vote.
Before I came into office, if you showed up illegally on our southern border and were arrested, you were simply released and allowed into our country, never to be seen again. My Administration has ended Catch-and-Release. If you come illegally, you will now be promptly removed. We entered into historic cooperation agreements with the Governments of Mexico, Honduras, El Salvador, and Guatemala. As a result of our unprecedented efforts, illegal crossings are down 75 percent since May – dropping 8 straight months in a row. And as the wall goes up, drug seizures rise, and border crossings go down.
At Bush's final NATO summit, in 2008, Bush called on NATO allies to increase their defense investments to support both NATO and EU operations.
That'd be big news: Congressional Republicans haven't yet figured out what they'll replace Obamacare with – and Paul is on a lonely crusade to slow down what's expected to be a vote early in the year to repeal it.
Here tonight is Debra Bissell. Just three weeks ago, Debra's parents, Gerald and Sharon, were burglarized and shot to death in their Reno, Nevada, home by an illegal alien. They were in their eighties and are survived by four children, 11 grandchildren, and 20 great-grandchildren. Also here tonight are Gerald and Sharon's granddaughter, Heather, and great‑granddaughter, Madison.
PSAKI: Look, I have to say this is becoming pattern. So when something becomes a pattern, you have to wonder what is behind it and why Mitt Romney is so uncomfortable with his own positions.
Average prices in the individual market would be:
I don't think I'm exaggerating when I say it is the most important moment of the presidential campaign, so far he has an opportunity to rise above the candidate and the campaign that has been so decisive -- successful that also very off putting to know youths of Americans. He has an opportunity here to present a new quote unquote Presidential Donald Trump.
[04:30:35] CHRISTINE ROMANS, CNN ANCHOR: Don't lock him up. Robert Mueller recommends no prison time for Michael Flynn because of substantial help with the special counsel.
Repeal cost-sharing subsidies to lower deductibles and co-pays. The bill would kill the additional help that individuals earning less than roughly $30,000 a year receive to cover their out-of-pocket costs. More than half of the enrollees on the Obamacare exchanges receive these subsidies. This provision would take effect in 2020.
Estimates are just that: estimates. But aides have been allotting roughly four hours per objection.

Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg took the lead in a dissent, writing an opinion that first gave rise to the Notorious RBG meme on social media.
Trump does not set an attendance record each time he holds a rally in an NBA arena. The last actual NBA arena he spoke in was the American Airlines Center in Dallas. Jason Evans, a spokesman for the Dallas Fire-Rescue Department, told CNN that the fire department and the arena calculated an attendance of 18,500. The Dallas Mavericks, who play in the arena, had an average announced attendance of 20,013 per game last season, among the highest in the NBA, according to ESPN data

BARONE: They were at war and I think the other cause of this is that in effect that's related to my book Shaping The Nation which is about migrations internal and immigrant back from the Scotch, Irish to the present day. The demographics of the country, why did we elect a Democratic president, a Republican House of Representatives?
But Johnson said there is a real level of disgust with some conservatives across the country because the GOP-led Senate hasn't carried out its promises.
I endorsed him at his request, and I gave him the kind of funeral that he wanted, which as President I had to approve. I don't care about this. I didn't get thank you. That's OK. We sent him on the way. But I wasn't a fan of John McCain, Trump said during a speech Wednesday at a tank factory in Lima, Ohio.
As usual, Bannon covers a lot of (shaky) ground in quick bursts of chatter, but his fundamental argument – that Americans were ready to sign on for a half-century of right-wing populism in the halls of federal power – so obviously misunderstands Trump and his way of thinking.
Her criticisms came after she cast doubt on Sanders' strategy -- or lack thereof -- for delivering on his Medicare for All plan and did not let him off the hook over his medical records, saying he had made a promise to release all his medical records and I thought that was what he was going to do.

One conservative group is saying by golly, you better put shopping across state lines in this bill or else we're not going to support it. Guess what, Chad? If we did that, we wouldn't be able to pass this bill. It would be filibustered in the Senate. It wouldn't even come up for a vote.
The federal government's website for the Energy Star energy efficiency program notes that Energy Star-certified dishwashers cut people's electricity bills and save water: A new ENERGY STAR certified dishwasher will save, on average, 3,870 gallons of water over its lifetime. Consumer Reports wrote in October: Today's dishwashers use about half the water and energy that dishwashers used 20 years ago. Thanks to tougher federal efficiency standards, water usage is down to about 4 to 6 gallons per load -- and less water means less energy required to heat the water.
Speaking at her father's funeral last year, McCain, who didn't mention Trump by name, made several unmistakable and pointed references to him throughout her emotional remarks.
And the accomplishments that his campaign offered up, supporting a bill that became law where he didn't vote for it, taking credit for the elimination of a risk corridor inside of Obamacare that he didn't sponsor. And the passage of one law with Jeanne Shaheen as a sponsor that I think I'm sure is a good bill, that's it. That's all that you can point to.
The Biden administration and Majority Leader Chuck Schumer have their work cut out for them when it comes to advancing their agenda and that's not because they are bad at whipping votes or laying out a policy vision. It's because the numbers aren't flexible here.

That said, overall, virtually all of the candidates (including Buttigieg) acquitted themselves well during the debate. If no one had a breakout moment, no one had an embarrassing moment either.
House leaders pulled the GOP health care bill from consideration Friday after it became clear Republicans did not have enough votes to pass the legislation, in part because of near-unified opposition from the Freedom Caucus.
So, Donald called me up evening because I can't stand it, I'm going to go over early, why don't you come over early with me? I said fine. We get to the funeral hall and we're sitting as kind of, you know, two middle-aged guys that go through that debate when your father leaves of what's the difference between relevancy and mortality, right?
He said he probably never will like McCain, because John McCain received a fake and phony dossier.
And, you know, I think there's been a lot of mistruth out there about this. You have seen the Democrats try to suggest that we want to build a 2,000-mile-long wall. That's absolutely not the case.

John McCain was tortured for more than five years in Vietnam and survived for more than a year after being diagnosed with brain cancer in 2017.
I don't blame China, Trump said during remarks to business leaders inside the Great Hall of the People in Beijing. After all, who can blame a country for being able to take advantage of another country for benefit of their citizens? I give China great credit.
Why? Historians will likely be debating this question for years. After all the Iran deal is quite popular with Americans, a healthy majority of whom – 63% – want to stay in the deal, while only 29% want to leave it, according to a new CNN poll.
Facts First: Venezuela was not the wealthiest country in Latin America 20 years ago, as Trump has claimed previously, and certainly not one of the wealthiest countries in the world, as Trump has also claimed previously. (Trump didn't say this time which one he meant.)
The problem is that the debate can't remake the basic character of this candidacy or the problems that he has created. The Access Hollywood tapes were the tip of a very big iceberg. He apologized for the comments, yet without much gusto. On top of that, there are very likely more Trump controversies on the way.
He also dug into McCain's now-famous vote against a repeal of the Affordable Care Act.
BASH: But you think you can -- you think you can do your plan without raising the marginal tax rate for the super rich? I guess that's my question. Can you do it with -- just with the corporate changes?
That plan, Meadows argued, didn't do enough to give assurance to the military. Meadows said Tuesday night that the House Freedom Caucus either wanted to see a one-year defense funding bill attached to the short-term continuing resolution – a nonstarter when the caucus pushed for it in December – or wanted to see Republican leaders include more funding of defense anomalies.
MARQUARDT: Are you confident in the appeals process that this won't go any farther?

(The fact check website PolitiFact reported in July 2015: We asked the Bloomberg Government study's author, Peter Gosselin, whether he thought the number could have more than doubled to $5 billion since the study was released 10 months ago.

Could you imagine living in like Miami here and having people shooting missiles in?

Kelsey -- Sarah was just hitting on the point that I wanted to start with you, the fact that the first choice for chief of staff, Nick Ayers, who is Vice President's Pence's chief of staff. [11:20:05] The reason those talks broke down is because he wanted the acting title and Trump didn't. So why do you think he's accepted it with Mulvaney? Is it just to sort of quash any perception that no one wants the job?
We, as Republicans, have been waiting seven years to do this. We, as Republicans, who fought the creation of this law and accurately predicted that it would not work, ran for office in 2010, in 2012, in 2014 and in 2016 on a promise that we would -- if given the ability, we would repeal and replace this law.
El viernes, el mismo día en que prestó juramento, firmó un decreto para que las agencias federales comiencen a aliviar la carga del Obamacare.
Y he aquí el ingenio de su estrategia antimediática: aún si fracasa, no es su culpa. Trump y su base creen que la conspiración contra ellos es enorme y casi imbatible. Al atacar a los medios con tanta fuerza como lo ha hecho Trump, ha impulsado a sus partidarios para la derrota. Es por eso que muchos perdonarán los errores que ha cometido en el último mes. Los considerarán inevitables. Donald, dirán, está haciendo todo lo posible.
Facts First: Study after study has shown that Americans are bearing the vast majority of the cost of the tariffs. And it is Americans who make the actual tariff payments.

CRUZ: We need to do whatever is necessary to utterly defeat ISIS. And that's needs to be driven not by politicians but by military expertise and judgment. Right now we're not using a fraction of the tools that we have. We're not using our overwhelming air power. We're not arming the Kurds. Those need to be the first steps. And then we need to put whatever ground power is needed to carry it out.

Many expect the new health care bill to weaken protections for people with pre-existing conditions, which could leave many with high premiums and huge medical bills.
And when it comes to radical political obstructionism, nobody has done it better than Senator Cruz. Earlier this year The Washington Post gave him the title of Obstructor in Chief. He has been one of the champions of congressional practices that bring Washington to a halt. He has steadfastly refused to enter into any kind of agreement with the administration, lobbying members of the House as well as the Senate, and he has employed practices like the filibuster to new levels.
Trump told a story about how he shook the hand of every graduate in the Air Force Academy class to which he gave a commencement address in 2019 -- all 1,156 cadets. He said he was told by a general that other presidents did not shake every hand -- only 30, 40 or 50, or the top 10 out of the class.
CAMEROTA: Of course. I mean, some of the areas have gotten 40 inches of rain. I mean, and this is the aftermath. What we're looking at right now, we're watching some of the 700 rescues that you're talking about.
While longer-term spending negotiations were still ongoing, Democrats have dug in their heels and demanded that no spending caps be agreed to until there is a deal on the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which expires on March 5. Democrats have said they want assurances that DACA recipients are protected before agreeing to an omnibus spending bill, the best leverage they believe they have. And even on the short-term continuing budget resolution, many Democrats say they want an answer on DACA before they vote again to fund the government.
And in the days leading up to Nevada's March filing deadline, Trump 2020 campaign manager Brad Parscale urged Tarkanian to drop his Senate bid and run instead for the 3rd Congressional District seat – with Trump's support.
Engel added, FDR used lawyers for law stuff; so too Clinton -- and his closest 'fixer,' Vernon Jordan, was a lawyer. But I really don't see any comparison between the type of government-engaged work by a private lawyer that Giuliani seems to be (doing).

And the President is asking agencies to look at Affordable Care Act and Medicaid waivers and demonstration projects that the Trump administration approved or put in place that may reduce coverage or undermine the programs, including work requirements.
So, when I look at all the issues, Barbara Buono was clearly my close and she's in line with the voters of New Jersey. But I tell you this.

It has been the long-term position of the Justice Department to defend the constitutionality of statutes whenever reasonable arguments can be made, Clement said. He was quick to add that it has also been understood that even if you think that part of the statute is unconstitutional, it would be in the long-term tradition of the office to have as little of the statute as possible fall.

And while he has continued to decry the US trade deficit with China and recently tied widespread loss of manufacturing jobs to the Asian powerhouse, Trump has confronted the reality of the US's complicated and delicate relationship with China in the last month as he's sought to enlist China in efforts to tame an increasingly belligerent North Korea.
CHAVEZ: Instead of the big tax breaks. How about just lowering your tax rates in states like New York and then you will in fact attract more businesses as states with lower tax rates do.
However, for Abrams, these barriers have often been present, and not once did they stand in her way. For example, I saw firsthand how effective she was as the Georgia House Democratic Leader, and I might add, the first woman to lead a party in either house of the Georgia Legislature.

Provide refundable tax credits based on age and income instead. The Republicans want to issue advanceable refundable tax credits to help people afford coverage on the individual market, but these credits will be based mainly on a person's age. The credits will range from $2,000 for 20-somethings to $4,000 for those in their early 60s. The credits will also have an income cap. Those making more than $75,000 would see their tax credits start to phase out, and an enrollee making more than $215,000 would no longer be eligible. Families with incomes above $150,000 would see their credits dwindle, while those earning more than $290,000 would no longer qualify. This provision would take effect in 2020.
CHAD MYERS, AMS METEOROLOGIST: The center of the storm now is 15 miles south-southwest of where Leyla is. That means the winds are going to shift in San Juan in the next 15 minutes. For most of the night the winds were like this. For most of the morning hours when we actually had Leyla live outside the winds were like this. But now that the eye has gone by, the winds are going to shift direction and come in like this. All of the debris we saw in her live shot will now be blown the other way. And debris is a really significant indicator of how much damage there is to the island. Devastating doesn't even truly begin to what really is going to show in the daylight when we can actually get out there.

Sanders is struggling because he hasn't been able to attract strong support among black voters and while he has a strong following among younger adults, their voter turnout hasn't increased.
During the debate, Biden and Klobuchar argued over who authored gun control legislation aimed at protecting women.
Klobuchar is markedly more centrist than many of the other Democrats running for President, including some of her colleagues in the Senate. Klobuchar has a liberal voting record, but she does not support abolishing the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency or Vermont Sen.

BLITZER: Quick -- quick -- a quick question about Ted Cruz, who won in Iowa, at least officially according to the Republicans. Before the Republican debate over the weekend, he had said you do not have -- his words -- the temperament to be president of the United States. He was asked about that at the debate. He refused to say that in front of you. He wouldn't say in front of you what he said earlier. What does that say to you about him?
And here's the thing. If we do not do it, we will have a debt crisis. Not to mention a crisis in Social Security and Medicare. Both parties have taken far too long to deal with it. It is one of the major issues confronting America. It's barely been asked in any of these debates. And we'd better deal with or we're going to have to explain to our children why they inherited this disaster.
TRUMP: There is tremendous hate. There is tremendous hate. Where large portions of a group of people, Islam, large portions want to use very, very harsh means. Let me go a step further.

BROWNSVILLE, TX - JUNE 22: A crying Honduran woman and her child wait along the border bridge after being denied into the Texas city of Brownsville which has become dependent on the daily crossing into and out of Mexico on June 22, 2018 in Brownsville, Texas. Immigration has once again been put in the spotlight as Democrats and Republicans spar over the detention of children and families seeking asylum at the border.

Unlike during the 2008 Great Recession, when the government leaped to assist financial institutions, the first priority this time should be helping individuals in need. Only then should we help businesses caught in this storm.

LEE: El presupuesto de «poder duro» de Trump plantea un recorte del 28% en el Departamento de Estado
Trump didn't pick Jackson because of his depth of management experience in big organizations. (Jackson doesn't have that.) He didn't pick him after a long and deliberative process that included consultation with Republicans (and Democrats) on Capitol Hill. He didn't vet Jackson fully to ensure that he could even be confirmed. (Jackson was tapped as the top White House physician by President Barack Obama in 2013; that position does not require Senate confirmation.)

If this is the new standard, every President from here on out is impeachable.' Andy McCarthy @FoxNews So well stated. Thank you! -- December 18 tweet
But I think it's important to focus on -- when you're talking about that public/private partnership to attract a large corporation and plenty of jobs, I think you focus less on the corporate subsidies and the tax incentives and focus on the infrastructure that you're going to bring to that community to support. And it's not just roads and rail but it's workforce development. It's affordable housing.
Those two comments – almost four years apart and more than six months after McCain's death – provide telling bookends to understand just how much Trump has changed Republican politics (and politics generally), and not for the better.
John Avlon argued that Americans' focus on individual self-interest at the expense of the common good at a time when the President is uniquely unsuited to being a uniting father figure sets the nation up poorly to endure the kind of sacrifices that might be needed to get through the crisis.

Consumers today can find short-term plans that cost as little as 20% of the least expensive Obamacare plan, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation.

Continuing resolutions are hurting the readiness of our troops, endangering our troops, and for those of us defense hawks, we find it very difficult to support CRs, Byrne said. The alternative is to let the Democrats crash the whole government, and that's what they are trying to do.
DAVID GERGEN, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST (via telephone): I am. The news is Americans are starting to demand negotiations on both sides. The new poll out tonight has 60 percent of Democrats -- and 60 percent of Republicans saying the House Republicans ought to compromise. That's the good news. The bad news is in Washington. They are game playing. There is a childish game of pin the tail on the donkey. Everybody knows that everybody in Washington is getting hurt, who gets hurt the worst.
Here is the full list of 90 false claims from December 14 through December 27, starting with the ones we haven't previously included in one of these roundups:

Saudi Arabia was making a billion dollars a day, and we were getting virtually nothing to protect them. We are going to be in a different world. We're going to negotiate real deals now, and we're going to bring the wealth back to our country. We owe $19 trillion. We're going to bring wealth back to our country. (APPLAUSE)

What -- you know what I -- what bothers me? When I see a Nancy Pelosi trying to defend this monster from Iran, who has killed so many people, who has so badly -- I mean, so many people are walking around now without legs and without arms. Because he was the big roadside bomb guy. He was the one who would send them to Afghanistan. He would send him to Iraq. He was big. That was his favorite thing. He thought it was wonderful. He doesn't think it's wonderful anymore. When Nancy Pelosi and the Democrats want to defend him, I think that's a very bad thing for this country. I think that's a big losing argument, politically, too. -- January 9 exchange with reporters after speech on National Environmental Policy Act regulations
When Schiff made up the phony story, and he repeated it to Congress and the world -- and it was a totally phony story -- then I released the transcript...When we released that conversation, all hell broke out with the Democrats, because they say, 'Wait a minute.

So Hurricane Maria is still a powerful Category 3 storm as it takes aim at the Turks and Caicos. CNN meteorologist Chad Myers has the latest forecast.
CROWLEY: I don't know because I don't think they know. It's really hard as a reporter to figure this out because the principles are still trying to figure this out. In the meantime, sticking with their positions and they -- the president has said for I don't know how long, I'm not going to negotiate on a debt ceiling. This is money we've already spent.
Facts First: Trump was exaggerating. The economy : Trump was exaggerating. The economy added 497,000 manufacturing jobs between January 2017, when Trump took office, and November 2019, official data shows. The number is 524,000 jobs added if you go back to November 2016, the month of Trump's election, as Trump often likes to do.
I'm very unhappy that he didn't repeal and replace Obamacare, as you know. He campaigned on repealing and replacing Obamacare for years and then he got to a vote and he said thumbs down. And our country would've saved a trillion dollars and we would've had great healthcare. So he campaigned, he told us hours before that he was going to repeal and replace, and then for some reason, I think I understand the reason, he ended up going thumbs up, and frankly, had we even known that, I think we would've gotten the vote cause we could've gotten somebody else. So I think that's disgraceful, plus there are other things.
RYAN: So, I would answer it in this way.
Facts First: We can't be sure of what Trump himself has heard about conditions at the VA, but it's just not true that the rest of us no longer hear complaints.
And while Sandoval's office says the Obama administration has not yet contacted the governor, he is at least being considered as of now.
The use of the word deplorable had more than a hint of politics. Hillary Clinton was widely criticized in 2016 for comments in which she said half of Trump's supporters are deplorables. She later said she regretted the comment.
But one of the names that comes up and there are only a few, is Tom Barrack. And Tom Barrack, you know, it may sound like a chapter from The Art of The Deal and, you know, in some ways.

In post-debate analysis of Tuesday night's Democratic debate, a number of commentators expressed surprise and even a bit of disappointment that the candidates were relatively chummy .

DeSantis announced during the press conference that a COVID-19 antibodies test will be available. The test can show if a person has had the virus in the past without showing symptoms, and therefore may be immune to it.

His performance appeared to confirm the skepticism of critics who saw his much hailed change of previous tone about the scope of the virus as a temporary departure from his unchained norm.
A recent calculation by Axios found that top health care executives brought in more than $1 billion combined last year – a fact that Sanders, using similar numbers, has frequently cited on the stump as evidence of a dysfunctional system.

(CNN) Congress has passed President Joe Biden's proposed $1.9 trillion stimulus along party lines. The package aims to not only tackle Covid-19 through mass vaccination, testing, and contract tracing, but also to aggressively manage the economic devastation the pandemic leaves behind.
Facts First: This was a major exaggeration. While Trump's administration has : This was a major exaggeration. While Trump's administration has invested in new military planes and other equipment, it is not even close to true that the US military has all brand-new jets or that, as Trump has claimed in the past, the old planes are all gone now.

He was undisciplined and puerile, whining about the moderators treating him unfairly, which is never a winning strategy. He missed obvious openings to attack Clinton, for example, on the revelations she's advocated for open borders in those private speeches. He lurked behind her uncomfortably while she spoke, a visual he was either unaware of or maybe actually totally aware of.
Governor Greg Abbott today held a press conference in Houston on the importance of election integrity legislation this session. The Governor named election integrity as an emergency legislative item during his State of the State address in February. Governor Abbott was joined for the press conference by Senator Paul Bettencourt and Representative Briscoe Cain, who have both filed several pieces of legislation to enhance election integrity in Texas
As this year's primary season comes to a close, the slate of candidates chosen includes a diversity of backgrounds not often seen in American politics. With a record number of female candidates on major party tickets for Congress and groundbreaking candidates from racial, ethnic and religious minorities landing on ballots across the country, many Americans are now choosing among candidates who resemble them for the first time. The new poll finds a majority of Americans feel it is extremely or very important for Congress to represent the country's demographic makeup (62% say so), about the same share who say it's that important for Congress to represent the nation's political makeup in partisanship and ideology (63%). More, 67%, say it's critical for Congress to represent the nation's economic diversity.
Biden will play an important role in the negotiations on Capitol Hill.
So what happened? The usual, according to reporting from The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal . Trump's speech said the prohibitions would not apply to trade and cargo; Trump accidentally added the word only, reversing the meaning; Trump plowed ahead as usual.

This new era of cooperation can start with finally confirming the more than 300 highly qualified nominees who are still stuck in the Senate – some after years of waiting. The Senate has failed to act on these nominations, which is unfair to the nominees and to our country.
TRUMP: And it's -- it's, literally, you know, it's so unusual because it's such an incredible place. It's so beautiful. And yet their number one question is always about the heroin and drugs that are pouring in. And I'll stop that cold at the border. And guys like Marco and Jeb probably even more so, they don't have a clue. They can't -- they can't stop it.

Last weekend, Trump attacked McCain in several tweets that targeted his ties to the controversial Russia dossier and his vote against repealing Obamacare. He also referred to McCain as being last in his class at the US Naval Academy.
Pelosi: I don't know. I think there are lots of people who have worked very hard, and are more in line for what will happen one of these times. But they're not to be considered [among] who those people would be. I mean, there are people who work very hard to win the elections, who have been in legislative battles. People who paid their dues. Not to put anybody down. Anybody is consequential. But I have great support in my caucus. I'm not worried about that. And I'm certainly not worried about them.
As we work to defend our people's safety, we must also ensure our economic resurgence continues at a rapid pace.
It's not exactly newsy, either, since Donald Trump doesn't say anything in the interview he hasn't said repeatedly since.

The Trump administration took another whack at the Affordable Care Act on Wednesday.

Presumably Mr. Severino thinks any religious values health care providers hold are more immutable than their patients' beliefs.

If Medicaid expansion remains, the real fight could be over funding. President Trump's senior adviser Kellyanne Conway has said part of the new administration's plans for repealing and replacing Obamacare would include converting federal funds for Medicaid into block grants.

On March 19, 2019, President Donald Trump offered this assessment of the late war hero and senator: I was never a fan of John McCain and I never will be.
Also, the Trump administration is allowing insurers to offer alternatives to Obamacare, which will come with lower premiums but fewer benefits. Of particular concern to health policy experts are short-term health insurance plans. The administration plans to make it easier to obtain this coverage by allowing carriers to sell policies that last just under a year, rather than a maximum of 90 days.
Because of these concerns, several prominent health care stocks have lagged the broader market's gains for the past year.

Marco Rubio on insulting Trump: I'll never do it again
2021 must be an opportunity to rectify our national failures. President-elect Joe Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris must do their part but so should ordinary citizens. Every city, town and hamlet in the nation should look inward at their histories of racial inequality, acts of truth-telling that can form the basis for local, state, and regional policy solutions that can pave the way toward healing and reconciliation across the nation.
Still, we've heard the President persist with his lies about readily available coronavirus tests against all evidence. He's repeatedly attacked the media for asking tough but totally fair questions about his handling of the crisis and bragged about his ratings . This isn't reality TV anymore, Mr. President: ratings don't matter; results do.
My industry has made a lot of progress in computers and in software and of course, it's made a lot of money. But Silicon Valley is a small place. Drive out to Sacramento or even across the bridge to Oakland, and you won't see the same prosperity. That's just how small it is. Across the country, wages are flat. Americans get paid less today than 10 years ago. But healthcare and college tuition costs more every year.

Trump stands with Alfred Eisenpreis, New York's economic development administrator, in 1976 while they look at a sketch of a new 1,400-room renovation project of the Commodore Hotel.

Those properties included Trump Tower in New York and Trump Plaza and multiple casinos in Atlantic City.
The House proceedings did involve closed-door hearings in a secure room in a Capitol basement, but there were also, of course, subsequent public hearings.

The NRA, which is good at politics (and not just, as some critics suggest, paying off politicians), understands why this kind of shift in social norms would be so damaging to its interests. Hence their effort to stigmatize not just the message, but the desired strategic outcome.

But what exactly that is remains a work in progress.
(CNN) Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders is tying himself to former President Barack Obama in a new TV ad despite years of criticizing him and his administration.
[Shows up with breakfast food] I'd like to be escorted.
The most absurd false claim: Impeachment polling
CNN previously reported that the senator, who had been held as a prisoner of war in Vietnam, did not want the President at his funeral. McCain's daughter, Meghan McCain, also revealed earlier this year that she wished Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner, Trump's daughter and son-in-law and senior advisers, had not attended the funeral.
Desde hace meses, Trump ha querido implementar una prohibición a la entrada de personas procedentes de seis países mayoritariamente musulmanes y los jueces federales se lo han impedido porque consideran que es una forma de discriminación por religión.
We will manage the best we can, but a shot of cash or additional funding to the navigator program would make more hours and more people available, said Allen Gjersvig, the alliance's director of outreach and enrollment services. Sure hope it comes.
We're getting fire extinguishers thrown at us from the top ... in the upper level of the inaugural deck, an officer shouted in another clip.
I mean, it is incredible. I was talking to one of the officers who told me it's hard to watch, A, because this is their home, this is their island, they are getting calls for help. Their own families are out there right now at this hour, 11,000 people -- at last check, anyway, 11,000 people in shelters, and this is an island of 3.5 million people. So it's not a large number given how many people are here.
Warren, Harris and Booker have all signaled their willingness to consider compromise plans that allow private insurers a role to play in any new or revamped system. They're up against moderates like Sen. Amy Klobuchar, who has said she is not in favor of Medicare for All, and Sen. Michael Bennet, who is planning to enter the race soon – neither of whom are expected to join their more liberal colleagues.
Less than an hour later, the billionaire was no longer a presidential candidate
Every politician in Washington is watching to see what happens in Alabama. Every. Single. One. By any traditional political calculus, Moore should lose given the allegations of inappropriate sexual conduct with teenagers while in his 30s leveled against him. (Moore denies all the charges.) But we are in extraordinary political times. Trump, after all, won while dismissing accusations of sexual misconduct from multiple women during the 2016 campaign.
He always faces zero consequences for his actions, the adviser said. Why change now?
Members bemoaned the need for another stopgap measure – the fourth in just six months – but members inside the conference meeting Tuesday night described an atmosphere that was mostly supportive of Republican leaders, who many admitted had little choice than to put another short-term spending bill on the floor.
Instead, Trump often chooses to spout fiction. He said in a speech to mayors last week: We've created 700,000 manufacturing jobs.
MORGAN: So what is the ...
One other complication: FISA authorization for surveillance expires at the end of 2017 and there is no clear plan yet to extend it. Few, if any lawmakers, want it to expire, but there are three different reform proposals that have advanced through committee between the House and Senate and no one really has had time to debate which version should move forward. Plus, the administration has expressed support for a clear extension with no reform.
CNN's Maegan Vazquez and Ted Barrett contributed to this report.
You will in total spend more as a nation on health care from adding all the bells and whistles that are associated with these kinds of proposals, Linda Blumberg, institute fellow, said when the study was published last October.
In October, for instance, Republican Sen. Bob Corker of Tennessee raised questions about Trump's temperament by describing his White House as an adult day care center.
In the immediate aftermath of her loss to Trump in November, the two-time presidential candidate largely stayed away from the limelight.
And then, when you do have a death, like you have had in the state of Washington, like you had one in California -- I believe you had one in New York... -- March 4 interview with Fox News' Sean Hannity
SANDOVAL: With the recommendation still tentative, more debate is likely about how to face a school's worst nightmare.
Facts First: Trump's deal with China reduces, though does not eliminate, some of the US tariffs on imported Chinese products. Schumer accurately described the tariff changes in a January : Trump's deal with China reduces, though does not eliminate, some of the US tariffs on imported Chinese products. Schumer accurately described the tariff changes in a January letter in which he argued that Trump had given away leverage with a temporary deal of some reduced tariffs in exchange for American goods and vague promises of reform.
Changing the heath insurance marketplace under Obamacare is complicated business, and there is no universal agreement on how any legislation would affect coverage.
Here's what you need to know:
MICHAEL PLAIS (ph): Yeah, basically we're talking a lot about what's going domestically but I want to know what message are we sending to countries around the world. And especially those that are major creditors the United States.
And while he has continued to decry the US trade deficit with China and recently tied widespread loss of manufacturing jobs to the Asian powerhouse, Trump has confronted the reality of the US's complicated and delicate relationship with China in the last month as he's sought to enlist China in efforts to tame an increasingly belligerent North Korea.
First, following up on Olivier's question, you mentioned that there's a legal review of the -- this legislation. But the White House has already said that the president will sign it. So, what -- what is the nature of that review if, presumably, there is some review before putting (inaudible)?
Furthermore, during the campaign, Trump insisted that Americans would not pay for the wall or any new barriers his administration constructed. According to Trump, Mexico would pay for the wall, but both the former and current Mexican president have refused to do so (the former President was more explicit while the current President, who has been less critical of Trump and has just avoided the topic). In the end, the US government spent billions in federal funds on the wall. Since January 2017, approximately $15 billion has been allocated to construct both new and replacement structures for the border wall through a combination of Department of Homeland Security and Department of Defense funding combined with the Treasury Forfeiture Fund, according to a January 2021 report from Customs and Border Protection.
BALDWIN: But Ken, I got to interject because this is a total tangent. We're not talking about Obamacare. You know, the question --
No one program is typically responsible for stopping an attack, so it is impossible to say with certainty that the program by itself stopped an attack that could not have been prevented with more conventional methods.
COOPER: Did she seem in recent days to be off medication or to be unstable?
DRUCKER: My general rule of thumb, Wolf, is the party that cares about the debt and deficit doesn't have the power to spend any money. When you have the power, you have to make choices. What is notable here, we heard nothing for eight years, but the Republicans speak against President Obama and all the debt he was racking up. Republicans were faced with a choice and they give the compromise and they govern and show faith in the philosophy that we needed tax reform and it will generate economic growth that will take care of that deficit. Or they can fold and have nothing to show with the complete control of government and not show they believe their own rhetoric and they made a choice.

El plan de Biden deja al Congreso decidir qué mecanismo de aplicación se usaría para exigir a las corporaciones en Estados Unidos que cumplan con los objetivos que él establece, y penalizarlos si se quedan cortos.
The President proclaimed that the state of our union is stronger than ever before -- boasting of standing up to China, winning with new trade deals and bringing torrents of jobs back to their rightful home.
As Trump's senior staff in recent days mulled a potential executive order announcing the US' plans to withdraw from NAFTA, officials have had to consider tedious factors to ensure that they would maintain fast-track authority over a renegotiated deal and drafted several versions of a potential order to ensure it would pass muster. It's part of the reason the White House has yet to formally notify Congress of its plans to renegotiate the deal.
CUOMO: And he treats Trump in a way because of the office that he holds.
RUBIO: Well first, I think - well, I'd be open to it if it takes a pause. But I don't think it takes a pause to enforce the law. What they are doing is they are in fact using that program to replace an American.
DR. DREW PINSKY, HOST, HLN'S DR. DREW ON CALL: Yes. Yes.
The prevailing commentary is that the case – the first of its kind since the Nixon era – was so weak that it must have been the product of political interference by the Trump administration with the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice.
Klobuchar has admitted that she can be too tough on her staff in response to the stories.

How about the senator from Hawaii? Nasty...She wants the Green New Deal, and then they informed her that that does not include airplanes. And you're the senator from Hawaii. So they said, 'What are you going to do?' And then they talked about building a train to Hawaii, can you believe it? No, no, she wants it, even though you can't -- you'll never get to Hawaii again.

The Justice Department in my view tends to get itself in trouble when it deviates from that tradition, Clement said in comments that amounted to repudiation of the Trump administration's legal position in the case.
In a generic ballot test, 52% of likely voters back the Democratic candidate for House of Representatives in their district while 42% back the Republican. Among all registered voters, Democrats hold a 12-point margin over the GOP, suggesting preferences have not shifted much since an August CNN Poll, which did not include an assessment of likely voters.
Klobuchar claimed during Tuesday's Democratic debate that a Vanderbilt University study ranked her as the most effective Democrat in the Senate and that two of her competitors for the Democratic nomination, Sens. Warren and Sanders, ranked among the bottom half of the list.
Last year, McCain died of brain cancer, and as part of his services, lay in state in the Capitol building in Washington.

Warren had an attack for just about everyone on stage, which is why I slightly lowered her grade. Warren's attacks wore off their steam because they were deployed too often. Debating is a balancing act, and Warren needed to spend more time building up her own case for the presidency. To her credit, she did come to Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar's defense, arguing that it was unfair for the senator to be picked on for forgetting the Mexican president's name. We need to see more of that from Warren on stage.
What doesn't end is battle inside the Republican Party that has flooded into the open the last several days. What doesn't end is how the country moves on from this moment -- if it does at all.
They have a history of losing members after they've gone too far and their position is indefensible to the rest of the conference, the senior GOP aide said Sunday after Poe announced his departure. It also probably doesn't help that the President of the United States publicly rebuked them this morning minutes before two of their leaders hit the Sunday shows.

Facts First: The number of Hispanic homeowners had indeed increased by more than 500,000 during Trump's presidency, according to data provided by the National Association of Hispanic Real Estate Professionals -- it rose by 176,000 in 2017, 365,000 in 2018, 277,000 in 2019. But this total gain of 818,000 was not the largest net gain ever recorded. In 2001, 2002 and 2003, the first three years of George W. Bush's presidency, the total gain was 930,000, according to the association's data. (The net gain during the 2003-2005 period, also under Bush, was 940,000.)
Demand, at the moment, far exceeds supply.
Facts First: There is no evidence that people are now saying Merry Christmas any more frequently than they did under previous presidents, nor that all stores that declined to use the phrase before Trump's presidency have changed their policies.
TRUMP: He didn't know that they used -- no, Wolf, he didn't know that they used private -- they used -- they privatized it. He didn't know that. But they used it on the Texas stadium, having to do with eminent domain. And he didn't even know that. And on top of it, Wolf, he spent over $100 million and he's a failed candidate. I mean, he's a laughingstock.
The reasoning behind much of Trump's trade moves, he and his allies asserted, was to bring back jobs from overseas. But tacking on tariffs, relaxing economic regulations and lowering taxes could have a limited effect on the repatriation of job opportunities for Americans lost to cheaper labor abroad, and foreign direct investment in the US declined significantly during the first two years of Trump's tenure.
But Trump has made remarkable progress in just two years to sandblast that view away, replacing it with an ever-growing perception among his supporters that the department's decisions are driven by politics, not law. The upshot is an erosion in public confidence in the justice system, and deep demoralization in the ranks of the career professionals at the Department of Justice. It is a nightmare from which there may be no waking so long as Trump remains in office.
Zelensky said had been no pressure from Trump and made other statements to that effect, but he has not gone so far as to say Trump did nothing wrong or that everything was perfect. In an interview published by Time magazine in early December, Zelensky did say, Look, I never talked to the President from the position of a quid pro quo. That's not my thing. But Zelensky continued: I don't want us to look like beggars. But you have to understand. We're at war. If you're our strategic partner, then you can't go blocking anything for us. I think that's just about fairness. It's not about a quid pro quo. It just goes without saying.
But Abrams has something more — a determination to get the job done, no matter what challenges may stand in her way. And given the stakes of the 2020 election, that tenacity will be a quality critical to winning back the White House in November
But I want to take a walk so you can see exactly what we are seeing in this hotel. Let me show you, police officers are standing by waiting to do their jobs that they really can't do right now because it's too dangerous. I am told they are already getting calls for rescue but they cannot go out right now because it is too dangerous.
Monday wasn't the first time McCain offered a strong rebuke of the President's character.
Despite an initial rough patch in the ACA marketplaces, the ACA Medicaid coverage expansion and subsidies to insurers have resulted in a large increase in health insurer profits, the four-page report said.
Facts First: Neither the unemployment rate for Pennsylvania nor the unemployment rate for the Scranton area is at its lowest level ever. And both rates have crept higher over the past several months.
Home builders throughout the country are struggling to find workers, and it's causing major problems: Labor costs are rising, homes are taking longer to complete and buyers are facing higher prices.
Facts First: Although Sanders is correct that several studies have found Medicare for All would reduce health care spending, at least one study published last year found the opposite.
Governor Greg Abbott today held a press conference in Houston on the importance of election integrity legislation this session. The Governor named election integrity as an emergency legislative item during his State of the State address in February. Governor Abbott was joined for the press conference by Senator Paul Bettencourt and Representative Briscoe Cain, who have both filed several pieces of legislation to enhance election integrity in Texas
He will likely try to avoid appearing a pawn of the Senate Republican majority or, alternatively, the sudden savior to House Democrats pressing their case against Trump. It is an uphill climb for the House, not merely because of fights over whether witnesses will be called, but because a conviction would require a two-thirds vote of senators.
There's chatter of potentially kicking the can down the road again and passing a short-term continuing resolution that lasts until January, so that members have more times to discuss rather than jam a bill in just before Christmas.
San Diego and the border wall
Trump claimed three times to have eliminated the estate tax, suggesting all three times that this would be beneficial to small farmers and small businesspeople.

The terrorist responsible for killing Sergeant Hake was Qasem Soleimani, who provided the deadly roadside bomb that took Chris's life. Soleimani was the Iranian Regime's most ruthless butcher, a monster who murdered or wounded thousands of American service members in Iraq. As the world's top terrorist, Soleimani orchestrated the deaths of countless men, women, and children. He directed the December assault on United States Forces in Iraq, and was actively planning new attacks. That is why, last month, at my direction, the United States Military executed a flawless precision strike that killed Soleimani and terminated his evil reign of terror forever.
Most of the questions on Monday will come from New Hampshire voters, an electorate which prizes its position as the first-in-the-nation primary and is often known for asking discerning and pointed questions.
BALDWIN: I want to come back to the two of you in just a second.
So, you know, Mitt is just trying to remain relevant. Nobody's talking to him much anymore. He got some publicity today. But the one problem I have is that I'm always audited by the IRS, which I think is very unfair. I don't know, maybe because of religion, maybe because of something else, maybe because I'm doing this, although this is just recently.
I've watched, covered, written about and studied presidential debates for a long time, but I've never seen anything like this one. It was more tawdry, more personal, and nastier that any political event I've ever witnessed. Everyone felt the effects. I sat next to a Trump supporter and directly in front of a pro-Hillary Democrat. They maintained decorum, but wrapped it in disgust. The debate broke little new ground substantively, but the tone set a new standard for nasty, personal and brutish.
We'll be back in a moment.

There are buildings and people trapped in buildings all over, and hundreds, perhaps thousands of first responders, military, family, friends, going through the rubble trying to find loved ones. There are lists, like the one you see over my shoulder close to the buildings that have collapsed. Those are the lists of the people who have been rescued.

Facts First: It is not true that Hawaii Sen. Mazie Hirono decided to support the Green New Deal and then was informed afterward that the deal does not include airplanes, nor that she later started talking about building a train to Hawaii. Trump was mischaracterizing an exchange Hirono had with a reporter in February.

Mr. Trump, I want to start with you in this block. Earlier today, a man was arrested and charged with assault after sucker- punching a protester in the face at your rally in Fayettville, North Carolina. This is hardly the first incident of violence breaking out at one of your rallies.
Aired September 20, 2017 - 08:00 ET
Biden pointed to his long-ago apology for that 2002 vote which, if we're honest, seems like ancient history in the Trump era. He was smart to pivot to what's still fresh to most Democrats: the Obama era. Biden drew voters' attention to his leadership on the Iraq troop drawdown and opposing an Afghanistan surge.

He may want to force the issue or to diffuse an issue or just claim control...as long as he doesn't get the blame, Miller said.
Here's our solution. Let's make sure we just cover the people who have pre-existing conditions, make sure that reinsurance or risk pools kick in for those four people in that small business that get cancer, subsidize that coverage. And what you do by doing that, is you dramatically lower and stabilize the price of insurance for everybody else. So those other 36 people, in that small business have predictable prices, lower prices.

Ryan writes in his policy paper that insurance premiums are rising and that certain plans are becoming unaffordable; that many states have been reluctant to expand Medicaid, which was intended to be a factor in the law's success; that many of the regional co-ops that were created to provide health services have failed, and that others are unsustainable; and that many of the major insurance companies have decided not to provide policies in certain regions of the country.

Medicare Advantage (MA) plans offer a second example of markets at work to lower costs and drive innovation. These plans offer seniors a holistic solution to their care, combining medical and drug coverage into an integrated private health care plan. And they often include benefits that traditional Medicare does not, such as wellness programs, as well as routine vision and dental care. As a result, an increasing number of seniors are choosing MA over traditional Medicare and have a variety of choices of competing private plans within MA to choose from.

Back in December, the president tweeted the deal was, quote, making Amazon richer and the post office dumber and poorer. So, the treasury-led task force found little appetite for fully privatizing the agency, which could have undermined its current mission to serve rural America. The report concluded the post office should act more like a private beings, including having the authority to charge market-based prices for both mail and package items. Currently, the agency is limited in how quickly it can raise rates.

Yes, president Trump is a racist. There is no doubt about it. But as we have seen, Democrats delve in racism as well. We've got to stop making this about who is a Republican, who is a Democrat. I want to know who say humanitarian.
Even right now, one of the biggest recent announcements in our county of added union jobs in the auto industry was at a facility making electric vehicles. I think a Green New Deal would promote that. And so that could be good news for us here in the Industrial Midwest.

The newly issued guidance is targeted at working age, able-bodied adults and does not apply to most of Medicaid's traditional beneficiaries, including children, seniors or the disabled. However, states that did not expand Medicaid could apply for fixed funding to cover certain low-income adults in their programs.
Why she's important: McSally lost a race for Senate in 2018 to Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, but she was appointed to fill out the term of Sen. John McCain.

The fact that she bragged to her supporters about calling CNN's Manu Raju a hack suggests she's focused on the Trump base in her state.

Here's a recap of where we are right now. OK? Here you go. Four people have been sentenced to prison. One person, Trump's campaign chairman Paul Manafort, was convicted at trial. Seven people had pleaded guilty including Trump's former personal attorney Michael Cohen, and 36 people and entities have been charged, including a criminally linked social media troll farm, the Internet Research Agency.
Trump talked up the production of oil and gas in the US during his time in office.

On top of that, the Turks are also saying why not extradite all of the accused to turkey to face the music there, face an open trial, and have this whole saga put to bed. Of course, that does not and would not solve the riddle, which certainly as far as those senators are concerned, the CIA, has satisfied them. The riddle of who gave the order. And that order as far as they're concerned for the murder of Jamal Khashoggi has been given by none other than the crown prince, coming at a very difficult time for Saudi Arabia as they embark on peace talks over the Yemen.
Trump repeatedly promised that he would cover all Americans when given the chance to repeal and replace Obamacare. He stated that coverage for everyone was ​just human decency back in February of 2016.
We can fix this problem. We promised the American people we would fix this problem. And the way to fix this problem is to repeal Obamacare and replace it with a patient-centered market-based system. This is something that we, as conservatives, have been dreaming about for decades. This is the chance, and the best and only chance we're gonna get. And that's why I'm really excited.
Bloomberg defended himself at the debate, saying, I was in favor of it. I thought it didn't go as far as we should, comments his campaign also made to CNN's KFile on Sunday . His campaign pointed to comments he made in 2013 on a radio program after the bill's passage as a sign of his support. Congress passed this, so let's try it at least, Bloomberg said.
(CNN) Uninsured Americans who want to buy Affordable Care Act coverage have another three months to do so, thanks to an executive order President Joe Biden signed last month.
The view from the floor when the RNC turned on Ted Cruz
Trump was at 89% approval with Republicans in a NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll conducted January 7-12, 93% in a Quinnipiac University poll conducted January 8-12, 88% in an Ipsos/Reuters poll conducted January 6-7, 89% in a Gallup poll conducted December 2-15.
Mindful of the nation's collective weariness at pandemic forced restrictions -- illustrated in part by polling conducted for Democrats and viewed inside the White House -- the President's speech will be his most forward-looking toward reopening, an aide said.
TRUMP: I think so. But, you know, it's not for me to say. I would say that a few of them maybe should. And you know, Marco, I'm 20 points up on him in Florida. And with Cruz, I'm even. It seems the last polls I'm even in Texas and winning every other state.
Facts First: Trump was exaggerating. Defense spending for fiscal years 2017, 2018 and 2019 was $2.05 trillion, and that includes more than three-and-a-half months of Obama's tenure, since the 2017 fiscal year began in October 2016.
If Trump had said nearly 30 years, we'd let it go as reasonable rounding. But nearly 31 years clearly suggests the number is more than 30 years.
– The UK company responsible for the largest indoor rainforest announced plans to build more transparent biomes around the world. One of the first will be in a coastal city in China.
The litany of justices going bandaged into June, traditionally the last month of the session, is anecdotal. Certainly, justices have taken spills at other times. Yet coming in the season that is also rife with retirement speculation, the late-spring pattern offers a reminder of the justices' sometimes precarious health.
This is one promise CNN was able to fact check even before the end of Trump's presidency, as the Trump administration and Republicans repeatedly put forward bills and filed lawsuits that would weaken Obamacare's protections for people with pre-existing conditions. Trump also never issued a plan to protect those with pre-existing conditions, despite repeatedly promising to do so.
A Klobuchar aide told CNN on Monday that the senator prepared for the town hall like she would for a major interview.
John McCain was tortured for more than five years in Vietnam and survived for more than a year after being diagnosed with brain cancer in 2017.
At times on Thursday, it appeared that the whole of Congress was fixated on its own civil wars, cut off from behind its high iron fence from the reality of America's darkest modern winter.
Facts First: Trump's comments appeared to refer to a remark Obama made at a PBS : Trump's comments appeared to refer to a remark Obama made at a PBS town hall in 2016 -- but he was inaccurately describing what Obama said.
And I got a full endorsement because they are the ones that said, and they had a news conference, and they said, he's the only one that's going to be able to fix it. Because it is a mess. I think for a period of a year to two years we have to look back and we have to see, just to answer the second part of your question, where we are, where we stand, what's going on.
Democrats spent most of the hearing questioning Walker's experience and pointing to past comments he's made that were critical of the Supreme Court and its 2012 Affordable Care Act decision. The panel's Republicans, meanwhile, heaped praise on the judge while also quizzing him on his views on different constitutional provisions.
COOPER: Do you think you will ever get the answers you're looking for about what happened in your sister's mind, in her life?
We live in Vermont, not in Cuba, China or Russia, Sanders said . We have to do what we can to meet the needs of the people here. Anyone who says I'm following Mao's method, or Cuba's or Russia's is a lunatic.
Facts First: Wages have been : Wages have been rising since 2014, using one common measure.
By Wednesday night, Trump had talked to the fretful leaders of Canada and Mexico and stood down on the possibility, deciding against pulling the US from the trade deal altogether.
MORGAN: ... a way to work yourself into a fearful rage and we'll come back in three minutes.
También se está concentrando en lo que ha llamado una carnicería que se está produciendo en casa. El lenguaje alarmista es parecido al de su campaña, cuando solía describir a las ciudades estadounidenses como zonas de guerra empapadas de sangre. El martes, hacia el final del día, Trump amenazó con intervenir en Chicago, a través de un mensaje de Twitter en el que dijo que si no detiene esta horrible carnicería con 228 tiroteos y 42 asesinatos en el 2017, les enviará a los (agentes) federales.
The 2034 date is the exhaustion date for both funds when combined. But if considered separately, the old-age fund will be exhausted by 2035, after which it would be able to pay just 77% of benefits. And the disability fund will be tapped out by 2023, at which point it could only pay out 89% of promised benefits.
Majority of people say 'the U.S. Senate already has enough information!' @FoxNews -- January 26 tweet
Congress held hearings today. We'll talk about that shortly, but first, my conversation with Sean Smith's mom, Pat.
At her event in Goffstown, Klobuchar pitching herself as a candidate who can win independent and lean Republican voters. She pledged to go everywhere, not just where it is comfortable, but where it is uncomfortable and outlined a platform that included overturning Citizens United, reinstating the Voting Rights Act, rejoining the Paris Climate Accord and getting on the path toward a public option for health care.
Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer said in the Democratic response to Trump's State of the Union that American workers are hurting and wages have stagnated. In my own state. Our neighbors in Wisconsin. And Ohio. And Pennsylvania. All over the country. Wages have stagnated, while CEO pay has skyrocketed.
Republican President George W. Bush is known for the initiatives his administration spearheaded to combat AIDS, especially in Africa. And the Obama administration spent more than $5.5 billion per year on the three primary domestic programs to combat HIV/AIDS, according to figures provided by the Kaiser Family Foundation , which closely tracks health care spending. (That's in addition to billions in spending on international anti-HIV/AIDS initiatives.)
TRUMP: Well, first of all, I don't really think that. I think that I hold views that are very similar to many of the people. We are more inclusive. And if you look at the polls and if you look at the millions of people that have been pouring into the polls, it's, again, the biggest story.
I want to build on the momentum that we saw here in 2018, Klobuchar told reporters Saturday in Wisconsin. No one ever thought that the Democrats were going to be able (to defeat) Gov. Walker, but we did it, and we did it in a smart, Wisconsin way with a grassroots campaign with (Democratic Sen.) Tammy Baldwin at the top of the ticket, and we can do it in the presidential, as well.
The law allows those collecting unemployment benefits to sign up for Obamacare coverage with no premiums in 2021. However, since this subsidy doesn't currently exist, it will take longer to set up, said the official, who did not have an estimated start date.

DeSantis announced during the press conference that a COVID-19 antibodies test will be available.

While providers would have protections under the plan, they would also have responsibilities. And it is an either-or scenario. Either they enroll as a Medicare for All provider or they go outside the system.
But there's also tremendous opportunity here. Look, we're not only being disrupted by economic change. We're being disrupted by climate change. We have had multiple cases, two different cases of floods, historic floods here in South Bend, of the kind we're told to expect every 1,000 years or so. And they happened within 18 months of each other.
I have, you know, tremendously, you know, I have a very complex system of taxes. And, frankly I get order that every single year. But, we'll make a determination over the next couple of months. It's very complicated.
Most of the questions on Monday will come from New Hampshire voters, an electorate which prizes its position as the first-in-the-nation primary and is often known for asking discerning and pointed questions.

Washington (CNN) The Supreme Court on Wednesday grappled with the Trump administration's attempt to weaken the so-called contraceptive mandate, the Affordable Care Act's long controversial requirement that employer-provided health insurance plans cover birth control as a preventive service.
Tolerance for illegal immigration is not compassionate – it is cruel. One in three women is sexually assaulted on the long journey north. Smugglers use migrant children as human pawns to exploit our laws and gain access to our country.
For example, Mary Landrieu, then a Democratic senator for Louisiana, voted for the final bill that included the fencing. But she said during the debate: I'm not going to waste taxpayers' money on a dumb fence...I've been in tunnels under the fence. I've watched people climb over the fence. I'm not going to send taxpayers' money down a rat hole.
Yet, Roberts is concerned about the court's reputation in polarized Washington. In 2018, when the President derided a federal judge who had ruled against his administration as an Obama judge, Roberts issued a statement that said, We do not have Obama judges or Trump judges, Bush judges or Clinton judges. What we have is an extraordinary group of dedicated judges doing their level best to do equal right to those appearing before them.
That the deal is working is also the considered view of some of the most hawkish Israelis – for instance, Ehud Barak, who is a former Israeli prime minister and former defense minister as well as a former chief of staff of the Israeli army.

The most egregious false claim: The buses to New Hampshire
Sanders caucuses with Democrats, but since he is elected as an independent in Congress, he was not ranked among those within the party as Klobuchar suggested. Sanders has a score of .159.
WIRE: All right. Well, President Trump has been overly critical of Goodell and the NFL, he has tweeted praise for Jerry Jones twice, calling him a winner for his handling of the protests. He told his players that they would be benched if they knelt.
That's absurd. People have it only because Trump's opponents have blocked his attempts to get rid of it.
Bernie voted five times against the Brady Bill, Biden said.
Facts First: Trump simply did not save Social Security and Medicare, which still face uncertain financial futures, and there is no evidence Democrats intend to cut either program. Also, Biden did not lie when he accused Trump of wanting to cut Social Security and Medicare: Trump's 2020 budget proposal includes : Trump simply did not save Social Security and Medicare, which still face uncertain financial futures, and there is no evidence Democrats intend to cut either program. Also, Biden did not lie when he accused Trump of wanting to cut Social Security and Medicare: Trump's 2020 budget proposal includes cuts to Medicare spending and spending on Social Security's Disability Insurance and Supplemental Security Income programs.
Governors have a vested interest in Obamacare, particularly in Medicaid expansion, which has extended coverage to 11 million low-income adults in the 31 states that have accepted it. Some 16 of those states are headed by Republicans.
For this enormous responsibility, Knudsen was paid $1 per year. He didn't do it for the money. He was motivated by a duty to keep America free from tyranny. He set aside the job of leading one of the largest companies in America so he could help save the world.
Though costly, members of Congress and Americans who opposed its passage should view the sweeping package as critical to stem the steep rise in overdose deaths the US would likely otherwise experience. Not supporting its passage is to overlook the possibility of hundreds of thousands more lives being lost to addiction for years to come.
BOOKER: No. It's probably your producer calling me to tell me to turn off the phone.
CNN tried to reach at least four Alabama lawmakers who voted to overturn Birmingham's wage increase, including some of the most outspoken opponents. None responded. Alabama's attorney general's office, though, made the state's position clear in a brief filed with the 11th US Circuit Court of Appeals. The court is hearing an appeal by the plaintiffs after a federal judge dismissed their lawsuit. A decision is not expected for months.
In the last 2 years, our brave ICE officers made 266,000 arrests of criminal aliens, including those charged or convicted of nearly 100,000 assaults, 30,000 sex crimes, and 4,000 killings.
AC 360 LATER starts right now.
Pelosi called the killing provocative and disproportionate and argued that it put American soldiers, diplomats and other citizens at risk. But she called Soleimani a terrible person who did bad things, explicitly emphasizing that her opposition to killing him was not based in any sympathy for him or for Iran.
The President has frequently touted that the US has the cleanest air and cleanest water in the world, but the US ranks 16th in air quality in the world and the US ranks 26th in quality of sanitation and drinking water, according to the Environmental Performance Index.
Democratic presidential candidate Mike Bloomberg speaks during a campaign rally at the Palm Beach County Convention Center in West Palm Beach, Fla., Tuesday, March 3, 2020.
The task was especially hard on Tuesday as she was trying to respond to Trump's flamboyant, non-traditional approach with the conventional imagery of a regular politician's televised speech.
We must choose whether we are defined by our differences – or whether we dare to transcend them.
Republican Congressman Charlie Dent speaks during an interview at his campaign office in Allentown, Pennsylvania on November 2, 2016.
And the reason is they have a fantastic lobby. They take care of all of the senators, the Congressmen. They have great power and they don't bid out. The military is never properly bid. When we go out to military bids, it's not properly bid. And the people that really sell us the product are oftentimes the product we don't want, only because that particular company has political juice, OK?
Meredith wanted to buy Time Inc back in 2012, but didn't want Time magazine. The difference now is the Koch brothers' money.

Aired July 5, 2017 - 12:00 ET
Right now in the Texas court – probably ends up in the Supreme Court, Trump told reporters on Friday. But we're doing something right now that will be much less expensive than Obamacare for the people.
Biden eager to attack Bloomberg, too
We are going to make sure voters understand the rampant waste that Democrats snuck into this so-called covid relief bill, McAdams said. It's a socialist wish list for Nancy Pelosi and her democratic allies and it is going to hurt them in 2022.
Touting record unemployment rates for various groups, Trump added, Women -- best in 71 years. Sorry. We'll have you there soon. Soon, it will be 'historic.' I have to apologize to the women; it's only 71 years. -- February 6 speech at National Prayer Breakfast

The American people want the border secure. So, I'm hopeful that this committee will be able to come up with a proposal that we can all support, that the president can sign. But it's going to have to include funding that will allow us to secure the border, and it will have to include funding for some sort of a barrier.
In 2016, the campaign recognized Sanders' popularity among Latinos, senior Sanders adviser Chuck Rocha said, but we learned it too late to capitalize on it, because we were building the airplane and flying it at the same time.
If I leave my job now, I think I'll have enough money to live comfortably the rest of my life. So is there any reason I shouldn't stop working and retire? --J.Z.
Pamela Brown to Biden: Why not carve out time to answer tough questions?
CORTES: Look. Right now, it's so far away. But right now, if I had to bet, I would bet on Beto O'Rourke. I think he has a bit of that Obama factor, that charisma, that likeability. And if he can put Texas in play, that alone is enough to make him the nominee.

Last month, the president had delivered a -- a warning to Congress, a couple of times, not to take vacation in August. What is the status of the president's August plans? Does he plan to leave Washington? For how long? And what will he be doing during that timeframe?
LEMON: So, let me ask you -- because I want to ask Garrett this. Because Garrett, you know Robert Mueller. Do you get the sense as Jack says that things are wrapping up or is it possible that this is on the beginning? GARRETT GRAFF, CNN CONTRIBUTOR: Well, I think both can be true.
She later added, We live in an era where we knock down old American heroes for all their imperfections when no leader wants to admit to fault or failure.
Un Congreso hostil mantuvo viva la base de Guantánamo, aunque Obama haya logrado reducir el número de presos allí. Trump está ahora preparado para reconstruirla una y otra vez y, según informes de The New York Times y The Washington Post, el equipo de Trump estaría planeando revivir las cárceles clandestinas de la CIA.
COOPER: Well, he lost that election. Eight years later running for governor in Massachusetts, he said this.
We fully recognize that these products are not necessarily for everyone, but we do think they will provide an affordable option to many, many people who've been priced out of the current market under the Obamacare regulations, said Randy Pate, a deputy administrator at the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services.
Highmark, the nation's fourth-largest Blue Cross plan with members in Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Delaware, said its Obamacare members are older, have more chronic conditions and consume more health care services than its employer plan members. As a result, the company has lost more than $773 million in its first two years on the exchanges. It called the losses unsustainable.
On Tuesday, he continued his criticism, telling reporters at the White House that I was never a fan of John McCain and I never will be.
Klobuchar spent the lead-up to the town hall with a trip through Wisconsin and Iowa, building on her campaign theme of retaking Midwest communities that have drifted away from Democrats in recent years. Klobuchar, a three-term senator from Minnesota, is pitching herself as a pragmatic lawmaker who is willing to work with those who oppose her to get things done.
SANDOVAL: The Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School Public Safety Commission is recommending teachers be allowed to carry guns on school campuses. The controversial proposal part of a 407-page preliminary report. It addresses failures by Broward County law enforcement during the massacre as well as recommendations on how to counter future school violence.
Many lawmakers have questioned the proposal's price tag, calling instead for a scaled-down bill narrowly focused on vaccine distribution. This approach would have been a mistake. Not only would lives soon be needlessly lost to overdose, but also, dollar for dollar, preventing addiction is far less expensive than treating it.
Story highlights We must come together to find solutions to move this country forward, Poe said Leaving this caucus will allow me to be a more effective member of Congress, he said
[11:49:18] We have to understand times are tough for a lot of people in our country. Today, this is about how much better things can be. This is about more jobs, fairer taxes. It is about bigger paychecks. It's about faster growth and upward mobility. It's about a strong economy that makes all of us stronger and healthier. Those are the effects. Those are the benefits of tax reform. Here is the heart of it. And here is why this is so vital that we do
It is disappointing this vote has become the exclusive litmus test for whether or not a member of Congress stands with President Trump, Sen. Kevin Cramer, a Republican from North Dakota, said in a statement. One would have a hard time finding a more fervent, consistent, longstanding supporter of this President than I have been since he first announced his candidacy.
Aaron David Miller is a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and author of The End of Greatness: Why America Can't Have (and Doesn't Want) Another Great President. Miller was a State Department Middle East analyst negotiator in Democratic and Republican administrations.
I think that you've taken that word. It was once called abortion then it was choice and now it's all women's health. It's insulting to women --
SEN. RAND PAUL (R), KENTUCKY: I think if we keep saying we wanted to defund it, we fought for that, but now we're willing to compromise on this, I think they can't -- I think I know we don't want to be here but we're going to win this, I think.
Facts First: CNN did not have a red light on as Trump was speaking. CNN's photojournalists do not use red lights on their cameras at his rallies.
Many people know the story of Henry VIII and his six wives but it took a contemporary British writer to turn the life of the king's most competent minister into a riveting story that won awards and launched versions on television and in theaters.

Our military is rebuilt. Our -- if you see the VA, you know how well that's doing now. We have Veterans Choice. That was a big difference where you can go out, get a doctor if they can't take care of you immediately. So our vets are taken care of for the first time, really. -- January 13 interview with WWL-TV in New Orleans
It's going to take a lot of years to adjust those bills to get to some place you should have been in the beginning, he said.
LINDA CHAVEZ, FORMER REAGAN ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: We're not going to settle here whether or not he has the right. It is going to go into the courts. And he's right about that.
Biden said Bloomberg called Obamacare a disgrace after it passed.
Washington (CNN) Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg participated in Wednesday's Supreme Court's teleconference hearing from a Baltimore hospital, where she is recovering from a benign gallbladder condition.
COOPER: So as far as you know, she wasn't bipolar, she wasn't schizophrenic, you believe it was postpartum depression.
Defund Planned Parenthood. In keeping with long-standing Republican beliefs, the legislation prohibits federal funding for Planned Parenthood. But the restriction is only for a year.
So, the amount of the tax credits is based upon the way insurance works. And it's modeled after the Tom Price legislation, which he had last year, which is adjust for age and family size. Because, the older a person gets, the more costly their health care is. That's how insurance is written.
And so, Trump went back to being, well, Trump. He tweeted more. He made calls – on everything from foreign policy to staffing – on instinct. Which brings us to the Jackson pick.
TAPPER: In just five days voters will go to the polls here in this state as well as in Ohio, Illinois, North Carolina and Missouri. The race for the Republican nomination for president could change dramatically.
Trump has also struggled to make good on his core campaign promise of repealing and replacing Obamacare with something much better amid disagreements between warring factions of the Republican Party. And amid his quest to get a bill passed as soon as possible, Trump failed to help bridge those differences and was forced to accept a loss, canceling a scheduled vote on the House floor.
But a Trump adviser working with the task force told CNN's Jim Acosta that Trump bet that warmer weather in the spring would cause the virus to dissipate.
So, would all those pages really stack up as tall as a three-story building?
SANDERS: I'll let you know if I do.
Facts First: The US has never had a $500 billion trade deficit with China.
I want to thank the people at Google and Google Communications because, as you know, they substantiated what I said on Friday. The head of Google, who's a great gentleman, said -- called us and he apologized. I don't know where the press got their fake news, but they got it someplace...And how that got out -- and I'm sure you'll apologize. But it would be great if we could really give the news correctly. It would be so, so wonderful. -- March 15 coronavirus press conference
Buttigieg also name-checked justice in policing, which might not have been the smartest move given that he has faced controversy for his handling of a police shooting that inflamed racial tensions in his hometown of South Bend, Indiana. By now, Buttigieg should have developed a more nuanced answer to explain his lack of minority support.
Since my election, the net worth of the bottom half of wage-earners has increased by 47 percent – 3 times faster than the increase for the top 1 percent. After decades of flat and falling incomes, wages are rising fast – and, wonderfully, they are rising fastest for low-income workers, who have seen a 16 percent pay-increase since my election. This is a blue collar boom.
5. Economics: The latest monthly S&P Case Shiller Home Price Index will be released at 9 a.m. ET.
Trump's health care efforts were largely motivated by attempting to undo his predecessor's landmark law -- the Affordable Care Act. He also implemented a slew of regulations aimed at appeasing his evangelical base, such as religious freedom objections. In apparent efforts to appeal to seniors and his longtime nationalist focus -- fighting for the US not to get ripped off -- he also pursued policies aimed at price transparency and matching the prescription costs in other countries.
And Jake, my family worked in the steel industry, not with a white collar. I understand their plight.
So for more let's bring in CNN's Sarah Westwood at the White House. Sarah -- Zinke was in trouble because of all these investigations but his departure didn't seem imminent, did it? Why did all this happen today?
Today is a great day for America's franchise job creators and their employees in the fight for high quality, less expensive health coverage, said Robert Cresanti, chief executive officer of the International Franchise Association.
Former Vice President Joe Biden echoed that argument.
You're going to vote 'no' and then shut down the government? asked Rep. Mark Sanford, a Republican from South Carolina, when asked if the House Freedom Caucus was doing little more than paving the way for a big increase in spending in a later deal by supporting short-term continuing resolutions.

MORGAN: So, Star, you see, when you hear this it just makes me so bloody angry, right?
But he noted that Latino voters over 45 have tended to dominate the caucuses in the past, so the age of voters who turn out will be a major determining factor.
Becerra has so far avoided the fate of Neera Tanden , Biden's nominee for the Office of Management and Budget, who is facing public rejection from lawmakers in both parties. The White House said Tuesday it is standing behind her.

Castaneda said she also faces long wait times for her doctor in Northridge, a suburb that has seen an influx of patients from poorer areas. You can't get an appointment when you're sick ... so I've just been waiting and waiting, she said. They told me, 'If you get sick enough, just go to the emergency room.'
COOPER: You talked about also winning the 44 percent of the Latino vote last night. Obviously there are some polling experts who point out there were so few people involved in the caucus in terms of Latinos the win for you represents about one-half of 1 percentage of the entire Latino population in Nevada. Are you planning to make more of an outreach to Latinos, to African-Americans?
She was a nonevent on the campaign. She became a White House staffer and that's when people suddenly realized she's dumb as a brick. A little marketing savvy and has a look but as far as understanding actually how the world works and what politics is and what it means – nothing, Bannon was quoted as saying by Wolff.
The US became the top producer of crude oil in particular during Trump's tenure. The United States has been the world's top producer of natural gas since 2009, when US natural gas production surpassed that of Russia, and it has been the world's top producer of petroleum hydrocarbons since 2013, when its production exceeded Saudi Arabia's, the Energy Information Administration says.
Facts First: The trade deficit with the European Union was $114.6 billion in 2018, $101.2 billion in 2017, $92.5 billion in 2016. The deficit was $169.6 billion in 2018 if you only count trade in goods and ignore trade in services. But Trump, as usual, failed to specify that he was using this more limited measure.
Approaching sagas of a potential government shutdown, raising the debt ceiling and a moment of truth in the Senate over the potential nuclear option confirmation of Supreme Court pick Neil Gorsuch will severely test the political alacrity of a White House already exposed by the busted bid to repeal Obamacare.
Ten years later, ten years later, one of the greatest men in Donald's life passed away, Fred Trump. And the funeral was being held the night before at the Frank Campbell Funeral, 82nd in Madison.
TAPPER: Do you endorse the Markey/Ocasio-Cortez Green New Deal?
You can read a longer fact check here
There's a real problem in the tax code today in that the tax code discriminates against people who don't get health care from their job. If you're working and you're not on Medicaid, and you have a job that's paying you 10, 12, 15 bucks an hour, and that job does not give you health insurance, there's nothing that the tax code does to help you buy health insurance. If you do have health care from your job, you have an open-ended tax benefit.

The move was designed by newly empowered Democrats to put Republicans on the record voting for or against protecting Obamacare and its safeguards for those with pre-existing conditions. The GOP has for years fought against the law, with House Republicans voting in 2017 for repeal.
SANDERS: Since you said my name so politely.
Trump claimed twice that the Obamacare website, Healthcare.gov, was so problem-plagued that it cost $5 billion.

The timing of Rep. Adam Schiff's comments
The abrupt end to the advertising campaign did not affect the federal exchange website, healthcare.gov, which continues to operate and accept new applications. Also, the agency's website continues to direct viewers to enroll in an affordable health plan at healthcare.gov.
Under Obamacare, most people must have health insurance or pay a tax penalty. For 2017, the penalty is $695 per adult (up to a family maximum of $2,085), or 2.5% of household income, whichever is greater. The penalty for children is half the adult rate ($347.50).
STODDARD: Tax reform is the goal. They never meant to cut taxes for the middle class. They've wanted tax cuts for the wealthy for a long time. This is a goal.
Tens of thousands of innocent Americans are killed by lethal drugs that cross our border and flood into our cities – including meth, heroin, cocaine, and fentanyl.
Facts First: There is no evidence that Obama called Kim even once. This is a total fabrication, Susan Rice, who served as Obama's national security adviser, : There is no evidence that Obama called Kim even once. This is a total fabrication, Susan Rice, who served as Obama's national security adviser, said on Twitter in response to a previous version of this Trump claim. There's also no evidence for Trump's previous claim that Obama begged Kim for a meeting.
Trump's budget assumes his tax cuts are extended – not an unusual thing to assume. President Barack Obama's budgets often made assumptions too, assuming spending cap increases and discretionary spending changes.
I think one of the reasons the President has been able to move so far to the right is that there is no primary opposition to him, said Sanders in a July 2011 radio interview. And I think it would do this country a good deal of service if people started thinking about candidates out there to begin contrasting what is a progressive agenda as opposed to what Obama is doing.
In the days since, the House leadership announced the Republican Party would move on from its seven-year promise to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, and the House Freedom Caucus has taken a large share of the blame for the defeat.
And of course he's going to be introduced by perhaps the best person that there is to introduce him to America, his daughter Ivanka Trump, who is by almost all accounts that it take lovely and very, very bright and warm person.
Facts First: Trump was tentatively supportive of the war in Iraq when radio host Howard Stern asked him in September 2002, Are you for invading Iraq? Trump responded: Yeah, I guess so. I wish the first time it was done correctly. The day after the invasion in March 2003, he said, It looks like a tremendous success from a military standpoint. Trump did not offer a definitive position on the looming war in a Fox News interview in January 2003, saying, Either you attack or don't attack.

Facts First: Michelle Obama and Bill Clinton did not go to Michigan for Hillary Clinton's : Michelle Obama and Bill Clinton did not go to Michigan for Hillary Clinton's rally in the state on the last day of the campaign, nor for President Barack Obama's rally in the state that day. Both Bill Clinton, who campaigned in North Carolina that day, and Michelle Obama joined Hillary Clinton, along with Barack Obama, at a nighttime rally in Philadelphia.
TRUMP: You're right, Wolf, but how can he criticize me for using eminent domain when his own family used it?
I thought the reaction was pretty positive even though there were a lot of people saying – and rightfully so – 'God, here we go again,'  said Rep. Mike Simpson, a Republican from Idaho.
COOPER: To Gloria's point, Senate may not be the one do it.
We are going to war ... but not physically, this source said in describing the sentiment. It's primary season, and it's open season.
Biden will spend the ensuing weeks firing up Air Force One to fly around the country highlighting where the bill's effects will be most felt , an effort designed to sell people outside Washington that it is in part because of his plan that vaccinations are speeding up, schools are reopening and life is starting to look like normal, according to people familiar with the plans.
Some 8.7 million people signed up on the federal exchange, while 3 million picked plans in the 11 states and the District of Columbia, which run their own marketplaces. Some 27% of consumers were new to Obamacare, a somewhat lower share than last year. Another 24% were automatically re-enrolled, while 47% were returning customers who picked new plans, slightly higher than last year.
Another bruising hearing is looming on Tuesday, for interior secretary nominee Deb Haaland , whose opposition to fossil fuels has GOP members branding her as extreme, in a showdown that could also prove uncomfortable for moderate Democrats.
Those other chunks include a government-run public option to compete with private plans on ACA marketplaces and a Medicare expansion lowering the age of eligibility to 60. Whether or not those eventually get enacted, there is no sign yet of Democratic fractures that would threaten passage of the Covid relief package in the next few weeks.
In one fell swoop, Trump delivered a speech worthy of the worst demagogue and turned his constitutional obligation to inform Congress about the state of our union into an episode of reality television.

Slavitt: Our narrative, unfortunately, is limited by what our politicians and our lawmakers are willing to do. And the public doesn't feel particularly well represented by that. They feel like the needs of their families, their concerns, aren't represented and that we don't have politics that represent the need for American families to be able to afford to take their kids to the doctor, to afford their prescriptions, so they're fearful.
Before their conversation ended, they mentioned a startling detail. They said they'd sought out black veterans of the 1963 campaign to get advice and inspiration. Instead they got shrugs.
Obama said in 2009 that increasing the US share of trade with Asia from 9% to 10% could mean 250,000, 300,000 jobs, but he was not specifically attributing that estimate to the potential effects of a trade deal with South Korea. Republican Rep. Kevin Brady later used an estimate of about 250,000 new jobs from trade agreements with South Korea, Colombia and Panama combined, not just the one with South Korea.
Trump has tried to get South Korea to agree to a much larger increase for 2020. Negotiations broke off in November.

The years of economic decay are over. The days of our country being used, taken advantage of, and even scorned by other nations are long behind us. Gone too are the broken promises, jobless recoveries, tired platitudes, and constant excuses for the depletion of American wealth, power, and prestige.
Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders has argued Bloomberg's money and record won't help motivate the Democratic base. Former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg has labeled Bloomberg a billionaire who thinks that you can just ... buy your way on to television and win that way. And Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren , hours after Bloomberg qualified, compared him to President Donald Trump and called him an egomaniac billionaire.

SANTORUM: Of course, you're ignoring the Affordable Care Act where he took money that was not appropriated, specifically under that. The Congress said, no, we're not giving you this money. And he took it from somewhere else and spent it to subsidize insurance companies.
I think this is an organization that has an opportunity, if done right, to make a difference in the long-term debate even while people are working on these very challenging issues in the near term.

We know that the Trump Justice Department is backing a lawsuit to destroy what's left of Obamacare (even though they'd rather wait for a final judgment until after the election) . Give the current crisis, blocking people from getting access to open enrollment health care exchanges is petty and cruel.
Students loan debt is also a major factor, rising to more than $1.34 trillion.
[W]e believe it is very likely that we would need to leave the public exchange business entirely and plan for additional business efficiencies should our deal ultimately be blocked, Aetna (AET) CEO Mark Bertolini wrote in a July 5 letter.

Facts First: Even 2020 Democratic presidential candidates who have advocated the decriminalization of the act of illegally entering the country, such as Massachusetts Sen.

My father was his kryptonite in life, he was his kryptonite in death.

President Donald Trump's attacks on the late Sen. John McCain are stupid and socially unnatural, Anthony Scaramucci said Thursday.
But let's get to the other big headline out of the briefing, this whole FOX story and the DNC staffer, Seth Rich.
Senator Lindsey Graham (C), R-SC, stands with Senator Bill Cassidy, R-LA, Senator Dean Heller (L), and Senator Ron Johnson, R-WI, as well as former Senator Rick Santorum (R), to announce their legislation to repeal and replace Obamacare through block grants on Capitol Hill in Washington, DC, on September 13, 2017. / AFP PHOTO / JIM WATSON (Photo credit should read JIM WATSON/AFP/Getty Images)
Over the weekend, Trump attacked the late senator in several tweets that targeted McCain's ties to the controversial Russia dossier and his vote against repealing Obamacare. He also referred to McCain as being last in his class at the US Naval Academy.
The immediate obstacles. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has a five-vote margin on this bill, and scrutiny on the package -- even by some Democrats -- is more intense than last spring's stimulus.
But what Trump's comments about McCain should remind us of is this: Whether there is political gain to be found in dishonoring a lifelong public servant, it is simply wrong. It is not who we are – or who we should be. That everyone – Republicans, Democrats, independents and all the rest – won't come together to say that as one is profoundly depressing and disappointing.
The poll shows Democrats with a huge advantage among women likely voters, 60% say they back the Democrat in their district compared with 36% for the Republican. Among men, Republicans hold a slim 5-point edge. And as in 2016, education is a sharp divider among white voters. Those without college degrees broadly back the Republican (57% for the Republican to 38% for the Democrat) while those who hold four-year degrees favor the Democrat by a similar margin (59% to 37%).
And of course, Elizabeth Warren knocked it out of the park. She combined clear explanation of her plans with a powerful defense of people who are suffering in Trump's America.

Awareness of Obamacare coverage and premium subsidies remains fairly low, even though the exchanges first opened in 2014. Just under two-thirds of uninsured adults said they had heard nothing or only a little about financial assistance for policies, according to an Urban Institute study conducted in September. The Trump administration slashed Obamacare's marketing budget by 90% during its term.

That doesn't mean that the impact this could have on the debt and deficit isn't real. That doesn't mean that Republicans aren't going to argue that this plan isn't needed. It's true that there are still billions from the last package that haven't gone out the door. Many Republicans argue it's irresponsible to spend more when you don't even know what you need. Those are arguments they can make to the public. But, Democrats are feeling confident that they can win that public fight.
En el papel, Trump carece de un gran logro legislativo, tiene el menor nivel de aprobación de cualquier nuevo comandante en jefe desde la Segunda Guerra Mundial, ha visto cómo algunas de sus metas claves en cuanto a inmigración han sido frenadas en los tribunales y no ha cumplido con su promesa de revisar el sistema de salud.

Unfortunately, when the president has had the megaphone to the American in his inauguration or his State of the Union, he didn't bring up the debt or the deficits.
Trump has sought to sidestep his difficulties on the legislative front with a slew of executive orders, but a person close to the White House acknowledged Wednesday that they were no substitute for legislation.

If someone my age or younger is weighing a policy idea, and somebody comes along and says, you can't do that, it's socialist, I think our answer is going to be, OK, is it a good idea or is it not?

In the next few days, the House Budget Committee will finish assembling the final bill based off the sections that committees passed last week. This will ensure Democrats are able to get the caucus on board and pass the bill as soon as next week.
GREGORY: No. I thought that was hyperbole in that interview that he did with you. I mean, I think, you know, that was kind of a short- handed way to say that, in his view, the IRS has targeted conservatives. There has been, obviously, a lot of talk about Tea Party activists and others being targeted. No, I thought that was off-base.
The intensity of concern over the issue -- and its potential to drive up enthusiasm among Democrats later this year -- was evident even before the coronavirus effectively paused the primary campaign.
However, it will take the President's health officials time to address all of the measures, particularly as battling the coronavirus pandemic remains the top immediate priority. Some items would be easy to undo, but others involve regulations and waivers that can't simply be voided. And some would need approval from Congress, which would be a challenge because Biden can't afford to lose a single Democrat in the Senate -- and few in the House, after his party lost seats in the chamber.

Some of Trump's most consequential decisions, such as his judicial appointments , will dictate the ideological make-up of the courts for decades. And the physical reminder of his immigration and border security policies, in the form of a US-Mexico border wall, will likely remain etched into America's landscape well past his presidency.
You have people that are terminally ill. If they have money, they go to Asia, they go to Europe, they go all over the world looking for help. If they don't have money, they go home and they die, and what we did is a thing called Right to Try. People sign something and they don't hold the country responsible. -- January 28 campaign rally in Wildwood, New Jersey
Trump told a story about how, in San Diego, they were begging us to build a wall, and then as soon as it was built, they said, 'We don't want the wall,' so Trump threatened to take the wall down and move it elsewhere, and they said, 'No, no, no, don't do that.' -- February 14 speech to National Border Patrol Council members

That said there are plenty of people very close to the President, including potentially relatives of his who could be in criminal legal jeopardy. And he's going to have all manner of civil problems. The Trump Org is going to have to deal with all sort of civil lawsuits as well. So yes, I wouldn't be resting easy by any means.
The Trump administration continues to chip away at the Affordable Care Act. It's once again slashing funding for the program that pays navigators, usually from non-profit and community groups, to help people sign up. The government will only provide $10 million for the program for this fall, compared with $36 million last year and $63 million in 2016. The administration said the navigators are not effective; last year, it broadened the chances for private sector agents and brokers to assist consumers. Obamacare's advertising budget was cut as well, by 90%. Open enrollment for 2019 coverage begins in November.
It was Amy Klobuchar who had the best night, with consistently strong answers on every topic and a convincing argument that she can beat Trump in a general election, but her performance is likely not enough to get her from 6% to a win, place or show in Iowa.

The suit is the latest skirmish in a national battle over the minimum wage. At least 21 states and DC have raised their minimum wages above the federal level of $7.25 an hour in the last four years, and at least 41 localities have adopted wages above their state minimums. Many have done so because of protests by Fight for $15, a workers' movement that seeks to raise the minimum to $15 an hour.

A district court judge invalidated the mandate, and said it was inseverable from the rest of the law. His decision was put on hold, but it emboldened the Trump administration to dig in and escalate its case against the law. Instead of continuing to argue that the mandate and other closely related provisions should fall, the Trump administration endorsed most of the position taken by Texas and other states that the whole fall should fall.

NIC ROBERTSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMATIC EDITOR: Yes, there is a reason for it. Quite simply, Angela Merkel has chosen to hold this summit in an environment, in a location that can be surrounded by protesters. It's not, as we see, some summits on a remote hilltop that the whole village or the town around it is secure. And there will be protesters here. There were protesters last night. The police had to turn a water cannon on about 1,000 of them. They just sort of rained in on them. Didn't wash them off the streets. There was a women's protest just down beside here a little while ago.
One thing's for sure, every candidate on the debate stage tonight would make a far better president than Donald Trump, who is more concerned with promoting his own interests above the country's. But it's still unclear which of them is poised to be the Democratic nominee. After seven debates, the primary race is predictably split along ideological lines with progressives pushing for deep structural change and moderates preaching pragmatism.
it's really a matter of whether you can effectively lead. And when you have somebody, especially at this very sensitive time for the office of lieutenant governor, when you have somebody facing multiple credible accusations, I just don't see how he can continue to serve.
I will ask a prominent Trump supporter what he thinks next.

The Post also reported that a Bloomberg spokesman said in 2001 that 'some of the things he might have said' and Bloomberg apologized to 'anyone that was offended by' the comments.
He painted a vision of a prosperous unified American utopia, pulsating with racial harmony and common national purpose, leaning heavily on the strong economy and the lowest unemployment rate in 50 years.
The President has said repeatedly that he would roll out a new health care plan that would protect those with pre-existing conditions, but he has yet to do so. Last April, he backed away from pushing for a vote on a replacement plan until after the 2020 election.

Rush Limbaugh is one of the most divisive Americans in recent history. Full stop. Earlier recipients, according to the White House, included Steven Spielberg, Muhammad Ali, Angela Merkel, Nancy Reagan, Mother Teresa, Billy Graham, Rosa Parks and Martin Luther King, Jr.
Short says he's seen a lot of change in the past 18 moths he's worked at the White House but one of the biggest changes he's seen in the relationship between Trump and Republicans on Capitol Hill involves Twitter.
And looking ahead to the next major election to come – the presidential nominating contests – the Democrats who are among the top contenders for their party's presidential nomination are generally viewed more favorably than unfavorably by their partisans. But outside of the very top tier of candidates, many potential presidential hopefuls are widely unknown.
Whether it's unfair Chinese trade practices, the North American Free Trade Agreement he's dubbed a disaster or Iran's destabilizing actions, Trump has kept up much of his bold campaign rhetoric.
CARY: I was advised on Friday afternoon of the connection between Lillian and I, and the batch and lot number of the recalled FDA steroid. On Saturday afternoon I had a spinal tap. Those tests were sent out. I still haven't received any information regarding them.
Go ahead, bail out the airlines if they need it. Give a hand to the industries that suffer the harshest blow. Offer low-interest credit to small businesses, to restaurants, dry cleaners, landscaping companies.

A second Holocaust survivor who is here tonight, Joshua Kaufman, was a prisoner at Dachau Concentration Camp.

Trump's actions include the discontinuation of federal support of a key Obamacare subsidy, the reduction of advertising and assistance for Obamacare's open enrollment season and the proposed expansion of short-term insurance policies. The Congressional Budget Office does not consider consumers with such policies to be insured.

As he does at his rallies, Trump has mixed boasts about his own performance with cries that he has been mistreated.
Until Monday, some 20 cases were in a suspended state, delayed but with no signal from the justices of whether they would resolve them before the court's usual end-of-June recess. The justices said they will hear a designated 10 cases in the first two weeks of May and the rest of the cases in early fall. It is not known whether that latter group, which could be aired in the courtroom, would be livestreamed.

On Thursday night, Warren continued on that path, questioning how any candidate -- including Senator Sanders -- plans to execute on their vision without blowing up the Senate filibuster. Later on, she suggested that Sanders would have trouble bringing together Democratic factions and other voters outside the party to defeat Trump in November.
Trump's efforts have prompted grumbles – private and public – from Republican lawmakers mindful of the uphill battle Trump is setting them up for.

But sexual harassment and child molestation accusations are also an issue here and what we're asking is you're someone who has power to vote to remove someone from the Senate, if he is elected, and we're just asking you, would you do that?
In March of last year, Trump tweeted that he had ordered the withdrawal of additional large scale sanctions he claimed the Treasury Department had announced earlier that day. But his announcement sent White House officials scrambling. Many aides quickly concluded that the President was referring to sanctions targeting two Chinese shipping companies that have allegedly helped North Korea skirt sanctions imposed by the United Nations. Those new actions were fulfilled under existing sanctions authority. But two sources familiar with Trump's tweet said it was in fact not about those sanctions, but instead about additional large-scale sanctions targeting North Korea that had been in the works.
The President has the support of millions of veterans in the United States. I don't think those veterans are in love with the fact that he's attacking John McCain, he said.
CUOMO: Well, if you don't want to answer the question, it suggests that yes, it was him who told you not to do it, because otherwise, you'd say, no, it wasn't him, because it clarifies it.
The Trump administration had offered the Freedom Caucus a repeal of Obamacare's essential health benefits, regulatory changes that would mean insurers no longer would have to include benefits such as maternity care or mental health coverage in their plans. But the caucus rejected the olive branch, arguing that it alone would not be enough to drive down premiums.
Those buying association health plans could see their premiums drop $9,700 a year compared to the individual market and $2,900 a year versus the small business exchanges. That's largely because the plans will offer less generous benefits and have healthier enrollees, according to Avalere.

Si Trump hubiera hecho lo que tantos de los medios de comunicación esperaban que hiciera y se llegara al poder prometiendo unidad, compasión y piruletas, habría sido una traición a su base.
TAPPER: Meanwhile, the government is just five days away from another potential government shutdown. Democrats have previously vowed not to give the president any money for any wall but there's this group of bipartisan lawmakers working on a compromise that according to sources could include up to $2 billion if not more for border barriers. Whatever you want to call them. A wall, border barriers.
Not surprisingly, the uninsured age 18 to 64 are most likely to say they'd be better off, at 43%. But 37% of this group don't think it would have much of an effect, while 19% thought it would leave them worse off.
The former aide also speculated about why only a few Republicans have criticized Trump's comments, saying that it's likely because they don't want to get in the Twitter crosshairs.
More recently, as president-elect, Trump reiterated his support for the idea in January.
In addition, 420,000 employees are deemed essential and are working without pay. That includes 41,000 federal law enforcement and correctional officers. And tens of thousands of Customs and Border Protection agents and customs officers.
It is impossible to keep track of his overstatements. The economy is the best it's ever been? The US has had the largest military in the world for decades. The borders are secure? Then why is there a national emergency to build a wall there?
TAPPER: And then there is that master work, the president might feel like he can't escape the gaze of the Mueller Lisa.
But what this still highlights, you have to keep in mind is the fact that in today's world, ethnic cleansing does still happen, and the world can't come up with an acceptable way to intervene, at least often until after the fact, although the State Department pushed back and said, it's not as if governments were just standing by. They said there's been a lot of effort by a lot of different countries. And on the U.S.'s part, that effort continues -- John and Poppy.
Donald Trump has portrayed himself now consistently as fighting for the working people. And he has a record of sticking it to working people for 35 years.

Trump said twice that unemployment rate is the lowest in in over 51 years. On another occasion, he said, We have the best unemployment numbers we've ever had. So that's very important.
As it stands now, the Trump administration position fully backs the lawsuit filed by a group of Republican states seeking to invalidate the entire Affordable Care Act.

So the tax credit adjusts more tax credit for the person's age, and obviously, if you have a bigger family you have more health care costs, so a bigger tax credit.
Facts First: The unemployment rate for Americans with disabilities is lower than at any point in the Obama administration, but it did go up from 6.1 percent in September of last year to 7 percent in December. In addition, describing this as an all-time low obscures the fact that the government has only tracked this data since 2008.
But then they very definitively make clear that Michael Cohen was directed by Trump to commit these crimes, crimes by the way that Cohen pled guilty for. He was charged and pled guilty for. And they also have citations in there that make it clear that the probation department, a totally separate arm of the government, also came to the same conclusion.
A decade later, as he's running for the Democratic presidential nomination, Bloomberg has fully embraced Obamacare and supports a Medicare-like public option that builds on the same health care law he once spoke out against.
Not only did we have that in the law, we reasserted it in the law. And we also want parental advisers in the local school district so that, in fact, you know, frankly, education has to be run at the school board level with a little guidance from the state.

Facts First: That's not quite true. The President was citing the 12-month change in the consumer price index for prescription drugs for December 2018, when it dropped 0.6%. That was the largest (but not the first) decrease since April 1973, not in 51 years. At last year's State of the Union he said drug prices experienced their single largest decline in 46 years.

Facts First: We usually don't fact check promises, but this one has already proved untrue. The Trump administration and congressional Republicans have repeatedly put forward bills and filed lawsuits that would : We usually don't fact check promises, but this one has already proved untrue. The Trump administration and congressional Republicans have repeatedly put forward bills and filed lawsuits that would weaken Obamacare's protections for people with pre-existing conditions. Trump is currently supporting a Republican lawsuit that is seeking to declare all of Obamacare void. He has not issued a plan to reinstate the law's protections for people with pre-existing conditions if the suit succeeds.
The most revealing false claim: The flu mortality rate
And that is one of the biggest tools we believe can be used to replace Obamacare. This is part of replacing Obamacare with a system that works to give everybody universal access to affordable coverage.
While the $1,400 stimulus payments could hit people's bank accounts within days of Biden signing the bill, the extension of federal unemployment benefits as well as the enhanced child tax credit and more generous Affordable Care Act subsidies may take a few weeks -- or even a few months -- to arrive. The exact timing would depend on when federal departments can write the guidelines and how long it takes them and state agencies to then implement the new provisions.
Facts First: We give Trump wide latitude to express opinions about public figures, but there is no evidence Comey was dirty. The December : We give Trump wide latitude to express opinions about public figures, but there is no evidence Comey was dirty. The December report from Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz presented no evidence that Comey was corrupt in any way. Horowitz found significant errors in FBI work connected to the Russia investigation, and rejected Comey's claim of vindication, but he did not make any finding accusing Comey of deliberate malfeasance.

We're having millions of extra people join. We are going to beat the Democrats. We are going to beat Hillary or whoever it may be. And we're going to beat them soundly.
TRUMP: Yes. The answer to that is yes. I would, I would not do. I mean look I'm very political and I've been political. But, I would absolutely not pay another business person. I will have many, many business people, I mean, some of the great, you know, Carl Icahn endorsed me. Many of them endorsed me, the best ones. But we'll going to have them in terms of play. COOPER: For vice president, you would want somebody with Congressional experience
However, if Trump dropped the administration's defense, it would end the reimbursements to insurers. That would wreak havoc in the individual market. Many insurers depend on these cost-sharing payments -- without them, they might leave the market, which could lead to fewer choices and higher premiums for consumers. Such a move would be at odds with the orderly transition Pence stressed as important to the incoming president.
Warren has cast herself repeatedly as a unity candidate, which will make it a tougher task, but she has shown a willingness in recent days to hit out hard at some of her rivals.

In many ways the logic behind allowing this bill to go through in ballooning the deficit is very similar to the idea of let's just support Donald Trump even though we don't necessarily agree with him or like him, but we will get behind him. The reason being is they see him in the vehicle to get something done. They are now at the water's edge on this tax cut. They are going to get it through. Politically, heading into next year, the tax cut doesn't necessarily generate enthusiasm. It is going to generate enthusiasm with liberals, who will try to lose it going into November.
SEN. KIRSTEN GILLIBRAND (D), NEW YORK: The truth is if we changed who is at the decision-making table, we would change everything.
Meanwhile, President Trump is targeting high prices for prescription drugs and wants hospitals and insurers to disclose the rates they negotiate with each other for various procedures and medical services. While he said we will never let socialism destroy American healthcare at his State of The Union address Tuesday, investors have reason to be concerned if he is re-elected.
In response to Trump's tweets, Meghan McCain tweeted that No one will ever love you the way they loved my father, adding that the President should be spending time with his own family instead of obsessing over mine.
Running to follow Obama -- Clinton came right after Obama. She pushed an inevitability vibe and only really faced Sanders. She was set up to be the first woman president following the first black president. Biden, who was older and had already run for president twice, deferred to her. But she struggled against Sanders and, despite promising apocalypse if Trump won, lost to him too.
CLARIFICATION: An earlier version of this story oversimplified what Republicans did to the individual mandate in 2017. They effectively eliminated it by reducing the penalty for not having insurance to zero.
Enacting the legislation would decrease deficits by $473 billion over the next decade, however this doesn't take into account the cost of a replacement plan.
Governor Greg Abbott today held a press conference in Houston on the importance of election integrity legislation this session. The Governor named election integrity as an emergency legislative item during his State of the State address in February. Governor Abbott was joined for the press conference by Senator Paul Bettencourt and Representative Briscoe Cain, who have both filed several pieces of legislation to enhance election integrity in Texas

Washington (CNN) The Democratic National Committee, in cooperation with the Biden White House, will kick off a sweeping effort to sell the newly signed Covid-19 relief package to a politically divided American people on Friday, releasing a new national ad bragging about the bill along with a detailed guide on how Democrats across the country should tout the legislation.
He took a gamble and got it wrong, the adviser said. He analyzed the data and opinions of experts and sided with the one that said warm weather will likely slow the virus.
If there is going to be peace and legislation, there cannot be war and investigation. It just doesn't work that way!
The Senate GOP plan would certainly break Trump's promise to lay off Medicaid. It makes make deep cuts to the program, ending its expansion under Obamacare and capping future payments.
Passengers are still turning away from the airline after its fatal accident in April.
Burr also argued that Becerra undervalues the input of the private sector and has called for policies that would undo decades of investment in American biomedical research.
That someone, Trump promised, would be him.
Back when my parents came to America looking for that dream, they found it right here in Cleveland. They brought me here as a 1-year- old and this is where I became an American.
But then again, I suspect, talking about foreign policy, a solid jobs plan, college costs are not topics that come up during locker room banter, where apparently Trump does his best talking, bragging about groping women and encouraging sex assault. So while Trump may have looked more poised than what we saw in his bombastic behavior during the first debate, he did little to appeal to voters outside of his diehard followers, for whom he can do no wrong. And he'll need more than them to win.
Trump previously slammed his chief presidential rival as a total liar as Cruz and his allies have claimed that Trump favors government-run, universal health care.
Vindman testified that there were some words missing from the rough transcript of the call, and that his requests to add these words to the document were unsuccessful. But Vindman also emphasized that the document was still substantively correct, that there was nothing nefarious about the words being left out, and that the omissions were not that big a deal.
Like the others here, this plan, which would create an independent, non-government organization to handle air traffic control work, has been grounded – repeatedly. Trump offered something similar in his last budget and in a separate pitch last year. But it's never taken off, mostly because of bipartisan security and cost concerns.

Among the top priorities will likely be saving the law itself from being declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court. The justices are currently considering a case brought of a coalition of Republican state attorneys general -- and backed by the Trump administration. It revolves around Congress reducing the penalty for not having health insurance to zero several years ago, which the states argue rendered the individual mandate unconstitutional and the entire law invalid
I think it's going to stretch out for some period of time. And I also think that a really important recent development and we've talked about it a little before. But the more I think about it, the more I focus on how angry Judge Sullivan was. And I think he was not just angry at Michael Flynn. I think he was also angry at Robert Mueller.

Most of the questions on Monday will come from New Hampshire voters, an electorate which prizes its position as the first-in-the-nation primary and is often known for asking discerning and pointed questions.
Asked what advice he has for people who have lost their jobs or are afraid they would the next day, Trump said, Well, what they do right now is keep receiving their paycheck, and hopefully their companies are going to be in a very strong position. If people do lose their jobs, he added, We have unemployment, we have checks, we have a lot of things happening, a lot of very positive things.
Ginsburg made clear she is opposed to the Trump administration's attempt to weaken the mandate and provide an exemption for more employers.

DeSantis announced during the press conference that a COVID-19 antibodies test will be available. The test can show if a person has had the virus in the past without showing symptoms, and therefore may be immune to it. The test will be available to first responders and health care workers first, with the goal of being able to expand testing to the general public. (Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)
KING: They showed up to take his place. Edina, Minnesota, there.
There are several reasons why the Biden administration may not have announced a boost in funding for navigators, who also help clients enroll in Medicaid if they qualify. First, Congress has not confirmed Biden's pick for Health and Human Services secretary, Xavier Becerra , and the President has yet to name an administrator for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which runs the federal exchange.
Now, once you open them the government, you know, that taken cared of then we can begin to go back. And I would argue this is going to back to negotiation because the original negotiation was we accepted a $70 billion lower number and by doing that, Speaker Boehner had promised as Dana Bash reported to pass a clean resolution that was months ago. But when he couldn't pass it then he went in a different direction.
ROMANS: All right. Let's get a check CNN Business this morning.

The former mayor has maintained a focus on Sanders in the day leading up to the debate, hoping that an intense back-and-forth between the two will further cement them as the race's frontrunners. He has questioned Sanders' commitment to a clean campaign, pointing to the hard attacks the senator's supporters online level against his opponents.

And if that happens, many of these people will die, Sanders said.

In front of factory workers at the Ohio plant on Wednesday, Trump dedicated a considerable amount of time in his speech to disparaging McCain.
Trump is eager to be front and center in next year's races and has told White House advisers that he wants to keep a robust schedule. The midterms will undoubtedly be viewed as a referendum on Trump, meaning that as the President campaigns for others, he will also be looking to boost his own standing.
FORMER REP. CHARLIE DENT (R), PENNSYLVANIA: Yes. It's almost inexplicable that he would make a comment like that. It's certainly indefensible. I mean, the shutdown affects everybody negatively. There's nothing good about it.
TAPPER: The Affordable Care Act, yes.
Written off by many (including Bloomberg, whose campaign is arguing it's a two-man race between the former mayor and Sanders) after a fourth-place finish in Iowa and a fifth-place showing in New Hampshire, Biden is on more comfortable territory in a state with a much larger share of non-white voters.
MARQUARDT: All right. Well, the Affordable Care Act was, as we mentioned, one President Obama's biggest achievement while in office. This latest ruling threatens to wipe away the protection for people with pre-existing conditions, as you just heard from Ariane
TAPPER: I guess the argument he's -- he's making here is, he deserves due process, like anyone else deserves due process.
Back then, negative campaigning between Howard Dean and Dick Gephardt aided the rapid ascent of John Kerry and John Edwards in the final weeks before the 2004 caucuses. In contrast, a multilateral non-aggression pact was evident in Des Moines on Tuesday night.

Several insurers have reported their first profits in their Obamacare businesses. Highmark Health in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, announced earlier this week that its Affordable Care Act division generated income for the first time in 2017, calling it a substantial turnaround.
By leaving out the House, the court indicated it won't hear directly from the body that passed the law. It's a point most likely not lost on House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, but she released a statement praising the court's decision.
But there are countries that are poor that we will -- we don't want anything from them. We want to help them. There are some horrible things going on in the world. We want to help those people. We don't want money from them. We're not looking for that. But when you have massively wealthy countries that could easily pay us the full amount and they also take advantage of us on trade so when I speak up, I mean, that's why I got elected. Issues like that. Issues like the border. And it would be so easy not to do anything. When they say I'm not popular in Europe, I shouldn't be popular in Europe. If I was popular in Europe, I wouldn't be doing my job because I want Europe to pay. Germany pays 1 percent. They should be paying 4 percent. They're paying 1 percent. They should be paying even more than that. Other countries pay a small percentage of what they should be paying. So, when I say I'm sorry, folks, you have to pay up, I shouldn't be

You write that diversity is the country's superpower. What do you mean?
McConnell has undoubtedly been an ally, pushing through three Supreme Court justices for the President, remaking the courts and orchestrating a massive tax overhaul. Lawmakers gave Trump money for a wall. They waited out every impulse, tried hard not to see bombastic tweets, and now, if members aren't with the President on overturning the election, they are being ridiculed and attacked by him as if they never walked the line for him in the past.
False, dubious or questionable medical claims
A July memo from CMS discouraged the directors of state agencies that survey nursing homes from issuing daily fines for violations that began before an inspection, favoring one-time fines instead. Daily fines remain the recommended approach for major violations discovered during an inspection.

But in comments made months after Obamacare was passed in April 2010, Bloomberg said the bill would do absolutely nothing to fix the big health care problems and also called the program a disgrace. He added it was another program that's going to cost a lot more money.
(END VIDEO CLIP) LEMON: And it looks like those federal workers will be without paychecks for quite a while. Both the House and the Senate reconvened for just moments today, and then they adjourned until next week. So that means no progress, nothing is getting done.

Open enrollment ended Jan. 31, and the administration has cracked down on who can sign up for coverage the rest of this year after insurers complained that consumers were enrolling only after they got sick. Traditionally, only those with a major life event -- such as job loss, marriage, divorce or the birth of a child --- can obtain insurance after open enrollment ends.
The President did not repeat that reference, which has become a familiar refrain in his stump speech, on Friday evening.
The public is against Trump on immigration, but he maintains support among Republicans, according to a new CNN's poll released Monday. Trump learned in 2016 that immigration is a top issue for Republicans. Getting them to the polls will be key if they want to keep majorities in the House or Senate.

James Lipton, 'Inside the Actors Studio' host, has died at 93
Some within Trump's circle are advising the former President to focus on 2022 and winning majorities of the House and Senate, which are both now controlled by Democrats. However, Trump and those who have pushed his anti-establishment agenda are instead considering a message without undertones of Republican Party unity that takes aim at Trump's intra-party critics, the source said.
However, while Buttigieg's proposal doesn't set caps on consumers' out-of-pocket spending, it would reduce what they have to pay for medical care in two ways. He would tie those premium subsidies to gold policies, which typically have lower deductibles and co-pays than the silver plans that Obamacare premium subsidies are based on now.

Without Sinema, the Senate cannot pass the relief bill, even using the budget process that allows them to pass it with just 51 votes.
Facts First: Biden's campaign Biden's campaign announced in early April that he supports Trump's travel restrictions on China. But neither Biden nor his campaign apologized for any previous criticism of Trump. The campaign says that Biden's comments Trump has described as criticism of the China restrictions -- in which Biden said Trump has a record of hysterical xenophobia and fear mongering -- were not about the travel restrictions.
But Bannon's political compass has some Republicans worried. Many say his backing of Moore – even after multiple women accused the judge of sexual impropriety when they were in their teens and Moore was in his 30s – shows a hubris that needs to be checked. And they worry that Trump, who listens to Bannon, could be backed into bad decisions because of the former White House aide's confidence.
Trump claimed three times that he had a 95% approval rating among Republicans. On two occasions, he said this was a record; on one of these two occasions, he said Ronald Reagan was in second place at 87%.

And one that Democrats will only suffer more for backing down from. Capitulation here will only compound the damage done and sow more doubt over whether the party can be trusted to defend its most fundamental, core principles.
As a third-party candidate for Vermont governor in 1976, Sanders scoffed at the idea the type of socialism he supported was similar to authoritarianism in China, Cuba, and Russia.
Facts First: Trump was exaggerating when he said seven years is like record time. Mary Neumayr, chairwoman of the Trump administration's Council on Environmental Quality, said at the same event that it takes over seven years on average for federal agencies to complete the environmental impact statement process for highway projects. She added that many projects have taken a decade or more -- but over seven years is, again, an average, not record time.
COOPER: All right. Manu Raju, thanks, Manu. Well, joining me now, CNN Senior Legal Analyst Jeffrey Toobin, with me again, CNN Political Director David Chalian and CNN Chief Political Analyst Gloria Borger. Jeff, I mean, you know the court probably better than anybody. I loved your book The Nine. is this a political trial balloon to see how the Senate reacts or do you think the White House is seriously considering Governor Sandoval?
It wasn't about the policy, the official told CNN. It didn't matter what policy we made because they (the Freedom Caucus) didn't want a deal. We were captives in an internal House caucus fight. The Freedom Caucus had too much interest in killing this to send a message to Speaker Ryan: 'You have too much power.'
Trump cited new, high poll numbers and suggested independent-minded voters are leaving the Democratic party in swarms.
These are unrelated stories, obviously, but they share what's become a truism of White House – which is that Trump likes to take credit for things he hasn't quite accomplished. The details will come later.
Only 8% think the Senate should pass the legislation as is, according to a new poll from the Kaiser Family Foundation.
Betsy McCaughey is a public policy expert and former New York lieutenant governor. She is a vocal opponent of President Obama's health care plan and author of the book Beating Obamacare.
This anecdote, from a book set for release next week by former Trump White House aide Cliff Sims and first reported in The Washington Post, is illustrative of both of those facts:
One specific thing Trump has been clear on, however, is Medicaid. He has been consistent in voicing his opposition to any cuts to the program, which helps to provide coverage to low-income Americans. On the campaign trail, he often touted his promise to not touch Medicaid.
It would send the states a fixed amount of money per Medicaid enrollee, known as a per-capita cap. States could also opt to receive federal Medicaid funding as a block grant for the adults and children in their program. Under a block grant, states would get a fixed amount of federal funding each year, regardless of how many participants are in the program.
Or I watch Schumer ... If you say, how great is the deal with China, oh, I don't like it, I don't like it. He said, 'He took away tariffs.' Well, I didn't take away the tariffs. They're paying 25 percent of $250 billion. They pay us a tariff of 25 percent on $250 billion. But he was screaming, he took away the tariffs. You know, he didn't want the tariffs. And then, all of a sudden, when he thinks they were taken away -- but we didn't take them away. Just the opposite. -- March 4 interview with Fox News' Sean Hannity
States could also opt to receive federal Medicaid funding as a block grant for the adults and children in their program. Under a block grant, states would get a fixed amount of federal funding each year, regardless of how many participants are in the program.
Sims recounts one time when (Paul) Ryan was in the Oval Office explaining the ins and outs of the Republican health-care bill to the president. As Ryan droned on for 15 minutes, Trump sipped on a glass of Diet Coke, peered out at the Rose Garden, stared aimlessly at the walls and, finally, walked out.
Sen. Rand Paul claimed the President-elect supports the Kentucky Republican's calls to approve an Obamacare replacement on the same day Congress repeals the health care law.
We must choose between greatness or gridlock, results or resistance, vision or vengeance, incredible progress or pointless destruction.
But the top House Democrat didn't mince words when it came to Vermont Senator Sanders' health care proposal, dismissing the notion of a single-payer health care plan, curtly saying, That's not going to happen.
Now, it's time for the politics lead.

«Un extenso grupo de actores de Hollywood y medios de Washington se están consolando los unos a los otros en un salón de hotel en la capital de nuestro país en estos momentos», dijo Trump ante la multitud. «Se han reunido para la cena de corresponsales de la Casa Blanca –sin el presidente. Y yo no podría estar más emocionado que estando a 100 millas de distancia del pantano de Washington, pasando la noche con todos ustedes y con una multitud más grande y con mucho mejores personas».
He has not upgraded American infrastructure or revived a coal industry still beset by economic and environmental pressures that drive down demand. Manufacturing -- the object of his pledge to end the carnage afflicting blue-collar workers -- has fallen into recession.
In front of factory workers at the Ohio plant on Wednesday, Trump dedicated a considerable amount of time in his speech to disparaging McCain.
This is the time to re-ignite the American imagination. This is the time to search for the tallest summit, and set our sights on the brightest star. This is the time to rekindle the bonds of love and loyalty and memory that link us together as citizens, as neighbors, as patriots.
He's very committed to repealing and replacing it. Mr. Trump has been very up-front about what some of those particulars are, she said. And we also know that you have popular provisions like coverage for pre-existing conditions. We also know there are Americans relying upon it now.
We may also need to see the evidence behind that report. There may be, for example, evidence of collusion or conspiracy that is clear and convincing, but not proof beyond a reasonable doubt.
Three days before Indiana's critical primary, Ted Cruz's campaign on Saturday released two ads linking Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, saying they're two sides of the same coin.

Sen. Amy Klobuchar will take to the national stage on Monday headlining a CNN town hall in New Hampshire to make her most public case yet for why she should be the next President of the United States.
For lawyers, justices, and the public, the hour-long public sessions are an important but not crucial part of the decision-making process. Lawyers put their most comprehensive arguments in written briefs. But the oral arguments allow lawyers to address tough questions about their cases and give the justices themselves an opportunity to telegraph their views and begin persuading each other.
At her event in Goffstown, Klobuchar pitching herself as a candidate who can win independent and lean Republican voters. She pledged to go everywhere, not just where it is comfortable, but where it is uncomfortable and outlined a platform that included overturning Citizens United, reinstating the Voting Rights Act, rejoining the Paris Climate Accord and getting on the path toward a public option for health care.

Facts First: Ukraine's president and foreign minister have made comments that bolster Trump's argument that he did not pressure Ukraine to investigate his opponents in order to receive US military aid -- but the foreign minister has never called the phone call perfect or complained that Trump's opponents were trying to impeach him over a perfect call, and the president has not said that Trump did nothing wrong.

Short-term plans are allowed to exclude those with pre-existing conditions and can base rates on an applicant's medical history. They don't have to offer comprehensive coverage and they can impose annual or lifetime limits on benefits, meaning they may only pay out a set amount -- often $1 million or less -- leaving the policyholder on the hook for the rest. Also, they don't have to cap the amount consumers have to pay in deductibles and co-pays every year.

The exact counter to that is in Texas, a state cut off from the federal government to avoid being regulated, to avoid the kinds of safeguards that would have stopped the power outages, a state government that was totally absent from prevention to mitigation and taking care of its people. That was a very clear example of drained pool politics, of anti-government sentiment being put into policies that hurt everyone. It cost lives.
And let me begin by wishing you a beautiful -- look, do you remember this? Do you remember they were trying to take 'Christmas' out of Christmas? Do you remember? They didn't want to let you say 'Merry Christmas.' You would go around, you'd see department stores that have everything -- red, snow, beautiful ribbons, bows. Everything was there, but they wouldn't say 'Merry Christmas.' They're all saying 'Merry Christmas' again. You remember? I went through that, during the campaign: 'They going to say Merry Christmas again.' And they are. -- December 21 speech to Turning Point USA Student Action Summit
Ultimately, this second debate, which featured no opening handshake between two candidates who apparently despise one another, illustrated more than just the polarizing nature of contemporary American politics.
VOIGHT: After a long career accomplishing much of what others said couldn't be done, Donald Trump has set his sights on a new rebuilding project.
This is about jockeying for position while they try sort of internally to figure out in the Democratic and Republican side what it is they will or won't do. Publicly they have been stuck on the same position for a couple of weeks at this point, and I think it's pretty clear it will kind of, this whole conversation, is going to flow into the debt ceiling.
ACOSTA: And strong conservatives for the Supreme Court.
BASH: If 2018 was the campaign year of the woman, 2019 is the year women take the lead.

Klobuchar has admitted that she can be too tough on her staff in response to the stories.
President Donald Trump's attacks on the late Sen. John McCain are stupid and socially unnatural, Anthony Scaramucci said Thursday.
He doesn't like attacks on the image of the Trump family, on the integrity of his children, Trump biographer and CNN contributor Michael D'Antonio said. At the end of the day, he's really concerned about his image, himself and how he is being portrayed.
Majorities of the Democratic electorate are unsure, however, about Cory Booker (53%), Kamala Harris (55%) and Deval Patrick (84%). Among those who do have an opinion about each of them, the reviews are largely positive.

Sanders has, in public, repeatedly said that there is no room in the political revolution for abuse and harassment online, but that is unlikely to quiet the issue. And at a CNN town hall Tuesday night, Sanders put a finer point on it : I do not believe in online bullying. End of discussion
This is about affordability and choice, Charlene Maher, Blue Cross' CEO, said Wednesday, when announcing the new plans. The current marketplace is not affordable for middle-class families.
All the while, a growing number Republican members of Congress have been publicly pushing back on Trump's comments, defending McCain.
Cindy and Meghan McCain spoke out Wednesday against President Donald Trump's remarks at the Conservative Political Action Conference last week, calling his remarks about Sen. John McCain incredibly hurtful.
JONES: Yeah. So in some point everybody gave the score to like get over the fact the man has been elected twice.
President Donald Trump complained Wednesday that he didn't receive a thank you for approving the funeral the late Sen. John McCain wanted, marking his latest grievance in his recent onslaught against the Arizona Republican.
Buttigieg's operation began pushing out Spanish-language digital ads in December, as well as Spanish-language radio ads, which were also narrated by the former mayor. It opened it's East Las Vegas office in mid-September, conducting caucus trainings in Spanish, and providing Spanish-language canvassing tools to their volunteers—including their relational organizing tool that allows a volunteer to contact their own contacts on behalf of Buttigieg.
Simply put, walls work and walls save lives. So let's work together, compromise, and reach a deal that will truly make America safe.

At her event in Goffstown, Klobuchar pitching herself as a candidate who can win independent and lean Republican voters. She pledged to go everywhere, not just where it is comfortable, but where it is uncomfortable and outlined a platform that included overturning Citizens United, reinstating the Voting Rights Act, rejoining the Paris Climate Accord and getting on the path toward a public option for health care.
And I think that shows, if you're from an older generation, you care about the world that you're leaving. If you're from my generation, you're thinking about the world that we're going to continue living into.

What's concerning in all of this is how Trump treated another prominent leader within his own party. The utter disrespect of simply walking away when someone is talking – and turning on a TV in another room – is colossal. That the vice president of the United States had to be called on to convince Trump to come back into the room and talk to Ryan is startling stuff. (Nota bene: Yes, Ryan had been very wary of Trump as a candidate and had distanced himself from Trump in the wake of the release of the Access Hollywood tape. But still…)
[06:10:07] There are massive trees. This is an island of rain forests. Massive trees, washed down the rivers and banged up against bridges. There is no power. There is no running water. Very little aid has gotten in so far. You mentioned the isolated villages. There are many of these villages, hillside villages all around this island. We flew around the island a day or so ago before we could actually land. And those places have all been decimated, as well.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell says it will make health insurance more affordable, strengthen Medicaid and stabilize the market. But critics disagree. Here's a rundown on who gets hurt and who gets helped by the Senate health care bill.
COOPER: So, what was your initial reaction? I mean, obviously the horror of it all, but what went through your mind?
Klobuchar, at different points throughout the debate, turned to her left to take on Buttigieg with a fire that she hadn't previously shown on the debate stage. She accused the former mayor of calling her dumb and suggested that his entire candidacy was based on him memorizing a bunch of talking points.
COOPER: So listening to the sisters, you say -- they are very informed about what their sister was going through.
The Kasich campaign and his super PAC, New Day for America, stepped up their attacks against Trump, releasing a TV spot last month mocking Trump's days peddling a name-brand steak line.

Unified opposition, it turns out, doesn't require unified thought or tactics.
In response to Trump's tweets, Meghan McCain tweeted that No one will ever love you the way they loved my father, adding that the President should be spending time with his own family instead of obsessing over mine.
But when you want to get money for a wall that most of the people in the Democrat Party wanted five years ago -- they just didn't like it when I announced that we were going to build it -- they were unable to get it built. They had the money, but they were unable to get it built because it takes talent to build things, and they don't have that talent. But we got it built. -- February 14 speech to National Border Patrol Council members
I am running because I see that sense of community is getting fractured, Klobuchar said on Sunday in Iowa. It's getting fractured by someone in the White House who gets up every morning and tweets whatever he wants but doesn't respect the amendment that allows him to do it.
TRUMP: No, I can't do that. I can't do that. We have to put it out there in a very unified way. They all relate to each other. I don't know if you saw the picture where I have almost a thousand.

It's called the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program, and its days could be numbered. The Washington Post reported last week that the Department of Education is planning to eliminate the program.
Perhaps Elizabeth Warren pulled back from her attack on Sanders because when she attacked Buttigieg in the last debate she gained nothing; in fact she stalled. In fact, Joe Biden had perhaps his best moment when, after noting that Donald Trump is viciously attacking my surviving son, he said it was his job to not only fight but also heal. Beautiful.
The Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit was passed in 2003 and has helped beneficiaries of the program get access to medicines at lower cost, which, in turn, has driven down the use of other (often costlier) health care services.

Indiana's effort to continue its Medicaid expansion demonstrates how states that expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act — even Republican-controlled ones — are counting on additional federal dollars to pay for those expansions. It also reflects deadline pressure: They can't wait for Congress to finish its debate over the future of the health law because they need to set budgets and programs now for next year.

The Quinnipiac poll at which he was at 93% had an overall margin of error of plus or minus 2.5 percentage points, and a larger margin of error for the smaller sub-sample of Republican voters, so that poll found that it's possible Trump's true number is indeed 95% -- but it's not accurate to make leaps from the numbers the polls actually found without explaining that this is what you are doing.

The justices have often expressed concerns that listeners would get the wrong impression from arguments, for example, if they play devil's advocate in their questions or focus on a relatively minor issue for clarity. Some justices try not to tip their hand or, perhaps, are truly uncertain about which side they favor before the case is put to a vote in their private meetings.

The largest share of the fleet is 26--30 years old. The average age for fighter and attack planes was 26.4 years, for bombers 42.0 years, for tankers 53.7 years.
This latest Trump administration action is part of a slew of recent health care policies that our government is using to wage culture wars rather than treat health care as a vital service we all need.
If you want to talk about somebody who's actually been tough on Russia, look at President Trump. He wants more fracking, more coal, more energy, a stronger military, a stronger defense. Those things aren't good for Russia.

The Senate approved the final plan overnight on Wednesday, and the House's revote is expected to pass around noon Wednesday. The passage of the legislation that would overhaul the current tax system is considered as a major Republican victory for President Donald Trump's first year in office, following the failure to repeal and replace Obamacare earlier in the year.

That is more important in the US than in any other developed country, because the US has a mind-boggling number of uninsured people. Since Trump came to office, the numbers have been climbing as he tries to dismantle the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare. Millions lost coverage in 2018, bringing the number of uninsured to 27.5 million, according to the US Census. (The administration is still in court trying to end Obamacare.)
In 2018, the Trump administration doubled down , lengthening the time short-term insurance could be offered from the previously allowed three months to a year and flooding the market with cheaper alternatives; these plans limit coverage such as for incidences of cancer only or have strict requirements before coverage kicks in like the plan Azcue has.
Trump didn't seem possible in 2016 -- Both the Clinton and Trump campaigns thought leading up to Election Day that she would win. She warned that it was her or the apocalypse.
Among the cases heard in earlier arguments during this 2019-2020 term and still awaiting resolution involve whether federal law protects LGBTQ workers from discrimination, whether Louisiana abortion regulations infringe a woman's constitutional right to end a pregnancy, and whether the Trump administration's plan to deport certain undocumented immigrants who came to the US as children can proceed.

There could be no greater contrast to the beautiful image of a mother holding her infant child than the chilling displays our Nation saw in recent days. Lawmakers in New York cheered with delight upon the passage of legislation that would allow a baby to be ripped from the mother's womb moments before birth. These are living, feeling, beautiful babies who will never get the chance to share their love and dreams with the world. And then, we had the case of the Governor of Virginia where he basically stated he would execute a baby after birth.
However, one analysis shows that after rising sharply in 2018, US greenhouse gas emissions reversed course and dropped an estimated 2.1% in 2019. But that drop is largely due to drops in coal power generation -- an industry the Trump administration has attempted to revive.
And while Bloomberg got the worst of it, Warren spent the whole night on offense.
Ultimately, however, half a million fewer Americans signed up for Obamacare coverage for 2017 by the end of the enrollment period on Jan. 31. (Consumers are not actually enrolled until they pay their first month's premium.)
To have a reasonable shot at being able to pull that amount from savings year after year without too high a risk of running out of money too soon, you'll likely need a savings stash somewhere in the neighborhood of 30 to 35 times the annual income you wish to withdraw, or in this example a nest egg of roughly $1.5 million to $1.8 million.

The bill would also kill the additional help that individuals earning less than roughly $30,000 a year receive to cover their out-of-pocket costs. More than half of the enrollees on the Obamacare exchanges receive these cost-sharing subsidies.

They pointed to Alabama's Constitution, which they say state lawmakers relied on to abolish Birmingham's wage increase. The Constitution is explicitly racist. It calls for separate schools for white and colored children, and it still has references to poll taxes, which were used to prevent blacks from voting in the Jim Crow era. A referendum was held in 2012 to remove the language, but voters rejected it.
Age composition of Saturday's turnout will also be a factor. Sanders has a huge edge among younger voters, while Biden does better among older ones.

Facts First: There is no apparent basis for Trump's claim that it now takes just two years to get environmental approvals for highways. According to the Federal Highway Administration's National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) page, the department's median environmental impact statement completion time was 47 months in 2018, up from 46 months in 2017 and 44 months in 2016.

The Senate bill would make sweeping cuts to Medicaid, get rid of the individual mandate, and eliminate Obamacare's taxes on the wealthy and insurers. It would also prevent federal funds from reimbursing Planned Parenthood for any health services it provides.
That means, in this Supreme Court fight, unified opposition will be essential – even if it falls short of being successful. It means leadership, starting with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York, need to do everything in their power to deny Trump and the GOP their way.
Additionally, a spate of negative headlines about Klobuchar's demanding management style have trickled out around her 2020 announcement.
Facts First: Trump was vague, but it is obviously false that Bolton would know nothing about the dealings with Ukraine that led to Trump's impeachment.

In a speech Monday, he pitched his experience as a prosecutor and governor to New Hampshire voters, and argued that challenging times call for someone who has been held responsible and accountable for their decisions, not someone who just changes the next vote if the last one didn't work out. The address was a not-so-subtle dig at congressional rivals such as Rubio who, as Cruz is all too eager to remind people, changed his position on immigration reform.

Sanders envisions a four-year transition period. Children under 19 would get universal coverage one year after the bill is signed into law. Everyone else would have the option of keeping their current coverage during the transition or of buying into Medicare or a transitional public plan. Four years to transition from a mostly private system to an entirely public one would be a quick pace. Automatic enrollment is also a departure from the current Medicare system. There would be no precedent for administering this kind of federal program in the US.

Offer two tax cuts for the wealthy.

The White House is now scrambling to patch over the most glaring gaps, including with a new plan to use stimulus funds to cover hospital expenses for uninsured coronavirus patients . But efforts along those lines to ease the pain of the current crisis, like the promise of free Covid-19 testing, have so far largely ignored the failures and inequities that made them necessary in the first place.
Second, as both a Democrat and a progressive, I was saddened to see the friction between Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren.

Bottom line: Democratic unity is fragile here. It's just a symptom of the numbers and the reality of a 50-50 Senate. It's not just Republicans who have intra-party squabbles about the direction of their party. Democrats are going to wrestle with that too. It's what we are seeing with the nomination of Neera Tanden to be director of the Office of Management and Budget. It's what we are seeing with the minimum wage . It's going to continue to be a dynamic as we move toward infrastructure and immigration. The differences for Democrats is their disagreements don't center around following one leader at all costs, but the party has an energetic base too and they have to balance it with the fact that if they want to keep controlling the Senate, they have to win in states that are rural and filled with voters who might lean more conservative than those in New York or LA.
Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar put in solid performances, but both were more effective at articulating the case against Trump than in sealing the deal for themselves. Buttigieg once again showed himself to be a dynamic speaker with a keen intellect and a compelling story. Klobuchar is a shrewd, smart and likable politician. But both were arguing for incremental rather than structural changes, at a time when many Democrats are fed up with the status quo. Their cases seemed to be no match for what Klobuchar dismissed as other candidates' grand ideological (schemes) that will never see the light of day.

But in the last peek at the mayor's tax returns in 2013, the Journal described those disclosures as highly-redacted, and reported that the documents never quite offered a full view of Bloomberg's wealth. For example, the mayor's accountants often used a code letter to represent a range of dollar amounts rather than listing an actual figure, the Journal reported.

Legislative battles over abortion led to several government shutdowns in the fall and winter of 1977. The Senate wanted to loosen the restrictions on Medicaid funds being used for abortion – which were only in cases where the mother's life was at stake – to also include cases of rape or incest. The House was opposed to this. The two sides couldn't come up with a compromise by the end of the fiscal year that September, so there was a funding gap. A temporary spending bill was passed to give the House and Senate time to work out their differences, and this cycle would repeat itself until a deal was struck in December 1977 allowing Medicaid funds to be used in abortions, including in cases of rape, incest and when the mother's health was at risk.
Tax reform will be a heavy lift for many reasons. For starters, there are still big disagreements within the Republican party itself as to how low tax rates should be and whether it's even necessary to pay for tax cuts.

None of Bloomberg's criticism of the bill at the time, however, appeared to cite its lack of a public option for health care.
The results of the poll suggest a midterm environment that is looking a lot like 2006, when Democrats took control of the House amid widespread voter dissatisfaction with Republican president George W. Bush and his handling of the war in Iraq. In 2010, backlash to President Barack Obama and the passage of Obamacare led to the organization of the ideological Tea Party movement, which boosted Republicans back into control of the House. In September of 2006, CNN polling also found Democrats with a 10-point lead over Republicans on the generic ballot.

He's also patient and willing to doing the plodding groundwork needed for legislative victories, like the ones he's trying to set up this summer when he canceled the August recess, a step he believes will give voters reasons to keep Republicans in control of the Senate. They include clearing a backlog of nominations and passing several lower-profile bills that McConnell says are evidence of good governing.
MARQUARDT: And the judge did say that because the individual mandate is unconstitutional, the whole law is as well. That mandate as we know is what they called as central and inseverable, as you were just discussing, from the remainder of Obamacare. So do you agree?
Of course, members of the caucus weren't the only Republicans opposed to the health care bill. A collection of moderates including Rep. Charlie Dent of Pennsylvania and powerful House Appropriations Chairman Rodney Frelinghuysen, of New Jersey, had also come out against the bill.

This isn't the first presidential budget proposal to crash headlong into unaccommodating political realities.

Here are a few controversial issues that got a mention in the budget.

But agreeing to get something passed and sorting out the details are two distinct steps. The complications will only intensify in the weeks ahead. Once the budget passes, multiple committees in the House and Senate will begin writing legislation that will force Democrats to make tough decisions about where they want to go as a party -- not just on spending, but on issues like raising the minimum wage. While many Democrats support a provision like raising the minimum wage to $15 in isolation, cramming it through using the budget reconciliation process has raised concern.

We are running the bad health care (system) much better than it was ever run and we're making it better, but it could be much better than it is, Trump said of Obamacare, though his administration has yet to release a replacement plan. And so what we want to do is terminate it.

The President felt burned by the Freedom Caucus's rejection of the compromise, a White House official said.
This is New Hampshire, anything could happen, she said when asked about the town hall at an event earlier in the day.
There is not a lot of time to waste, Sebelius said of Biden's relief push. He is wise to put it forward early, to say, 'I want bipartisan support,' and then to do anything he can to get whatever he can passed as quickly as possible, because people are really hurting.

Facts First: Trump had it backward: The Apprentice performed best in the ratings in its first season, then steadily declined. Trump has a : Trump had it backward: The Apprentice performed best in the ratings in its first season, then steadily declined. Trump has a long history of making the false claim that The Apprentice was the top-rated show on TV. (When he made this claim about Celebrity Apprentice at an event with television critics in January 2015, he was mocked by the critics on Twitter and greeted with laughter in the room -- eventually claiming , when challenged, that he had merely heard it was number one.)
It could cover millions of people who are self-employed, said Tim Jost, an emeritus health law professor at Washington and Lee University School of Law.
SCARAMUCCI: So, being Italian, I would actually hug you but I'm in- between you and this camera.
He also blamed McCain for wars in the Middle East.
But a solid jobs report might also make the Fed more likely to step up its pace of rate hikes. And Wall Street would not like that.
The Consumer Price Index has limitations as a way to measure what is really happening with drug prices; it does not capture rebates paid by drug manufacturers. Other sources of data have shown an increase both years.
The President, they said, wants to telegraph to his political base that he is standing firm on his promise to repeal the entire law despite failing to wrangle Republicans to do just that during a drawn out legislative battle in 2017, when the party held both chambers of Congress. And he is now pinning his hopes on the courts accomplishing what he and a Republican majority in the House and Senate could not.
SANTIAGO (on camera): It's difficult, but at least they're alive. She believes if they're alive it means it can be a new start.
Except it didn't destroy Trump. For all the hand-wringing and predictions of doom for his campaign, he just kept right on going – first to the Republican presidential nomination and then to the White House. For many of his supporters, Trump's broadsides against McCain were music to their ears – finally someone was standing up to the political establishment in Washington! Trump wasn't afraid of slaughtering a sacred cow – or all the sacred cows! He didn't care! And they loved it.
Trump found it possible to dig a trillion-dollar hole in the budget for a tax cut during good times. That was elective, unnecessary. This is urgent, indispensable.
CRUZ: Yes, I would. And you know, I think this exchange actually highlights a real choice for Republican primary voters. When it comes to foreign policy, do you want to continue on the same basic trajectory as the last seven years of the Obama foreign policy? When it comes to these deals, Cuba and Iran, they were negotiated by Hillary Clinton and John Kerry.
I had a really nice conversation with him and Melania and I really was under the impression this sort of fight between our families and between him and my father, especially at this particular moment would end. I understand the argument is he's talking about policy, and that's the attack, but it's still particularly hurtful, especially after I've had this conversation with him on the phone, to have this moment of booing at CPAC … at this particular moment in time is incredibly hurtful and I feel, quite frankly, very naïve to have believed that this would be any different, she said.
It's also possible that the incoming administration might not yet have specific executive actions in mind, especially since GOP lawmakers remain very divided about what a replacement plan will look like.
The highly visible venue of the impeachment trial will challenge Roberts, whose work across the street from the Capitol at the marble-columned court proceeds in a camera-free zone , mainly in closed chambers.
There are now more billionaires than black people in the Democratic primary. There are more plutocrats than people of color. The most diverse field ever has been winnowed down -- and not in the way any of us hoped.

28 million people would be uninsured under Obamacare in 2026.
But our proposals for health care, tax and regulatory reform, strengthening security and generating upward mobility will only become reality if someone in the White House signs our legislation. That is the fulcrum on which we sit. We simply cannot afford another four years of sputtering zero to 2% economic growth. That is the consequence if A Better Way is not enacted into law. Hillary Clinton's status quo, big-government policies will only lead to more debt, doubt and decline.

Top Donald Trump aide Kellyanne Conway – who is set to become a senior White House adviser – wouldn't commit to a time line for replacing Obamacare, despite a claim by a top Republican senator about Trump's position.
He boasted of building over 100 miles of a long, tall and very powerful wall on the US-Mexico border. Yet most of that construction is in replacing dilapidated barriers with an enhanced wall system.

Klobuchar's primary pitch to voters is likely to be electability. The Democrat has been notably successful in Minnesota, winning her three terms in the Senate by an average of 26 percentage points. Klobuchar won re-election in 2018 with 60% of the vote, two years after Trump came within two points of defeating Hillary Clinton in the state.
Trump would have at least a slightly better case if he spoke of 2013, just shy of seven years ago, when Democrats supported a comprehensive immigration reform bill that included 700 miles of border fencing. But that was fencing, not the giant wall Trump has proposed -- and many Democrats supported it only as part of a package that included provisions they wanted, most notably a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants.
CUOMO: He called the plan mean. He said is lacked heart and that you needed to take care of people. He said in his pre presidential life that he believed that everybody needed to be covered by health care.
CUOMO: What about the ones that aren't audited. This seems like an easy answer for you.
McConnell, who is 76, has been determined and willing to take tough steps to achieve his political and legislative goals. He did that when he boldly blocked Merrick Garland, President Barack Obama's choice for the Supreme Court, and worked to install Trump's pick Neil Gorsuch instead.

It has also emerged as a purity test for Democratic 2020 candidates as they look to navigate an energized party base, with Sen. Amy Klobuchar urging caution as Sen. Bernie Sanders and others embrace the idea.
The Trump administration had offered the Freedom Caucus a repeal of Obamacare's essential health benefits, regulatory changes that would mean insurers no longer would have to include benefits such as maternity care or mental health coverage in their plans. But the caucus rejected the olive branch, arguing that it alone would not be enough to drive down premiums.

Now, we have seen at least five Trump associates indicted for just that, lying to investigators. Do you think McCabe should be prosecuting -- prosecuted for doing the same thing?
CUOMO: There just seems to be a disconnect between the urgency that the president has in any particular plan. You analogize him to a football coach. I would suggest where are the x's and o's. The president doesn't have his own plan or what he seems to want. We do know that costs are a problem. We do know that the rate of increase of those costs is less since the ACA. So we get what the problems are. We get that there is a need for fixes. But we don't get what the plan is to fix them. And now we have the president saying act, act, act, but with no direction on what to do.
The heart of the Affordable Care Act dispute dates back to 2012 when Chief Justice John Roberts stunned conservatives by upholding the law under Congress' taxing power , even though that justification for the law had hardly came up during oral arguments. At the time, Paul Clement, who had served as solicitor general for former President George W. Bush, was in private practice representing 26 states opposed to the law. Clement's side lost.
We're taking people from the Democrat Party. We're taking people as independents, and they're all coming out and the whole world is talking about it. It's very exciting. I think, frankly, the Republican establishment, or whatever you want to call it, should embrace what's happening.

Many of them will find that the safety net is fraying or nonexistent -- in large part due to the actions, over a decade, of Republican officials. Some 14 states, all with either Republican governors or GOP-controlled state legislatures, have yet to take advantage of the Affordable Care Act provision expanding Medicaid to low-income adults, though at least two were reconsidering that stance prior to the pandemic.

Just 51% of Republicans said the same thing. Independents were in the middle of these two groups, at 61%.

Linking a minimum wage battle in Birmingham to water hoses and attack dogs may seem far-fetched, almost obscene.

The initial goal of the campaign was to desegregate downtown stores for black shoppers and persuade merchants to hire black sales clerks.
Trump claimed the next day that he had not meant the virus was under control -- that he had meant we are doing a very good job within the confines of what we're dealing with. But he had repeatedly made clear on previous occasions that he was talking about the virus when he spoke of control. He said in late January, soon after the US announced its first confirmed case, that we have it totally under control. He said in late February, when the number of confirmed US cases was in the low dozens, that we have it very much under control in this country.

Trump's body language was especially revealing tonight. He fidgeted. He paced the stage. At times he lurked behind Clinton, giving off a creepy stalker vibe. And, just like the last debate, he seemed stricken with a case of the sniffles. These were all distractions on top of his rambling answers. Consider that he answered a question from a Muslim woman about Islamophobia by apparently encouraging racial profiling of Muslim Americans. Or that he may have conceded that he did not pay federal income taxes for years.
What we need to do is fix that by adding more competition, she said.

We have to grow our way out of this problem and create and generate revenue back in the federal Treasury.
Our ability to withstand these losses is dependent on our achieving anticipated synergies in the Humana acquisition, he wrote. Our analysis to date makes clear that if the deal were challenged and/or blocked we would need to take immediate actions to mitigate public exchange and ACA small group losses.
It's unclear what a strong debate performance can accomplish at this point. It might be that concerns about electability are so strong that they will give Biden the victory, or that Sanders' grassroots support is so strong that Warren can't undercut his strength.
The health care provisions of the Covid relief bill would help Americans who don't currently qualify for subsidies -- now limited to those with incomes below 400% of poverty -- buy coverage from Affordable Care Act marketplaces and make such coverage free for unemployed and lower-income workers. The 12 states that have not yet expanded Medicaid under Obamacare would receive robust new financial incentives to do so.

We gather here to mourn the passing of American greatness, the real thing, not cheap rhetoric from men who will never come near the sacrifice he gave so willingly, nor the opportunistic appropriation of those who live lives of comfort and privilege while he suffered and served, McCain said at the time.
Over the weekend, Trump revived his long-running feud against McCain – who died in August after a long battle with brain cancer – citing his ties to the controversial Russia dossier and his vote against repealing Obamacare. He said in the Oval Office on Tuesday that he was never a fan of John McCain and I never will be and complained on Wednesday that he wasn't thanked for giving McCain the kind of funeral that he wanted.
Let me move on to something else while I have you, Anthony.
For years, McConnell has managed to keep his conference together through fights over the Supreme Court, a tax overhaul and even the passage of some of the largest stimulus packages in the country's history. He's legendary for his ability to use arcane Senate procedures to realize his political ambitions. The failure to repeal and replace Obamacare one of the only true defeats McConnell has suffered in his Senate tenure.
The first step would be to pass a budget bill through committee to essentially unlock the process. Once that was finished, the Senate Democrats could rework Biden's bill so it fit into a very specific framework of what is allowed under the process. Reconciliation requires that anything passed has a real impact on the budget and not just an incidental one. The process also requires that proposals have no impact on social security and that the impacts on the budget do not stretch beyond a 10-year window if the changes are permanent. Because the process requires jumping through so many hoops and consultation with the Senate's parliamentarian, committee staff have been working for weeks now to make sure they understand and are ready for the process in case it has to be used.
CUOMO: By suggesting you need to do it the right way and make it better for people? If that's being an establishmentarian I think it's the right place to be.

Women (69%) and non-whites (70%) are more apt than men or whites to consider a demographically-representative Congress deeply important. Democrats (82%) say it's more important than Republicans (44%). Democrats are also more likely than Republicans to say it's important for Congress to represent the nation's political makeup in terms of partisanship and ideology (76% among Democrats to 55% among Republicans). The economic makeup of Congress is also important to Democrats, who say Congress should represent the country in terms of income and education (78% among Democrats to 59% among Republicans).
No, because almost as depressing was Trump's repeated unwillingness to actually answer the questions that were posed to him. How would Trump ensure that pre-existing conditions are still covered by health insurance without some sort of universal coverage mandate? We don't know, he didn't answer.

Executive actions are more informal and broad. They could be defined as any action that is typically relating to policy matters that the president or his subordinates in the executive branch, Super said.
Donald Trump was referring to the White House's Pledge to America's Workers initiative, in which Ivanka Trump has sought to get companies to commit to providing education and training opportunities for workers. As of February 21, 2020, companies had promised to create 15.7 million opportunities,including one million by Walmart alone -- but many of these opportunities are internal training programs, not new jobs. Also, as CNN has previously reported , many of the companies had already planned these opportunities before Ivanka Trump launched the initiative.

Story highlights CNN's Reality Check team spent the night putting the GOP candidates' statements and assertions to the test The team of reporters, researchers and editors across CNN selected key statements and rated them: True; Mostly True; True, but Misleading; False; or It's Complicated
We can't be sure why Republicans are now significantly less willing to get the vaccine, but remember Democrats have pretty much always said they were more concerned about Covid-19 than Republicans. It wasn't until mid-November, just after Trump's defeat in the presidential election, that the partisan gap began to really emerge in the Axios/Ipsos polling on vaccines. The bottom line is that there's still a lot of work to be done on vaccine hesitancy. Lives literally depend on it.

Yes, and I'm here because of the amazing magic elixir that happened between the DNA of a thousand civilizations from the levant and the beauty and the wonder and the opportunity of America that puts all of us here in this rapture of the American dream for me to be here tonight to talk about my friend, my partner and the future president of the United States, Donald Trump.
Residents of the 36 states that enroll through the federal exchange, healthcare.gov, will see the larger subsidies when they go to the site starting April 1. States that run their own exchanges are aiming for a similar time line, but their implementation dates could vary, according to a senior administration official.
You are like St. Paul, hard pressed on every side but not crushed. Perplexed but not in despair. Persecuted but not abandoned, struck down but not destroyed. Because in Brett Kavanaugh's America we will not surrender while you wage war on our work or our cause or our hope or our dream.

People can generally apply online or over the phone through their state Medicaid agencies at any time, and most states can determine eligibility within 24 hours, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. Medicaid provides comprehensive coverage with no or very low premiums and out-of-pocket costs, though it typically has a more limited network of doctors who accept it.
The Republican candidates, they're out, spread out across the state today. They're jockeying for every vote possible. Ted Cruz and Donald Trump have events, by the way, scheduled later this hour.
Governor Greg Abbott today held a press conference in Houston on the importance of election integrity legislation this session. The Governor named election integrity as an emergency legislative item during his State of the State address in February. Governor Abbott was joined for the press conference by Senator Paul Bettencourt and Representative Briscoe Cain, who have both filed several pieces of legislation to enhance election integrity in Texas
Story highlights When a presidency is anchored so fundamentally on an image, any deterioration of that image can be especially perilous For Trump, the mockery is likely to be especially painful
MURPHY: Well, these are very serious allegations, when you're talking about sexual assault and rape.
TUCHMAN: Brenzovich never voted for a Democrat for president. And that string will continue this year. Illegal immigration issue he says has a lot to do with it.
The former aide also speculated about why only a few Republicans have criticized Trump's comments, saying that it's likely because they don't want to get in the Twitter crosshairs.

SCARAMUCCI: And also my fellow American Democrats who would have the courage to cross the line. That's another thing that happens here in Washington, nobody crossing the line anymore.
Facts First: Trump's math was wrong: the $130 billion current increase in military spending by non-US NATO members (over 2016 levels) cannot be added to the $400 billion increase expected by 2024; the $400 billion figure includes the $130 billion.

COOPER: Valarie, do you have any idea why she may have driven down to D.C.? I mean, there are all sorts of, you know, reports that she had been having emotional problems, that authorities, according to some authorities, there were drugs for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder and for depression found in her house. Does this make any sense to you?
TRUMP: Look, I'm prepared -- I think the people of the country think I'm right. Again, I could have done nothing. Could I have a lot easier presidency by doing nothing. But I'm here, I want to do it right. And I'm not only talking here, I'm talking about middle east problems and other problems and North Korea problems.
DINAN: Senator Rubio in late 2014, Disney laid off 250 tech workers in Orlando, replacing many of them with foreign workers. Some of the Americans even had to train their own replacements. You support increasing the H-1B visa program that made it possible to bring in these foreign workers. Doesn't this program take jobs away from Americans?
It's a question of judicial modesty, Gorsuch added.
But I'll tell you, Chuck Grassley -- he's looking at Comey: 'Well, you tell me, what did you say?' Now, he wasn't being rough. That was just the way he talked. And that was when Comey -- I think that was when Comey announced that he was leaking, lying, and everything else, right? He choked because he never heard anybody talk like that. -- February 6 speech on Senate impeachment acquittal
CONWAY: No, well, look, President Romney is not a liar. He is not going to go on national TV and talk in a debate and lie about his own health care plan. He got that part wrong according to his senior adviser, which I am not --
This is our moment to set a new course for an America as strong and confident as we have ever been. Let's stand united as Republicans. Let's stop Hillary Clinton. Let's get to work. Expand our Republican majorities and let's elect Donald Trump president.
It is possible that the health spending numbers were different in 2019 than they were in 2018 and in years prior, but that data is not yet available.
Whether we are Republican, Democrat, or Independent, surely we must all agree that every human life is a sacred gift from God!
Facts First: Trump's claim about protecting those with pre-existing conditions is false. Though Trump says he would do this, his administration has consistently taken steps to undermine the Affordable Care Act — including joining a lawsuit aimed at striking down the law — without presenting alternative plans that would offer similar benefits.
LEMON: Yeah. She had an immeasurable impact on comedy. What do you feel her legacy is in the comedy world and in the world in general?
The existence of the second whistleblower -- who never planned to file a separate whistleblower complaint -- was revealed after Trump released the rough transcript of his call with Zelensky, not before.
Trump's 200 million figure for the present Muslim population is about right.
On Monday, the super PAC backing Cruz released a new spot to paint Rubio, who has been dogged by questions about his Senate attendance record, as unserious. Using footage from a lighthearted video Rubio made, in which he jokingly confuses fantasy football players with presidential candidates of the same name, the attack ad lists various threats against America before cutting to video of Rubio discussing fantasy football. The ad is set to run in Iowa for two weeks and is intended to blunt any potential last-minute surge by Rubio ahead of the caucuses.
Klobuchar has admitted that she can be too tough on her staff in response to the stories.
Si llegamos a la destitución, probablemente será por algo que Trump dijo o porque simplemente no pudo contenerse. Aunque no lleguemos a esa catástrofe constitucional, Trump se arriesga a ser presidente por un solo periodo y a echar a perder su oportunidad de implementar su proyecto.
A week of health care moves
For the first time in its nearly 50-year history, CPAC will be held outside of the Washington, DC, area in Orlando. Florida has emerged not just as a reliable red state but is the home to Trump and two other important conservative figures: DeSantis and Scott, both of whom will have high-profile speaking roles on the conference's main stage.
CASSIDY: Can I respond to that?
Haroon Moghul: The real message of the night
Lipinski won by just 2 points in 2018 by mobilizing the Chicago political machine, which first helped his father, and then him, come to Congress. But that machine isn't what it used to be. Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot, the city's first black female chief executive, backed Newman.
And before that health care vote, the President called McCain an American hero in a tweet.
Since Congress can't get its act together on HealthCare, I will be using the power of the pen to give great HealthCare to many people - FAST — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 10, 2017
PACE: Right. BASH: They do see this as just yet another move by the Republican establishment, Paul Ryan leading the charge, to not listen to what conservatives really want.
With that, I yield back the balance of my time.
Without health insurance for as many Americans as possible, it will be difficult to contain the pandemic.
SANTORUM: But the big difference here is what the president did on DACA, President Obama, and what he did on the Obamacare. Both were counter to what the Congress wanted, just like what this president is doing. But he had absolutely no authority to do so, none.
He declined to condemn Putin or his government over their role in foreign election interference and spreading misinformation, hacking federal agencies, the poisoning of dissidents, and the reported bounties on the heads of US troops in Afghanistan.
For many of these voters, Trump's relentless attempts to dismantle Obamacare and destroy the entire legacy of the first black president -- Barack Obama -- has been an unending nightmare. The unyielding assault and systematic attack on other prominent African American leaders, like Congresswoman Maxine Waters, and the dismantling of safety net programs like the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program for seniors made removing Trump from office a pivotal issue for many black voters.
Sanders prometió un impuesto a la especulación en Wall Street, con lo que, dice, financiará sus proyectos. «Juntos vamos a crear una economía que funcione para todos, no solo para el 1% de arriba».

Why is Paul Manafort talking to people in the White House as recently as this year? But that's not the only thing we learned about the Mueller investigation today.
Here's a look back at how some of the most notable promises Trump made during his campaigns and throughout his time in office stack up against reality.
Additionally, Trump's nominee to lead the Securities and Exchange Commission -- Jay Clayton -- is having a confirmation hearing before the Senate banking committee at 9:30 a.m. He's expected to be pressed on his extensive links to Wall Street and quizzed about his ties to troubled companies like Volkswagen (VLKAF) and Valeant (VRX).
Two GOP senators – Bill Cassidy of Louisiana and Rand Paul of Kentucky – went to the White House on Monday to try to continue negotiations. Cassidy was asked later if he would like to see additional votes on the issue before the Senate recesses in the next few days. He said that decision was entirely up to McConnell, and that getting one of the three no senators to change his or her mind would be a tough task.
QUESTION: Is first strike off the table with North Korea?
Facts First: Trump did not pull out of Syria; regardless of why he has kept some troops there, they are there. While he did withdraw US troops from the northeastern region in advance of a Turkish offensive in that region, he has kept hundreds of troops in the country.
Facts First: There is no apparent basis for Trump's claim that it now takes just two years to get environmental approvals for highways. According to the Federal Highway Administration's National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) : There is no apparent basis for Trump's claim that it now takes just two years to get environmental approvals for highways. According to the Federal Highway Administration's National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) page , the department's median environmental impact statement completion time was 47 months in 2018, up from 46 months in 2017 and 44 months in 2016.

Democrats maintain a wide lead over Republicans in the race for control of the House of Representatives, a new CNN Poll conducted by SSRS finds, including a 10-point lead among those most likely to turn out this November.
However, if the devastation is not as severe, then we can restore it quickly. But our warning, you know, when we came in eight months ago to this administration was that we had a very weak energy grid here in Puerto Rico, and we needed to restore it. So of course, that takes time. But now, certainly, with the help of FEMA and working together, we're going to have to not only restore it but make sure we mitigate future impact so that we can restore energy quicker.
The legislation Biden described will, under the Senate's current rules, require at least 10 Republican votes and a unified Democratic caucus to pass. If that fails, the White House and Senate Democrats are poised to pivot to a process called budget reconciliation, which would allow for a pared-down package to pass with a simple majority. To get the full package without GOP support, Senate Democrats would likely have to go nuclear and change or end the legislative filibuster, a move that former President Barack Obama endorsed last year.
COOPER: Pamela, thanks very much. We'll be right back.
For some of the pending March and April cases, there appeared more urgency. One dispute, relevant to the upcoming presidential election, tests whether states may fine or remove Electoral College delegates who refuse to cast their ballots for candidates to whom they were pledged. That will be heard in May.
No force in history has done more to advance the human condition than American freedom. In recent years we have made remarkable progress in the fight against HIV and AIDS. Scientific breakthroughs have brought a once-distant dream within reach. My budget will ask Democrats and Republicans to make the needed commitment to eliminate the HIV epidemic in the United States within 10 years. Together, we will defeat AIDS in America.
Trump's remark about the funeral came as the President has continued to denigrate the dead senator's legacy.
Facts First: The US economy remains much bigger than China's economy in terms of total output, but China has continued to close the gap even though its own growth has slowed. In other words, it's not true the US is only now so far ahead because of growth during Trump's time in office. In fact, the US lead has continued to shrink under Trump.
MA plans are able to achieve higher satisfaction and better outcomes for an equal or lower cost because they better manage care and effectively negotiate costs for everything from doctors and hospitals to prescription medicines. The cost-effectiveness of MA plans also has positive, spill-over effects on traditional Medicare. A recent study in the journal Health Affairs found that the greater the penetration of Medicare Advantage in a particular market, the lower the costs for traditional Medicare patients there.
The bill would repeal Obamacare's individual mandate, drastically cut back federal support of Medicaid, and eliminate Obamacare's taxes on the wealthy, insurers and others – which would be one promise kept.
TRUMP: Well, that's fine. First of all, Ted was in favor of amnesty. So there's no question about that. And Sheriff Joe Arpaio recently endorsed me and there's nobody tougher on the borders than Sheriff Joe. And Jeff Sessions, one of the most respected Senator in Washington, an incredible man, also endorsed me.
now essentially an unindicted coconspirator in not one, but two felonies, there was the obvious reference to the ways in which Michael Cohen is cooperating, which suggests that a lot more is to come. And I think that anybody that thinks Director Mueller is near the completion of his task, probably isn't reading between the lines of the sentencing memos. I think there's a lot more to come. I think there are more indictments and I think there are more bombshells.
If you guys know anything, you know that Donald Trump is a winner and he's not going to do something for the purpose of not coming out on top and not coming out as a winner, she said. That's one of the most ridiculous things.
Social Security plays a major role in many Americans' retirement plans.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Who's going to bear the brunt of the responsibility if indeed there is a shutdown of our government?
President Trump kicked off his Wildwood, New Jersey, rally tonight with an optimistic economic message, but quickly moved on to hit Democrats.
She started fundraising earlier -- she'd raised $1.7 million by the end of the pre-primary reporting period, compared with about $1 million at that point two years ago. That's more than Lipinski, who had raised $1.25 million by the end of this year's pre-primary reporting period.
She cited the CDC's latest Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report -- which showed that around 60% of high school and middle school students are reliably masked. This has to be universal, Walensky said, in addition to practicing 6 feet of distancing and other mitigation measures.
While a federal judge, Amy Berman Jackson, did revoke Manafort's bail and send him to jail in 2018 after he tried to tamper with witnesses (he later pleaded guilty), she didn't dictate where he would be incarcerated or what kind of cell he would be held in. A US marshal, and not the court, made the decision about where he should be placed, she explained in court in 2019.
On the other hand, you've seen trade deals like in Mexico that have been less than promising in some aspects, better in others. Bottom line is I believe that America, if given access to foreign markets, our workers are the most productive in the world, our people are the most innovative on this planet. If it is a free and fair trade deal, we can compete against anyone in the world, and we need to in the 21st century.

Trump: Heidi the best thing Cruz has got going for him
The court had options. It could have taken up the case this term, and put the issue to rest by the end of June. It could have allowed the case to continue for months or maybe even years in the lower courts, delaying Supreme Court action until next year or beyond.
ACOSTA: Trump is also warning a new ad, warning that D.C. establishment is out to get him. And he's making the case Republicans should consider how he's expanding the party and get on board.
Facts First: It is a popular belief that Ford invented the assembly line, but it is not correct. While Ford was the : It is a popular belief that Ford invented the assembly line, but it is not correct. While Ford was the first to use a moving assembly line for the production of an automobile, Ransom Eli Olds was the first to use an auto assembly line of any kind; he used one to build his Oldsmobile Curved Dash cars at the beginning of the 1900s. (Olds' production also happened in Michigan.)
As might be expected, people are stocking up on hand sanitizer, toilet paper and other products they might need if they have to self-quarantine. The result in many places: the shelves are empty. If you can find it, choose sanitizer that has at least 60% alcohol, wrote Ford Vox, a doctor.
Biden faced a huge field -- Yes, he was the early frontrunner, but Biden also faced scrutiny from many more sources. More than 20 Democrats were in the presidential race at one point and Biden, despite not winning in either Iowa or New Hampshire, survived to romp in South Carolina and then on Super Tuesday. The party coalesced around him instead of making a binary choice between Clinton and Sanders.
TAPPER: Hello. I'm Jake Tapper in Washington, where the state of our union is focused on 2020. Democrats are hitting the campaign trail across the country this
MORGAN: Tell me this, I spoke to a very eminent doctor, a very famous eminent doctor in America only yesterday about this who didn't want to speak about this publicly, he didn't want to inspire any kind of party's own reaction, but he said that all the doctors that he knows believe that ObamaCare broadly speaking and there are definite fault lines with the current program but ObamaCare they genuinely welcomed it, they felt that it will be a force for good in America.
The new rules have been instituted gradually throughout the year.
MORGAN: Dana, for now, thank you very much indeed. We'll go back now to Senator Casey. Senator Casey, you heard all that and honestly we're all watching. I think with a vague sense of real depression it's like, Come on, let's get this done.

Washington (CNN) The Trump administration doesn't want the Supreme Court to act quickly on a case that could determine the future of the Affordable Care Act, the Justice Department said in a court filing Friday.
And finally, we are doing something to put America in the lead. We are doing something historic to develop our own energy resources. Some people have been working here since I've been in the second grade on this project.
We got news last week regarding the future of the Affordable Care Act, just how strong the gig economy is, how much your Social Security could be cut and why airlines might be hiking their ticket prices.
COOPER: So you were actually standing between one of the people who was hitting the guy with the -- with his helmet and the man on the floor, the driver.
Some party leaders are worried that Sanders and his democratic socialism is too extreme to win a general election. But depriving him of the nomination could convince his legions of liberal voters to stay home in November.
So they got the money. In fact they got it very early. -- January 22 interview with CNBC's Joe Kernen
Facts First: Mexico has deployed around 27,000 troops, but Trump exaggerated how many are being stationed near the US border in particular; Mexico's defense minister : Mexico has deployed around 27,000 troops, but Trump exaggerated how many are being stationed near the US border in particular; Mexico's defense minister said in October that it was about 15,000 on the US border, about 12,000 on Mexico's own southern border.
We shouldn't have the warfighters have their arms tied behind their back as President Obama wanted to do, but they had a chance to show support and it wasn't popular at the time, Bush said.

Mary Christensen, 60, would rather go back to the days before Obamacare, when they paid $557 a month for coverage that fit their needs. They rarely go to the doctor and bristle at the idea that they have to buy a policy that covers pediatric dental benefits, even though their daughters are grown.
In Wisconsin, Republicans are conducting an extraordinary session to limit the power of incoming Democratic Governor Tony Evers and Attorney General Josh Kaul.

This was just a little story but it was a big story to me because I said oh, here we go, we make a deal, then get sued for a tremendous amount of money for reparations. So I want to do something, but it's got to be done intelligently. We have to make good deal.
MORGAN: America, this is the land of opportunity your shutting down program like this because politicians just squabbling.
To be sure, the solicitor general's office, comprised of political and career lawyers, prides itself in representing long-term institutional interests of the United States, not the political whim of a particular president. As such, its interest in the stability of the law and its own credibility before the justices is paramount and a change of position based on a new administration has been institutionally considered a rare move. But Trump may have pushed that norm.
BERMAN: Now CNN has been following this crisis. Nearly 1 million Rohingya Muslims have fled Myanmar and they're finding they have nowhere to go.
Now, McConnell has other things on his plate. The Senate needs to pass a defense bill, raise the debt ceiling and fund the government.
African-American poverty has declined to the lowest rate ever recorded.
The most bizarre presidential debate in history featured Trump, a candidate rejected by many of his own party's leaders, threatening to appoint a special prosecutor to reopen the FBI investigation into her emails. Clinton countered that she was grateful a man like Trump was not president. Because you'd be in jail, Trump shot back, in a line that served as red meat to his core base of supporters.
One of the problems we have is we don't really have a consumer dynamic in health care. People don't always care what things cost or how good care's going to be, because they don't get that information. We actually immunize or block the ability for people to actually see what things cost in health care, or to act like a consumer.
SEN. CORY BOOKER (D-NJ), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Lead with love.
Keeping annual and lifetime limits. Prior to Obamacare, many insurers in the individual market had caps on how much they'd cover each year or over an enrollee's lifetime. Some would not pay anything after an enrollee's care costs more than $500,000 or $1 million. Obamacare banned those limits.
He said people would be able to buy plans from many, many competitors, which he implied would drive down prices.

Senator Bernard Sanders asks questions to Betsy DeVos during her confirmation hearing for Secretary of Education before the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee on Capitol Hill January 17, 2017 in Washington, DC.
In 2016, Trump called for enacting a five-year ban on all executive branch officials lobbying the government for five years after they leave government service. Within his first week, Trump signed the Ethics Commitments by Executive Branch Appointees executive order. While on the surface that may have seemed like a promise kept, the order contained a loophole. The order only required appointees to pledge that they will not engage in lobbying activities with respect to the executive agency they were appointed to serve, language which could theoretically have permitted officials to lobby on other issues not directly related to their role less than five years after they stopped working for the federal government. Additionally, days before his presidency came to an end, Trump revoked the rule, ostensibly allowing his former administration officials to begin lobbying when they left government if they so choose.
The Trump administration is about to start letting states require many Medicaid recipients to work for their benefits.
We are also joined tonight by Matthew Charles from Tennessee. In 1996, at age 30, Matthew was sentenced to 35 years for selling drugs and related offenses. Over the next two decades, he completed more than 30 Bible studies, became a law clerk, and mentored fellow inmates. Now, Matthew is the very first person to be released from prison under the First Step Act. Matthew, on behalf of all Americans: welcome home.

Republicans will strongly protect patients with pre-existing conditions. -- December 18 campaign rally in Battle Creek, Michigan
But the sheen had been taken off and the voters were exposed to the fact that the man they saw in omnipresent ads may not be the same as the one who took the debate stage.
Do you think Carson is tough enough on that?
To defend the dignity of every person, I am asking the Congress to pass legislation to prohibit the late-term abortion of children who can feel pain in the mother's womb.
It wasn't about the policy, the official told CNN. It didn't matter what policy we made because they (the Freedom Caucus) didn't want a deal. We were captives in an internal House caucus fight. The Freedom Caucus had too much interest in killing this to send a message to Speaker Ryan: 'You have too much power.'
I speak to Congress, you know, daily, various members of Congress daily, you know, about budget needs and we are communicating what we need to them very clearly so they know what to do.

The US share of NATO spending
The border he refers to -- the Turkish-Syria border -- was established in 1923 with the Treaty of Lausanne and the founding of the Republic of Turkey. The exception to this is the province of Hatay, which passed from Syrian to Turkish control following a referendum, said Lisel Hintz, assistant professor of international relations and European studies at Johns Hopkins, who called a previous version of Trump's claim -- in which Trump said there had been fighting for 2,000 years -- patently and irresponsibly false.
Kasich: 'Unless it gets fixed, I'm against it'
The budget makes growth assumptions nearly 1% year higher than the Federal Reserve in the first three years, and substantially higher over the rest of the ensuing 10-year window. According to a Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget analysis, Trump's budget may estimate as much as $3 trillion more in GDP in 2028 than previous Congressional Budget Office estimates.
Look back 50 years, when Congress and the White House in our country realized that tobacco was a huge public health threat. All of the federal government, with all kinds of local community, people, governments, businesses, labor unions, all pulled together.
A White House official said Trump also called McCain following word of the senator's diagnosis.
Russia, if you're listening and the media
BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Sean Smith, it seems, lived to serve. First in the Air Force, then with you at the State Department. He knew the perils of this calling, from his time in Baghdad. There in Benghazi, far from home, he surely thought of Heather and Samantha and Nathan, and he laid down his life in service to us all.
Collins said he informed the Sanders campaign on Tuesday morning that there had been an error, after CNN contacted the campaign to ask for the source for the $850 billion number. It is not clear, though, whether Sanders himself was informed of the error prior to the debate.
And the Trump team has promised a one-time tax break for companies if they bring back, or repatriate, that cash to the United States.
This is not the first time the Trump administration has pulled advertising for Obamacare. It halted up to $5 million worth of ads just days after taking office in January. The campaign was intended to alert consumers to the end of the 2017 sign-up period on January 31. Outreach is considered critical in the final days of the enrollment period to remind consumers -- particularly younger ones -- of the deadline. Sign ups typically surge during this time.

Trump's decision not to withdraw from NAFTA came only after Trump consulted with members of his Cabinet as well as business and congressional leaders, a senior White House official said Thursday.
The administration's response to the virus was widely criticized, with critics especially blasting the slow rollout of testing. President Trump's Wednesday night address to the nation missed the mark, in the view of many. (His Friday Rose Garden press conference declaring the emergency was seen as an improvement by many. Peter Bergen called it a reassuring affair after his disastrous Oval Office address on Wednesday night and credited Trump with offering some realistic policy prescriptions.)
I think it's a pretty inappropriate question to ask a daughter, if she believes the accusers of her father, when he's affirmatively stated that there's no truth to it, she said, smilingly indignant. I don't think that's a question you would ask many other daughters.

The President tweeted Sunday evening that reports about him firing Azar are false and said, Alex is doing an excellent job! Shortly after, Azar quote tweeted the President's tweet as part of a multi-tweet thread. Like Trump, he smeared the press and called the reports that the President was looking to replace him fake news, then lavished praise on Trump's handling of the pandemic.
At her event in Goffstown, Klobuchar pitching herself as a candidate who can win independent and lean Republican voters. She pledged to go everywhere, not just where it is comfortable, but where it is uncomfortable and outlined a platform that included overturning Citizens United, reinstating the Voting Rights Act, rejoining the Paris Climate Accord and getting on the path toward a public option for health care.
Facts First: Trump's claim about protecting those with pre-existing conditions is false. Though Trump says he would do this, his administration has consistently taken steps to undermine the Affordable Care Act -- including joining a lawsuit aimed at striking down the law -- without presenting alternative plans that would offer similar benefits.
SNELL: That is not the expectation that people have for the type of chief of staff that we would see from Mick Mulvaney.
He used his most valuable card -- the strong economy -- skillfully and at length, boasting that he shattered the mentality of American decline and was building the world's most prosperous and inclusive society.
«Es hora de que recordemos que somos un solo pueblo con un gran destino estadounidense, e independientemente de que seamos negros, cafés o blancos, todos tenemos la misma sangre roja de los patriotas, y todos compartimos las gloriosas libertades de nuestra magnífica nación», dijo Trump, evocando la retórica populista de su discurso de inauguración, luego de pasar gran parte del sábado quejándose de las supuestas deficiencias de la prensa establecida.
In Monday's filings, the government and the states led by Texas said it would be premature for the Supreme Court to weigh in on the law especially because it will remain in place while the appeals process plays out.
Those two comments – almost four years apart and more than six months after McCain's death – provide telling bookends to understand just how much Trump has changed Republican politics (and politics generally), and not for the better.
He said he probably never will like McCain, because John McCain received a fake and phony dossier.
House Republicans have had a tough decade. Many of us elected in 2010, 2012 and 2014 went to Washington to challenge President Obama's big-government, progressive agenda that was sending our country down the wrong track, driving up debt, and imposing growth-choking, Washington-knows-best regulations on our health care, financial services, energy and other industries.
The president is committed to ending these anti-growth policies and unleashing the American economy. We will continue to work with Congress to repeal Obamacare's oppressive mandates. And along with our partners in Congress, we will deliver bold tax reform that provides relief for middle-income individuals, a more competitive model for businesses, and simplification for everyone. And we will continue the president's ambitious plan to eliminate unnecessary regulations, which disproportionately affect small businesses.
Tim, is that how the business world views what happened over the last three weeks, the Taliban minority seized control of the House Republicans?

The White House's Council of Economic Advisers issued a report this week declaring that insurers have made a lot of money since the Affordable Care Act took effect, primarily thanks to large premium increases and generous federal funding of premium subsidies and Medicaid expansion. The release coincided with an unsuccessful attempt in the Senate to restore funding for a second set of Obamacare subsidies -- which helped to reduce low-income enrollees' deductibles and co pays -- that President Donald Trump eliminated last fall.
I have a great heart for these folks we're talking about, Trump said back in September of 2017. A great love for them and people think in terms of children but they're really young adults. I have a love for these people and hopefully now Congress will be able to help them and do it properly.

BASH: Mr. Trump, you don't want to raise the retirement age, and you also don't want to cut benefits even for wealthier Americans. But according to the Social Security Administration, unless adjustments are made, Social Security is projected to run out of money within 20 years. So specifically, what would you do to stop that from happening?

Klobuchar, who announced her presidential campaign during a snowy outdoor event in Minneapolis earlier this month, is the third potential presidential hopeful to appear at a CNN town hall. Sen. Kamala Harris appeared at an event hosted by Jake Tapper and former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz, who is considering an independent bid for the presidency, headlined a town hall hosted by Poppy Harlow.
TURNER: Well, Don, it's going to be a hell of a ride. And unlike 2016, there will be no -- you know, nobody will have a coronation. People are going to have to earn this. And even the folks who are uniquely positioned, there are plenty of folks, you know, who are on that poll who are certainly uniquely positioned, no doubt about it. But people are going to have to earn this.
And our manufacturing numbers are fantastic. You see that. Remember? Manufacturing. Phil, you remember? 'There's no more manufacturing.' And then we have almost 600,000 jobs.

We found the magic wand. -- January 19 speech to the American Farm Bureau Federation
That's fine. But if you're a Trump supporter and you want to get into the insult game, I still think that Trump comes out on top on that, even if you look rattled at some point.

If this law goes away, we return to a day where people who are sick can't get health insurance, which defeats the whole purpose of the product.
One specific thing Trump has been clear on, however, is Medicaid. He has been consistent in voicing his opposition to any cuts to the program, which helps to provide coverage to low-income Americans. On the campaign trail, he often touted his promise to not touch Medicaid.

GRUBER: I honestly don't. I just hope that they will look and realize that even without the individual mandate, we are talking about a law that provided insurance to 17 million people, and for the 133 million Americans with pre-existing conditions, it's saying don't worry, if you lose health insurance you can go buy it on the exchange.
Asked if she would ever run for office again, Clinton said more than once that she is set on finding interesting things to do with her life – without outright rejecting the suggestion of another political campaign.
The Trump administration unveiled a proposed rule Thursday that would make it easier for small businesses -- and some self-employed folks -- to band together and buy health insurance.
Facts First: We could not find any cases in which Biden was supposed to make a campaign speech but drew so few attendees that his campaign roped the people who did come into having a roundtable discussion with him instead. The Biden campaign told us this did not happen; the Trump campaign did not respond to a request to identify the event Trump was talking about.
You can get by with a much smaller nest egg, of course, if you'll be depending on it for significantly less income. But the point is that to accumulate enough savings during your working years to support yourself over an extra long retirement, you're going to have to do some heavy-duty saving.

Governor Abbott was joined for the press conference by Senator Paul Bettencourt and Representative Briscoe Cain, who have both filed several pieces of legislation to enhance election integrity in Texas
Klobuchar is trying to stake out the middle ground in these debates, and health care is a perfect example. Klobuchar briefly mentioned, when criticizing Sanders' plan, that even many Democrats in congress don't support Medicare for All. Frankly, this is her strongest argument on health care and Klobuchar would be wise to highlight it more in the next debate.
The trade deal Trump mentions here is a half-measure of what he promised, not a solution to the problem. The US and China will try to finish the job after the next presidential election. He also fails to mention, in particular, the billions in taxpayer-funded bailouts that were required to get US farmers through after China retaliated with counter-tariffs — double the cost of the auto bailout after the financial crisis. He also does not mention the Obama-led Asia trade deal he removed the US from when he took office. That deal — with other Pacific countries — has gone forward without the US.
As one of just a handful of open contrasts amidst a relatively friendly primary, a successful Sanders attack -- and Biden flub — conceivably could have shifted the dynamic in the final weeks before Iowa. But for some reason Sanders demurred, instead focusing on his own dovish stances.

While Manafort was held alone at Virginia's Northern Neck Regional Jail, he was not subjected to the harsh conditions commonly associated with solitary: he was given a large private room, bathroom, shower, workspace, phone and laptop.

Obviously, something like that would completely overhaul industries across the Midwest, including in Indiana. Do you have any concerns about how the Green New Deal might affect your constituents or your state?
(Trump has a long history of attempting to improvise after he has made a mistake reading a speech from a Teleprompter, rather than simply correcting the error.)
One of these allegations is an allegation of rape. That's a crime that you can go to jail for, for a very long time. And so I think that you have to look at the circumstances of every case. These are serious.

SEN. SUSAN COLLINS (R), MAINE: What I've been hearing the entire recess is people telling me to be strong, that they have a lot of concerns about the health care bill in the Senate. They want me to keep working on it, but they don't want me to support it in its current form. I still am a no unless the bill is dramatically changed.

The bill did not eliminate Obamacare's expansion of the Medicaid insurance program for low-income people, the federal and state marketplaces that allow people to shop for coverage, or the consumer subsidies that help many of them make the purchases. While Trump continued to take other steps to weaken Obamacare , much of it still exists.
TRUMP: I hope not. I truly hope not. I will say this. We have 25 (thousand), 30,000 people - you've seen it yourself. People come with tremendous passion and love for the country, and when they see protest - in some cases - you know, you're mentioning one case, which I haven't seen, I heard about it, which I don't like.

Meanwhile, the super PAC backing Jeb Bush, who has tried to position himself as an experienced alternative to Trump, called the real-estate mogul reckless and impulsive in a 30-second spot last month. But Bush's efforts have had little effect, leading Trump to taunt him last week by saying he wasted $40 million.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) AL GORE, FORMER VICE PRESIDENT: It was after my second and final concession speech after the Supreme Court decision, and when I got in the Secret Service car to go back to the V.P. house at the naval observatory, I was surprised when the car telephone rang and it was President George H.W. Bush. He said such incredibly kind things. And what he said was rooted, again, in his love for our country.
Revealing in that it's clear from the episode that Trump had zero interest in the details of a policy on which, theoretically, much of his political fate rested. Trump decried Obamacare as the worst law ever and insisted that if he got into the White House, he would personally ensure its removal and replacement. And yet, once in office, Trump apparently couldn't be bothered to, you know, pay attention to Ryan for 15(!) minutes. Because policy details carry no interest for him.
Klobuchar is markedly more centrist than many of the other Democrats running for President, including some of her colleagues in the Senate. Klobuchar has a liberal voting record, but she does not support abolishing the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency or Vermont Sen.

Facts First: Trump is correct about the recent decline, but he's cherry-picking the most favorable possible starting point: May 2019 was the month with the largest number of illegal crossings at any point in his presidency. The total number of illegal crossings under Trump has increased, not decreased, from the late Obama era.
Por ejemplo, los conservadores más importantes del Capitolio han argumentado que el proyecto de ley no llegó lo suficientemente lejos. Incluso lo han llamado Obamacare Lite (Obamacare ligero).

As you're no doubt aware, things are, shall we say, kind of up in the air when it comes to private insurance these days, what with the (so far, at least, unsuccessful) attempts to repeal and replace Obamacare. But you can get an idea of what you might have to pay for coverage, at least for now, by going to sites such as Healthcare.gov, HealthPocket.com and eHealthInsurance.com. That said, you'll want to stay abreast of the ongoing health-care debate to see whether new developments affect the terms of your coverage as well as what you'll pay.
And beyond that is just ongoing litigation, and I'd refer you to the actual parties involved, which aren't the White House.

The rule also allows states to make it easier for insurers to spend less of the premiums they collect on policyholders and put more toward profits and administrative costs. And the administration raised the default threshold that trigger state reviews of insurers' proposed rate hikes to 15%, up from 10%.

Not a surprise from a politician who has called for the abolition of the IRS as well as of the departments of Education, Energy, and HUD. In contrast to Trump, he has called for privatizing Social Security for younger workers.
On Monday, McCain said she genuinely feel(s) bad for (the Trump) family and that she can't imagine having a father who does this on the weekends.
So, let's see what's wrong with that statement. OK? Purely political. Obviously not true. The president stayed at the White House because of the optics of going to his luxurious Mar-a-Lago estate. Well, that stinks. While hundreds of thousands of employees are not being paid.

And their safety and security very much relies upon friendly Muslims that live along side them, that may not convert, but protect them and certainly look out for them. And their mission field really are Muslims that are looking to convert to Christianity as well. And they tell me that today they have a very hostile environment in which to operate in because the news is coming out that in America, leading political figures are saying that America doesn't like Muslims. So this is a real impact. There's no doubt that radical Islam is a danger in the world.
Some Blue Cross plans have also come under pressure.
Facts First: While Hunter Biden has previously had a board seat and a financial stake in a private-equity fund that the Chinese government-owned Bank of China has invested in, there is no evidence he walked out of the country with $1.5 billion. Hunter Biden's lawyer, George Mesires, said in an October 2019 While Hunter Biden has previously had a board seat and a financial stake in a private-equity fund that the Chinese government-owned Bank of China has invested in, there is no evidence he walked out of the country with $1.5 billion. Hunter Biden's lawyer, George Mesires, said in an October 2019 statement that the firm, BHR Partners, was capitalized with 30 million renminbi (RMB), or approximately $4.2 million USD at today's currency exchange rates.
From the outset, Bloomberg's strategy was to operate in a universe onto himself, not part of the everyday stories of Democratic primary but not fully in a race against Trump. For a short time, the plan worked, and Bloomberg's ubiquitous ads caught Trump's attention, as the two traded Twitter insults.
BLITZER: Who is your biggest competition on the Republican side?
BLITZER: All right, so Hillary Clinton is telling a moving story out there in Manchester, New Hampshire, right now. We'll continue to monitor what else she's saying.
And took us out of that horrible Paris accord. I always say, how are you doing with the Paris accord? Don't ask, saved trillions and trillions of dollars that was put in there to hurt us. In my opinion, it was put in there to hurt us. We were paying money to India, we were paying money to China, China's didn't kick in until 2030, we kicked in immediately. -- January 9 campaign rally in Toledo, Ohio
As Trump's senior staff in recent days mulled a potential executive order announcing the US' plans to withdraw from NAFTA, officials have had to consider tedious factors to ensure that they would maintain fast-track authority over a renegotiated deal and drafted several versions of a potential order to ensure it would pass muster. It's part of the reason the White House has yet to formally notify Congress of its plans to renegotiate the deal.

The Democrats just aren't calling about DACA. Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer have to get moving fast, or they'll disappoint you again. We have a great chance to make a deal or, blame the Dems! March 5th is coming up.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell this week revealed Senate's long-awaited plan to reshape America's health care system – the fruit of many weeks of work entirely behind closed doors by a group of 13 Republican senators that were selected by the majority leader.
In the first few years of Obamacare, many insurers priced their plans too low, resulting in big losses. This prompted many carriers -- including most of the large publicly traded ones -- to downsize or exit the market completely. There are just over 130 insurers on the exchanges this year, down from 237 two years earlier, according to data from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services.
It's very difficult -- we experienced this when Republicans were in the majority -- very difficult to pass a budget. And so the process of getting to reconciliation when a party is doing it solo is a real challenge, said GOP Sen. Jerry Moran of Kansas. So it would be a difficult scenario for the Democrats to get to a point to use reconciliation for a Covid-19 package.
ROMANS: Earlier in the day, a poignant moment. Former Senator Bob Dole helped out of his wheelchair for his final salute to the former president. Just a remarkable moment. And a moment that brought a smile to many people's faces. Sully, the president's loyal service dog, pausing before his casket.
When Carson became the director of pediatric neurosurgery at Johns Hopkins at age 33, he was the youngest to head a major division in the hospital's history.
The word trail in all-caps, an apparent reference to the tragedy the Trail of Tears. Just a few weeks ago, the president also made a reference to Wounded Knee in a joking manner when talking about Elizabeth Warren.
US Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump speaks during rally at the Atkinson Country Club in Atkinson, New Hampshire on November 4, 2016.
I have to be honest, Trump said, I never liked him much. Hasn't been for me.
And I believe it's a new partnership - a partnership that can allow us to restore the spirit of America and strengthen America for the best century we've ever had.
Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia (D)
Today, Hillary Clinton, your potential general election opponent, clearly indicated she sees this as an issue for the campaign. She said, quote, this kind of behavior is repugnant. We set the tone for our campaigns, we should encourage respect, not violence. Do you believe that you've done anything to create a tone where this kind of violence would be encouraged?
So, put that in perspective. We have seen far worse days. Two things took stocks down. First, the realization of the trade war with China is not over. There's a mountain of hard work to do.
The Trump administration also took another step Monday to put its stamp on the Affordable Care Act by releasing new rules for 2019.
Trump said of the FBI's January 2019 raid on Roger Stone's Florida home, footage of which was captured by CNN journalists: This is early in the morning, CNN following them. So they were obviously alerted. -- February 13 radio interview with Geraldo Rivera
The three attorneys withdrew from the case just before Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced the Justice Department would no longer defend the Affordable Care Act, saying two important parts of the law should be invalidated and the individual mandate is unconstitutional.
Both Klobuchar and Warren are in danger of losing their home states to Sanders, who hopes to ride his coalition of young, liberal voters to multiple victories on Tuesday night. The Vermont senator has also made inroads with Hispanic voters over the last four years, as evidenced by his win in Nevada.
But the challenge of agreeing on what form that change should take was underscored by the quite different perspectives offered in two articles in the last few weeks by two of the ACA's architects.

We've been in the dark so long, it's time we've seen some light.
To help support working parents, the time has come to pass school choice for America's children. I am also proud to be the first President to include in my budget a plan for nationwide paid family leave – so that every new parent has the chance to bond with their newborn child.
COOPER: And her daughter is about a year old, is that correct?
These were thin reeds to grasp, of course, but they were gripped all the same.
Before Joe Biden became vice president in 2009, Hunter Biden, a lawyer who graduated from Yale Law School, worked as a lobbyist; he became a partner at a law and lobbying firm in 2001. (He stopped lobbying late in the 2008 election .) Before that, he had worked for financial services company MBNA, rising to senior vice president, and for the US Commerce Department.
He said he probably never will like McCain, because John McCain received a fake and phony dossier.
If the Senate bill passes, it keeps alive the possibility of repealing Obamacare.
Creo firmemente que nadie estará peor económicamente en el proceso que estamos atravesando», dijo Price en el programa «Meet the Press» de NBC.
The last government shutdown occurred in 2013 between a Republican House and a Democratic White House and Senate. It lasted for 16 days in October and ended with a temporary debt and spending deal. Phew!
In the days since, the House leadership announced the Republican Party would move on from its seven-year promise to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, and the House Freedom Caucus has taken a large share of the blame for the defeat.
En su papel constitucional clave reside el gran poder del Congreso. «No hemos prestado mucha atención al presupuesto de ningún presidente desde que estoy aquí», aseguró el líder de la mayoría del Senado, Mitch McConnell, en una entrevista con Bloomberg News la semana pasada.
And I'll say this, and with a wonderful statement from African history, there's an old statement that goes true for the Senate which I think is going to be true for me. If you want to go fast, go alone, but if you want to go far, go together. And I hope to join with other people to take that institution far in service of this nation.
With a Wednesday deadline to make any alterations to its argument looming, Barr made his case in a room with Vice President Mike Pence, White House counsel Pat Cipollone, members of the Domestic Policy Council, press secretary Kayleigh McEnany and several other officials. The meeting ended without a decision and it was not immediately not clear if any shift in the Trump administration's position will emerge.
Trump claimed three times that the US has long had a trade deficit with the European Union of $150 billion per year, or more.
Officials unveiled a final rule that will make it easier to obtain coverage through short-term health insurance plans, which don't have to adhere to the law's consumer protections.
BLITZER: Not necessarily cut the bottom line. Is that something --
It's not clear where Trump heard China would pass the US as the largest economy in 2019. Derek Scissors, a resident scholar at the conservative American Enterprise Institute and an expert on the Chinese economy, told CNN in 2019 that there were some predictions at the beginning of that decade that China would pass the US around 2019, but that experts were not saying this around the time Trump took office.
The reason they based that is on a study of a different bill, but it depends upon the individual mandate. And those folks put great credit in the individual mandate which penalizes, coerces working families into purchasing insurance.
The relevant federal laws do not include penalties nearly that long for killing a bald eagle, the National Audubon Society, a nonprofit that works to protect birds, told the Toronto Star in May, when Trump made a five years version of this claim; the penalties are up to two years under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, if someone knowingly shoots a bald eagle with intent to sell or barter it, and up to two years under the Bald and Gold Eagle Protection Act, the National Audubon Society noted. (As the federal government's Fish and Wildlife Service notes on its website, the maximum two-year penalty under the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act is for a second conviction; a first conviction has a maximum penalty of one year.)

This is a Russian national, someone that prosecutors believe has ties to Russian military intelligence and someone who is working closely with the former Trump campaign chairman.
No one has benefitted more from our thriving economy than women, who have filled 58 percent of the new jobs created in the last year. All Americans can be proud that we have more women in the workforce than ever before – and exactly one century after the Congress passed the Constitutional amendment giving women the right to vote, we also have more women serving in the Congress than ever before.

The two big problems with health care is that we have a health care system that we just cannot afford. It is going to bankrupt us. It keeps getting bigger and bigger and bigger, he added. And number two, you want to provide good health care. And in Western Europe they seem to do it for less than half of what we do it.
Many Democrats are still fuming over what they consider the stolen nomination of President Barack Obama's Supreme Court pick Merrick Garland last year. And Trump's low approval rating – 36% in the latest Gallup tracking poll and rock bottom reputation among Democratic voters, means Democrats have little political room to work with Trump even if they wanted to.
I think the President just listed off the names of people he's spoken to on the phone about health care, one Senate Republican aide told CNN.
The coalition largely stuck to its bargain during the first two months of the year, but American shale producers have been lured back into the market by higher prices.
And you and I have talked about this before, 17 total different distinct investigative avenues pursuing the President right now, by seven different sets of prosecutors, both looking at the campaign, the transition, the inaugural committee, the Trump organization, the Trump Foundation. And that really what we're beginning to see is how these lines blur and that how Donald Trump sort of moved money from one place to another, and how money flowed into and out of his various entities involved and surrounding him in 2016.
Listen, a lot there. Let me just begin with the story of the day, this Washington Post piece, which, you know, if you believe The Post and their sourcing, they believe that now infamous Don Jr meeting over at Trump tower along with Paul Manafort, Russian attorneys, Jared Kushner, for a minute there, that the original statement, which said, no, no, no, and I'm entirely abbreviating this for you, but, no, this was about adoption, when in actuality, when the e-mails came out, we clearly saw it was about getting dirt on Hillary Clinton. This was the original statement because we just heard Sarah Huckabee Sanders saying the president weighed in, didn't dictate, but did weigh in offering suggestions. The original statement here, so we're all on the same page, We primarily discussed a program about the adoption of Russian children that was active and popular with American families years ago and was since ended by the -- he goes on -- Russian government. But it was not a campaign issue at the time, and there was no follow-up.
We must choose whether we will squander our inheritance – or whether we will proudly declare that we are Americans. We do the incredible. We defy the impossible. We conquer the unknown.

Walker's opinion is what you would expect from someone rated 'Not Qualified' by his peers -- ignoring the facts and evidence in order to try to score political points, Christopher Kang, general counsel for Demand Justice, a group opposed to Trump's nominees, told CNN.
Perhaps one of the most elusive, recent targets in Congress has been immigration. Republicans in both chambers struggled with and ultimately did not pass legislation to address the expiring Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, full funding for Trump's campaign promise of a border wall or the issue of family separation at the border.
In the Senate, McConnell has been working toward an agreement that would allow for an hour of debate for those supporting the objection and another hour for those who are opposed to it. But in order to pass it, McConnell would need unanimous consent. We expect that some Democrats are going to want to speak out against Cruz's challenge. But the more interesting moment will come when Republican senators stand up in opposition.
A Klobuchar aide told CNN on Monday that the senator prepared for the town hall like she would for a major interview.
The $130 billion current increase cannot be added to the $400 billion increase expected by 2024; the $400 billion is a cumulative figure that includes the $130 billion.
Anytime you have far greater numbers, you have far greater potential for harm, said Ben Decker, who runs the digital investigations consultancy Memetica. Decker, who has monitored Facebook groups supporting Democratic candidates and who previously spoke to CNN , said he has observed higher levels of online harassment among Sanders' followers relative to those of his Democratic rivals.
You're going to vote 'no' and then shut down the government? asked Rep. Mark Sanford, a Republican from South Carolina, when asked if the House Freedom Caucus was doing little more than paving the way for a big increase in spending in a later deal by supporting short-term continuing resolutions.
On Tuesday, he continued his criticism, telling reporters at the White House that I was never a fan of John McCain and I never will be.

Last weekend, Trump attacked McCain in several tweets that targeted his ties to the controversial Russia dossier and his vote against repealing Obamacare. He also referred to McCain as being last in his class at the US Naval Academy.
KASICH: I think that the Chinese government butchered those kids. And when that guy stood in front - that young man stood in front of that tank, we ought to build a statue of him over here when he faced down the Chinese government.
The great irony of the Trump era (well, one of them) is that Pelosi, for so long the GOP bogeyman, is now often cast by Berniecrats and other insurgent progressives as being insufficiently left. She's trod willingly into a few of those potholes and can turn defensive when her credentials are challenged – understandably so, in many cases, after having spent years being caricatured as the American Trotsky.
This is an example of what it looks like when things work well, said Josh Holmes, a top political adviser to McConnell. Both of them had opportunity to be big trouble.
Arizona's Department of Economic Security has also started planning for an extension, but the timing on when benefits would go out would depend on guidance from the US Department of Labor, said Tasya Peterson, the agency's press secretary.
We must move to universal health care. And I am so proud of the work we did as a party to protect the Affordable Car Act, Klobuchar said Sunday. We are to the point now where Obamacare is more popular than the President.
It's almost like let me -- let me fix what's going on here so I -- let me go and focus on something else so that people can stop focusing on the things I did when I was 25.

Just over half of Obamacare enrollees said that they were satisfied with their plan choices on the exchanges and that their health insurance was an excellent or good value, Kaiser found. Most enrollees said their premiums and deductibles were similar or lower in 2018 than in the prior year.

The President spent a few weeks playing coy about his support for Moore – citing the fact that he was in Asia when all of this news broke. He is playing coy no longer. Not only has Trump endorsed the controversial former judge, but he held a de facto get out the vote rally for Moore on Friday night in Pensacola, Florida and has recorded robo-calls in the state for the Republican nominee.
Now, meanwhile the one thing I think we can say that's going on here is they're trying to position her as a general election candidate. But on the ground in South Carolina, it was all about the primary over the last 24 hours. The former secretary of state moving around South Carolina with her husband, the former president. They're also going to be joined here by their daughter, Chelsea Clinton, later today.
It's a pitiable state of affairs. The choice of Kavanaugh might stir up some agita on the right, but there's little doubt the GOP will coalesce around him when it counts. The best case for Democrats, meanwhile, is to keep from splintering while parlaying almost certain defeat into more fuel for the base as the midterm elections approach and the 2020 presidential season comes up on the horizon.
CORTES: Gosh. I would be working very hard...
NEWMAN: Well, the atmosphere, because of Lorne Michaels, was very supportive. I think we all kind of took it in stride that it was a meritocracy. And whatever sketch, no matter who wrote it, no matter who was in it, if it was funny, it went in the show. This whole idea that it was a boy's club just wasn't true.
The town hall format is familiar for Klobuchar, who has found success in her home state – which almost went for President Donald Trump in 2016 – by consciously visiting each of Minnesota's 87 counties, often to hold town-hall style events.
Krieg: Going back to your experience these last few years. Republicans have been very open about their position on all this. They do not like Obamacare. But they also don't, as we've seen, really have a plan to replace it. What would you say to activists who argue, even with Republicans on the board, that you're cloistering yourself, with other elite thinker types, and then setting up to negotiate with yourselves?
Would you have rejected those jobs? GRANHOLM: Oh, no. I would have never rejected a single job.
El hecho de que el presidente sea tan hablador, además de ser consecuencia de su ego, es una cuestión de agresión. Aunque sus palabras extremas perturban, parece que Trump está dispuesto a causar dolor a los demás para satisfacer sus propios impulsos.
A week earlier, Bloomberg's team believed they would be competitive across much of the southern states, aides said, including North Carolina, Arkansas, Tennessee and Oklahoma.
And, if the economy does tip into recession, extend unemployment benefits. Instead of slashing food stamps and other aid to the poor, as the Trump administration is doing, expand it. Protect workers and support business. That's not just the moral thing to do, all of these measures will help the economy get back on its feet faster.
While Trump was able to use this debate to shift attention away from the recording, he didn't score a win in terms of the overall quality of the debate (his answers were filled with misstatements, vague references and scattershot statements on unrelated issues) and he didn't erase the problems that he has created for his party. However, Clinton didn't accomplish the kind of knockout punch that her supporters were hoping for.

This process is complicated, cumbersome and will force Democrats to walk through a tricky negotiation and stay together in a way they haven't had to do in recent years. Add on top of it the fact that Biden has pledged to keep talking to Republicans throughout this process and the reality that Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer can't lose a single member of his caucus and it's fair to say that Democrats have to operate darn near flawlessly to pull this entire thing off by mid March. Passing the budget resolution is the easy part. Getting everyone to the other side of this process without a massive internal backlash? That's a lot harder.
So. Let's take a step back here and think of what happened here in Washington on Tuesday. Sitting next to the leader of a foreign country, the President of the United States went after a former Republican senator (and former GOP presidential nominee) who not only served in the Vietnam War but spent years of his life being tortured in a North Vietnamese prison camp. And this is a President who received several deferments during Vietnam, including for bone spurs. In an interview with The New York Times in 2016, Trump called the condition temporary and minor.

Facts First: After : After eight consecutive months of declines , the number of Border Patrol arrests on the southern border increased from 29,200 in January to 30,068 in February, the government confirmed earlier in the day of Trump's town hall. The numbers are still down from last year, and the announcement of the increase was only hours old, so we'll give Trump some leeway.

After Trump made the announcement, Google issued a statement on behalf of its sister company Verily, which said , We are developing a tool to help triage individuals for Covid-19 testing. Verily is in the early stages of development, and planning to roll testing out in the Bay Area, with the hope of expanding more broadly over time. In other words, there would be no quick national website. Verily's focus was one part of California, and the entity in charge of the effort was not Google itself (though Verily said Google engineers had volunteered to assist with the project).
Yet Donald Trump, the party's undisputed front-runner for six months, remains the only candidate unscathed so far.

We have been waiting patiently while Congress has been unable to find a solution and Idaho families have been forced to buy products that are too expensive and loaded with benefits they don't want or need, Otter said. Now the door is open for states to pursue our own reasonable solutions. We believe Idaho will lead the way in states taking back control of their insurance markets.
Trump: We are all to blame for Russia relations
Paul Ryan on 2016 bid: 'Count me out'
Here are the repeat false claims we have previously fact checked in a weekly roundup:
Facts First: The whistleblower's account of Trump's July call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has been proven substantially accurate. In fact, the rough transcript Trump released showed that the whistleblower's three primary allegations about the call were correct or very close to correct.

TRUMP: I'm the only one on this stage that's hired people. You haven't hired people.
These measures run counter to Biden's promise to expand access to Medicaid so his administration is expected to seek to limit or undo these waivers during his term, as well as possibly restore the criteria on waivers' impact on increasing coverage.
During the 2000 presidential election ordeal, he joined fellow conservatives from the Reagan-Bush years to help former Texas Gov. George W. Bush, son of the first President Bush, claim the disputed Florida electoral votes.
But right now we move on to our other breaking story of the morning -- the future of health care for millions of Americans is once again up in the air.
Now, there is still a little chance that this makes a slight left turn back toward the U.S., and I'll show you why. A hundred and ten miles per hour, though, in the middle of the Atlantic. Missing Bermuda, too. See that little jog to the left? Why did they push it back? This is the Hurricane Center forecast five days from now. Why did they push it to the left? Because the European level has a slight jog as it tries to interact with Jose. This will rotate around each other. And that's this part of the wiggle. So that's why the model turns a little bit farther to the left, and so does the official hurricane track.
Sources telling CNN that White House chief of staff John Kelly has been interviewed by Mueller's team. The questions centering on Kelly's recollection of the president's reaction to reporting about how he had tried to fire Mueller.
After six Democratic debates in which foreign policy and national security received short shrift, I was really looking forward to a robust discussion during the seventh, especially given the real time crisis with Iran. I should have known better. There was too little discussion of the current crisis with Iran and too little about each candidate's conception of America's role in world. Here are my depressing and sobering takeaways.

Reduce the income threshold for deducting medical expenses. Under the GOP bill, taxpayers would be able to deduct medical expenses that exceed 5.8% of their adjusted gross income. Obamacare had raised the threshold to 10%. This would begin in 2017.
How would the government pay for all this?
Klobuchar's primary pitch to voters is likely to be electability. The Democrat has been notably successful in Minnesota, winning her three terms in the Senate by an average of 26 percentage points. Klobuchar won re-election in 2018 with 60% of the vote, two years after Trump came within two points of defeating Hillary Clinton in the state.
Those committees will also have to meet very specific and technical requirements so that the legislation can survive a review by the Senate parliamentarian. It could take weeks to finalize language and win support within the Democratic caucus.
Matthew Goodman, senior vice president and senior adviser for Asian economics at the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank, said there are no hard numbers or commitments in the US-Japan deal to support that figure, as far as I know.

For their part, the Biden administration has started to meet with Republicans they've identified as potentially supporting the package in an effort to build support.
The stimulus package also provides new subsidies for those who lost their jobs, but those folks will likely have to wait a little longer.
Obama filmed several videos promoting the ACA -- usually with a humorous bent -- while he was in office and then more recently at annual open enrollment time for the Obamacare exchanges. The appearances have been aimed at reminding consumers of the deadline to sign up for coverage at a time when the Trump administration has slashed funding for marketing and outreach.
After Trump took office, the government moved in 2017 to allow exemptions for more employers. That includes not only those entities with religious objections, but also nonprofits, small businesses and individuals that have non-religious moral objections. The government did not extend moral exemptions to publicly traded businesses.
One of Trump's flagship campaign promises was to revive US manufacturing and in his final State of the Union address, he claimed to have succeeded in restoring our Nation's manufacturing.
SEN. KAMALA HARRIS (D-CA), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: We need to have Medicare for all.
In July 2005, as the annual session was ending, reporters tried to find out whether Chief Justice William Rehnquist, who had been fighting thyroid cancer for months, planned to retire. Reporters and photographers camped out at his suburban Virginia home, monitoring his comings and goings. When a reporter shouted a question about Rehnquist's health as he left the house one day, the 80-year-old chief declared, That's for me to know and you to find out.
Trump said that, prior to his presidency, Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador refused to take back criminals the US wanted to deport, but now they do.

MIRA: El mundo se pregunta cuándo implementará EE.UU. un control de armas
The former first lady, Michelle Obama, offered what turned out to be a more prescient take while campaigning for Hillary Clinton.
Republicans have complained the President, who made nods toward working across the aisle on the measure, ultimately pushed through a plan without any GOP support. And some have warned it could trigger inflation.
But did anyone change their vote from Sanders to Warren as a result? Unlikely. And if not, it was a missed opportunity for her to make the case that Bernie Sanders is the wrong candidate from the progressive wing to expand the Democratic Party's double-digit lead with female voters. And there may not be many more opportunities coming her way before February 3rd.
QUESTION: What's the delay? What's the delay here? You guys have had this since Friday. What -- what's holding him back?
Rep. Adam Schiff of California was having none of Trump's argument, tweeting in response, Separating children from their parents as a 'deterrent' is a deliberate cruelty. Pretending the law requires it is cowardly nonsense. You own this horrific policy.
Best unemployment numbers in the history of our Country. -- March 10 tweet
As for Immigration Wars not being a bestseller, it's true: it ranks #346,025 on the Amazon bestsellers list.
More than 100 of Delgado's colleagues have already signed on as co-sponsors to a Medicare for All proposal introduced in February by Reps. Pramila Jayapal and Debbie Dingell. It has the support House Democratic freshmen like Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Rashida Tlaib.
I have to be honest, Trump said, I never liked him much. Hasn't been for me.
Should veterans' benefits be part of attempts to reduce the deficit?
Exit polls suggest that the South Carolina electorate was far more moderate and African American than the states in which Sanders has prospered. The former vice president's securing of last-minute endorsement of the state's political icon Rep. James Clyburn last week also appears to have been crucial.
Adding $1 trillion to the cost of the tax bill would make it even harder to make it revenue neutral. As it is, it's a heavy lift, said Roberton Williams, a senior fellow at the Tax Policy Center.
The relief package calls for increasing the credit to $3,600 for each child younger than 6 and to $3,000 for each child between 6 and 17 in 2021 for qualifying families. It is currently a $2,000 credit for kids between the ages of 6 and 16.
HEALTH CARE HEADS TO THE SENATE
SMITH: That's a funny subject. I begged them to tell me what was -- what happened. I said I want to know all the details, all of the details no matter what it is, and I'll make up my own mind on it. And everyone of them, all the big shots over there told me that -- they promised me, they promised me that they would tell me what happened. As soon as they figure it out.
And he went through Trump's divorces with Donald Trump and so, you know, it's interesting to me that this evening, instead about political speaker and you have somebody from the business world and just a close personal friend of Donald would tune. [21:45:00] COOPER: It was also, Michael so interesting to have him say from at the get-go, I'm not going to be talking about Hillary Clinton. We don't need to do that.
Here is what to watch for in Wednesday's debate ahead of the Nevada caucuses:
The President has the support of millions of veterans in the United States. I don't think those veterans are in love with the fact that he's attacking John McCain, he said.
And Tuesday night, he suffered perhaps a fatal blow by losing the three Ms -- Mississippi, Missouri, and Michigan.
And questions about Trump's focus and struggle to master policy details have been around as long as his presidency.
Facts First: There is no basis for the claim that there has been fighting over the Turkey-Syria border for 1,000 years; modern-day Turkey and Syria were both part of the Ottoman Empire that was only dissolved after World War I, and the border between them is less than 100 years old.
No force in history has done more to advance the human condition than American freedom. In recent years we have made remarkable progress in the fight against HIV and AIDS. Scientific breakthroughs have brought a once-distant dream within reach. My budget will ask Democrats and Republicans to make the needed commitment to eliminate the HIV epidemic in the United States within 10 years. Together, we will defeat AIDS in America.
The Supreme Court recently agreed to consider the approval of work requirements in Arkansas and New Hampshire, which were voided by lower courts.
Monday wasn't the first time McCain offered a strong rebuke of the President's character.

In the Senate, more uncertainty looms. There, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell must win Democratic votes, and many senators were still not saying Tuesday how they'd vote on a short-term continuing resolution.
TRUMP: We have some protesters who are bad dudes, they have done bad things. They are swinging, they are really dangerous and they get in there and they start hitting people. And we had a couple big, strong, powerful guys doing damage to people, not only the loudness, the loudness I don't mind. But doing serious damage. And if they've got to be taken out, to be honest, I mean, we have to run something.
Acting US Customs and Border Protection commissioner Mark Morgan has offered similar numbers, telling reporters in September that 10,000 of approximately 25,000 troops were on Mexico's southern border.
And last night, just the fact that they had a meeting at the White House at with absolutely nothing, no progress at all, gives you an indication that this sounds like it might last a while. People keep asking, when is this going to end? Nobody knows.
Trump overstates the problem created by the North American Free Trade Agreement, and fails to mention that Democrats in Congress were crucial to passing his new deal. He doesn't say we here.
When he finally had the chance to do it, he voted against repeal and replace, the President said. Remember thumbs down?
Add that slow burn to the much more serious news, reported by the Washington Post on Tuesday, that four foreign governments have been chatting, independently and idly so far as we know, about how they might take advantage of Kushner's combination of complicated business interests, financial troubles and political naivete, and it's hard to imagine any imminent reversal of fortune. Rather than a shrewd, well-manicured hand to guide Trump's operation, Kushner is now more widely viewed as a legal liability. Those concerns were compounded on Wednesday, when the New York Times revealed that the family real estate firm had secured a couple of mega-loans after Kushner took White House meeting with lenders. (A spokesman for his lawyer and another, for Kushner Companies, denied any connection between the talks and subsequent deals.)
Democrats maintain a wide lead over Republicans in the race for control of the House of Representatives, a new CNN Poll conducted by SSRS finds, including a 10-point lead among those most likely to turn out this November.
...but think of this, $45 million they spent... -- December 18 campaign rally in Battle Creek, Michigan
We have cut the rate of smoking in half and cut it by even more than that among young people.
But I told Mike (Pence). I said, 'Mike, we're giving them money, and, you know, you're always torn about that because we have our country to build, we have our cities to build and our roads to fix. But we're giving them money. Tell me, why isn't Germany paying money? Why isn't France? Why isn't United Kingdom paying money? Why aren't they paying money? Why are we paying them money? Is that a correct statement, Mike? I say, 'Find out what the hell is going on.' And I told that to all of my people, OMB. I said -- I asked that question: 'How much is Germany paying? Why isn't Germany paying?' Why is the United States always the sucker? -- February 6 speech on Senate impeachment acquittal
Losing the two provisions – guaranteed issue and the community rating provision – would gut protections for those with pre-existing conditions.
LEMON: It is impossible to overstate how important that is. Here's the question. Now the question is what are they going to do about it? What are they going to do about it? And there's more.
Facts First: There have been empty seats at various Trump rallies, including an October 2019 rally Minneapolis, a July 2019 rally in Greenville, North Carolina, an October 2018 rally in Houston and an April 2017 rally in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, according to journalists on the scene.
MARQUARDT: And of course, the major question, what did Michael Flynn actually tell the prosecutors in more than 62 hours of conversations about President Trump.
COOPER: Do you have questions about the reaction by law enforcement?
SCARAMUCCI: We're going to get there, Chris. And so we're basically saying this is an evolutionary step toward a greater system, a more efficient system, a more cost effective system.
SMITH: That would be so nice. That would at least acknowledge that I have a right to know something, something other than, we're checking up on it, or trust me. I like that one the best of all. Trust me. I will let you know.

ROSSELLO: No, we don't have numbers on casualties. Again, it talks a little bit to the strength of the storm. We have to get our rescue workers out fairly quickly. You know, once winds go to 50 miles per hour we got them out. But we are very attentive. We know that this is very dangerous and of course it's going to bring with it very likely injury and, of course, possible death.
BASH: Welcome back to STATE OF THE UNION. I'm Dana Bash.
So that was something that everybody agreed with and the Ways and Means Committee made that adjustment.
Trump would return to CPAC in 2013, 2014 and 2015 -- always drawing large audiences thanks to his celebrity and his ability to speak the populist language of the activist crowd. He became a big donor to the American Conservative Union, the organization behind CPAC. Trump also spoke at the conference every year of his presidency.
MICHAEL BLOOMBERG, FORMER NEW YORK CITY MAYOR: Now, this new Congress has to do something. If they sit back and do the same thing that the people they ousted did, then I'm not going to be happy. And I've told Nancy Pelosi that.

CUOMO: Many experts in the field of health care disagree with that sentence and say the greatest threat to Obamacare is federal subsidies being pulled by the president. All I'm saying is --
For example, decades ago the United States entered into a treaty with Russia in which we agreed to limit and reduce our missile capabilities. While we followed the agreement to the letter, Russia repeatedly violated its terms. That is why I announced that the United States is officially withdrawing from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, or INF Treaty.
Let the people of Alabama, if they want to make their choice, I hope they -- they have a very good candidate, a Democratic candidate.

The border he refers to -- the Turkish-Syria border -- was established in 1923 with the Treaty of Lausanne and the founding of the Republic of Turkey. The exception to this is the province of Hatay, which passed from Syrian to Turkish control following a referendum, said Lisel Hintz, assistant professor of international relations and European studies at Johns Hopkins, who called a previous version of Trump's claim -- in which Trump said there had been fighting for 2,000 years -- patently and irresponsibly false.

is a really broad ruling. This judge said not only is the individual mandate unconstitutional. He said the entire law must go.
Facts First: NATO was very much alive before Trump took office in January 2017. And the US was not the only one paying, no matter how you measure.
Five years later, CPAC is coming to Orlando, practically in Trump's backyard. While a number of would-be presidential candidates for 2024 will use the opportunity to make a splash, their speeches will all be the warm-up act for Trump's big address on Sunday.
When in post-midnight hour it ended in the dramatic way that it did, it certainly was disappointing, Short said, adding, that since then, It's not as if Senator McCain has stopped expressing his disappointment with President Trump.
On Wednesday, with the clock ticking down, a clearly frustrated McConnell called out Trump for complicating an already tenuous negotiation.
CUOMO: You can't bring yourself to say something nice, can you? You're still upset about the handshake thing, aren't you?
Trump said the following to his New Hampshire rally crowd about the border wall Americans are paying for: You do know who's paying for the wall, don't you? Right. Redemption from illegal aliens that are coming in. The redemption money is paying for the wall.
I want to build on the momentum that we saw here in 2018, Klobuchar told reporters Saturday in Wisconsin. No one ever thought that the Democrats were going to be able (to defeat) Gov. Walker, but we did it, and we did it in a smart, Wisconsin way with a grassroots campaign with (Democratic Sen.) Tammy Baldwin at the top of the ticket, and we can do it in the presidential, as well.
And the business of making those promises a reality, coupled with his lack of relevant Washington experience, has left Trump with few choices beyond sticking to his rhetorical guns while scrambling behind the scenes to find ways to convert those bold ideas into sound policy.
He also blamed McCain for wars in the Middle East.
This part is normal. It's not up to budget writers to assume recessions. But the Trump budget swings in the opposite direction, assuming wildly optimistic growth.
The key to reopening enrollment will be publicizing it and providing help for people to sign up, according to a recent Kaiser Family Foundation discussion with navigators who assist those looking for coverage on the exchanges. They also say the period should last more than six weeks.

Voters are worried about sending their children to college, about Social Security, clean air, terrorism. Will the next President send our sons and daughters to war? Trump doesn't seem to be too worried about the Middle East. He shockingly admitted that he hadn't talked to Pence about Aleppo, and when pressed by moderator Martha Raddatz, he couldn't come up with one detailed answer about how he would handle the war in Syria. One of the major issues of our time and he has no plan. That's beyond troubling.
I began this evening by honoring three soldiers who fought on D-Day in the Second World War. One of them was Herman Zeitchik. But there is more to Herman's story. A year after he stormed the beaches of Normandy, Herman was one of those American soldiers who helped liberate Dachau. He was one of the Americans who helped rescue Joshua from that hell on earth. Almost 75 years later, Herman and Joshua are both together in the gallery tonight – seated side-by-side, here in the home of American freedom. Herman and Joshua: your presence this evening honors and uplifts our entire Nation.
The initial salvo on that ban came within days of Trump's inauguration and with little consultation with government agencies that would typically be consulted. The result was chaos at airports worldwide and the detention of Muslims at US airports who had valid visas and even green cards to travel to and stay in the US.
VOIGHT: It's Donald's nature to help others.
BLITZER: Are you surprised, David, with the conservative leader, Mark Meadows, the Freedom Caucus member, how uncomfortable they are in voting for a bill that is going to significantly raise the national debt?

BRIGGS: Flynn's full account of events has been one of the best-kept secrets in Washington as Mueller puts together the final pieces of his case.
QUESTION: Would you, please? Could you ask him?
ROSSELLO: Well, the president has been phenomenal in this situation. He's been, both in Irma and Maria, he has offered an pre-landfall emergency declaration. He's already declared most of the island a disaster area so that we can start the rebuilding process quickly. And he just said that he loved the people of Puerto Rico, and that he would help, that he would stand by us in our rebuilding process.
Under Obamacare, insurers could only charge older enrollees three times more than younger policy holders. The GOP bill would widen that band to five-to-one, which would hike premiums for those in their 50s and early 60s, but reduce them for younger folks.
Why are many Republicans vaccine skeptics? Keilar rolls the tape
It remains to be seen how many people complete the enrollment process by paying their premiums. The administration's figures only included those who selected plans.
The national lead. In a rare display of actually getting something done, our elected officials reopened Washington for business today, but not, critics say, without a little something for themselves in return.
The first slate of 13 advisers was named on August 5. Most members of the all-male team were primarily involved in real estate and finance.
This is not a theory. Do you have to take on entitlement programs to balance a budget? Yes. It doesn't mean you have to cut them. It means you need to innovate them, the way we do things in the 21st Century.

When the Trump team arrived at the White House last year, many liberals and moderates – though you'd be hard-pressed to get them to admit it now – took some comfort in knowing that Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump would be close by the new president's side.
In past months, Trump has frequently referenced McCain's 2017 health care vote on the campaign trail without naming him, drawing the ire of the Arizona Republican's family.

As he was forced to explain on Twitter after the speech, he was not actually banning trade and cargo from Europe.
COOPER: They were using their helmets to hit the driver.
In a news conference after the 1994 election, Clinton admitted that Democrats were held accountable for their governing. Obama, likewise, had to be careful about where he campaigned during his time in office and was given a shellacking – as he put it – in the 2010 midterms.
ROMNEY: So when asked, will I preserve and protect a woman's right to choose, I make an unequivocal answer. Yes.
This has been one of Ivanka Trump's political hobbyhorses for some time. Recently, she and Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Florida, worked together on the outline of a plan that would allow new parents to effectively shift Social Security money, payable after retirement, to the time following the birth of a child. (Democratic Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York panned the idea, saying it was like robbing Peter to pay Paul.)
That is more important than it may seem: in voting for president, people tend to ask themselves whether they want to have Candidate X or Candidate Y in their living rooms for the next four years. Democrats who have become discouraged about the quality of their candidates should feel a little happier after last night.
Listen, he spends his weekend obsessing over great men because he knows it, and I know it, and all of you know it: he will never be a great man, McCain said on ABC's The View, where she is a co-host.
Out of health concerns related to Covid-19, the mayor had said, We are not allowing churches to gather, either in-person or any kind of drive-thru capacity.
COOPER: But joining me now is CNN Senior Political Reporter Manu Raju. So you spoke with Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid in Nevada State. What did he have to say about the possibility of Sandoval being the nominee?
President Donald Trump complained Wednesday that he didn't receive a thank you for approving the funeral the late Sen. John McCain wanted, marking his latest grievance in his recent onslaught against the Arizona Republican.
She also pointedly warned against supporting progressives like Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, telling voters to avoid candidates promising grand ideological sketches that will never see the light of day.
The recent debate over the future of Obamacare has obscured an important, but fundamental, truth: The American health care system is exceptional.
MIAMI GARDENS, FLORIDA - MAY 06: Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis speaks during a press conference at the Hard Rock Stadium testing site on May 06, 2020 in Miami Gardens, Florida. Gov. DeSantis announced during the press conference that a COVID-19 antibodies test will be available. The test can show if a person has had the virus in the past without showing symptoms, and therefore may be immune to it. The test will be available to first responders and health care workers first, with the goal of being able to expand testing to the general public. (Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)

Regardless of your stance on the content, the idea of grown adults playing capture the flag with a painting is classic politics. Imagine doing that at any job other than Congress or on The Office.
Revamp Medicaid funding. The GOP bill would send the states a fixed amount of money per Medicaid enrollee, known as a per-capita cap.
Stocks perform much better under Democrats
Can Sanders give as good as he gets?
The rest of the bill concerns this transition period. It zeroes out some Medicare premiums during that period and accounts for subsidies some Americans get under Obamacare.
The unemployment rate is now 3.5% -- the lowest in over 51 years, half a century. -- January 19 speech to the American Farm Bureau Federation
Now I will say this, there is tremendous hatred. The question was asked, what do you think? I said, there is hatred. Now it would be very easy for me to say something differently. And everybody would say, oh, isn't that wonderful.
They asked one of our Democratic -- Cryin' Chuck Schumer -- 'What do you think of the deal?' -- two weeks ago. He had no idea what the deal was. Never saw the deal; it's totally guarded. 'I don't like it. I don't like the deal,' he said. 'Well, have you seen it?' Yeah, I think I know what...' 'Well, why don't you like it?' 'Well, they took the tariffs off.' Actually, we didn't.

The good news is more Americans say they will get the vaccine than ever before. A new Axios/Ipsos poll finds that 63% of adults say they have had or are likely to get a Covid-19 vaccination as soon as it's made available to them. That's the highest ever recorded by Ipsos.

TRUMP: Jake, I have to say - honestly, it's just the opposite. What will happen if they don't behave, we will put on a tax of some amount, and it could be a large amount, and we will start building those factories and those plants.

That Trump had thought about running for president in the past isn't news. In 1999, contemporaneous to this CBS interview, he told Larry King on CNN he would form a presidential exploratory committee. He also teased campaigns on other shows, other networks, and in other presidential cycles. But watching that CBS clip in the context of how he eventually did run — and win — is quite interesting indeed.

After the financial crisis in 2008, states cut mental health spending by billions of dollars. In 2014, a study published in JAMA Psychiatry found that therapists were the least likely medical providers to accept insurance. The percentage that did was significantly lower than physicians in other specialties like cardiology or dermatology. Therapy can cost hundreds of dollars per session, and is especially expensive in cities, where rates of depression are higher. Most of the United States faces a severe shortage of practicing child and adolescent psychiatrists, with fewer than 17 providers available per 100,000 children, according to data from the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry.

The President has announced an ambitious bid to completely overhaul the faltering vaccine distribution effort left over by the previous administration. But the plan is contingent on a huge boost in funding that only Congress can provide. While hospitalizations and new cases of Covid-19 have fallen across the country, the baseline is still highly elevated. Many medical experts are concerned that mutations of the virus that are more transmissible, slightly more deadly and may be more resistant to vaccines could soon become dominant and trigger another wave of sickness and death. Two cases of one of those variants, first detected in South Africa, were found in South Carolina, officials said Thursday. The discovery was so worrying because Biden said this week that it will be the end of the summer before all Americans get the vaccine.

So we fixed this before October 11, and then we agree as we haven't pass shutdowns to pay them for the days they were suppose to work. It will be all kind of OK. Now, there's still the disruption where people don't know whether they're going to get paid.

In the global spread of Covid-19, this will prove catastrophic. Today, there are 27 million uninsured Americans -- almost 10% of our population . And like Azcue, 45% of Americans are underinsured, with coverage that results in catastrophically high deductibles and out-of-pocket expenses they can't meet.
She later added, We live in an era where we knock down old American heroes for all their imperfections when no leader wants to admit to fault or failure.

The town hall format is familiar for Klobuchar, who has found success in her home state – which almost went for President Donald Trump in 2016 – by consciously visiting each of Minnesota's 87 counties, often to hold town-hall style events.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It is difficult, I'm sorry, sir.

I did speak to Cindy McCain, and I wished her well. I wished John well. They've headed back, but I understand he'll come if we ever needed his vote, which hopefully we won't. But the word is John will come back if we need his vote, and it's too bad, Trump said.
Tanden's struggles are characteristic of nominees who have issues stemming from their own political vulnerabilities but who also fall victim to wider political forces beyond their individual fates.
They let you take action, the person said of the orders. It doesn't take place of something statutory.
Fortunately, policymakers in America have examples of successful programs in the health care sector that have been premised on competition and choice to drive value and innovation. Two, in particular, are of special note – the Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit (Part D) and Medicare Advantage plans.
The President felt burned by the Freedom Caucus's rejection of the compromise, a White House official said.

Facts First: The Mueller investigation was not illegal. Multiple federal courts have : The Mueller investigation was not illegal. Multiple federal courts have upheld the legality of Mueller's appointment and endorsed actions he took. Horowitz conducted an exhaustive review and determined in the report released in December that the FBI had a legitimate basis for opening the Russia investigation in July 2016, prior to Mueller's appointment in May 2017, though his report also criticized some FBI officials for how they had handled other aspects of the investigation.

Trump's efforts have prompted grumbles – private and public – from Republican lawmakers mindful of the uphill battle Trump is setting them up for.
The campaign within the GOP to stop Trump now seems to be placing much of its firepower behind a politician who has been at the far end of the political spectrum and who has practiced an aggressive, smashmouth style of politics that has sometimes made Trump look tame.
And next, and deadly storm system sends tornadoes ripping through the Southeast and now dangerous weather hitting parts of the Northeast. Well, the latest from our weather center when we come back.
Now, Zinke's departure does perhaps prevent some headaches for this White House because now he won't really be in a position to be dragged before Congress. Democrats had been vowing to bring him in to ask him questions about some of these scandals -- Alex.

RENATO MARIOTTI, FORMER FEDERAL PROSECUTOR: Well, here you have an American and a Russian, an American being the former chair of Trump's campaign, you know, conspiring with a Russian to commit a crime. It's obviously serious, and it begs the question, what did they have to hide? Why does this Russian intelligence operative care so much about Paul Manafort that he is willing to risk himself getting in trouble to aid Paul Manafort? It doesn't make a lot of sense.
Trump is now averaging about 59 false claims per week for the 31 weeks we have checked at CNN since July 8 , so both of these two weeks were better than his usual. They were still, of course, highly dishonest by any non-Trump standard.
Rubio's super PAC, Conservative Solutions, put up two ads in New Hampshire, blasting Christie over his record in New Jersey.

QUESTION: Sarah, has the president signed the Russia-North Korea-Iran sanctions bill?
He said he probably never will like McCain, because John McCain received a fake and phony dossier.
No one really knows what the ultimate political impact will be 20 months from now, said Doug Heye, a Republican operative who was communications director of the Republican National Committee during the fight over Obamacare. In 2010, Democrats were predicting political doom for any Republican opposing the Joe Biden-led stimulus bill. Republicans won 63 House seats that November.
That's really why they're doing it. Not to exit health care at all, he said. There's a lot of consolidation in the sector.
Klobuchar has admitted that she can be too tough on her staff in response to the stories.
I want to build on the momentum that we saw here in 2018, Klobuchar told reporters Saturday in Wisconsin. No one ever thought that the Democrats were going to be able (to defeat) Gov. Walker, but we did it, and we did it in a smart, Wisconsin way with a grassroots campaign with (Democratic Sen.) Tammy Baldwin at the top of the ticket, and we can do it in the presidential, as well.
El buen gobierno que desearíamos tener también habría asegurado que todos tengan seguro médico. Increíblemente, Trump rechazó el jueves una propuesta para reabrir la inscripción de Obamacare para que los estadounidenses sin seguro puedan obtener cobertura en medio de proyecciones de que millones podrían enfermarse.

CHALIAN: Completely true, totally factual. That is a sin of omission. She's not acknowledging the reality of what we've all learned since then. Donald Trump Jr admits, President Trump admits, that oppo research on Hillary Clinton was part of this, there was a set-up for this meeting where Donald Trump Jr knew that it was the Russian government's desire to affect the election. All of that was present. So, to just say that that statement was 100 percent contract and correct when we know it is not the full story, is, again, it's like, am I not supposed to believe my lying eyes? I don't understand who she's trying to convince that that was a full and accurate statement.
The Trump administration says that about 101 miles of wall had been built on the Mexican border as of January 10. Only one of these miles was built in places where no barriers had existed before; the other 100 miles replaced or reinforced previously existing barriers.

He even awarded our nation's highest civilian honor, not to the real American hero in the gallery -- one of the last surviving Tuskegee Airmen -- but a conservative media personality who has done as much as Trump himself to divide our nation. It was a shameful display, Biden said.
Klobuchar's primary pitch to voters is likely to be electability. The Democrat has been notably successful in Minnesota, winning her three terms in the Senate by an average of 26 percentage points. Klobuchar won re-election in 2018 with 60% of the vote, two years after Trump came within two points of defeating Hillary Clinton in the state.

I did it. Iran is no longer the same country. Iran is pulling people out of Syria. They can do what they want there, frankly, but they're pulling people out, they're pulling people out of Yemen.

LEMON: And so, that's it. And I think it's easy for you to be able to sit there and say that because maybe this president only offends your sensibilities. He hasn't offended you as a person who is LGBTQ.
To be clear, this issue is not about what's best for Democrats or Republicans. It is about which mortal sins we will continue to allow to fester in our country. The very integrity of the election depends on it. It's time to hear what the candidates plan on doing.
Six in 10 voters supported a single-payer system -- with Sanders attracting close to 40% of those voters and Buttigieg attracting more than 2 in 10. Among those who oppose single-payer, more than 3 in 10 backed Buttigieg and more than a quarter voted for Klobuchar. Biden received 13% of the vote, while Sanders and Warren were in the single digits.
And, now it seems, the former New York mayor squandered his.
Earlier on Tuesday, Whip Rep. Steny Hoyer, a Democrat from Maryland, said a deal on DACA needed to be part of a funding bill in order to get Democratic support.
That formula is a formula that you reject now when given the political choice between a strong middle class and the party that markets to your race but delivers economic benefits only to the wealthy.

Trump inherited a positive trend that has continued during his tenure. The unemployment rate for all three groups had fallen substantially under President Barack Obama from the recession-era levels of 2009.
It is obviously false that the media never even mentions Trump's crowds. The response of the crowd to his rhetoric is a regular part of media coverage of his rallies; media outlets regularly mention when a rally venue was filled to capacity; their stories regularly include quotes from people in the crowd.
Three Republicans leaving last week' House GOP meeting all mentioned it as one of the biggest sticking points, suggesting lawmakers could pass a short-term extension to try to buy themselves time to have a legitimate debate about government surveillance out of the drama of year-end spending.

But after an unusually somber appearance in the briefing room on Tuesday, the President was back to his habitual efforts to distract from any personal culpability for the situation.
He got that the beginning of this year. That was a major concession and commitment from realizing from many Republicans that it was a hard bite to swallow, because the Republicans believe that lowering the tax burden, lowering regulations stimulates the economy.
Trump said the media humorlessly accused him of lying when he had told a joke that California Gov. Gavin Newsom wanted to give undocumented immigrants a free Rolls-Royce: One of the newscasters said, 'Donald Trump said that the Governor of California promised a Rolls-Royce to illegal immigrants. He didn't promise them. This was a lie and a misrepresentation by President Trump. 'They can't take a little humor, they can't take it. These people are sick, they're sick. -- January 30 campaign rally in Des Moines, Iowa
Trump's executive order, which he said was aimed at increasing choice and competition, also called for federal agencies to look at changing the rules governing short-term insurance policies and health reimbursement arrangements. Those regulations have yet to be issued.
This is a peculiarly dated list of childhood American heroes. (We won't get into the administration's failure to fast-track an Obama-era plan to put Harriet Tubman on the $20.)
Trump's budget doesn't ratchet down spending cuts any more slowly due to the changes in Congress – it just drops them down harder as if the budget increases never happened.

At least two years of big rate hikes have helped the insurers that remain get on more solid financial footing. Several recent studies, including ones by the Kaiser Family Foundation and S&P Global, have found that many insurers' premiums in 2017 were more than adequate to cover policyholders' medical expenses.
Todd Harrison, director of defense budget analysis at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said he thinks Trump must have been including military funding for the 2020 fiscal year to get to the $2.5 trillion figure -- but the 2020 fiscal year just started on October 1, and Harrison noted that the defense appropriation has not yet been approved by Congress.

The good news is more Americans say they will get the vaccine than ever before. A new Axios/Ipsos poll finds that 63% of adults say they have had or are likely to get a Covid-19 vaccination as soon as it's made available to them. That's the highest ever recorded by Ipsos.
[11:35:01] Now the judge has shown some interest, as you said before -- Alex. And I don't -- that could mean either thing. That could meant the judge is thinking about throwing the case out. I don't think that's likely. It could mean that the judge on the opposite side is ticked off and think that Flynn has not truly accepted responsibility now which could result in a slightly higher sentence.
The insurers are telling us, that will bring insurers back into the marketplace. If they can actually offer the plans that people want to buy, not the plans that people are making them buy, they'll have more plans being offered, there'll be more choice and more competition.
There is a new opportunity in American politics, if only we have the courage to seize it. Victory is not winning for our party. Victory is winning for our country.
But when a president has a reasonable governing majority in the Senate, confirmations become easier. If Democrats had a handful of seats to spare, for instance, a senator such as Manchin, who must constantly judge the winds in his ultra-conservative state of West Virginia, could be given a pass.
Since my election, we have created 7 million new jobs – 5 million more than Government experts projected during the previous administration.

We're still thinking through the contours of what's going to be in that next package, Bharat Ramamurti, the deputy director of the National Economic Council, told reporters Tuesday.
This would give Americans who missed the most recent sign-up period, which ended December 15, access to Obamacare policies -- and to federal assistance to pay for them. Roughly 15 million uninsured people could benefit, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation.
RYAN: Well, we'll see -- we'll see what we have to do when we get our score. Because as you know, you don't -- when you go to authorizing committees, you typically don't go with your score ready. When we get our score, I'm sure we'll probably have to make some tweaks and adjustments. That happens every time we do reconciliation.
But the second reason is a lot of people have friends and family members that do have concrete housing. Puerto Rico, a lot of the infrastructure is built on hard concrete. And although some of the people may leave the coastal lines on flooding areas and on vulnerable housing, there are a lot of people that have strong concrete houses.
We gather here to mourn the passing of American greatness, the real thing, not cheap rhetoric from men who will never come near the sacrifice he gave so willingly, nor the opportunistic appropriation of those who live lives of comfort and privilege while he suffered and served, McCain said at the time.

Governor Snyder, however, doesn't agree with the concept of block grants, saying handing states a chunk of money without any preconditions won't work.
I've heard many political scientists say, though, that the way you sell a policy that helps Black or brown people is to make it race-neutral. They say, for example, when Obamacare was seen as something pushed for by a Black president for people of color, it wasn't popular. But now that it's seen as a program that benefits White people, it's more popular.

On Sunday night, the two remaining mainstream candidates will face off in a CNN debate, and on Tuesday they will contend in primaries in Arizona, Florida, Illinois and Ohio.
The President unilaterally decided to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program put in place by former President Barack Obama to give children of undocumented immigrants long in the US a temporary protected status. Trump had routinely criticized the program in the past and started the process of ending it before Republican governors could sue to end it in courts. Republicans who control Congress could not fix the program within an arbitrary six-month deadline he set, although courts have since intervened and said he couldn't just end it the way he did.

As the world bears witness tonight, America is a land of heroes. This is the place where greatness is born, where destinies are forged, and where legends come to life. This is the home of Thomas Edison and Teddy Roosevelt, of many great Generals, including Washington, Pershing, Patton, and MacArthur. This is the home of Abraham Lincoln, Frederick Douglass, Amelia Earhart, Harriet Tubman, the Wright Brothers, Neil Armstrong, and so many more. This is the country where children learn names like Wyatt Earp, Davy Crockett, and Annie Oakley. This is the place where the pilgrims landed at Plymouth and where Texas patriots made their last stand at the Alamo.

The second problem with the current structure of the program that people perhaps don't understand is a lot of these companies are not directly hiring employees from abroad. They are hiring a consulting company like Tata, for example, out of India. That company then hoards up all of these visas. They hire workers. You hire - Disney or some other company hires this company.

A second attempt at Healthy Utah made it through the state Senate at the time, but hit a brick wall in the House. After that there were a series of incremental expansions, which kept the topic alive at the legislature every year, but the debate really flared up again when the ballot initiative started gaining momentum.
Rich guys and radicals can't beat Trump. The former South Bend mayor began with this theme, mentioning that the Democrats need to wake up as a party after Super Tuesday and warning that both Sanders or Bloomberg would be risky choices. He noted that Sanders' all the way attitude leaves most people out and warned against nominating anyone too polarizing. Buttigieg stayed consistent in this message, closing with a reminder that there's a middle ground between revolution and the status quo.

Amon noted that China's own official figures, as of 2017, listed about 2.5 million people registered as drug addicts. A 2016 report from the Brookings Institution noted that the number of registered addicts had increased every year since the government's first annual drug enforcement report in 1998.

ABC and NBC both led their nightly newscasts with coverage of the bill (CBS led with the latest news regarding President Trump's suggestion that he had tapes of his conversation with former FBI Director James Comey, but discussed health care later in the broadcast), ending a long period in which the issue was almost completely overshadowed.

COOPER: But one of the arguments is that the FBI made a mistake, essentially, that Apple was willing to help them get access to the Cloud of this particular user, but the city which owned the phone along with the FBI changed the password remotely thereby making it impossible for Apple to help the FBI get access to the Cloud.
It is likely that Trump's staff, not Trump himself, was primarily responsible for this error, but nonetheless, what he told the country was not true.
No matter the trials we face, no matter the challenges to come, we must go forward together.
Facts First: That is not exactly what happened. Trump did make a joke at a 2018 campaign rally in Arizona about Democrats wanting to give undocumented immigrants a free Rolls-Royce -- but then, at a rally the next day in Nevada, he made a non-joking claim that Democrats want to give them cars. He continued to joke about a Rolls-Royce in particular, but he was challenged on the assertion of fact.
Tonight, I stand before you to share the incredible results.

Trump claimed of the Obama-era Waters of the United States rule: They took away their rights. If you had a puddle in the middle of your farm, they said it was a lake, it was a river, it was a -- I mean, they virtually said it was an ocean, right? You had no right; you couldn't get anywhere near it.
Gary Clyde Hufbauer, a nonresident senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said that George W. Bush granting China the status of permanent normal trade relations in 2001 was far bigger than Trump's preliminary deal with China, covering a far greater number of subjects (tariffs, non-tariff barriers, investment and others). Hufbauer also noted that it is not clear if the China deal's pledged increase in purchases of US exports -- $200 billion in additional purchases over two years -- will actually materialize.
Ironically 2016, the year he won the Republican nomination, was the last time Trump did not appear at CPAC. In the midst of the GOP primary season, Trump backed out of his CPAC slot that year after some activists accused the CPAC organizers of being too close with him. Instead, he stuck to the campaign trail, including attending a massive rally in Orlando.

DRUCKER: Since the Republicans won back the House in 2010, they have not had a moment of accomplishment like this. So it's a very big deal for them. The challenge now is to sell this politically to the voters. And they do have a bit of an uphill climb.
How exactly that will come to be – and whether it will be a blessing or a curse for Republicans in 2020 – is still unclear.
Candidates, you can now take your positions behind the podiums while I briefly explain the rules. As moderator, I will attempt to guide the discussion, asking questions and followups.

MORGAN: That's not the endgame. The end game is they want to get at Barack Obama, right? And by the way, it's not just the Republicans who is guilty of this. There'd been 17 shutdowns in America each one of them to me is a complete disgrace. The idea that this great superpower simply repeatedly shuts down its government although, I think its petty squabbling, it's pretty shameful.

I'd be willing to walk from this interview and sit down immediately with Republican colleagues, we've been trying to for six years, and say, 'Let's improve on this system,' Stabenow said. But you don't do that by burning down a house when you say you want to renovate it. You don't start by burning it down. And that's exactly what you're doing.

By now, Trump should be wishing that the Federal Reserve Bank had ignored his pressure to lower interest rates.

Two prerequisites are necessary to assess the merits of the Department of Justice suit to block the merger of AT&T and Time Warner – which US District Judge Richard Leon resoundingly rejected Tuesday.

Trump's decision to support a ruling that would fully dismantle Obamacare, even as his administration has no viable alternative, is a risky gamble. If the ruling is upheld by higher courts, about 20 million Americans could lose healthcare coverage on Trump's watch.
Collins called on senators to produce a series of bills aimed at addressing pressing issues in health care. She said the first issue the Senate should focus on would be to stabilize the insurance markets.
After all, while plenty of Republicans didn't agree with McCain's much-touted renegade nature – and his willingness to buck party leadership – no one ever questioned the man's service to the country (in the military and in elected office). And doing so was seen as the easiest way to destroy your political future.

If the party wants to keep health care on the front burner, Cole said, that is entirely on the Senate.
The legislation, which is expected to be voted on Friday, would hit those making less than $10,000 a year so hard because these folks receive hefty amounts of government assistance from Obamacare. Many benefit from the expansion of Medicaid to low-income adults, while those who earn just a bit more receive generous subsidies that lower their premiums, deductibles and co-pays.
Now, what you're doing is you're looking at the chase there that took place. The woman who tried to sort of move -- maneuver her car and was when she backed in to one of the police cruisers that the police began jumping out of the way and then opening fire, that's an area, Piers, where because it is so high valued that any threat to that area, police are authorized to use deadly force.

The Affordable Care Act required nonprofit hospitals to take several steps to retain their federal nonprofit status, including establishing written charity care policies. Hospitals must determine whether patients are eligible under their policies and provide it for those who are. They also must limit how much uninsured patients are charged and restrict aggressive billing and collections activities. Under those rules, nonprofit hospitals are barred from initiating extraordinary collection actions (such as reporting to credit bureaus, garnishing wages or placing a lien on property or taking legal action) until 120 days after the first billing statement is sent.

Trump's decision not to withdraw from NAFTA came only after Trump consulted with members of his Cabinet as well as business and congressional leaders, a senior White House official said Thursday.
It is true, the judge noted, that the action imposed staggering costs on both the defendants while delaying the merger. As he also pointed out, however, the costs to the department were mammoth, too.

Mayors are also jumping into the fray. A bipartisan group of more than 100 mayors sent a letter to Congress this week with their wish list, which includes continuing protection for those with pre-existing conditions and maintaining free preventative care.

Peter R. Orszag, who was director of the Office of Management and Budget when the ACA was passed, wrote a glowing editorial in the Journal of the American Medical Association in which he hailed the substantial deceleration in health care costs.

After the administration kicked off the week with its surprise shift to supporting the invalidation of the Affordable Care Act in the Texas case, Trump has been beating the drum constantly, thrusting the thorny issue into the center of the political arena even as federal judges in other cases ruled against him. On Wednesday, one jettisoned the administration's approval of Medicaid work requirements in two states and another on Thursday blocked a rule that would make it easier for small businesses to band together to buy health insurance, which could undermine Obamacare.
Monday wasn't the first time McCain offered a strong rebuke of the President's character.
Trump went on to tout the US military and the deaths of ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi and Iranian General Qasem Soleimani, which prompted USA chants from the crowd. He then slammed Democrats Bernie Sanders and Nancy Pelosi, whom, he claimed opposed our action to saved American lives.

The House vote could be difficult, however. Obamacare payments will be tough to swallow for conservatives. And defense hawks concerned about continued temporary funding of the military may not be willing to go along with a short-term fix.
Before the Affordable Care Act (ACA) Ohio had a very competitive health insurance market -- many companies offered plans so prices were relatively lower compared to other states, the fact sheet said. New regulations from ACA have driven some companies out of Ohio and made it harder for them to do business, both of which have driven up the cost of health insurance in Ohio.

We've also exposed agencies and high-ranking officials who violated fundamental precepts of public service. We've put bills on the President's desk to repeal Obamacare and block implementation of onerous EPA rules.

The primary in Illinois' 3rd Congressional District was another test of whether a progressive female candidate could unseat a Blue Dog Democrat, whose local loyalties have been fading as his district changes, and whether the House Democratic conference would be even less of a big tent on abortion rights.
Orszag and Kocher's contradictory conclusions beg the question: If the original architects of the ACA themselves are confused over the success or failure of the ACA, then shouldn't we all be? Is Hillary Clinton right when she says this a good law that requires incremental changes? Or is Donald Trump right when he says the law should be repealed outright?
But Trump and his White House did not come to learn the limitations of his presidency and the realities of governing until after the bruising first weeks of his presidency.

And I think at the same time, for the 11 and a half million who are here, then in my view if they have not committed a crime since they've been here, they get a path to legalization. Not to citizenship. I believe that program can pass the Congress in the first 100 days.
I ask the men and women of this Congress: Look at the opportunities before us! Our most thrilling achievements are still ahead. Our most exciting journeys still await. Our biggest victories are still to come. We have not yet begun to dream.
Former House Speaker John Boehner called Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz Lucifer in the flesh, in a withering interview at Stanford University published Thursday.
Trumps said twice that President Barack Obama left him 142 judicial vacancies.
So, what we have to do is go step by step, person to person and figure out if we can fortify their confidence and fortify their security. If we can't do that, we've got to ask them to leave because nefarious leaking is disloyal to the president, is disloyal to the institution of presidency and it's bad for America, Chris.
Third: Trump said he recently got three calls from people that took (hydroxychloroquine) and they're giving it credit for saving their lives. He has Trump said he recently got three calls from people that took (hydroxychloroquine) and they're giving it credit for saving their lives. He has cited stories like these in the past. It's a good thing when anyone gets better, but these are just anecdotes from some of the 1.1 million Americans known to have the coronavirus. They don't carry the same weight as actual scientific evidence.
VAN JONES, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: The platform is horrible. I think the pick of Pence is very disturbing because of his position on LGBT. But what we just saw was beautiful. What we just saw was history. What we just saw was something that if you had told us hey, Donald Trump was unlikely, but this was unlikely.

But states look at one's income at the current point in time when determining eligibility, said Allison Orris, counsel at Manatt Health, a professional services firm. The monthly limits are roughly $1,470 for an individual and $3,000 for a family of four. Participants, however, are required to report changes in earnings in the future.
On the flip side, the House bill would jettison two taxes that fall on individuals making more than $200,000 and couples making more than $250,000, starting this year. So wealthier taxpayers would benefit most from the bill.
That brings you more choice, more competition and lower prices for the vast, vast majority of Americans who are not in the pre- existing condition category.
I also believe that there are lots of approaches, because there's not even one ready bill; it's not like there's a bill that's ready that can do everything because the Medicare program, of course, is designed for seniors. It's not designed for younger people, low-income people, etc. So there's a lot of un-sexy dirty work that has to happen, to make these policies work, to get public support for them. To vet them, to drive them.

Good evening to all of you. Thank you for being bright and chipper and joining us this evening. I appreciate it.
Though designed to combat the economic impact of the pandemic, these interventions are precisely the same actions needed to safeguard families and communities from addiction. To be clear, although the stimulus package extends Obamacare coverage for many people and ensures they can access health care, the bill does not specifically dedicate funds to expanding substance use treatment. But I assert that by investing in the social determinants of health, this bill is likely to go far towards preventing addiction and overdose deaths in the long term. The current stimulus package will build on the $4.25 billion in funding for mental health and substance use treatment in last December's pandemic relief bill. These funds will help ensure that, amid the enormous grief many in America are feeling, people can get the help they need in the short term.

Haaland is at risk of becoming the focal point of Republican attacks on Biden's recommitment of the United States to fighting global warming -- which saw him quickly rejoin the Paris climate accord after taking office.
ROGERS: If anyone can do it, it will be him.
SANDERS: I haven't heard those comments, or had a chance to speak with any (ph) about it. But I know that the goal is to work with all of the relevant departments, primarily the Department of Defense, to lawfully implement that new policy.
We give Trump significant latitude to make errors when quoting people on television, but we call it a false claim when he alters the meaning of the quote with major changes or omissions.
Biden's stance is less clear. He has supported retaining the filibuster in the past but hedged in comments last summer, saying his posture could change depending on how obstreperous (Republicans) become. Asked on Friday where Biden currently stands, White House press secretary Jen Psaki would say only that his position has not changed.
BERMAN: All right, Gary Cohn --
The President kicked off a slew of false claims Sunday night with one he's made several times before, aimed at a familiar target: the Obama administration. Trump accused the previous administration of doing nothing to address AIDS.
Marc was a great partner in helping Republicans advance major tenants of our legislative agenda including regulatory and tax reform and the rebuilding of the military, the Wisconsin Republican said in a statement to CNN. I thank him for his service and wish him all the best in his next chapter.
BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: And there's one way out of this reckless and damaging Republican shutdown, Congress has to pass a budget that funds our government with no partisan strings attached.
Trump said this is what happened when he claimed that Democrats would give undocumented immigrants Rolls-Royce luxury cars: You know, I one time said, 'We're going to get everybody a Rolls-Royce,' and CNN or one of them said, 'They never said -- and they never promised -- a Rolls-Royce, Donald Trump lied tonight.' I said, 'Every illegal alien will have a Rolls-Royce.' They said, 'He lied tonight.' -- January 14 campaign rally in Milwaukee, Wisconsin
Anthem says in its own suit that Cigna has waged a campaign to sabotage the merger.
Also, it's quicker to pump money into marketing budgets than to increase grants to the navigators, said Sabrina Corlette, co-director of the Center on Health Insurance Reforms at Georgetown University.

Then he proceeded to go on a worldwide apology tour apologizing for the United States of America. Our friends and allies quickly learned America could not be counted on. I'll tell you, when I travel abroad, when I meet with heads of states and defense ministers and foreign ministers, they say over and over again, it is hard to be friends with America; we can't count on America; America doesn't stand with us.

The expectation is that changes to the House bill will happen in the Senate, but not in a formal committee markup like last week in the House. Instead, the current plan for Democrats is to take their bill -- with some potential changes that have been ironed out privately -- directly to the Senate floor.

WOLF BLITZER, CNN ANCHOR: Our new poll, you know this well, Mark, has the president's job approval number is around 35 percent right now.

Trump's most notable work on the deal front has focused on busting or damaging them, as he did with the Trans-Pacific Partnership (a massive bipartisan trade deal that other Asian countries are now renegotiating without the US), the Paris climate accord (by withdrawing the US) and the Iran nuclear deal (by threatening to reimpose sanctions on Tehran).

At her event in Goffstown, Klobuchar pitching herself as a candidate who can win independent and lean Republican voters. She pledged to go everywhere, not just where it is comfortable, but where it is uncomfortable and outlined a platform that included overturning Citizens United, reinstating the Voting Rights Act, rejoining the Paris Climate Accord and getting on the path toward a public option for health care.
Which leads to speculation. Two of the four liberals are over 80 and could possibly step down during the term of the next president. The liberals' voting power -- and the ability to grant cases -- would significantly diminish if a Republican wins. One wonders if agreeing to take the challenge next term and not during this one (requiring an opinion before the election) was a compromise.
Even if the package passes, Summers warns that spending more than necessary on Covid relief may complicate Biden's ability to corral votes for a second legislative priority with a yet-larger price tag. Though its cost and elements remain in flux, a Build Back Better proposal expected this spring could contain $3-trillion worth of investments in infrastructure and other investments in long-term economic growth and equity.
But when it comes to follow through, at least in his first 100 days in office Trump has come up short on the bite, failing to deliver on his toughest campaign promises.
President Trump has been pretty clear that he's going to try to use the idea of socialism as a point of attack against Democrats.
Yet Strain sees an opening for Trump to brighten a national economic debate that has emphasized shrinking opportunities for middle- and working-class Americans.

party is divided, and they face head winds and wave numbers, they are going to after passing a deficit fund and tax cut make it up to the Freedom Caucus bypassing the entitlement reform. These mean Republicans cut your entitlement programs that you paid into and I'm never going to do that. They have enough trouble getting through the week without fighting with President Trump or each other. The idea that they will get grannies pushed off and when they wonder how they will find the support to turn enough voters out I think is the craziest thing I have heard this entire year.
Trump has chosen not to warn Americans about economists' dire forecasts for the coming months. Instead, he has assured people that the economy can recover very, very quickly.

We have successfully renegotiated new trade deals with South Korea and Japan, who were really ripping us. South Korea -- remember, Hillary Clinton -- the great Hillary Clinton -- she said, 'No, no we want this deal. It will produce 250,000 jobs.' And she was right, for South Korea. They produced -- (laughter) -- it's true. It got South Korea 250. So you can't say she was wrong. She wasn't misleading us.

He's talking here about Medicare for All, which would completely replace the US health care system. Read more about that here. He doesn't mention Obamacare, which he failed to repeal, but has been trying to suffocate. Republicans have not offered a workable health care plan of their own.

Worse, once again Trump could not resist interrupting Clinton, or making coarse comments -- like his statement that if he were president, he would have a special prosecutor investigate her and that she would be jailed. Does he not understand that using the judicial branch to go after your political opponents is against the law? His statement that Clinton has tremendous hate in her heart showed a stunning lack of self-awareness from the man who has disparaged Latinos, immigrants, a Gold Star family, a former Miss Universe, and people with disabilities -- among others.
RUBIO: All right, first of all, the embassy is the former consulate. It's the same building. So it could just go back to being called a consulate. We don't have to close it that way. Second of all, I don't know where Cuba is going to use, but if they sue us in a court in Miami, they're going to lose.
We had a very small voter-outreach program, Newman said of her 2018 campaign. But as of Friday, she boasted that 3,000 volunteers had knocked on more than 100,000 doors.

TRUMP: I think it was intentional, because I'm leading by so much. Honestly it got me here. That attitude got me here. But now it's time, and I'm very focused on policy.
But Trump now seems to recognize the House Freedom Caucus's history as a rabble-rousing collection of leadership agitators, and being a part of a group the White House thinks brought down its first major legislative effort could be a politically vulnerable position.

The Pennsylvania state unemployment rate was at 4.5% in December 2019, worse than the best rates under presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush. (The rate increased steadily in 2019 from the 3.8% rate in of April, May and June, which was the state's lowest rate since at least 1976.)
RUBIO: No. And I - and I think you've outlined why. The numbers don't add up. You know, when I ran for the Senate in 2010, I came out and said we're going to have to make changes to Social Security, and everyone said that's the end of your campaign. In Florida, you can't talk about that, but people know that it's the truth here in Florida.
President Donald Trump has been adamant about one point this week: The Republican Party will soon be known as the party of health care.
Many patient advocacy groups have also spoken out against the Trump administration's move, saying they're concerned it could lead to more instability in the individual and small business markets and leave policyholders paying more for needed care.
There are still some fans of bipartisanship in Washington. But impeachment is a very partisan affair.
Facts First: ISIS was not overrunning the Philippines three years ago. The US was : ISIS was not overrunning the Philippines three years ago. The US was one of several countries that aided the Philippines in a 2017 battle against militant groups linked to ISIS; the US did not succeed singlehandedly.

I must say, that was a VERY boring debate. Biden lied when he said I want to cut Social Security and Medicare. That's what they ALL said 4 years ago, and nothing happened, in fact, I saved Social Security and Medicare. I will not be cutting, but they will. Be careful! -- March 15 tweet
President Donald Trump has made some grand promises on health care.
Arriving hours before the Senate enters into high-wire, public negotiations over a potential immigration deal, the administration's specific ask on new funding for the border is pretty much an afterthought. The White House has spelled out its four pillars for a deal, and border security will feature heavily in any agreement.
Later in the interview, he offered this telling nugget – one you might hear, in a different key, from Democrats in 2018 – on the prospect of a short-term deal to end that impasse.
BLITZER: Melania. We haven't seen her here since she gave that speech Monday night.
COOPER: Amy, did you know she was in D.C.?
DRUCKER: I'm going to laugh because the House Freedom Caucus used to call that a fake cut that didn't do anything about the problem. I will say this. At end of Speaker Ryan's press conference, he went on to talk about the opportunity he sees in the first part of next year. Politically it will be way too difficult, and President Trump won't want to go there. They might want to make an attempt to do this around welfare reform and Republicans don't haven't gotten behind before.
Roger Stone, just so you know, never worked -- he didn't work for my campaign. There might've been a time -- way early, long before I announced -- where he was somehow involved a little bit. But he was not involved in our campaign at all. -- February 18 exchange with reporters before Air Force One departure

DOUGHERTY: Anderson, you know, I didn't hear a lot of really new information at all. I mean I think, I and some others who were watching it at the time were really struck by the fact that it really turned into his sparring, and it was very, very personal between, you know, the Republicans and the Democrats.

​I am going to take care of everybody. I don't care if it costs me votes or not, Trump said. He added: ​The government's gonna pay for it.
Okay, it sounds kind of comedic when the President of the United States complains extremely inaccurately about dishwashers. But as we explained when we called this the most notable Trump lie of December , it's also serious stuff. Trump is using his false claim that modern dishwashers require more water and electricity than older dishwashers to try to sell an effort to weaken efficiency standards.
MIAMI GARDENS, FLORIDA - MAY 06: Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis speaks during a press conference at the Hard Rock Stadium testing site on May 06, 2020 in Miami Gardens, Florida. Gov. DeSantis announced during the press conference that a COVID-19 antibodies test will be available. The test can show if a person has had the virus in the past without showing symptoms, and therefore may be immune to it. The test will be available to first responders and health care workers first, with the goal of being able to expand testing to the general public. (Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)
There is no doubt that the wealthiest Americans have gotten wealthier under Trump, though others have also gained.
President Reagan wanted to continue aiding the Contra rebels in Nicaragua, but Congress, run by Democrats, opposed the plan. Reagan had threatened to veto a spending bill unless the aid was included. The Democrats also waged a fight to save the Fairness Doctrine, which required broadcasters to offer opposing viewpoints on the air (although by the mid-'80s, federal agencies had stopped enforcing it). There was a brief, one-day shutdown before Reagan got his wish: the Democrats gave up on the Fairness Doctrine and agreed to send millions in nonlethal aid to the Contras.
Trump can accurately boast about the elimination of 100% of ISIS' self-proclaimed caliphate in Syria, but it's not true that 100% of ISIS itself has been eliminated; the terrorist group existed before it seized territory and continues to exist after it lost that territory. ISIS is still a threat in the wars in Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan; ISIS affiliates continue to claim responsibility for attacks elsewhere; and the US government continues to warn about ISIS' ability to inspire homegrown terrorists around the world.

Facts First: It has not been proven that Mueller had been seeking the job of FBI director when he met with Trump in May 2017. Mueller's testimony to Congress -- that he met with Trump because he had been asked to provide advice on the vacant job of FBI director, not because he was seeking the job again -- has been corroborated by former senior Trump aide Steve Bannon.

The unemployment rate for Americans with disabilities is lower than at any point in the Obama administration, but it did go up from 6.1 percent in September of last year to 7 percent in December.

Clean coal is an industry term for particular technologies that attempt to reduce the many environmental harms caused by coal, a particularly dirty source of power. The term is not meant to be used to broadly describe coal itself, though that is what Trump generally does.
Unfortunately, the worst is not over. President Trump falsely assured the American public that we have taken all preparations necessary, but in his recently proposed budget he called for another $844 billion in cuts over the next decade primarily from Medicaid, including the Affordable Care Act's (ACA) Medicaid expansion to low-income adults and other aspects of the ACA.

Facts First: The House did not hold a trial at all. Under the Constitution, it is the : The House did not hold a trial at all. Under the Constitution, it is the Senate that has the sole power to try impeachments.
Facts First: Trump was at least slightly exaggerating Green's comments. In May, Green said this: I'm concerned that if we don't impeach this President, he will get reelected. In September, when Trump previously claimed Green had said we can't beat Trump without impeachment, Green told CNN, I never said we can't beat the President.
When he finally had the chance to do it, he voted against repeal and replace, the President said. Remember thumbs down?
Trump, however, has reacted to the defeat of health care by predicting that Democrats will be willing to work with him down the road, especially if Obamacare spirals into decline. Ryan, in turn, is using that prospect to warn his own party about the risk of remaining divided.
Already, the National Retail Federation and International Franchise Association have praised the proposed rule.
GERGEN: I think there could be a negotiation, Anderson. I think we won't get there until next week. I think the public pressure and anger will rise and financial markets will get rattled and that will put pressure on. I think if the Republicans would promise President Obama we will not -- we will give you a clean debt resolution. We will not try to dismantle healthcare in exchange. In exchange, we want a short opening of the government, a short continuing resolution for a safe four weeks and then enter serious negotiations about entitlement and tax reform.

So, you know, Donald well enough by now they know that he needed that hotel. I was a young pup. He was a big guy in New York at the time and he wanted to buy the hotel. Long story short, we end up having 30 lawyers, 50 accountants, we can't get to a deal. I'm scared to death because my boss is going to fire me for selling to Trump, who's smarter, who's brighter, who's better, and who will end up getting a much better deal.

Although it is true that President Trump has 'put a lot of judges on the Ninth Circuit,' there is no chance that it will be tied by 'next week.' In fact, it probably won't be tied by next year, said Arthur Hellman, a professor at the University of Pittsburgh School of Law and an expert on the Ninth Circuit. To get a tie (or better), two Democratic appointees would have to retire. All nine of the active judges appointed by President Clinton are eligible to retire, but I doubt that any of them will do so before the November election. Unless Democratic appointees retire or leave the bench (or Congress adds new judgeships), there can't be a Republican majority or even a tie.
According to four sources familiar with the meeting, Barr argued for modifying the administration's current stance to preserve parts of the law, rather than fully back the lawsuit filed by a group of Republican states. As it stands now, the Trump administration's position seeks to invalidate the entire Affordable Care Act, signed by President Barack Obama in 2010 and commonly known as Obamacare.
Serving on the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee and chairing the subcommittee on railroads, Lipinski touted his service to the district. Although he voted against Obamacare in 2010, he's opposed GOP efforts to roll it back and argues that Newman poses a greater threat to the law because she supports Medicare for All. The Chicago Tribune editorial board took his side, writing that such massive government spending programs are unworkable and unaffordable.

Everyone has pulled in their horns. It's not worth getting into a Twitter war with the President, said Richard Evans, founder of SSR Health.
CNN reported last month that the Trump administration's response to coronavirus was being coordinated by the White House's National Security Council. But the NSC does not currently have a person dedicated to overseeing global health issues. That position was restructured in 2018, and a current official with a similar purview has less authority than the former official.
The case concerns the Affordable Care Act's requirement that employer-provided health insurance plans cover birth control as a preventive service and pits supporters of the Obamacare provision against those who say it violates their religious and moral beliefs.
Voters on both sides of the battle for the House say they are largely casting votes to support their candidate rather than to make a stand against their opponent. About 6 in 10 voters who choose the Democrat in their district say they are doing so more to vote for the Democrat than against the Republican. Likewise, 60% of Republican backers say they're casting a supportive vote for the GOP more than one against the Democrats.

The unifying theme of it all is an anti-humanist mindset that equates any difficulty or need to a moral failing. If you're poor in America, or perhaps simply not rich enough to be entirely self-reliant (maybe you work for someone else rather than leading your own highly successful enterprise), everyone wants to be your judge and jury, chief among us a President who equates economic success with personal fulfillment and validation.
Most estimates find that NAFTA had little if any impact on national employment levels, though the effect was uneven across regions and industries.
Also, small businesses with sicker workers could find themselves paying higher premiums than their peers with a healthier workforce. While companies can't exclude or charge higher premiums to individual workers based on their pre-existing conditions, the rates an employer pays as a whole are based on the health status of its workers. Under Obamacare, a small business' premium is not determined by its workers' medical history.
One of the Department of Justice attorneys who withdrew from an ongoing case over the Affordable Care Act just before the government said it would no longer defend the law has resigned.

Gupta, CNN chief medical correspondent, told Trump at a press conference, Mr. President, you talked about the flu and then in comparison to the coronavirus.

States could get waivers that would allow carriers to set premiums based on enrollees' medical backgrounds under several circumstances. Those enrollees would have to have let their coverage lapse, and the state would have to set up a risk program -- such as a high-risk pool -- that, in some cases, could provide help to those being charged higher premiums.
With Congress' effort to repeal and replace Obamacare on hold, all eyes are on whether the Trump administration will work to stabilize or undermine the health reform law. President Trump has repeatedly said Obamacare is dead. He has raised questions about whether he will try to dismantle the law by discontinuing funding for a key set of subsidies or weakening enforcement of the individual mandate.
He approached foreign relations much like his businesses, leaning on loyalists outside official diplomatic and military channels to push his most controversial efforts while insisting that he alone had the deal making prowess to deliver wins with dictators such as Kim Jong Un. Still, those efforts consistently fell short.

Facts First: While no poll directly compares the two, it's true that Obamacare is better liked. Polls done in November show Obamacare with a 10-point advantage over Trump. Subsequent polls also show former President Barack Obama's health reform law being more popular than the current president.

SUNLEN SERFATY, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Good morning to you, Alisyn.
Facts First: It's not true that House Democrats never even asked Bolton to testify: Democrats asked Bolton on October 30 to testify voluntarily on November 7. He declined to appear -- because Trump's White House directed current and former administration officials not to participate in the inquiry. Democrats decided against issuing a subpoena because they were concerned about the possibility of a lengthy court battle.
But he's retiring. Keep your eyes out for Sens. Ben Sasse of Nebraska, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Tom Cotton of Arkansas. In the House, the debate could be more unruly. We know House Speaker Nancy Pelosi will be presiding. She will call on members to speak, and again, each member will only have up to five minutes.
That's not why I do these things. I'm not here to inoculate myself, he said.
(We know this is a minor stretch, but Trump has relentlessly embellished accurate numbers by adding words like over and more than, so it's a pattern of little dishonesty rather than a one-time error.)

The Child Tax Credit would send $300 monthly checks to low-income parents with children under 6.

Cruz agregó: «Cuando John Boehner me llama Lucifer, se dirige a ustedes. Lo que le molesta a Boehner es que yo esté con el pueblo estadounidense».
The town hall format is familiar for Klobuchar, who has found success in her home state – which almost went for President Donald Trump in 2016 – by consciously visiting each of Minnesota's 87 counties, often to hold town-hall style events.
Once Democrats take control of the House next week the scrutiny is sure to heat up.
Uno de los puntos principales que los tribunales señalan es que en repetidas ocasiones, él ha hecho referencia a su política con la palabra «prohibición» a los musulmanes. Trump sigue hablando de una «prohibición» aunque esta palabra podría perjudicarlo ante los tribunales.
But under Obama alone, from 2009 through 2016, the decline was much smaller: 308,934 establishments to 291,543 establishments, a difference of 17,391 or about 6%.
Companies are also looking to make health care more accessible. Some 54% will offer health centers on or near their locations, and that number could grow to nearly two-thirds by 2020. Nearly all employers will offer telehealth services in states where it is allowed.

CNN previously reported that the senator, who had been held as a prisoner of war in Vietnam, did not want the President at his funeral. McCain's daughter, Meghan McCain, also revealed earlier this year that she wished Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner, Trump's daughter and son-in-law and senior advisers, had not attended the funeral.
The President, they said, wants to telegraph to his political base that he is standing firm on his promise to repeal the entire law despite failing to wrangle Republicans to do just that during a drawn out legislative battle in 2017, when the party held both chambers of Congress. And he is now pinning his hopes on the courts accomplishing what he and a Republican majority in the House and Senate could not.
The earlier high court postponement increased the likelihood that Trump would not be forced to turn over personal business documents before the November election and cast doubt on the investigative authority of the House of Representatives.

My father was his kryptonite in life, he was his kryptonite in death. On a personal level, I agree with you, all of us have love and families, and when my father was alive, up until adulthood, we would spend our time together cooking, hiking, fishing, really celebrating life, and I think it's because he almost died, she said. And I just thought, 'your life is spent on the weekend not with your family, not with your friends, but you're obsessing, obsessing over great men you could never live up to.' That tells you everything you need to know about his pathetic life right now.
She said, '250,000 jobs this will produce. It's going to produce 250,000 jobs.' And she was right -- for them. They got 250,000 jobs. She never said that. She said '250,000 jobs.' -- February 7 speech at North Carolina Opportunity Now Summit
Except it didn't destroy Trump. For all the hand-wringing and predictions of doom for his campaign, he just kept right on going – first to the Republican presidential nomination and then to the White House. For many of his supporters, Trump's broadsides against McCain were music to their ears – finally someone was standing up to the political establishment in Washington! Trump wasn't afraid of slaughtering a sacred cow – or all the sacred cows! He didn't care! And they loved it.
War places a heavy burden on our Nation's extraordinary military families, especially spouses like Amy Williams from Fort Bragg, North Carolina, and her 2 children – 6-year-old Elliana and 3-year-old Rowan.

For the past 7 months, she has done it all while her husband, Sergeant First Class Townsend Williams, is in Afghanistan on his fourth deployment to the Middle East. Amy's kids have not seen their father's face in many months. Amy, your family's sacrifice makes it possible for all of our families to live in safety and peace – we thank you.
The Department of Health and Human Services said it is looking into the issue.
And for me, it raises this question: If Trump treats his supposed political friends this way behind closed doors, how must he talk about – and treat – his political rivals? And what does allowing – and enabling – behavior like that from the President of the United States mean about the temperament and mindset of the most powerful man in the country?
TRUMP: Nobody that's under a regular audit -- I mean, it's just a regular audit. Almost every year, I think for 12 years, 10 years, 12 years, I get audited. Nobody would ever put out their returns that's under an audit.
But these are the wages of the Trump era. Trump's contemptible assault on federal law enforcement, his Deep State nonsense against the plainly legitimate (and effective) Robert Mueller probe, have had their toxic effect. They cast a pall over all high-profile actions and result in reflexive second-guessing of the department's motivations.
He has not delivered job gains nobody would've believed before his presidency. The 8 million jobs created during Obama's last three years in office outnumbers those created in Trump's first three.
Let me ask you, sir, Lisa Murkowski says she supports the repeal of the individual mandate. Do you think this puts the Republican plan closer to passing in the Senate?
Getting there will be a two-part task. First, governors need to decide how to handle Medicaid expansion, which funneled an extra $99 billion to the states between January 2014 and September 2015, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation.
Jen Kates, senior vice president and director of global health and HIV policy at the Kaiser Family Foundation, said Trump deserves credit for his bold 2019 plan and for proposing a funding increase for the 2020 fiscal year (after proposing cuts in previous years) -- though she said Trump's attempts to eradicate Obamacare, including its protections for people with pre-existing conditions, would hurt the effort. But President Obama also did much on HIV, Kates said, bringing domestic HIV back into the spotlight, launching the first ever comprehensive national strategy, upon which the Ending the HIV Epidemic Initiative builds, and supporting programs that led to an increase in coverage and access, particularly the ACA.
These closures didn't just hurt Black people, though -- they also denied the pleasures of the pool to White people.
A November poll by the Kaiser Family Foundation , which has tracked public opinion on the Affordable Care Act since it was passed in 2010, found that 52% of American adults had a favorable opinion of the law.

Klobuchar, unlike other candidates, has perplexed Buttigieg on the debate stage. Where he has effectively counter punted against attacks from Warren, Biden and Sanders, Buttigieg hasn't been able to hit Klobuchar with the same fire -- and the Minnesota senator is now surging after a strong debate performance and third place finish in New Hampshire.
Facts First: Trump exaggerated the size of the increase in South Korea's payments to the US for the American troops stationed in the country. As the New York Times : Trump exaggerated the size of the increase in South Korea's payments to the US for the American troops stationed in the country. As the New York Times reported in February when debunking an earlier version of Trump's $500 million claim: Under the one-year deal, this year South Korea will pay 1.04 trillion won, or $925 million, an increase of $70 million from last year's $855 million.
I mean, he is talking about if you have health insurance and you lose your job, and you have a pre-existing condition, you can continue with coverage if you pay the premiums. That's not most people's definition.
This man said that, in fact, he thought it was -- he did not condemn what they did, Biden said.
She added: We're going to be telling the story and fighting for people … this is craziness, Erin, that's going on right now, here, with the idea of repealing and unraveling the whole health care system, creating instability in one-sixth of the entire economy with no plan to replace it.
The whistleblowers have not vanished, Bradley Moss, a colleague of Mark Zaid, a lawyer for the two whistleblowers, said on Twitter in October, when Trump made another version of this claim.
The sales job isn't merely self-promotion. Because of the narrow scope required to pass the bill through a budget process, many of its benefits expire -- like increased subsidies for health insurance and an expansion of the child tax credit -- after a year. Making them permanent will require another act of Congress that would likely need some Republicans on board.
Trump is not only a relentless fabricator of his own nonsense but a gleeful purveyor of nonsense he has heard from others.
Facts First: It's not true that household income gains under Trump have already hit $10,000 in less than three years. A firm called Sentier Research found pre-tax income gains of about $5,000 between January 2017 and November 2019. Savings from energy or from regulation would be included in the pre-tax gains, not added over top of them.
Coming off the worst 10 days of any campaign in recent history, Trump desperately needed a win in order to reverse his slide in the polls. He was indeed better than in the first debate and she was not as commanding. Even so, he blew his opportunity for victory in the first 20 minutes and could never fully recover. CNN's poll found that by 57-34%, a majority of voters watching them thought she got the best of him.
U.S. President Joe Biden speaks during a press conference on the American Rescue Plan in the Rose Garden of the White House on March 12, 2021 in Washington, DC. President Biden signed the $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan Act into law that will send aid to millions of Americans struggling from the COVID-19 pandemic.
What is the standard for you to call for someone to step down? Is the accused entitled to due process before he is forced to resign?
We can't be sure why Republicans are now significantly less willing to get the vaccine, but remember Democrats have pretty much always said they were more concerned about Covid-19 than Republicans. It wasn't until mid-November, just after Trump's defeat in the presidential election, that the partisan gap began to really emerge in the Axios/Ipsos polling on vaccines. The bottom line is that there's still a lot of work to be done on vaccine hesitancy. Lives literally depend on it.
BOOKER: I don't necessarily agree with that. There's a large lead right now but there's still time. Look, when I draw the issues up, I see issues I disagree with, whether the earned income tax credit, Planned Parenthood, regional greenhouse gas agreements. Whether it's basic issues, frankly, when it comes to things like marriage equality.
TAPPER: So, I want to start with what's going on in Virginia.

Case: Little Sisters of the Poor v. Pennsylvania & Trump v. Pennsylvania
THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.
House Democrats are launching hearings and investigations into the Trump administration and working with their Senate counterparts to unveil sweeping new policies on matters such as health care and climate change.
It will increase federal subsidies and decrease premiums in order to ensure that no one pays more than 8.5% of their income to purchase meaningful and comprehensive health coverage, he said. And it incentivizes states to expand coverage to an additional four million people with low incomes, and provides states the opportunity to extend coverage for a year to low-income women who have recently given birth.

Story highlights Trump's 100th day in office falls on Saturday He's had trouble moving on some of his agenda items
Trump made just nine false claims in the week from December 23 through December 29, the lowest of any week we have counted. Trump has been in Florida since December 20, and he has made few public remarks and had little on his public schedule since a 15-false-claim speech to conservative student group Turning Point USA on December 21.
This fight will have a new resonance on Wednesday given the role Bloomberg is expected to play in the debate. The former New York Mayor, by offering a similar set of moderate policy prescriptions as Buttigieg and Klobuchar, is looking to court some of the same voters and conversations with supporters of each campaign here in Nevada highlight how Bloomberg has made inroads with moderate Democrats.
Of course, members of the caucus weren't the only Republicans opposed to the health care bill. A collection of moderates including Rep. Charlie Dent of Pennsylvania and powerful House Appropriations Chairman Rodney Frelinghuysen, of New Jersey, had also come out against the bill.
Which is also convenient for him because his party controls the entire government and they're simply not able to get anything done. And I don't mean this rhetorically, it's just a fact. That's because of Donald Trump. I really think that this Congress could have passed a lot, but they have someone at the head of their team who is entirely dysfunctional and won't tell the truth.
The causes of some them may surprise you.
Look at where this got us. The worst recovery since World War II. Flat wages, and an economy limping along. Stagnation is a breeding ground for a class based society where elites predetermine the outcome of our lives. They will tell you this. Just hand over more freedom to the bureaucrats and they will figure it out. They know more. We'll be OK. Hand over more of your hard-earned dollars to the IRS and it will be OK. There is your scam right there.
And when you -- when you have that kind of partnership and you pitch that to the local community, you'll get the kind of support you need to bring 25,000 jobs. We'll gladly take them in Maryland.
States could also require able-bodied Medicaid recipients to work, participate in job training programs or do community service.
A group of House Democrats, led by Massachusetts Rep. Joe Kennedy III, sent a letter Wednesday to Health & Human Services Secretary Alex Azar and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Administrator Seema Verma opposing the plan, saying it defies Congress and the federal Medicaid statute.
Warren's staunchest supporters are upset. After a pair of disappointing performances in Iowa and New Hampshire, they feel like the Massachusetts senator has been written off and out of the narrative around a primary still in its earliest stages.

Still, repealing Obamacare without replacing it would throw the individual market into chaos, prompting insurers to start exiting swiftly. Lawmakers wouldn't have a lot of time to come up with a replacement, said Cynthia Cox, associate director at the Kaiser Family Foundation.

Trump's remark about the funeral came as the President has continued to denigrate the dead senator's legacy.
In an early exchange during Tuesday night's Democratic presidential debate, Bloomberg told Sanders that (Russian President) Vladimir Putin thinks that Donald Trump should be President of the United States, and that's why Russia is helping you get elected.
Another key promise Trump repeatedly has made is that his health plan will lower costs. In January, for example, President-elect Trump told the Post that his plan would include lower numbers, much lower deductibles.
Remember the Obamacare, right?... Remember? It was going to cost $5 million. It cost $15 -- no, $5 billion, right? Five billion. It still didn't work. It still didn't work. -- February 7 speech at North Carolina Opportunity Now Summit
Still, the former vice president may still have his work cut out in overhauling Sanders. While South Carolina may provide a preview of the several state contests on Tuesday, Alabama and North Carolina for instance, Sanders is favored in delegate-rich states like Texas and California.

As she battles her fourth bout of cancer, she remains on the bench often piping up early during oral arguments, subtly jousting with her conservative colleagues.
It would be easy, and surely popular with many resistance liberals, for Pelosi to wave the impeachment flag or focus on Trump to the exclusion of other, less grabby policy proposals. But Pelosi seems to understand where Democrats are strong (with the anti-Trump crowd, naturally) and where they need to improve their standing (with voters looking for a positive alternative).
Trump promised twice to always safeguard protections for people with pre-existing conditions, once claiming, We left it.
Bans discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity.
I think we are moving on to tax reform but that doesn't mean we can't do more than one thing at a time, he said, adding that Senate Republicans should not vote on health care again unless there is a reasonable chance of success.
Bloomberg also claimed the 95% was prompted by his realization that the situation was out of control. He does not mention that the decline began right around the time a federal judge signaled she would rule against stop and frisk, nor that he continued to be a vocal defender of stop and frisk for years after his professed realization about the harms of the policy.
Even if lawmakers repeal parts of Obamacare soon, the program will likely remain in effect for another year or two to give government agencies and insurers time to adjust. The Trump administration has promised a smooth transition during this period.
Michael Horowitz, inspector general for the Justice Department, found basic and fundamental errors in the FBI's handling of applications for surveillance of former Trump campaign foreign policy aide Carter Page under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.

SANGER: That's right. So a few things about this. First, this is exactly where Kim Jong-un wants to be. He wants to be right on par with the president of the United States.
The President, they said, wants to telegraph to his political base that he is standing firm on his promise to repeal the entire law despite failing to wrangle Republicans to do just that during a drawn out legislative battle in 2017, when the party held both chambers of Congress. And he is now pinning his hopes on the courts accomplishing what he and a Republican majority in the House and Senate could not.

And to Chalian's point, we've heard out of the president's own mouth, both when he was with Macron in France and with Maggie Haberman, at the New York Times, both times saying, yes, the meeting in addition to talking about adoption was also about opposition research, and who wouldn't go to that kind of meeting.

Facts First: Trump administration has repeatedly supported : Trump administration has repeatedly supported bills that would weaken Obamacare's protections for people with pre-existing conditions. Trump is currently supporting a Republican lawsuit that is seeking to declare all of Obamacare void. He has not issued a plan to reinstate the law's protections for people with pre-existing conditions if the suit succeeds, though he promised again at the town hall that Republicans would have one.
He said he probably never will like McCain, because John McCain received a fake and phony dossier.

DON LEMON, CNN HOST: What a week. This is like maybe two weeks in one day with everything that came out today, don't you think?
It is possible Trump was taking an actual poll result and adding nine points because of what he claims is a phenomenon in which his supporters decline to tell pollsters that they support him. But even if there are some shy Trump supporters, that's just not how approval ratings work; you can't take the findings of a poll and give yourself a guessed number of additional approval points.
Many people assume their expenses will drop once they retire, but that's not necessarily true. Indeed, a 2015 study that examined changes in household spending in retirement found that nearly half of retirees actually spent more after leaving their jobs, at least in the initial years after retiring. So if want to accurately gauge whether you'll have enough income to cover your retirement living costs if you leave your job early, you need to have a realistic fix on what you're actually likely to spend.
DANA BASH, CNN ANCHOR (voice-over): National emergency? President Trump uses executive power to get his wall. But did he already undercut his case?
Biden's missed opportunity. He came close to articulating a strategy on North Korea. But the former Vice President missed a huge opportunity to demonstrate his experience, authority and clarity on foreign policy or why he was best credentialed to serve as commander-in-chief. It was the height of irony that the first candidate to even refer to the notion of an overall strategy was Tom Steyer -- the guy with the least foreign policy experience.

TAPPER: Mr. Trump, some of your Republican critics have expressed concern about comments you have made praising authoritarian dictators. You have said positive things about Putin as a leader and about China's massacre of pro-democracy protesters at Tiananmen Square, you've said: When the students poured into Tiananmen Square, the Chinese government almost blew it, then they were vicious, they were horrible, but they put it down with strength. That shows you the power of strength.

They said well, it's not an option, it's a brain tumor. And I said, you're not understanding what I'm saying. I don't have any insurance; I can't afford it.
Mr. Speaker, economic growth and job creation will not solve all of our problems, but it will help make all of our problems much easier to solve. This is the direction that we are choosing here today. Because we know exactly where the status quo leads us. For years, the powers that be have blocked and stone walled reform under the umbrella of an arrogant, condescending and ideology. An ideology that makes us accept less in our lives. View in the world that sees life in the economy as zero gain. Your gain comes at a loss, therefore, we can't do it.
But Trump's approach to the Justice Department, a federal agency traditionally understood to work independently from the President, can best be understood by the fact that he has said he sees himself as the country's chief law enforcement officer. Still, he's made history as the first US president to be impeached twice.

Repealing and replacing Obamacare not only would change health coverage and costs for tens of millions of Americans, it would also give a juicy tax gift to the rich.
The pace of the court's output so far this term is a reminder that, whatever today's political cycle might be, the court moves on its own schedule and its own pace, said lawyer Joshua Geltzer of Georgetown Law, who is waiting for justices to act on the future of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, an Obama-era immigration program, among other cases.
We talked about that but especially about how he and Donald Trump are going at it.
Democrats – especially the progressive left – have been making the case that the party needs to operate more ruthlessly and with less concern for airs and appearances. Here, Pelosi shrugs off a line of attack on her leadership while tucking in a jab – just for fun! – at McConnell.
Por su parte, Doug Elmendorf, exdirector de la Oficina de Presupuesto del Congreso, dijo en CNN este lunes que la afirmación de Price era «absurda».
Association health plans have existed for decades, though they have a long history of fraud and insolvency, which left some policyholders and providers on the hook for millions of dollars in unpaid claims, said experts from Georgetown University's Health Policy Institute. The Affordable Care Act largely eliminated their advantage because it required the plans to meet the same comprehensive regulations as the small business insurance market.
KASICH: I don't - I haven't seen the provisions of that bill, Jake. My initial instincts are no. And let me just say about the V.A. When a veteran comes home, they ought to have access to healthcare wherever they want to go at any time, number one.
Why he's important: It's more that Pennsylvania is important and Toomey hasn't closed the door to witnesses.
It's like government spending. It is very easy. Hillary Clinton says she'll cut waste, fraud and abuse. If only we had smarter people in Washington, that would fix the problem. You know what? That is the statement of a liberal who doesn't understand government is the problem.
The former aide also speculated about why only a few Republicans have criticized Trump's comments, saying that it's likely because they don't want to get in the Twitter crosshairs.
On Monday, McCain said she genuinely feel(s) bad for (the Trump) family and that she can't imagine having a father who does this on the weekends.
What Robbie said would be true and accurate if the Republican leadership in the Senate in particular were actually doing what they said. But they say something entirely different on the campaign trail and back in their districts, than they do here in Washington. When they're talking to you, when they're talking to lobbyists, when they're talking to donors, it's a whole different world.
So no more about this -- these three men. It had nothing to do with President Trump. What Lieutenant Governor Fairfax is going through don't have nothing to do with President Trump. Northam wearing blackface don't have nothing to do with Donald Trump.
COOPER: And how are Republicans going to react to the news?
The Senate bill would make sweeping cuts to Medicaid, get rid of the individual mandate, and eliminate Obamacare's taxes on the wealthy and insurers. It would also prevent federal funds from reimbursing Planned Parenthood for any health services it provides.
Mike Davis, who runs the Article 3 Project in support of Trump's nominees, defended Walker's actions.
In a capital accustomed to legislative gridlock, the scale of Biden's opportunity has largely escaped notice. That's partly because those economic provisions in emergency legislation to combat the coronavirus pandemic are drafted to be only temporary.
Here are the repeat false claims we have previously included in one of these roundups:
LEYLA SANTIAGO, CNN CORRESPONDENT: As Maria ripped through the island of Puerto Rico, this is what she left behind. The first images of utter devastation 10 miles west of San Juan.
Most of the questions on Monday will come from New Hampshire voters, an electorate which prizes its position as the first-in-the-nation primary and is often known for asking discerning and pointed questions.
The Freedom Caucus' tone differed greatly from the mood of the conference hours earlier. As members emerged from leadership's briefing Tuesday night, many rank-and-file members – from defense hawks to fiscal conservatives – seemed reluctant but ready to lend their support if they had to.
We've done well with health care anyway. We got rid of the individual mandate. And if you look at that, that was a big thing with Obamacare. That was the end of Obamacare. -- January 22 interview with Fox Business' Maria Bartiromo
(CNN) California has reversed several years of slipping sign ups on its Affordable Care Act exchange.
Did he wind up doing Cruz's handiwork by going at Trump, and therefore not being the positive force that he usually tries to be in these? So you have to look at it through the lens of what matters, and that gets very objective.
Clinton had a strong enough performance, but some of her fire was missing. Perhaps she wanted to give Trump the space to damage himself, but his repeated gambit of turning policy answers into personal attacks on her warranted a more energetic response.
On Monday, McCain said she genuinely feel(s) bad for (the Trump) family and that she can't imagine having a father who does this on the weekends.
Trump said of Chinese agricultural purchases: You know, the highest ever was $16 billion. -- March 3 speech to the National Association of Counties Legislative Conference
But behind every phone where we request a search warrant, there is a crime behind every crime, there's a victim.
Given the risk posed by Covid-19, it is more important than ever for people to have health coverage, the CEOs of America's Health Insurance Plans and Blue Cross Blue Shield Association wrote, referring to the disease caused by coronavirus.
Father: Robert Carson, auto factory worker
Short will be a research fellow at the Miller Center at the University of Virginia and teaching at the business school at UVA, in addition to partnering with a friend in a consulting firm.
ACOSTA: The contenders vying to be the anti-Trump insist the race is far from over.
But given the fluidity that seems to exist in the electorate, it might be possible that this debate becomes a step in revitalizing the coalition that started to come together in the summer, allowing Warren to position herself as the most unifying candidate in the Democratic pack.
One Democratic aide familiar with the Senate's process told CNN that the plan is for the House and Senate committees to work in coordination over the next week and a half to hammer out legislative text. Throughout the drafting, Democrats in the Senate will be consulting with the Senate parliamentarian to make sure their plans are actually allowed under the rules that govern reconciliation. The House will vote to pass the plan first. Then, the Senate will move.
The $1,400 relief checks in Biden's coronavirus rescue legislation have dominated the headlines. But less-familiar provisions in the giant $1.9 trillion package could have a larger long-term impact on the disparities of income and wealth that have animated Democratic politics for decades.
Over the weekend, Trump attacked the late senator in several tweets that targeted McCain's ties to the controversial Russia dossier and his vote against repealing Obamacare. He also referred to McCain as being last in his class at the US Naval Academy.
The number of Americans projected to sign up for coverage continues to be revised downward. The Congressional Budget Office lowered its estimate to 13 million enrollees for 2016, down from earlier projections of 21 million, according to its latest economic outlook.
El plan viene con un precio de 16,3 billones de dólares, pero Sanders ha dicho que «se pagará por sí mismo en 15 años».
Catherine Monson, chief executive at FASTSIGNS International, a signage and visual graphics company that has more than 600 locations and 4,200 employees in 48 states. Most of her franchisees offer coverage, but have few takers. They have been asking for years why they can't create a group health plan and offer lower-priced policies. Now, they will be able to, said Monson, a longtime advocate of association health plans.
The process of writing the bill is set to begin the week of February 8 and span at least eight committees across the Capitol. House Ways and Means Chairman Richard Neal told CNN that his committee will be working in consultation with the Senate's Finance Committee, but the massive process will also require work from the House and Senate committees on small business, Senate Health Education Labor and Pensions, House Labor and House Energy and Commerce as well as Senate Banking.
Trump's administration is also allowing states to make major changes to their Obamacare markets, which could also leave low-income, older or sicker residents with few choices and higher costs. Few states have taken the federal government up on this offer so far.
That plan, Meadows argued, didn't do enough to give assurance to the military. Meadows said Tuesday night that the House Freedom Caucus either wanted to see a one-year defense funding bill attached to the short-term continuing resolution – a nonstarter when the caucus pushed for it in December – or wanted to see Republican leaders include more funding of defense anomalies.
He played me like a Steinway piano. I then spent four months fixing everything in the hotel, a little rent-controlled tenant named Fanny Lowenstein, who was the smartest woman in the world, 83 years old, he had me buy her a piano, do the carpet. That it was one of the most amazing things I had ever seen.
We must move to universal health care. And I am so proud of the work we did as a party to protect the Affordable Car Act, Klobuchar said Sunday. We are to the point now where Obamacare is more popular than the President.
Jordan also pointed out that Ryan's positions on immigration do not sync up with many House conservatives. So all I'm saying is we need legislation in every policy area that is consistent with that we told them we were going to do and what they elected us to do. That did not happen last week, but I certainly hope it happens on immigration, Jordan said.
So why blow up the Iran nuclear deal, given that this array of impressive, independent observers say it's working?
Senator Cruz, I want to talk a little bit right now about how you gentlemen see the world. Senator Cruz, Colin Powell this week said that the nasty tone of this presidential election is hurting the image of the U.S. abroad. He said, quote, foreigners of the world looking at this are distressed. Does it matter to you what the rest of the world thinks of the United States?
But while Clinton was cool and collected, and seemed far more comfortable than he did, she had a clear strategy to wait for Trump to hang himself, instead of going for the jugular on the easy issue. She had an opportunity tonight to end his campaign for good, either by baiting him into a trap or just throwing a knockout. I'm not sure she did either.
Sanders has also drawn the support of Keila Eustaquio, a 24-year-old Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals recipient who plans to volunteer for his campaign even though she cannot legally vote for him.
So I think we can continue to work together on a better budget, a longer term budget. But if this passed, they could do it tomorrow and this would be over, we would have a budget in place to mid November, we could get through this debt ceiling crisis and then have a big debate even from a lot of arguments about what should be in a longer term budget. But we should do that in November at the appropriate time.
Trump is correct. The unemployment rate for each of these three groups is at a record low, at least since the government has been issuing data on them. Read more
Ryan's office did not provide a response to Meadow's comments.
They also often call for a mix of tax increases and spending cuts to reduce how steep either have to be.
Asked by CNN's Jake Tapper on State of the Union Sunday whether Trump and Paul agree that a replacement needs to be passed at the same time Obamacare is repealed, Conway dodged.
He's doing much better than, frankly, Jeb Bush is doing. And they're not friends. Why does he have to say, he's my friend? He goes around saying about me, he's a gifted politician, a highly-gifted politician, about me. And then, he goes, he's a great entertainer. But then, he goes hostile because he sees how well I'm doing.
On foreign policy, it was also one shocking statement after another. He said he disagreed with his running mate Mike Pence and his roundly praised statements on Syria. Pence said he would consider attacking Russia and the Syrian regime if they don't stop the slaughter in Aleppo. Trump said no, and offered a policy that surely brought cheers in Damascus and Syria. Then he made bizarre statements, such as Russia is new in terms of nuclear, we are old and tired.
White House officials were quick to tell CNN that Short had gotten ahead of White House deliberations.
More than one-third of Democratic voters going to the polls in New Hampshire's first-in-the-nation primary said health care was the most important issue in determining their vote, beating out climate change, income equality and foreign policy.
If the goal was to stop, at least temporarily, the incessant discussion of his comments on the bus with Billy Bush and the calls for him to step down, Trump was successful. He probably re-energized some of his base and turned attention back to Clinton's controversies. There were several moments when Clinton found herself on the defense and stumbled in her responses.
Changing the heath insurance marketplace under Obamacare is complicated business, and there is no universal agreement on how any legislation would affect coverage.
Klobuchar's electability in Minnesota, which has largely come by taking more politically moderate positions, has some Democrats questioning whether the senator will be able to capture the imagination of a party that has drifted to the left nationally.
Last February, the White House proposed a resolution which asked Congress to authorize the limited use of the United States Armed Forces to fight ISIS alongside the anti-ISIS coalition, but did not go so far as to authorize putting American soldiers on the ground.
And then there's the overall lack of any meaningful challenge to Joe Biden, the national front runner. Sanders challenged him a little bit on foreign policy to open the debate but that too was fairly tame. The rest of the night people just left him alone, which is nuts when you consider that for any of the rest of these candidates to win they have to defeat Biden!

Looking for a less heated topic? How about all the deals going down this year on Black Friday. Here's your guide to when stores will open their doors.
We should engage in multilingual, multilevel community health education efforts that target all communities and backgrounds in America. In a strong example of the power of reverse innovation, Ebola in West Africa taught us powerful lessons about how to create culture change around disease prevention and to reach all communities.
US childcare workers make on average $24,610 a year, the 2018 BLS data showed, more than the fast food workers. That corresponds to mean hourly wages of $11.83.
But more people flocked to the federal Affordable Care Act exchange during the most recent open enrollment period, which ran for six weeks in November and December. That's the first time sign ups increased under the Trump administration. The number of new consumers for 2021 slid somewhat, however. Roughly 8.3 million people selected plans in total.
But in Trumpland, such competence and expertise aren't a requirement but a barrier, especially when it comes to oversight duties. The incompetent man at the top is desperate not to have his inadequacy revealed.
After college Donald faced a decision, joined his father in Queens to dream big and make it in the greatest city in the world. The decision was easy.
Democrats and White House officials told CNN on Monday that they anticipate a tense few hours when Haaland appears before the Energy and Natural Resources Committee on Tuesday.
The former Delaware senator's big win in South Carolina also poses a challenge to former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who jumped into the race in the belief that Biden was a weak candidate.
Enrollees would pay no more than 8.5% of their income towards coverage, down from nearly 10% now. Also, those earning more than the current cap of 400% of the federal poverty level -- about $51,000 for an individual and $104,800 for a family of four in 2021 -- would become eligible for help.
A federal judge in Texas last month ruled that the Affordable Care Act is unconstitutional because Congress eliminated the individual mandate penalty by reducing it to $0, starting this year.

Baquet acknowledged that the murkiness of the bill-writing process has posed a problem to the Times, as well.
Trump added Wednesday that veterans were on his side during the dispute, because McCain didn't get the job done with the Veterans Administration.
CUOMO: All right. Mr. Administrator, thank you for joining us. Let us know what information we can get out that is important to people.
And so it -- I don't think that it accomplished very much when you get down to the nuts and bolts of what was learned.
You know, now he wants a box for the debates, to stand on. Okay, it's okay, there's nothing wrong -- you can be short. Why should he get a box to stand on, okay? He wants a box for the debates. Why should he be entitled to that?...Really. Does that mean everyone else gets a box? -- February 2 Super Bowl interview with Fox News' Sean Hannity
Pamela Brown to Biden: Why not carve out time to answer tough questions?
After TMZ broke the news last week that Spears had checked herself into a mental health facility, the coverage, though extensive, was comparatively muted. The consensus (rightly) seemed to be that Spears, in the face of extreme stress, had done the responsible thing by seeking help. Many other celebrities expressed their support, and voiced to their fans the importance of getting the care you need. Spears, who announced earlier this year that she was taking some time out of the limelight to focus on her family, posted on her Instagram page last week: We all need to take time for a little 'me' time.
SCARAMUCCI: Chris, I've already answered it. You're just not really a derivative thinker. I said somebody above my rank, go read the press release, Chris.
After months of railing against NAFTA, some of Trump's top aides signaled Wednesday he might withdraw from the deal altogether in the coming days.
On the subject of the immigrant children, the administration was slow to realize its moral mistake in separating the children from parents at the border. The resulting chaos is just becoming clear.
Trump claimed that, under previous administrations, Honduras and Guatemala refused to accept criminals the US wanted to deport back, even refusing to let the US land its planes on their soil.
Bizarrely, the President also boasted about his popularity on Facebook, and suddenly floated a scheme to build two new hospital ships -- a project that would take years in the event the Navy commissions them.
Trump has repeatedly inverted the timing of Schiff's comments in relation to the release of the rough transcript.
The problem is nothing looks like it did 60 years ago. The 21st Century economy simply is not creating enough jobs for people that don't have skills. When my parents came, they had a very limited education. My father stopped going to school when he was 9 years old because his mother died and he had to work. And he would work the next 70 years of his life and never go back to school. And I'm grateful every day that America welcomed them.
He took heat on sexual harassment in the workplace, redlining, stop and frisk, excessive wealth and his former support for Republican politicians. Bloomberg's responses simply weren't sufficient.
If real reform is going to be possible, that will have to change. And if it does, the second step might become more feasible: the election of federal lawmakers, en masse, who campaign on platforms demanding legislative action. We've seen some shifts in this direction on the state level and among entrenched congressional Democrats.
And it's time for Abrams to break one more barrier — as Joe Biden's vice-presidential candidate. She has many of the strengths that can help Biden win in November, including popularity among key Democratic constituencies: progressives, young voters and voters of color — and the data backs it up
He also dug into McCain's now-famous vote against a repeal of the Affordable Care Act.
SANDERS: Not at all. I think you guys are jumping and trying to make something out of nothing.
Gen. Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said in November that there would be probably in the 500-ish frame. Maybe 600 soldiers left in northeast Syria (he said the number would definitely be less than 1,000), in addition to the separate force of more than 100 soldiers stationed in southern Syria near Jordan.
But the market pulled back and gave up nearly all of its gains by the end of the day after minutes from the Federal Reserve showed that some members of the central bank felt that stocks were quite high.
CUOMO: What did you think of that dynamic of having to take both of them on?
As early as next week, they may vote to rebuke President Trump for using military action in Iran without congressional authorization,said, referring to the US strike on Iranian military general Qasem Soleimani
COOPER: Well, the family of Lillian Cary is speaking out tonight. They want you to know she is more than just a statistic in the deadly fungal meningitis outbreak. You're going to hear from them ahead.
At the side of the door there's a little nondescript man and he says Mr. Trump, Mr. Trump and Donald stops, he walks over to the door, he says Louie. He says Mr. Trump, I'm so happy to see you, and thank you for what you've done for my employees and thank you for what you do for me. And I just want you to know that my critically ill son thinks you're the greatest man in the world.
He also repeated a favorite inaccurate claim about energy — saying he ended the war on American energy and that the US is now the world's number one producer.
I mean, as an example, GDP was zero essentially for the last two quarters. If that ever happened in China. you would have had a depression like nobody's ever seen before. They go down to 7 percent, 8 percent, and it's a - it's a national tragedy. We're at zero, we're not doing anything.
Sen. Strom Thurmond of South Carolina spoke for 24 hours and 18 minutes against the Civil Rights Act of 1957 in the longest uninterrupted filibuster in Senate History, according to Senate.gov.
I think you cannot credibly argue that Justin Walker is not a judicial all-star, the majority leader told The Washington Post last month . I thought it might be a good idea to go outside the Beltway... There are plenty of DC lawyers that salivate over this job.
CNN's Veronica Stracqualursi contributed to this report.
MORGAN: Tell me this, so it's not helpful is it? If someone like Harry Reid, such a high ranking person in all this, uses his phrase like they're a bunch of anarchist, they're weirdoes and so on. It's exactly the kind of poisonous rhetoric that is just designed to get their backs off. It's not designed, I don't think, to bring people to a negotiating table.
As we pray for all who are sick, we know that America is constantly achieving new medical breakthroughs. In 2017, doctors at St. Luke's hospital in Kansas City delivered one of the earliest premature babies ever to survive. Born at just 21 weeks and 6 days, and weighing less than a pound, Ellie Schneider was born a fighter. Through the skill of her doctors – and the prayers of her parents – little Ellie kept on winning the battle for life. Today, Ellie is a strong, healthy 2-year-old girl sitting with her amazing mother Robin in the gallery. Ellie and Robin: We are so glad you are here.

And by the way, I just want to go back to your point, because I'm really not that smart. And you know that? I understand identity politics, and I understand the kinetics on stage the stage last night. And that, by the way, is important, because the ability to show your supporters, to show donors, to show other people who might be wavering in this Republican primary that you've about got some fight and you can take this guy on.
Obamacare supporters, however, argue that the changes will only further undermine the law and hurt the millions who depend on it.
Asked in April 2017 about a Saturday Night Live sketch that labeled her complicit in the White House's policy and operations, Ivanka pleaded ignorance. Not simply to the administration's troubled launch, but the word itself.
Facts First: Gone was an exaggeration. China : Gone was an exaggeration. China announced the day prior that it will lower, not eliminate, tariffs on more than 850 US products starting on January 1.
RYAN: I want to personally thank one of my predecessors, Dave Camp, who did a lot to help get us where we are.
That's just the start. As economists predict the world may soon plunge into recession, some are promoting a modest cash payment to every individual to stimulate consumption and help the most vulnerable navigate this crisis. That seems reasonable.
Advocates for nursing home residents say that relaxing penalties threatens to undo progress at deterring wrongdoing. Janet Wells, a consultant for California Advocates for Nursing Home Reform, said the changes come as some egregious violations and injuries to residents are being penalized — finally — at a level that gets the industry's attention and isn't just the cost of doing business.
MIAMI GARDENS, FLORIDA - MAY 06: Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis speaks during a press conference at the Hard Rock Stadium testing site on May 06, 2020 in Miami Gardens, Florida. Gov. DeSantis announced during the press conference that a COVID-19 antibodies test will be available.

But there was something else we noticed. Look closely at the name of this garbage facility connected to the NECC.
When we met with him as House Republicans, we met an hour-and-a-half. When he walked in the room, we stood and we clapped because he's president of the United States, but in that hour-and-a-half, Jake, he never brought up the debt, never brought up the deficit. Still, we did. He said, I'm really not that concerned about deficits.
Klobuchar spent the lead-up to the town hall with a trip through Wisconsin and Iowa, building on her campaign theme of retaking Midwest communities that have drifted away from Democrats in recent years. Klobuchar, a three-term senator from Minnesota, is pitching herself as a pragmatic lawmaker who is willing to work with those who oppose her to get things done.
Kasich: 'Unless it gets fixed, I'm against it'
In the days since, the House leadership announced the Republican Party would move on from its seven-year promise to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, and the House Freedom Caucus has taken a large share of the blame for the defeat.
Trump said seven million new jobs have been created since his election, more than government experts projected during the previous administration.
But problems became apparent immediately. The executive order sought to detain undocumented families together and it ran afoul of a law that mandated children not be detained indefinitely. And while the stated purpose was to reunite families, it's not clear that's happened much at all. In fact, the government this week made clear it had separated even more children than previously thought.
TRUMP: One of the biggest political events anywhere in the world is happening right now with the Republican Party. Millions and millions of people are going out to the polls and they're voting. They're voting out of enthusiasm. They're voting out of love. Some of these people, frankly, have never voted before - 50 years old, 60 years old, 70 years old - never voted before.
This fall, Donald Trump will be trying to get the Supreme Court to strike down Obamacare -- ripping health insurance away from 30 million Americans, ending protections for 100 million more with preexisting conditions, destroying families, and costing a million jobs, the Democratic presidential contender said in a statement. This case is a stark, life-and-death reminder how much is at stake this fall and what's on the ballot right now: Democrats must nominate the candidate whom they know can beat Trump and bring along the Senate, to ensure we can protect our health care for generations to come.
Now, Trump has issued an ultimatum: If they don't vote yes on Friday, he will move on and saddle them with the shame of failing to repeal Obamacare, a cherished GOP goal.
Facts First: Even 2020 Democratic presidential candidates who advocate the decriminalization of the act of illegally entering the country, such as Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, do not support completely unrestricted migration, as Trump suggests.
I am running because I see that sense of community is getting fractured, Klobuchar said on Sunday in Iowa. It's getting fractured by someone in the White House who gets up every morning and tweets whatever he wants but doesn't respect the amendment that allows him to do it.
A Klobuchar aide told CNN on Monday that the senator prepared for the town hall like she would for a major interview.
Facts First: Trump was not entirely clear on what he meant by it, but he left the impression that Biden had recently told NPR that his effort to oust Ukrainian prosecutor general Viktor Shokin, or the 2018 : Trump was not entirely clear on what he meant by it, but he left the impression that Biden had recently told NPR that his effort to oust Ukrainian prosecutor general Viktor Shokin, or the 2018 video of him telling the story of his effort to oust Shokin, looked bad. In fact, Biden's looked bad comment was about something different: Hunter Biden's position on the board. Specifically, Biden said the appearance of Hunter Biden's presence on the board looked bad and it gave folks like Rudy Giuliani an excuse to come up with a Trumpian kind of defense.
He then pivoted to a promise that Mexico will pay. Then, reverting to his reality TV past, he vaguely promised a dramatic reveal at some future point: And here's the thing, here's the thing, you'll see that. It'll come out. We'll do it sometime during the debate or maybe before our debate, the real debate that people are going to watch.

And so I think she's made herself a laughingstock. You -- I -- I wonder whether or not anybody around her is saying, you know, it's -- it's time to say this just isn't going to work, because I think, at this point, each time she sort of tries to take one more step to show that she wasn't claiming membership in a tribe or claiming that she was a Native American in order to get benefits, we see that it wasn't true.
Most states, however, don't have the wherewithal to make up the difference so it's likely they'll tighten enrollment, curtail benefits or trim provider rates.
The Fox News anchors asked Trump about hydroxychloroquine, an anti-malaria drug that Trump spent much of March and April promoting as a potential game-changer for Covid-19.
Some quick history -- in 2013, the Supreme Court in Shelby County v. Holder made it infinitely easier for states and localities to revert to the discriminatory policies that have haunted the United States for all of its history. For instance, in just 2016 ,14 states put in place new, restrictive voting laws for the first time. And according to the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, 1,688 polling places have been closed in formerly covered states since the Shelby County decision. The candidates need to be talking about this.

POPPY HARLOW, CNN ANCHOR: From Alaska. Alaska Senator Lisa Murkowski says she does support, including the repeal of the individual mandate of Obamacare in this bill.

Tackling the high cost of prescription drugs was one of Trump's key campaign promises in 2016. And it's been a main focus of his administration, though little has actually been done.
I want to ask you about another policy proposal that you say would help working families. It would double the Earned Income Tax Credit, expand the child tax credit. How are you going to pay for that?
They were the usual Trump allies: Rep. Jim Jordan, the top Republican on Judiciary, plus Rep. Mo Brooks of Alabama and Andy Biggs of Arizona. But even those members are still in the dark about how far some senators are going to be willing to go Wednesday.
I'm the one on this stage that had the highest voter turnout of any state in the country when I led the ticket, as well as bringing in rural and suburban voters. And I've done that as well, she said. And I'm the only one with the receipts to have done that in Republican congressional districts over and over again.
He said he probably never will like McCain, because John McCain received a fake and phony dossier.
For now at least, this is a total dead end.
Unemployment rates in the U.S. stand at 5.0%, that's 7.9 million out of work Americans. For blacks and Hispanics, the picture is bleaker (Black 8.3%, Hispanics 6.4%). And notice that Trump did not deny sending jobs to China by buying low-grade Chinese metal to build his buildings. Not exactly a winning jobs strategy for Americans.

MADDEN: ... but is to point the boat directly into the wind of Donald Trump and take him on.
The numbers might well rise as we delve deeper, but here's the preliminary list:
«Basándonos en lo que sabemos acerca de este presupuesto, la buena noticia (la única buena noticia) es que es probable que sea rechazado rotundamente por los miembros de ambos partidos aquí en el Senado, como pasó con el último», dijo el senador demócrata por Nueva York Chuck Schumer, líder de la minoría.
As we have seen, when we are united, we can make astonishing strides for our country. Now, Republicans and Democrats must join forces again to confront an urgent national crisis.
Gradually tip toeing into that arena. He understands now, I think, that he's got to start taking him on.
CAMEROTA: Governor, obviously, we know that you have weeks and months ahead of you that are going to be really challenging. We appreciate you giving us a status report. Governor Rossello, thank you very much for being on NEW DAY.
COOPER: And Heather, what do you want to see happen? I mean, who do you think should be held accountable here?
But his declaration was premature. The agreement he signed in North Korea was more of an entree into figuring out the details. And his administration, since his tweet, has reaffirmed that there is still a nuclear threat from North Korea. Obviously. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo shuttles back and forth to hammer out the hard details. Meanwhile, North Korea's nuclear program continues.
Nobody ever told me that politics was going to be so much fun, Trump declared, perhaps ironically, at a White House reception for senators on Tuesday night.
[07:00:09] SEN. TED CRUZ (R-TX), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: He's going to look to cut a deal rather than fight.

But patient advocates and health policy experts argue that these policies provide only skimpy coverage and will undermine the Affordable Care Act. Other actions the administration has taken this year include making it easier for small businesses to band together to buy coverage and slashing support for a program that helps people sign up for Obamacare.

MURPHY: Speaking of murky situations with the Saudis. Amazon founder Jeff Bezos wrote an extraordinary essay on Medium this week accusing the National Enquirer parent company of trying to extort him over explicit photographs sent to his extra marital girlfriend. In that essay Bezos refers to -- quote -- the Saudi angle.
So, there was a lot going on. It's unclear. Initially, we have been told that there was medication but there were prescriptions at the very least. And I think when you spoke to the family, they acknowledged that indeed she was on medication.

The question is, which of the many threats he faces will Biden target? Will it be Sanders, whose support among Latinos has become a major asset? Or Buttigieg or Klobuchar, who are part of a crowded centrist lane?
Average prices in the individual market would be:
TRUMP: You know what I'll say? Yes. If we don't get what we want, one way or the other, whether it's through you, through a military, through anything you want to call, I will shut down the government.
In my view, the initiative is purely Ethiopian, said Awol Allo, an associate professor of law and Horn of Africa analyst at Keele University in England, and even if we assume that the Americans have played some role, it is not clear to me how that makes Trump an obvious candidate. Trump has never been to Ethiopia and has never said a word about the conflict between these two countries, at least in public. If there is anyone who could claim some credit for the deal between the two countries, it should be Middle Eastern powers, particularly the United Arab Emirates, which had a key mediating role
SEC. 107. PROHIBITION AGAINST DUPLICATING COVERAGE. (a) IN GENERAL.—Beginning on the effective date described in section 106(a), it shall be unlawful for— (1) a private health insurer to sell health insurance coverage that duplicates the benefits provided under this Act; or (2) an employer to provide benefits for an employee, former employee, or the dependents of an employee or former employee that duplicate the benefits provided under this Act. From page 8
MOOK: I also -- I actually agree with what Ken just said. I would just add on to this. I think this is a pattern of behavior that was -- you could qualify this more, but basically, effective for him in his business life. He has a long track record. And I say this objectively, he has a long track record of not paying people, of signing a contract and just not following through on it, he bullied people all the time and wouldn't tell the truth in real estate. He's had a very topsy-turvy career. And I think at 70 years old, he has a long career behind him. I think he's pushing that forward into the White House. It just doesn't work. And Ken knows this from serving in public life. You cannot lie to people every day and the public will just move on. You're held accountable every single day and everything's under a microscope. And I agree with ken. That frustrated him but this is not running real estate in New York. This is the most important office in the world. Everything's going to get nitpicked and it will catch up with him.

Now, look. People who are going to spin it, you know, the pundits are in the business of having an opinion. They're in the business of keeping the race going. You know, you have to read all reviews through that light. This isn't like a car race where you can say objectively who won and who didn't.
Robert Mueller's 2017 meeting with Trump
Editor's Note: Watch CNN's town hall with Sen. Amy Klobuchar hosted by Don Lemon at St. Anselm College in Manchester, New Hampshire, Monday at 10 p.m. ET on CNN.
We eliminated the very unpopular Obamacare individual mandate penalty – and to give critically ill patients access to life-saving cures, we passed right to try.
Jeff Gundlach, the billionaire investor who correctly predicted Donald Trump's 2016 victory , similarly warned Wall Street last month of a looming Sanders scare for markets.
[10:35:05] CARPER: I don't know. What really starts off as tax reform has ended up being in part some more repeal of the Affordable Care Act. One of the keys in the Affordable Care Act is establishing exchanges in every state for people who don't have access to health care through their employer, through Medicaid, through Medicare. So it's the Republican idea to have the exchanges.
CNN's Brianna Keilar explains why many Republicans are hesitant to take the coronavirus vaccine.
All the while, a growing number Republican members of Congress have been publicly pushing back on Trump's comments, defending McCain.
CRUZ: Listen, if you are fed up with Washington, the question you ought to be asking is who is willing to take on Washington? It's easy to have language, I'm fed up with the corruption in Washington. But if you have a candidate who has been funding liberal Democrats and funding the Washington establishment, it's very hard to imagine how suddenly this candidate is going to take on Washington.
Este martes, Trump firmó dos decretos que autorizan avanzar en la construcción de los oleoductos Keystone XL y Dakota, detenida en diciembre pasado por el entonces presidente Barack Obama.
Some enrollees who receive premium subsidies may also have to provide more documentation to prove their eligibility. Exchanges will have to implement stronger checks to verify consumers' earnings if other data sources, such as the Internal Revenue Service, show the enrollees' income is actually below the poverty line, rendering them ineligible. Also, those who fail to file taxes and reconcile any past overpayment of subsidies will lose their assistance, even if their exchange doesn't send them a notice first.
He seems to be suggesting he and his team seems to be suggesting the Saudis had something to do with the National Enquirer obtaining these explicit photographs. What do you make of it?
Each member can only speak for up to five minutes, but all eyes are going to be on the Republican members opposed to overturning the results and whether they actually speak up knowing Trump will be watching closely. So far, we know that at least one Republican senator -- Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania -- plans to speak out at least against the objection to the Pennsylvania results.
So he has to do something to change the subject. So he declared a fake crisis, a fake emergency at the border. And then what happens is that he puts it all on Republicans to try to remedy the problem.
TRUMP: I would listen to the generals, but I'm hearing numbers of 20,000 to 30,000. We have to knock them out fast. Look, we're not allowed to fight. We can't fight. We're not knocking out the oil because they don't want to create environmental pollution up in the air.
You're going to need to get more help up here. We don't have enough people to hold the line, one officer said.
But men also swung from Sanders to Biden. They went 55% for Sanders over 44% for Clinton in 2016. This year Biden and Sanders split them about evenly. The exit polls don't tell us why.

TAPPER: Senator Rubio, last October, you said that you're, quote, generally very much in favor of free trade. More recently, you backed a away from your support of some trade deals. If elected, will you support free trade deals even if it means the inevitable loss of U.S. jobs?

Look, my job is to help unify our party. It's to take all pieces of the conservative movement in the Republican Party and help stitch them together, especially after a primary, Ryan said at a news conference. I have a very good relationship with both of these men and I'm going to keep it that way.
Trump's image is under siege, and Fire and Fury seems certain to widen the perception between the version of himself that the President wants America to see and the one that emerges from behind-the-scenes reports.
We were looking for some support, but in all sincerity, not looking for a lot of help in running the business. So that eliminated a number of the players who came around the table, he said on the call. He said that the fact that Koch Industries didn't ask for a seat on the board, either as a voting or non-voting member, without a doubt, made the offer from [Koch] the most attractive.
MECKLER: With so much opposition, whether they're going to ultimately be able to do this.
The broadening of the exemptions won't matter after this year since Congress eliminated the individual mandate penalty starting in 2019. Until now, hardship exemptions were typically granted to those who were homeless, facing eviction, had filed for bankruptcy or were in other difficult situations. People could also apply for income-related exemptions if the only plans in their areas were too costly or they earned too little to file a tax return.
TRUMP: You see what's happened. I mean, you have many religious groups that are complaining about that. They've been complaining about it for a long time.
CRUZ: We're going to end welfare benefits for anyone who is here illegally. And the thing to understand, Stephen, we can solve these problems. It's not that we don't know how to do it. It's that we're lacking the political will. Neither of the parties in Washington wants to do this.
US intelligence leaders have said that Russia routinely tries to sow discord among the American public and amplify voices on the extremes of the political spectrum, to inflame divisions and undermine the stability of American democracy. Their past support for Sanders and Trump, who have both antagonized their own parties, fits into this big-picture strategy.
When states look under the hood a little bit on some of these flexibilities, they'll find that most of them have already been offered and made available in waivers where they don't have to take a cap, Mann said.
Azar has also been at odds with Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Administrator Seema Verma, an ally of Pence's from Indiana who has been involved in the coronavirus task force briefings.
The Apple results will show how successful the iPhone 7 was during the holiday season.
I can say it is the defining moment for this speaker. If he gets it wrong it will have consequences for him, but it will also have consequences for the rest of the Republican Party, Meadows said at an event with fellow House conservatives on Capitol Hill on Wednesday.
SANDERS: I can't at this time. It's something I'd have to check into and get back to you.
Still, New Jersey's job growth was rather mediocre when compared to other states. In December, the state ranked 24th in year-over-year job growth, according to Arizona State University's School of Business.

RUBIO: Because there's no one to negotiate with. The Palestinian Authority is not interested in a serious deal and they are now in union with Hamas, an organization whose specific purpose is the destruction of the Jewish state. Every time that Israel has turned over territory of any kind, be is Gaza, or now in Judea and Sumaira, it is used as a launching pad to attack Israel. And that's what will happen again.
No luck there. Our invitation, of course, the congressman stands. We will be here all next week. We are not shutdown. We welcome you on the program any time. I will come on early and talk to you.
Separately, a senior US intelligence official, Shelby Pierson, told lawmakers earlier this month in a classified briefing that Russia was taking steps to help Trump win reelection. CNN later reported that Pierson appears to have overstated the formal assessments from the US intelligence community, and senior White House officials rebutted her comments.

In fact, Trump's administration itself had said , prior to Trump issuing his own plan, that it was being guided by the Obama-era strategy: The domestic policies and programs of the Federal government continue to be guided by the National HIV/AIDS Strategy, and we are focused on working toward achieving the Strategy goals for 2020.
Rachael, I'm going to start with you. You know, I called it. The shutdown will continue into the new year. Our sources on the hill say no progress has been made towards a deal. And that is abundantly clear when you look at the sheer number of tweets the president shot off today. Nothing is getting done.
But it's safe to say, Clinton came in with the advantage, and Trump came in with an almost impossible recovery mission. He did little to recover, but it's also hard to see where she used that advantage effectively.
GLORIA BORGER, CNN CHIEF POLITICAL ANALYST: You know ...
Delgado and his staff have had early stage discussions about the next steps for the bill with the committees that oversee health care policy, as well as Democratic leadership, according to an aide, and will seek to use the heft of a freshman class that swept House Democrats into power largely running on health care, to bolster the outlook for his effort. A more aggressive effort to line up supporters will be launched in the coming days, Delgado said, as he seeks to overcome what he says he's found to be an immediate roadblock in his early months in office: dysfunction.

The late senator's widow, Cindy McCain, publicized hateful messages she's been receiving since Trump's tweets, and daughter Meghan McCain has continued to respond to the President online and on ABC's The View, where she's a co-host.
Facts First: Trump seemed to realize partway through this claim that it did not make sense to blame Obama for a bill signed into law before Obama was even elected to the Illinois state Senate -- but even though he eventually conceded Obama was pretty young at the time, he did not make clear that Obama had nothing at all to do with the bill.
TAPPER: Traditional moment for a very non-traditional candidate and I'm sure a nontraditional speech. We're told it's more of a greatest hits of what he is been saying on the campaign trail for months and months and not anything new but a lot of new delivery in how he presents it to the American people.
Trump has tried to use subsidies as a bargaining chip, first to get Democrats to the table and more recently to spur the Senate to return to its effort to repeal and replace the health care law. He is paying them on a month-to-month basis, further unnerving insurers. The August payment is scheduled to be sent out next Wednesday.

Last April, Axios quoted senior administration officials as saying there was a need to keep smart, sane people around Trump to fight his worst impulses.
Consumer advocates, however, worry that this will allow insurers to trim services that sicker enrollees need, leaving them with fewer benefits and higher out-of-pocket costs. For instance, states could allow insurers to limit the number of physical therapy visits or tighten the variety of drugs covered under the plan.
Facts First: While the 1989-1990 flu season was considered bad at the time -- the CDC : While the 1989-1990 flu season was considered bad at the time -- the CDC declared that it was an epidemic -- Trump greatly overstated the number of deaths. A CDC analysis in 2010 estimated that there were 26,582 deaths from the seasonal flu in 1989-1990. (The same analysis found that this number of deaths was exceeded in nine of the 17 subsequent flu seasons through 2006-2007.)
He supports Obamacare, but thinks it needs to be fixed.

TRUMP: You are all talk and no action. What I see up here -- I mean, first of all, this guy's a joke artist and this guy's a liar. You have a combination of factors. He can't do it for the obvious reason, and he can't do it, because he doesn't know how to tell the truth. I know politicians, believe it or not, better than you do, and it's not good.

We expect this new federal law will spark a rise in both insurers refusing to pay medical bills and medical bankruptcies, both of which have fallen since 2010,when the health law went into effect, said Frederick Isasi, executive director of Families USA, a left-leaning advocacy organization. When the people who are tricked into buying these cheap, junk plans need their health insurance to cover their medical care, they'll realize they've been swindled out of their money with no comprehensive health coverage to show for it.

As part of its rules package for the 116th Congress, the Democrats granted themselves authorization to intervene in the lawsuit that threatens to bring down the landmark health care law. It directed the House's Office of General Counsel to represent lawmakers in any litigation involving the act and authorizes hiring of outside counsel.
By then, he had already promised universal coverage. When he was a presidential candidate in 2015, Trump told CBS's Scott Pelley on 60 Minutes that everybody's got to be covered. He conceded that it may be an un-Republican thing to say, but he wanted to ensure that everyone had quality health care.

While longer-term spending negotiations were still ongoing, Democrats have dug in their heels and demanded that no spending caps be agreed to until there is a deal on the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which expires on March 5. Democrats have said they want assurances that DACA recipients are protected before agreeing to an omnibus spending bill, the best leverage they believe they have. And even on the short-term continuing budget resolution, many Democrats say they want an answer on DACA before they vote again to fund the government.

For all the formidable power of the White House, Trump and his top officials can do little more to urge Americans to stay home to ease the terrible demands being placed on medical staff in hospitals in worst-hit areas that are crammed with sick patients and running out of basic supplies. There is a feeling of a terrible storm approaching with the government predicting the worst over the next month or so.
One effort that is moving forward -- amid much controversy -- is allowing states to import certain drugs from Canada. Several states, led by Florida, have expressed interest in doing this. Canada, however, hasn't been so eager to participate, and experts question whether it would be effective since Canada's prescription drug supply is small compared to the US market.

Sen. Rand Paul claimed the President-elect supports the Kentucky Republican's calls to approve an Obamacare replacement on the same day Congress repeals the health care law.
The Vermont Senator handled himself well when placed center stage. His answer to a question about fracking -- explaining that fighting for the planet  is a moral issue  -- was excellent. After Bloomberg said that he'd worked hard for his vast wealth Sanders played to his democratic socialist theme, retorting that maybe your workers played some role in that, as well. Sanders later reframed the idea of socialism when he explained that the United States currently has socialism -- but it's socialism for the rich.

In two stunning moments that book-ended the evening, Trump, as he began his speech, turned his back on House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's outstretched hand in a snub that encapsulated their boiling bad blood. Then, after he wrapped up, Pelosi, channeling her disgusted and outraged Democratic members, ostentatiously tore up the speech in full view of the cameras , in a sure-to-go viral moment that showed she can do theatrics, too.

Obama said in 2009 that increasing the US share of trade with Asia from 9% to 10% could mean 250,000, 300,000 jobs, but he was not specifically attributing that estimate to the potential effects of a trade deal with South Korea. Republican Rep. Kevin Brady later used an estimate of about 250,000 new jobs from trade agreements with South Korea, Colombia and Panama combined, not just the one with South Korea.

The US became the top producer of crude oil in particular during Trump's tenure. The United States has been the world's top producer of natural gas since 2009, when US natural gas production surpassed that of Russia, and it has been the world's top producer of petroleum hydrocarbons since 2013, when its production exceeded Saudi Arabia's, the Energy Information Administration says
Facts First: China's officially : China's officially reported 2019 growth rate, 6.1%, was the lowest since 1990, 29 years prior . While China's official figures are unreliable, there is no basis for the 67 years claim; Trump has habitually exaggerated how long it had been since China's growth was as slow as it was in 2019, steadily inflating the figure over time.

According to data from Russell Wheeler, a visiting fellow at the Brookings Institution who tracks judicial appointments, Trump had appointed 187 judges as of the day after this tweet -- two Supreme Court justices, 50 appeals court judges and 135 district court judges. Wheeler said it's possible to get to a total of 191 judges by adding Trump's three appointments to the Court of Federal Claims and his designation of a sitting judge on that court as chief judge -- though he noted that claims court judges are generally not included in such counts.
Facts First: We could not find any cases in which Biden was supposed to make a campaign speech but drew so few attendees that his campaign roped the people who did come into having a roundtable discussion with him instead. The Biden campaign told us this did not happen; the Trump campaign did not respond to a request to identify the event Trump was talking about.
After the administration kicked off the week with its surprise shift to supporting the invalidation of the Affordable Care Act in the Texas case, Trump has been beating the drum constantly, thrusting the thorny issue into the center of the political arena even as federal judges in other cases ruled against him. On Wednesday, one jettisoned the administration's approval of Medicaid work requirements in two states and another on Thursday blocked a rule that would make it easier for small businesses to band together to buy health insurance, which could undermine Obamacare.

Roof's background check took longer than three days to complete and so the gun shop owner was allowed to sell him the gun after the three days passed. Because this error wasn't discovered until after the shooting, when the FBI began investigating Roof, it's unclear how a longer waiting period would have prevented Roof from passing the background check.
Nonetheless, Manafort complained about being at Northern Neck, saying he was being held in solitary and that he was too far from his lawyers to prepare for trial. A different judge, T.S. Ellis, then transferred him to the city jail in Alexandria, Virginia -- but Ellis, too, did not order him held in solitary. Upon Manafort's arrival, Alexandria Sheriff Dana Lawhorne said , Because he is a high-profile inmate, Mr. Manafort will be placed in protective custody, which limits his interactions with other inmates.

Nobody in their wildest dreams would have ever thought that we'd need tens of thousands of ventilators, Trump said, though a 2015 study by government disease experts estimated that the US would need as many as 60,000 additional ventilators to deal with a severe flu pandemic.
Roberts, who turns 65 later this month, has played multiple roles in Washington but kept the same face: reserved, practiced, steady. Since he was a prep school student in northern Indiana and through his early years at Harvard, he has striven to be top-notch. He oversees a conservative majority on a tightly divided Supreme Court, yet he constantly touts the impartiality of the federal judiciary. He has sparred publicly with Trump on that score.
ERIC TRUMP, DONALD TRUMP'S SON: He doesn't need to do this. But what's been happening over the last eight years has been so tragic for the course of our nation, he simply had to do this.
Anthem has argued that the deal would save health insurance customers over $2 billion in medical costs because Cigna customers will be able to access discounts that Anthem is able to offer its customers.
Trump was vague here about what he was referring to when he invoked the phrase go get him. But the best clue comes from a 2019 interview in which Trump claimed that former FBI official Peter Strzok meant we're gonna go get him -- go get Trump -- when Strzok texted colleague Lisa Page in 2016 about having an insurance policy for what Strzok saw as the unlikely event Trump would win the election against Hillary Clinton.

While Trump did lift his freeze on the aid on September 11 , more than two weeks before a September 30 legal deadline, the delay caused by Trump's freeze meant that $35 million of the $391 million in aid could not make it out the door in time to meet the deadline, according to impeachment testimony from Mark Sandy, deputy associate director for national security in the Office of Management and Budget. To deal with this problem, Congress had to pass an extension of the deadline. Had that provision not been included, then any unobligated funds as of September 30 would have expired, Sandy testified.

We can't be sure why Republicans are now significantly less willing to get the vaccine, but remember Democrats have pretty much always said they were more concerned about Covid-19 than Republicans. It wasn't until mid-November, just after Trump's defeat in the presidential election, that the partisan gap began to really emerge in the Axios/Ipsos polling on vaccines. The bottom line is that there's still a lot of work to be done on vaccine hesitancy. Lives literally depend on it.

But what we do know is that foreign governments are constantly trying to infiltrate the American political process.

And more Americans say the country would be better off (40%) than worse off (28%) should Democrats take control of Congress in this November's elections. That's a wider margin that felt the nation would be better off should Republicans take control back in 2010.

In June, we mark 75 years since the start of what General Dwight D. Eisenhower called the Great Crusade – the Allied liberation of Europe in World War II.

Here with us tonight are three of those heroes: Private First Class Joseph Reilly, Staff Sergeant Irving Locker, and Sergeant Herman Zeitchik. Gentlemen, we salute you.
[22:45:00] The very fact that they would take a meeting and talk with Russian operatives on the promise that they would be provided dirt against Mr. Trump's opponent at the time, Secretary Clinton, is in and of itself collusion.

Buttigieg's proposal , which he calls Medicare for All Who Want It , would create a government-run health insurance plan, known as a public option, that would be sold on the Affordable Care Act exchanges.

Carter later signed the bill, with the nuclear aircraft carrier deleted from the legislation.

(CNN) Uninsured Americans can start signing up for coverage on the federal Affordable Care Act exchange starting Monday, but the Biden administration has not allocated more funds to help them enroll.
Total income gains for median households will reach $10,000 a family. I'll give you a couple of quick numbers. So under President Bush, for eight years, you saved $450, meaning you took in $450. OK, fine. Under President Obama, you took in $975. Under President Trump, including the energy savings and the regulation savings and the tax cuts savings, it's more than $10,000 in less than three years. Pretty good, right? So for two eight years, you had a $400, $450 and a $975. That's eight years, $450. In less than three years, you had more than $10,000. That goes right into your pockets. -- December 18 campaign rally in Battle Creek, Michigan
That's because more people would be insured, more benefits would be covered and more medical services would be used since there'd be no cost for care.
Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah appears to have escaped the fate of other GOP lawmakers who faced fierce backlash from their respective state parties for reprimanding former President Donald Trump.
Just like he sent active duty troops to the border before the 2018 midterms. He fabricates a crisis, calls it a national emergency for political purposes.
While unemployment benefits typically count as part of one's income for determining eligibility for Medicaid or CHIP, the new $600 enhancement approved by Congress last week does not.
Herring, wearing blackface has nothing to do with Donald Trump. This is about racism in the DNA of this country. And I am over it.
The good news is more Americans say they will get the vaccine than ever before. A new Axios/Ipsos poll finds that 63% of adults say they have had or are likely to get a Covid-19 vaccination as soon as it's made available to them. That's the highest ever recorded by Ipsos.
None of this is to say that Hunter Biden's name was not a factor in his career advancement. He has acknowledged that he would probably not have been asked to be on the Burisma board if he were not a Biden. But Trump's repeated portrayal of him as an unemployed man is inaccurate.
The mayor of New York City Bill de Blasio defended the deal in a New York Times op-ed this morning. And here's what he said, The agreement we struck with Amazon back in November was a solid foundation. The retail giant's expansion in New York encountered opposition in no small part because of growing frustration with corporate America. The lesson here is that corporations can't ignore rising anger over economic inequality anymore.

I think the most remarkable thing about the filings regarding Michael Cohen were embedded in the special counsel's memorandum to the court. Which identified four separate areas of cooperation the special counsel is getting from Mr. Cohen.
As we were reminded this Friday, that privilege isn't ever benign. It came about through violence, and maintains itself through violence: over bodies, over land, over culture. I'd hoped Trump would be out of the race by this weekend, but it seems even sexual predation isn't enough to wake our country up. Don't ask if Clinton won or lost. Ask what happened to us.
For instance, she has said she wants to shore up Social Security, but then says she wants to expand benefits, which increase the program's costs.
The sad irony of today's decision lies in its utter failure to grasp why the VRA has proven effective, she wrote, adding that throwing out preclearance when it has worked and is continuing to work to stop discriminatory changes is like throwing away your umbrella in a rainstorm because you are not getting wet.
I'd like to talk about who we're running against, Warren said, a billionaire who calls women fat broads and horse-faced lesbians. And no, I'm not talking about Donald Trump, I'm talking about Mayor Bloomberg.
But I think it's very important that this is a big political issue for Pelosi. She firmly believes and has strong evidence for the fact that Republicans lost many, many congressional races in states like New Jersey and in Florida and California based on messaging on the Affordable Care Act because voters really started to like this law.
And we have got to ensure that our forces are there based on the conditions on the ground, not based on, frankly, what has been Rand Paul's approach, which is, you know what, I have just decided it's too long, we're going to come home.
PINSKY: So postpartum depression is a very common condition. It's different than the baby blues. It's very common after people -- a woman's body is flooded with hormones, suddenly let down. They can feel depressed. Sometimes it can become a major depression that actually bleeds into a psychotic episode where they hallucinations and delusions.
Casey's much redder state colleagues have been more circumspect. Alabama's Doug Jones and North Dakota's Heidi Heitkamp, the latter facing a tough re-election fight, signaled some openness to backing Trump's choice. West Virginia's Joe Manchin could be swayed. Joe Donnelly, of Indiana, is another GOP target.
It's really sad because they say they've insured or provided coverage for another 45 million people, Bloomberg added in the speech. Except there's no doctors for 45 million more people and unless they fix immigration and let people who come here for medical education stay here, those people are just going to do the same thing. They're going to have to go to the emergency rooms where they've been except that now it's going to cost a lot more money.
Former President Donald Trump will be the star of the show in Orlando, delivering a Sunday afternoon speech -- one in which he is expected to continue to falsely claim that the presidential election was stolen -- that will mark his first public comments since leaving the White House.
The agenda I will lay out this evening is not a Republican agenda or a Democrat agenda. It is the agenda of the American people.
That doesn't mean retirees will get nothing by 2034. It means that at that point the program will only have enough revenue coming in to pay 79% of promised benefits.

There are about 15 million uninsured people who could shop for coverage on the exchanges, though not all are eligible for a subsidy, according to the foundation.
The two other employees who withdrew from the case – Rebecca Kopplin and Eric Beckenhauer – have had no change in their employment status, the spokesperson said.
«Este fue el discurso más divisorio que le he escuchado a un presidente en funciones», dijo Gergen. «Otros podrían no estar de acuerdo. Se dirigió a su base y trató a los otros oyentes, el resto de la gente a los que ha perturbado o que se la han opuesto, los trató básicamente como 'me importa un bledo lo que piensen porque ustedes francamente son el enemigo'. Creo que fue un discurso profundamente preocupante».
One of the most complex set of challenges we face is in the Middle East.
John McCain was tortured for more than five years in Vietnam and survived for more than a year after being diagnosed with brain cancer in 2017.
But my position has always been we want to have free trade, but fair trade. And I've been arguing all along that it is absolutely critical that when other countries break those agreements, we don't turn the process over to some international bureaucrat who comes back a couple years later and says, Oh, America was right, and people are out of work.
Of course, it's important to remember that a President Sanders could not wield a magic wand to enact his extreme policy proposals. Congress must approve any sweeping changes. Republicans (as well as perhaps some moderate Democrats) would surely seek to block the Sanders agenda. And the GOP may still control the US Senate.
COOPER: Neither do the 5,000 defense contractors that could be out of work if the shutdown continues or the 800,000 federal workers that are furloughed or the kids and parents who won't have access to head start programs.
CARPER: He was interested in a greater good.
Wood: Cost. And to be clear, cost has been the stated objection all along. The initiative included a tax increase to fund the state's Medicaid expenses, but the governor's budget office dropped new estimates after the election that suggested the initiative would run a deficit after a couple years.
The Obama administration boosted outreach efforts last fall in hopes of enticing more people to sign up for coverage, recognizing that enrollment was critical to the program's stability. HHS officials doubled down after Trump's victory, hoping that larger enrollment figures would make it harder for Republicans to repeal the landmark health reform law.
LEMON: Yes. Matthew two questions. First one is what are the chances do you think that anything will happen like what Charlie said?
Additionally, a spate of negative headlines about Klobuchar's demanding management style have trickled out around her 2020 announcement.
During opening statements, Democrats on the committee also blasted McConnell for focusing on the nomination amid the pandemic, with Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois laying out a lengthy list of things he said the panel could be doing instead to address the crisis.
I know I can be too tough sometimes and I can push too hard, she told MSNBC earlier this month. That is obvious. But a lot of it is I have high expectations for myself and I have high expectations for people who work with me.
CAREY-JONES: No, it -- we're still trying to put the pieces together. It's very sudden. It still doesn't seem real. We're just waiting for the real story as to exactly what happened to come out.
SCARAMUCCI: We got a plan in place, vote for us.
Russians will be back time and time again if the United States doesn't take bipartisan action together to hold whoever was involved accountable, Clinton warned.
New police radio dispatches and security footage from the January 6 US Capitol riot paint an even sharper picture of how the insurrectionists at times showed little fear of the police as they launched a large and coordinated attack.
SMITH: When that was over. I can't spend my life worrying about it. I accepted what he wanted to do.
Besides Trump's decision to pull out of the accord, the Trump administration's record on energy and the environment was largely headlined by efforts to roll back a slew of environmental protections in favor of perceived economic opportunity. Much like Trump reversed many of Obama's environmental policy achieved through executive order, Biden is expected to do much the same of Trump's.
Senator John McCain has always been a fighter, the President said in a statement at the time. Melania and I send our thoughts and prayers to Senator McCain, Cindy, and their entire family. Get well soon.
MORGAN: Senator Casey, thank you very much indeed for joining me.
Usually the president's budget is divorced from reality, but this year it is very divorced from reality, said Ben Ritz, a former analyst at the Bipartisan Policy Center and incoming director at the Progressive Policy Institute.
TRUMP: No, no, no. I watched him repeat himself five times four weeks ago. And I'm going to tell you...
So we take the kids, we roll in. Its five minutes to the fight. I think it was Tyson-Holmes, probably lasted four seconds. It can it was one of Tyson's longer fights.
As rioters began to overrun the officers, creating an untenable situation, radio waves filled with desperate shouts and requests for backup:
Trump's remark about the funeral came as the President has continued to denigrate the dead senator's legacy.
So what then is the purpose of this designation? Well, they say it's a way to pressure both the government and the military to control the situation better and reach an agreement so that people can start returning to their homes. They want the military to respond more quickly to situations on the ground. And they say it highlights the urgency of the situation.
In the wake of the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting in Florida in 2018, Trump established a school safety commission that led to the rescinding of Obama-era guidance meant to address racial disparities in how students are disciplined. Two years after the shooting, the commission rolled out SchoolSafety.gov, a federal clearinghouse of information to help schools. Trump and the White House also proposed arming teachers.
Heading into this debate, Trump's campaign was possibly mortally wounded. He performed well enough to stop the bleeding, for now. But did he do anything to close the gap with key swing state constituencies he needs to win? Doubtful. Fortunately for Trump, Hillary Clinton is such a flawed candidate, she was unable to land the knockout blow. This one was a draw.
RUBIO: No, of course not. And we don't have to in order to defeat terrorists. The way you defeat terrorists is pretty straightforward. It's difficult to do, but it has to be done. When I'm president of the United States, the best intelligence agencies in the world that right now have been hamstrung. They're going to be expanded. And the best intelligence agencies in the world are going to find terrorists.
President Donald Trump played a key role in getting Nevada Sen. Dean Heller's primary challenger to drop out, and in convincing Rep. Kevin Cramer to run for the Senate in North Dakota.

In response to Trump's tweets, Meghan McCain tweeted that No one will ever love you the way they loved my father, adding that the President should be spending time with his own family instead of obsessing over mine.
Trump claimed it would be easy to beat Democratic presidential candidate Michael Bloomberg. When interviewer Geraldo Rivera noted that Bloomberg has a lot money, Trump said, Yeah, he's got money but, you know, they spent $2 billion on me, Hillary Clinton, and mostly negative ads, and I won. And I won really easily if you look at -- you know, the Electoral College, I won some states that were -- I won by massive numbers. She spent $2 billion. I mean, they had a $2 billion campaign. -- February 13 radio interview with Geraldo Rivera
We hope tonight the candidates will give the voters specifics on their visions for America.
Klobuchar spent the lead-up to the town hall with a trip through Wisconsin and Iowa, building on her campaign theme of retaking Midwest communities that have drifted away from Democrats in recent years. Klobuchar, a three-term senator from Minnesota, is pitching herself as a pragmatic lawmaker who is willing to work with those who oppose her to get things done.
Supreme Court justices tend to serve well beyond normal retirement years. Justice John Paul Stevens stepped down in 2010 at age 90 and remains a prolific writer.
HEATHER ANGUS, MOTHER DIED OF FUNGAL MENINGITIS AFTER INJECTION: I was not aware of that at first. I can honestly say that shock, frustration, anger, and a little bit of disgust were definitely emotions that crossed my mind.
On how she keeps Democrats united
During an Oval Office meeting a month later with his South Korean counterpart, Trump claimed he believed sanctions are at a fair level and acknowledged the dust-up, saying he had the option of significantly increasing them but decided he didn't think it was necessary.
I'm not a prude about this. Neither is Michael. But I mean, this was a pitiful display of political discourse. It really was a new low for 2016 and I think the brand, I think the party has to deal with that because of the larger question, which is does it actually change anything?
The town hall format is familiar for Klobuchar, who has found success in her home state – which almost went for President Donald Trump in 2016 – by consciously visiting each of Minnesota's 87 counties, often to hold town-hall style events.
Our franchisees compete with big companies for labor, said Monson, a longtime advocate of the plans. We want to have the same benefits at about the same price.
Insurers, who are already skittish about participating in the exchanges next year, responded to the ad cancellation by stressing the importance of open enrollment.

QUESTION: So just to clarify, not to belabor the point, so you're saying that this bill was crafted in a way so it would meet the reconciliation Byrd test in the Senate.
Biden was an evanescent presence on the stage. He has come a long way from his early performances. He was solid, showed confidence and made some good points. Most of all, he made no big mistakes. But no one would accuse him of giving a rousing performance. As the candidate leading in the national polls, Biden didn't need to win. He only needed to hold his own, to keep from losing ground, and he did that.

Nine days after newly sworn-in President Joe Biden told America that every disagreement doesn't have to be a cause for total war, recriminations between the parties and the Republican meltdown are consuming Congress.
Klobuchar's primary pitch to voters is likely to be electability. The Democrat has been notably successful in Minnesota, winning her three terms in the Senate by an average of 26 percentage points. Klobuchar won re-election in 2018 with 60% of the vote, two years after Trump came within two points of defeating Hillary Clinton in the state.
Facts First: Trump was both exaggerating how recent the decline in prescription drug prices was and how many years it had been since there had been such a decline.
Now on top of that, you want to talk about the 21st Century and what we need to do with our kids? We need to start connecting them to the real world. We need to be training them for the jobs of the 21st Century, not the jobs of 20 years ago.
By now, Trump should be wishing that the Federal Reserve Bank had ignored his pressure to lower interest rates. If rates were higher, the Fed would have much more powerful ammunition: it would be able to aggressively lower rates, which is the strongest weapon in its arsenal. But that arsenal is much depleted.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: On the timetable for withdrawing troops --
For now at least, this is a total dead end.
Trump isn't one for wonky policy details. He often makes vague pronouncements on issues like health care. In May, for example, he tweeted,​ Despite what you hear in the press, health care is coming along great. We are talking to many groups and it will end in a beautiful picture!
WESTWOOD: That's right. That's what this administration says, although the day-to-day work will be taken over by a deputy. It won't even be the first time Mulvaney is pulling double duty. He also took over as head of the CFPB earlier in the Trump president -- something that was a little controversial at the time.

Now, he'll try to build momentum on the debate stage -- where he looked feistier than he had before a week ago in New Hampshire.
The results of the poll suggest a midterm environment that is looking a lot like 2006, when Democrats took control of the House amid widespread voter dissatisfaction with Republican president George W. Bush and his handling of the war in Iraq. In 2010, backlash to President Barack Obama and the passage of Obamacare led to the organization of the ideological Tea Party movement, which boosted Republicans back into control of the House. In September of 2006, CNN polling also found Democrats with a 10-point lead over Republicans on the generic ballot.
A Klobuchar aide told CNN on Monday that the senator prepared for the town hall like she would for a major interview.
Systematic cuts by this administration and the Republicans in Congress have reduced the number of US citizens insured, undermined disease prevention and weakened vaccination efforts, to name a few. In 2017, Congress repealed the insurance mandate and stopped reimbursing insurers for low-income deductible and copay waivers. Insurance became less affordable and increased those who could opt out.

ROSSELLO: My biggest concern is for the people, right. We have been sort of blessed for a couple of decades that hurricanes have skimmed through but have not hit right through us. So my biggest fear prior to the storm was complacency. We have many fronts of danger, not only flooding regions, which we have plenty here in Puerto Rico, coastal lines where the surge is coming, but also we have mudslide potential and we have very vulnerable housing. We are talking wooden housing and so forth.
The late senator's widow, Cindy McCain, publicized hateful messages she's been receiving since Trump's tweets, and daughter Meghan McCain has continued to respond to the President online and on ABC's The View, where she's a co-host.
About half of respondents think the upper chamber should make either major or minor changes to it, while 29% say the Senate should not pass the bill.

in late December. But it's possible that For the previous pandemic stimulus bill, the Internal Revenue Service started sending out the second round of payments -- that were worth up to $600 -- three days after then-President Donald Trump signed that billn late December. But it's possible that tax filing season , which is currently underway, could slow down the process this time.
People talk to each other in headlines, Delgado said. They engage in a fashion that allows for clickbait to ensue. There seems to be very little room for substantive debate on issues that we know are of critical importance. I want figure out how to own that space and be one of hopefully a growing group of individuals in DC who are committed to really doing the business of solutions oriented work.
Also, the premiums can vary widely. Consumers will have to fill out a 20-question form about their medical history. The healthiest folks could pay roughly half of what the bronze plan would cost them -- $90 a month versus $238 a month for a 21-year-old. But the maximum rate could cost more -- particularly for older Americans, who tend to have more medical issues. They might have to pay $971 a month if they have pre-existing conditions, compared to $713 a month for the bronze plan. Insurers are not allowed to turn anyone away because of their health backgrounds.

Those comments come after a weekend in which Trump repeatedly attacked McCain, who, in case you forgot, is deceased, for graduating last in his class from the Naval Academy and for allegedly sending the so-called Steele dossier to the media. (Trump offered zero proof that McCain had leaked the dossier, put together by a former British intelligence agent, to the press.)

The only thing he thinks is that they should negotiate a little bit better deals, they should be more effective.

In a single, memorable answer, Warren lambasted three of her opponents' health care plans. She called Buttigieg's proposal a slogan that was thought up by his consultants. Klobuchar's, she said, was like a Post-It note. And she said Sanders' Medicare for All plan -- which Warren largely backs -- is hurt because his campaign relentlessly attacks everyone who asks a question or tries to fill in details about how to actually make this work.

We gather here to mourn the passing of American greatness, the real thing, not cheap rhetoric from men who will never come near the sacrifice he gave so willingly, nor the opportunistic appropriation of those who live lives of comfort and privilege while he suffered and served, McCain said at the time.
On Capitol Hill, lawmakers are trying to seem hopeful that they can come up with a deal that the president will agree to. The latest negotiations center around about $2 billion for border barriers. That is short of the $5.7 billion President Trump said he wanted.
DRUCKER: Absolutely where the money is. They will never address the debt and deficit problem if they don't do it. These seniors would be impacted or believe they would. They tend to vote Republicans. Why they are going to take a chance and scare them off I have no idea. I don't think for that reason that anything major will happen.
Biden then hit Sanders for voting to exempt gun manufacturers from any liability. Zero. They cannot be sued.
Regardless, Trump's approval rating is not a record. Gallup's website features data on approval rating by party for every president since Harry Truman; George W. Bush hit 99% in Gallup polling after the 9/11 terrorist attacks of 2001. His father, George H.W. Bush, hit 97% at the end of the Gulf War in 1991. Ronald Reagan, Richard Nixon, and Dwight Eisenhower all went higher than 90%.

Still, millions of people could be at risk of missing out because the IRS does not know how to reach them. An estimated 8 million eligible people did not get the first stimulus payment, worth up to $1,200, which was approved last year and delivered over the spring and summer. While most people received the money automatically, very low-income people who don't normally file tax returns may have to take an extra step to register online or file a 2020 tax return.

When Britney Spears' mental health deteriorated in early 2008, the story dominated the news for weeks. Pictures of the wide-eyed, shaven-headed superstar saturated the internet, and a Rolling Stone cover story described Spears as being a toy we'd all grown tired of playing with, a perfectly proportioned twenty-six-year-old porcelain doll with a nasty weave. Long after the episode had passed, the meme If Britney can survive 2007, you can handle today remained synonymous with the worst, most embarrassing kind of breakdown.

More Americans have appeared to hold on to job-based coverage than expected, while many of those who have lost their employment and most of their income have turned to Medicaid. Between February and September, Medicaid enrollment jumped by more than 6.6 million people, or 10.3%, according to federal data.
The long list of prominent Republicans who have announced they now will not vote for Trump is well known. The deep record of polarizing and controversial positions and statements won't go away. Within this debate itself, there were many occasions when Trump reminded undecided voters about why so many Republicans are not on his side. When he threatened to put his opponent in jail on live television he crossed another boundary in campaign history. He even seems to disagree about policy with his vice presidential running mate.
PACE: And you also hear this difference between what Paul Ryan is saying where he says this is the only choice. Not only does he think it's the best choice, but it's the only choice, and what the president seems to be saying in some of these private meetings, which is leaving the door open to negotiation, to having some flexibility around it, that's the dealmaker side of him coming out. But how Ryan and Trump try to close that gap and appeal to these conservatives, you know, Trump wants a win here, but he doesn't want to tie himself to something that's going to be unpopular for the sake of that win.

MADDEN: But I think it's very clear that I believe that one of these campaigns has to come to the conclusion that the way to consolidate, that anti-Trump or to become the alternative is to show that your best position to take Donald Trump on and finally start making some -- making some progress.
Some of this is just a result of the erratic relationship between the White House and Congress. Planning a budget from the executive branch is complicated; it's nigh on impossible when legislators throw an eleventh-hour spending pact at you. Despite it all, the budget plan remains a crucially informative and important document – an annual view into the President's priorities and goals.
The Quinnipiac poll at which he was at 93% had an overall margin of error of plus or minus 2.5 percentage points, and a larger margin of error for the smaller sub-sample of Republican voters, so that poll found that it's possible Trump's true number is indeed 95% -- but it's not accurate to make leaps from the numbers the polls actually found without explaining that this is what you are doing.

As we restore American leadership throughout the world, we are once again standing up for freedom in our hemisphere. That is why my Administration reversed the failing policies of the previous administration on Cuba. We are supporting the hopes of Cubans, Nicaraguans, and Venezuelans to restore democracy. The United States is leading a 59-nation diplomatic coalition against the socialist dictator of Venezuela, Nicolás Maduro. Maduro is an illegitimate ruler, a tyrant who brutalizes his people. But Maduro's grip of tyranny will be smashed and broken. Here this evening is a man who carries with him the hopes, dreams, and aspirations of all Venezuelans. Joining us in the gallery is the true and legitimate President of Venezuela, Juan Guaidó. Mr. President, please take this message back to your homeland.

Just how much impact this regulation has on Obamacare depends on whether it really spurs more businesses to create or join association health plans.

New York Democratic Rep. Antonio Delgado plans to introduce legislation Monday that would allow all Americans to buy into a version of Medicare – an approach designed to avoid the substantial system-wide overhaul that would come with any effort to create a government-run health care system.
Facts First: Mexico has deployed around 27,000 troops, but Trump exaggerated how many are being stationed near the US border in particular; Mexico's defense minister said in October that it was about 15,000 on the US border, about 12,000 on Mexico's own southern border.
In 2019, Trump issued a plan called Ending the HIV Epidemic: A Plan for America, which aimed to reduce the number of new HIV infections in the US by 75% within five years and by at least 90% within 10 years. Experts said that Trump's plan builds on Obama's 2010 National HIV/AIDS Strategy and a 2015 update to that strategy.

I was at the Children's Hospital in Cleveland. And I went there because I was meeting with parents of very ill children who could not get insurance. And I listened to their stories, and, you know, as a mom, they were hard to hear. And then one man said, you know, here's what I don't understand, he told me. He said, I'm successful. I have my own business. I provide health insurance for my employees and their families. I have two daughters with cystic fibrosis. Nobody will sell me an insurance policy no matter what I offer. I said, what do they say to you? He said, well, the last conversation that I had, I asked, I told them I could afford something, anything that would help me. And the man just looked at me and he said, you don't understand, we don't insure burning houses. And this father, with tears in his eyes, just said, they called my little girls burning houses.

Over the weekend, Trump revived his long-running feud against McCain – who died in August after a long battle with brain cancer – citing his ties to the controversial Russia dossier and his vote against repealing Obamacare.

The new poll marks the first time this election season CNN has looked at preferences among likely voters. Typically, likely voters in midterm elections are a bit more Republican-leaning than the broader pool of registered voters. This year, Democrats are expressing just as much interest in voting as Republicans, and voters who are Democrats or Democratic-leaning independents continue to be more enthusiastic about casting a ballot for Congress than those who tilt toward the GOP (56% are extremely or very enthusiastic vs. 50% of Republican voters).

It's important to note these numbers represent the non-elderly population, since most Americans get Medicare after they turn 65. The rate of uninsured would rise drastically, both because the law would do away with the requirement that people either obtain insurance or pay a fine and, in the later years, because of changes to Medicaid rules and spending is capped, according to CBO.
All the while, a growing number Republican members of Congress have been publicly pushing back on Trump's comments, defending McCain.

Vindman testified that he had wanted to change the words the company to Burisma, the company name he said Zelensky had used on his call with Trump. And Vindman testified that he had wanted to add in Trump saying there are recordings related to former vice president Joe Biden and a Ukrainian prosecutor Biden had pushed Ukrainian leaders to fire. (Trump was vague about what he meant; in public comments last fall, Trump brought up a video of Biden at a 2018 event telling the story of his effort to get the prosecutor ousted.)

Meghan McCain on Monday continued her fierce pushback against President Donald Trump, who over the weekend revived his long-running feud with her father, the late Sen. John McCain.
TRUMP: It's the end of the world and we're subsidizing their military by billions and billions and billions of dollars many, many, many times what those soldiers cost their country.
And by CNN's count we know at least 16 Trump associates and contacts had contacts with Russians during the campaign or transition. Sixteen.
TAPPER: Welcome back to the CNN Republican presidential debate in Miami, Florida.
Question: Will you be okay if John Bolton testifies? He indicated yesterday that he would if he is subpoenaed. Trump: Well, that's going to be up to the lawyers. It will be up the Senate. And we'll see how they feel. He would know nothing about what we're talking about, because if you know, the Ukrainian government came out with a very strong statement -- no pressure, no anything. -- January 7 exchange with reporters at meeting with Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis
HOWARD LORBER, ENTREPRENEUR: He single handedly changed the Grand Central in midtown area by himself by doing that project.

CNN's Brianna Keilar explains why many Republicans are hesitant to take the coronavirus vaccine.
When he finally had the chance to do it, he voted against repeal and replace, the President said. Remember thumbs down?
That's why we call our campaign us, not me, he said. Because I'm not going to tell you I can do it alone. I can't do it alone. We need to all stand up to take on the power of the health care industry.
Many Americans are concerned about their coverage options for next year, the Kaiser poll found. Some 58% of Obamacare enrollees said they were very worried or somewhat worried that there will be no insurers selling plans in their area. Some 82% were worried that their premiums will increase so much that they won't be able to afford their current plan, while 80% were worried that co-pays and deductibles will become so high that they won't be able to afford to get the health care they need.
I'm simply not going to end these agreements because they were made consensually and they have every right to expect they will stay private, he added.
Interspersed with policy panels and breakout sessions for activists, the main-stage speeches at CPAC offer ambitious Republicans the opportunity to speak directly to the conservative faithful.

Either option would limit federal responsibility, shifting that burden to the states. However, since states don't have the money to make up the difference, they would likely either reduce eligibility, curtail benefits or cut provider payments. The block grant would be more restrictive since the funding level would not adjust for increases in enrollment, which often happens in bad economic times.
However, Tennessee's proposal does not fall into the parameters of the new guidance because it would move many of its traditional Medicaid enrollees into the block grant, which is wider than the federal program would allow. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services is working with the state, Verma said.

Biden openly stated: 'I said, I'm telling you, you're not getting the billion dollars... I looked at them and said: I'm leaving in six hours. If the prosecutor is not fired, you're not getting the money. Well, son of a bitch. He got fired.' Even Joe Biden admitted just days ago in an interview with NPR that it 'looked bad.' -- December 17 anti-impeachment letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi
The stage is set for a contentious convention
(CNN) President Joe Biden has been in office for less than two weeks, but a looming question is when, not whether, his Justice Department will change the federal government's position before the Supreme Court on the Affordable Care Act.
AT&T and Time Warner were quick to advance this view. A Time Warner spokesman excoriated the government: The Court's resounding rejection of the government's arguments is confirmation that this was a case that was baseless, political in its motivation and should never have been brought in the first place.
I mean, I'm going to tell you about the Nobel Peace Prize. I'll tell you about that. I made a deal. I saved a country, and I just heard that the head of that country is now getting the Nobel Peace Prize for saving the country. I said, what -- did I have something to do with it? Yeah, but you know, that's the way it is. As long as we know, that's all that matters, OK? I saved a big war, saved a couple of them... -- January 9 campaign rally in Toledo, Ohio
TRUMP: It just over a period of time. Oh, we're withdrawing. We're hitting them very hard. When I met with the generals in Iraq, I said to a couple of the generals, why didn't you do this before? He said, sir, our commanders were telling us what to do. I said don't you tell them? No, sir, we take orders. And they're great soldiers. They listen. I do it differently. I sat around and after a few minutes they listened up and said this is what we're should do. But we were supposed to be out and that was five years ago and we never left. I see soldiers that are so badly injured and hurt, I don't want that. Why want it. And our military is getting really strong. I can tell you story when I got here about our military that I don't even want to talk about. I don't even want to talk about. One of the NGS, we do these reports on our military. Some I.G. goes over there, and he goes over there and they do a report on every single thing we're fighting wars and they're doing report and releasing it to the public. The public means the enemy. Those reports should be private reports. Let them do a report but they should be private reports and be locked up and but for these reports, criticizing referring for these reports -- essentially given out to the enemy is insane.
Lifestyle planning can also help with the financial side of preparing for your early retirement, as the way you live in retirement can directly affect how much you'll spend and thus how large a nest egg you'll require. So as you're working on your retirement budget and gauging how much you need to save, you'll want to think about such issues as whether you plan to travel a lot or stick close to home and whether you intend to remain in your current house or downsize to smaller, less expensive digs in an effort to free up home equity and lower housing costs.
Life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness is not just a tag line for a bumper sticker. It is our American legacy and it's our responsibility to save it and strengthen it for our children and grandchildren. Listen, God didn't put us here not -- he didn't put us here by accident.

But as we work to improve Americans' healthcare, there are those who want to take away your healthcare, take away your doctor, and abolish private insurance entirely. One hundred thirty-two lawmakers in this room have endorsed legislation to impose a socialist takeover of our healthcare system, wiping out the private health insurance plans of 180 million Americans. To those watching at home tonight, I want you to know: We will never let socialism destroy American healthcare!
The 47-year-old mother of three worked a full-time job, but didn't receive benefits. Doctors warned her that leaving the benign brain tumor in place would impair her hearing, vision, and balance, and might even endanger her life.
The law remains in effect while the case works its way through the court system. The administration last week told the Supreme Court in a filing that there's no rush for them to review the appellate court's ruling -- which Obamacare's defenders , a coalition of Democratic states and the House of Representatives, are pushing justices to do. They argue that the lower court opinion poses a severe, immediate and ongoing threat to the nation's health care markets.

The pandemic itself is an example of a virus that hit the Black and Brown and indigenous communities first and worse. And then the illusion that it was only happening to blue cities and brown people allowed the Trump administration to take its eye off the ball and downplay the risks and turn it into a culture war, an us vs. them where Covid support shouldn't go to blue states, which was also signifying brown people.

It's now lasted very long time. It's gone on now for about two months. It's getting very exhausting, very repetitive. And it makes them look as wealthy candidates. In the mean time, you've got John Kasich who has no plan to drop out, playing the role of Mr. Rogers.
DINAN: Governor Kasich, I want to come to you next. Mr. Trump says that legal immigration is producing quote, lower wages and higher unemployment for U.S. workers. He's calling for a pause on green cards issued to foreign workers. Wouldn't that help workers in the U.S.?

Trump's claim about protecting those with pre-existing conditions is false. Though Trump says he would do this, his administration has consistently taken steps to undermine the Affordable Care Act — including joining a lawsuit aimed at striking down the law — without presenting alternative plans that would offer similar benefits.

Obama never said, There's no more manufacturing. Rather, Obama scoffed at Trump's promises to bring back what Obama called jobs of the past without providing specifics on how he would do so. Contrary to Trump's repeated claims, Obama didn't say manufacturing was dead or that new manufacturing jobs could not be created; Obama boasted of how many manufacturing jobs were being created during his presidency, saying, We actually make more stuff, have a bigger manufacturing base today than we've had in most of our history.
Klobuchar's primary pitch to voters is likely to be electability. The Democrat has been notably successful in Minnesota, winning her three terms in the Senate by an average of 26 percentage points.

El Rushbo, who announced to his millions of listeners on Monday his stage 4 lung cancer diagnosis , is regarded as a bigot and extremist by many Democrats. His populist streak and mastery of flaming political rhetoric was in many ways a precursor to the President's own political brand.
It's not at all unusual for new presidents to run into trouble with some nominees -- or even to see several potential Cabinet members fall. Blocking a pick is one easy way for senators to flex their power and signal to a new White House that they can't be taken for granted. And the policy clashes clouding the confirmation hopes of candidates such as Haaland and Tanden are quite predictable, since they mirror the chasms between the parties.

The laws were often initiated in response to aggressive billing and collection practices by hospitals, which would charge uninsured patients far higher rates than those paid by insured patients, who benefited from discounts negotiated by their health plans.
An optimistic approach meant to spur more action
That'd be big news: Congressional Republicans haven't yet figured out what they'll replace Obamacare with – and Paul is on a lonely crusade to slow down what's expected to be a vote early in the year to repeal it.
Without a comprehensive solution, the story of Osmel Martinez Azcue will be the first of what promises to be many more in the wake of Covid-19.

Orszag, in hailing the law's success, pointed to its achievements in lowering the rates of hospital infections and of readmission for diagnoses like pneumonia and congestive heart failure. But while these are indeed significant accomplishments, to see improvements like these across the board, hospitals and caregivers must have quick and ready access to patient data. And although billions of dollars have already been invested with this goal in mind, they have been focused more on costs and billing than on quality care.

Klobuchar's electability in Minnesota, which has largely come by taking more politically moderate positions, has some Democrats questioning whether the senator will be able to capture the imagination of a party that has drifted to the left nationally.

Biden said that President Donald Trump flat-out lied when he claimed the US killed Iran's top military general because he was targeting four US embassies.
Members bemoaned the need for another stopgap measure – the fourth in just six months – but members inside the conference meeting Tuesday night described an atmosphere that was mostly supportive of Republican leaders, who many admitted had little choice than to put another short-term spending bill on the floor.

Trump's CPAC speech Sunday afternoon will serve as his resurgence into the political world , and according to a source familiar with his plans, it is not finished, with advisers still weighing in on how to make the most lasting impact.
CRUZ: I will let Donald speak for himself. But I will say, there's a reason, in my campaign I've laid out a very, very specific spend and cut plan, $500 billion. I've specified five major agencies that I would eliminate, 25 programs. And Dana, you know why political candidates don't do that? Because when you do that, the lobbyists attack you. When you specify the programs you would eliminate, then you get attacked. Let's talk for example back in Iowa the first primary. When I went to Iowa and campaigned against ethanol mandates, everyone said that was political suicide. You can't take on ethanol in Iowa. And my opponents on this stage not only didn't do the same. They attacked me and even promised to expand corporate welfare.
I believe he ran one of the greatest campaigns that I've ever seen in my lifetime. He inspired people, galvanized people, brought people together, he added. But for whatever reasons, he has not followed through with a lot of the issues that he discussed in his campaign and I think has not stood up to the right wing extremism that is so potent in Washington right now. And the answer was what you're asking is what do we do? Well, the only thing that I know to do is to rally the American people around the progressive agenda.

President Donald Trump's attacks on the late Sen. John McCain are stupid and socially unnatural, Anthony Scaramucci said Thursday.
We started to walk back. Two other Senators, Sherrod Brown and Jeff Merkley and I walking back and then the Capitol Police told us to get down, to get down behind the car, get down behind anything, so then I thought, well this must be some kind of an attack, we have no idea what the facts were at that point but it was, I think everyone -- anywhere near that, I was about a block and a half away. I had great concern that it was some kind of an attack and maybe even a terrorist attack.
But the reality is, if you are in Maine, Virginia, Texas, Tennessee, there will be money in your state to help lower your premiums and provide coverage. And by the way, we protect those with pre-existing conditions.

NATO also has its own direct budget to fund its operations. While the US was also the biggest contributor to this budget in 2016, covering about 22%, it was, clearly, not alone ; Germany covered about 15%, France about 11%, the United Kingdom about 10%, and so on. Countries' contributions were set based on their national income.

The potential of the US economy to produce goods and services has not fundamentally changed, observes Michael Strain, who directs economic policy studies at the conservative American Enterprise Institute.
The President fired the pandemic specialist in this country two years ago, Bloomberg said. So, there's nobody here to figure out what the hell we should be doing. And he's defunded (the) Centers for Disease Control (and Prevention), CDC, so we don't have the organization we need.
In the tricky art of diplomacy, a reasonably good solution is not the enemy of a perfect solution, since those are rarely on offer. To be sure, the deal didn't address the fact that Iran has a robust ballistic missile program, but the deal wasn't about the unilateral disarmament of Iran – which Iran would be quite unlikely to agree to since its only real ally around the world is Syria! – but rather it was to stop the Iranians from acquiring nuclear weapons with all the new, additional leverage that would give them in the region.
For instance, last spring, conservative Justice Clarence Thomas warned in an opinion related to an Alabama abortion access law, that the time was coming for the Supreme Court to revisit its abortion jurisprudence which he said had spiraled out of control.

I know I can be too tough sometimes and I can push too hard, she told MSNBC earlier this month. That is obvious. But a lot of it is I have high expectations for myself and I have high expectations for people who work with me.
Trump added Wednesday that veterans were on his side during the dispute, because McCain didn't get the job done with the Veterans Administration.
CHAVEZ: This is playing right into President Trump's hands. I mean, really, this, you know, abolish ICE, tear down the wall. We do need walls in some places. We don't need it for 2,000 miles and we don't need it to be a concrete barrier but having a wall in California, having a wall in Texas where there are ports of entries and where you want to protect the area around it, it did, in fact, diminish the flow of people illegally into the United States when those sections of the wall were built.
But until investors have a better sense of what Trump's economic team will propose, the market may continue to tread water.
Roberts' dissents on the high court have been rare but often notable, such as on same-sex marriage.
Weakening that guarantee -- or eliminating the federal standards and oversight that ensure that states, health plans, and providers comply with it -- would worsen access to care, health, and financial security for beneficiaries and likely increase providers' uncompensated care costs, she added.
But if the analysis of the Senate bill is similar the House bill's, this promise might also be broken. The CBO found that while the House bill would decrease health care premiums for healthier, younger Americans, it could drastically increases costs for sicker, older citizens.
Pero sin importar donde estuviera, los reflectores estaban sobre Trump el sábado dado que la fecha marcaba un importante hito en la carrera de cualquier presidente. Después de servir como comandante en jefe durante 100 días, sus logros, así como sus fracasos, fueron ampliamente escrutados.

How Trump's health care loss will shape his presidency
As the Senate is expected to vote on the latest iteration of the GOP plan next week, we're tracking what Trump has promised when it comes to health care, from the campaign trail to the Oval Office.
Growing intrigue over a trio of controversial presidential picks is also underscoring the power of individual senators such as Democrat Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Republican Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, when the partisan balance is so evenly divided.
The agency also must provide information about whether existing enrollees would need to return to the exchange to access the more generous assistance.

Another important thing we have done is to develop a first-of-its-kind platform: A Better Way. If implemented, A Better Way would not only restore American leadership in the world, it would generate a true economic expansion that would lift wages, increase job opportunities and generate revenues that will help us keep the commitments we've made to our seniors and veterans.

Despite his promises to the contrary, the 2017 tax cut has ballooned the federal budget deficit , delivered its greatest rewards to wealthy Americans and failed to sustain growth of 3% or more. Business investment lags even after the top corporate tax rate dropped from 35% to 21%.
He has repeatedly mentioned Western expansion and frontiers. A new theme?
Comey responded, Never. Grassley: Question two, relatively related: have you ever authorized someone else at the FBI to be an anonymous source in news reports about the Trump investigation or the Clinton investigation? Comey: No. Grassley: Has any classified information relating to President Trump or his association -- associates been declassified and shared with the media? Comey: Not to my knowledge.
The new legislation will update Sanders'$2 2017 bill, adding provisions to broaden its scope and potentially offer new details on Sanders' plans to pay for a program that could virtually wipe out the private insurance industry. More than 150 million Americans are currently covered by private insurance through their employers and tens of millions more through Medicare Advantage. Millions more buy coverage via the Affordable Care Act's exchanges.
John McCain was tortured for more than five years in Vietnam and survived for more than a year after being diagnosed with brain cancer in 2017.
But I am not a fan of that ambassador, just so you understand. From what I understand, and I heard this a long time ago -- she wouldn't put my picture up. -- January 24 interview with Fox News' Raymond Arroyo
LEMON: Yes. That's -- we don't use that polling but I mean, it gets the point across because I think all the polling across the board shows something at least similar to what Rachael is talking about, Congressman Dent.
Still, the individual market is not likely to be a font of big profits for insurers. It's expected to generate margins of only 1% or 2%, which is why many of the larger public carriers left, said Deep Banerjee, a director at S&P Global. The employer insurance market, on the other hand, generally produces profit margins of 8% to 10%.
McConnell said last week he wants Cornyn, to stay in the Republican leadership ranks once term limits force the Texan to give up the No. 2 job at the end of the year. Cornyn said Thursday he will stay and use that position to launch an eventual run for GOP leader once McConnell leaves the post.
And there are a lot of campaign finance violations there. There's no way you can do what he's doing. You know, you go into a town, you give somebody a contribution, two days later the guy comes, 'I'd like to support Mini Mike Bloomberg.' There's something strange with that whole deal. -- February 29 speech at Conservative Political Action Conference
Why would I call China a currency manipulator when they are working with us on the North Korean problem? Trump tweeted earlier this month as he took flak for reneging on a major campaign promise.
Fifth: By saying people aren't dying by trying hydroxychloroquine, Trump is falsely implying that we know the drugs are safe to treat the virus. He has By saying people aren't dying by trying hydroxychloroquine, Trump is falsely implying that we know the drugs are safe to treat the virus. He has said this before , and it isn't accurate. The FDA gave hospitals emergency authority to use the drug, but issued warnings about deadly side effects. Also, a hydroxychloroquine trial in Brazil was halted after some patients died
In addition to the ad, the DNC has sent a detailed strategy guide on touting the bill to state parties, DNC members and national Democrats. They will also begin to train state party officials and grassroots community leaders on how to tout the bill. The sessions will be led by DNC senior adviser Brad Woodhouse.
This is an easy sale. This is a bill that helps people in a meaningful way, and it is clear recognition for folks as to where each of the parties stand where it comes to helping everyday folks, he said. We are confident they are going to remember. When it comes to election time next year, they are going to know who stood with them in their time of need and who abandoned them. It is very clear.
If you're not comfortable going through this sort of exercise on your own or you'd just prefer having an assessment from a pro, you can always hire a financial adviser to do this analysis for you.
Still, coming as it did during a general government trend away from transparency and accountability -- Trump's White House has cut back sharply on its on-camera press briefings, and even at times prohibited outlets from broadcasting audio of those briefings, for instance -- the drop-off in coverage has prompted a wave of media criticism and some questions within the press corps. If the government is keeping important business that once would have been public secret, how should the media respond? Does it have a responsibility to ensure that such issues don't fade from view?

DeSantis announced during the press conference that a COVID-19 antibodies test will be available. The test can show if a person has had the virus in the past without showing symptoms, and therefore may be immune to it.

But Kasich plans to switch from a traditional Medicaid expansion to a more conservative version that will require beneficiaries to pay more out of pocket.
TOM SCHATZ, PRESIDENT, CITIZENS AGAINST GOVERNMENT WASTE: Rather than talking about shutting down the government, it's time to talk about shutting down the waste.
Because more people would be uninsured, they'd be exposed to the full cost of their care and you'd very likely see the number of people who are carrying medical debt increase, said Sara Collins, vice president of health care coverage and access at the Commonwealth Fund, whose biennial insurance surveys examine issues of medical debt and underinsurance.
Alabama lawmakers responded by passing a law that abolished the wage increase. Every Alabama lawmaker who voted against the raise was white, according to the lawsuit.
This is largely a calculation of how many objections there are, how long it takes to vote and, of course, whether or not leadership breaks at any point to come back Thursday. Right now, the expectation is Democratic and Republican leaders want to go straight through the night if they have to. Making this too easy and giving members a break only emboldens Trump loyalists to object to more states, get more airtime and delay the inevitable. Still, don't expect members to be on the floor the entire time. They have hideaways and offices they can retreat to. They've been encouraged to stay away because of the pandemic until it's time to vote or speak.
The US vaccination effort has ramped up in meaningful ways in recent weeks. Nationwide, we've maintained a seven-day average of about 1.6 million doses per day.

He's hitting something that is socially unnatural. And so what is that? You're attacking somebody that died seven months ago, Scaramucci told CNN's John Berman on New Day. Now, I understand the point and I understand the grievance that the President's bringing up, but you're not scoring any points with anybody.
To be sure, the Covid-19 pandemic has revealed many problems with the health care system. The pandemic can be a clarion call to reenvision the entire way we deliver care. There are faults with the ACA that even proponents would say need improvement.
She's losing her parents to QAnon. Listen to her plea
We're prepared to be their worst nightmare and stand up for the working families of this country, he wrote.
Kathleen Sebelius, Obama's health and Human Services Secretary at the time, said one of the biggest issues with selling Obamacare was that most Americans saw no impact from the bill until 2014, something that is not the case with the Covid relief package.
As the crisis gets worse, with the federal government now predicting between 100,000 and 240,000 Americans could die, even if self-distancing works, the question over whether the death toll could have been eased with an earlier White House response are becoming ever more acute.
BASH: Senator, let's talk about the policy debates going on within the Democratic Party right now.
Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, who in 2007 became the first woman to win the job, would be the odds-on favorite to reclaim it. It's a remarkable feat, really, given the California Democrat's place in the national political firmament. She has for years been a bête noire for Republicans, who in turn have used her visage to raise campaign cash while daring Democratic congressional candidates to disavow her leadership.
LEMON: All right. I appreciate both of you, guys, both of your reports tonight. Thank you so much. Lots more to come on tonight's revelation of the Michael Cohen and Manafort investigation. New York prosecutors, not Robert Mueller, the first to implicate the president in a crime. What does that mean for the investigation?
When he finally had the chance to do it, he voted against repeal and replace, the President said. Remember thumbs down?
I terminated one of the most ridiculous regulations of all: the last administration's disastrous Waters of the United States rule. Thank you. It's gone. That was a rule that basically took your property away from you. I'll never forget: At the White House signing, I had probably 30, 35 people behind me -- farmers and homebuilders and others -- people that haven't cried in many years. People that weren't -- some of them were so tough, they never cried. They didn't cry when they were babies. And they were crying. No, we gave them their life back. -- January 19 speech to the American Farm Bureau Federation

Fine's role -- the one that will now be assumed in an acting capacity by Sean W. O'Donnell, who will do this along with his other job as Environmental Protection Agency Inspector General -- was to make sure that an enormous stimulus package was being spent as allocated, with minimal waste and no abuse or corruption.
So, I guess we'll have to watch the CNN Republican Debate tomorrow night to try and make up their minds. I mean we hear Donald Trump saying that he would like to win Texas. He is also saying that he expects to see Ted Cruz go way, way down in Texas. Those are his words. So we'll see what's happens come Super Tuesday. Anderson.
Sanders, who worked with Obama on a host of issues, maintained that Obama was not a progressive , but instead a centrist in the Democratic Party. He said Obama hadn't stood up to extremism in the Republican Party.
TRUMP: Education through Washington, D.C. I don't want that. I want local education. I want the parents, and I want all of the teachers, and I want everybody to get together around a school and to make education great.
Trump picked Jackson because he liked him. Because he thought Jackson did a good job at that news conference announcing the results of Trump's physical. Because it felt like the right move.
BUTTIGIEG: Well, like a lot of other things that have come along and have impacted us in the Industrial Midwest -- trade comes to mind -- we have got to make sure, this time around, that it's done in a way that benefits us, that benefits workers, more than it harms them.
The town hall format is familiar for Klobuchar, who has found success in her home state – which almost went for President Donald Trump in 2016 – by consciously visiting each of Minnesota's 87 counties, often to hold town-hall style events.
I endorsed him at his request, and I gave him the kind of funeral that he wanted, which as President I had to approve. I don't care about this. I didn't get thank you. That's OK. We sent him on the way. But I wasn't a fan of John McCain, Trump said during a speech Wednesday at a tank factory in Lima, Ohio.
And just weeks ago, for the first time since President Truman established the Air Force more than 70 years earlier, we created a new branch of the United States Armed Forces, the Space Force.
And while Biden was correct that Bloomberg fought the appointment of a monitor to oversee New York City's compliance with a court order to reform stop and frisk, he was misleading on two other points about the monitor.
The immediate obstacles. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has a five-vote margin on this bill, and scrutiny on the package -- even by some Democrats -- is more intense than last spring's stimulus.
Sen. Amy Klobuchar will take to the national stage on Monday headlining a CNN town hall in New Hampshire to make her most public case yet for why she should be the next President of the United States.
CAMEROTA: That could haven't been pleasant. All right, Chris. Because Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio were unleashing on Donald Trump in hopes of taking down the front-runner. They're banking on it not being too late, about Trump's momentum going into Super Tuesday. You're going hear from Donald Trump shortly about how he felt about all of this, but we begin our coverage of the raucous debate impact with Sunlen Serfaty. She's live in Houston.
Why is health care in the US so expensive?
We are going to rebuild that military and that military is going to find the terrorists and destroy them. And if we capture any of these terrorists alive, they're not going to have the right to remain silent. And they're not going to go to a courtroom in Manhattan. They're going to go to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba and we will find out everything they know and we'll do so legally.
Trump dips his second wife, Marla Maples, after the couple married in a private ceremony in New York in December 1993. The couple divorced in 1999 and had one daughter together, Tiffany.
One of many large boxes of returned products that fill the warehouse. The returned products in this box will eventually be sorted and categorized.
For that reason, it was a tough debate for the two contenders trailing the pack. They stated their cases effectively too: for Amy Klobuchar, I can win big and govern without extremes, and for Tom Steyer, I can beat Donald Trump on the economy. But they don't control their destiny. They can't break out unless Iowa Democrats see a need to abandon the candidates vying for the lead.

In response to Trump's tweets, Meghan McCain tweeted that No one will ever love you the way they loved my father, adding that the President should be spending time with his own family instead of obsessing over mine.
An unappetizing list of looming congressional showdowns, complex, months-long legislative challenges and intractable threats to President Donald Trump's standing threaten to make the failed health care push look like a small setback.

Of course, it can also be tough to get a clinic appointment or see a specialist in cities, but in the suburbs, Gillig said, geography exacerbates an already existing problem.
SCARAMUCCI: When you tease me, I have to stay here and not be upset.
CUOMO: But here's the thing. The step is only as good as the details of that step. And what is before the Senate right now has been scored and found grossly lacking in terms of securing the promise of the president, which wasn't as simple as repeal and replace but to make it better. How is this better?
In December, the justices heard their first major 2nd Amendment case in a decade, testing the scope of an individual's right to keep and bear arms in a dispute concerning a New York City law limiting where a licensed gun owner could take a locked an unloaded gun.
Everything that has come since – our triumph over communism, our giant leaps of science and discovery, our unrivaled progress toward equality and justice – all of it is possible thanks to the blood and tears and courage and vision of the Americans who came before.
The two Republicans' attempts to damage Cruz reflect their campaigns' understanding that their best bet at a long-shot run depends on a strong finish in Iowa – and that Cruz's strength in Iowa makes that unlikely. Whether or not the attacks help Santorum or Huckabee, though, they could hurt Cruz enough to widen the lane for middle-tier candidates such as Rubio and Christie.
At the core of our system is America's generally competitive marketplace for health care services. America has the most innovative health care economy in the world. No other country even comes close. This innovation manifests itself in the latest biopharmaceuticals, medical devices and surgical techniques, as well as rapidly evolving health IT and quality and outcomes measurements. Because our policymakers avoided price controls and tried to create competitive marketplaces for many of these products, we've driven down prices for consumers and expanded options for patients – all while promoting innovation.
Trump said, of the Grand Princess cruise ship that was being kept in limbo over coronavirus concerns, We do have a situation where we have this massive ship with 5,000 people and we have to make a decision. He later amended the claim slightly, saying, It's close to 5,000 people. -- March 6 exchange with reporters at signing of coronavirus appropriations bill
And the people who are losing out are in manufacturing jobs, or the steel industry or the auto industry. But I'll tell you who else is going to be losing out, which is the service industry. This Obama administration is negotiating the Trade in Services Agreement which is another treaty to allow services to come in and take jobs from Americans as well.
Stalled in his efforts to repeal and replace the Obama-era Affordable Care Act in Congress, Trump vowed late last month to take executive action to change aspects of the law, which he has deemed a failure. The plan has drawn backing from legislators like Sen. Rand Paul, the Kentucky Republican who has identified specific reforms that could be made by the President alone.
This wouldn't have made the claim accurate, since Trump has not implemented any of his proposals to impound or tax remittance money to pay for the wall, but it might have seemed at least slightly more plausible if he had taken the time to memorize the right word.
We virtually ended the estate, or death, tax on small businesses, ranches, and family farms.
As Congress weighs repeal of the Affordable Care Act, the home state of Vice President Mike Pence is seeking to keep its conservative-style Medicaid expansion that the federal health law made possible.
While the numbers Cruz cited of naval power are correct, the decline of ship power took place over the course of two decades and multiple presidential administrations, and not just the past seven years, as Cruz posited.
I ask the men and women of this Congress: Look at the opportunities before us! Our most thrilling achievements are still ahead. Our most exciting journeys still await. Our biggest victories are still to come. We have not yet begun to dream.
President Jimmy Carter had appointed 197 people to federal courts by December 20 of his third year in office, Wheeler said. If you go by the percentage of the judiciary appointed, both Carter (29%) and President Richard Nixon (31%) had Trump (21%) beat, according to data Wheeler provided to CNN.
It's with that in mind that Trump backed his White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney's arguments that the administration should support a federal judge's ruling in Texas invalidating Obamacare in its entirety, a senior White House official and Republican close to the campaign told CNN.

KING: And their leader -- and their leader just said he was slapping the American bastards in their face.
The President has the support of millions of veterans in the United States. I don't think those veterans are in love with the fact that he's attacking John McCain, he said.
The Congressional Budget Office has yet to release its evaluation of the bill Cassidy co-authored with Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina. Its reviews of earlier GOP bills in the House and Senate found that at least 22 million fewer people would have coverage by 2026, compared to current law.
RUBIO: The majority of Republican voters in this country do not want Donald Trump to be the nominee. I think that's been pretty clear. Now, the problem is that they are divided up among four people.
And more Americans say the country would be better off (40%) than worse off (28%) should Democrats take control of Congress in this November's elections. That's a wider margin that felt the nation would be better off should Republicans take control back in 2010. Only about a quarter now (27%) say it doesn't make a difference, fewer than felt that way in 2014 or 2010, suggesting voters see this year's contest as more consequential.
Dominica is an island of 70,000 or so people. It has been decimated from end to end. We're in the capital, Roseau, at the moment. Everywhere I look around me, I can see roofs torn off and, in many cases, down below, houses completely demolished.
California Representative and Chairman of the House Intelligence Committee Adam Schiff, thank you so much for joining me this morning.

Can we talk about the power grid? I mean, when we've spoken to you, as well as when we've spoken to the head of the Power and Light Company, I mean, the estimates are just really disheartening that it's going to be between some -- I mean, do you still believe it will be between four and six months to get power restored there?
When President Donald Trump named White House physician Ronny Jackson as his choice to be the next head of the Department of Veterans Affairs, it caught lots of people – inside and outside 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue – by surprise.
(CNN) No matter how much President Donald Trump and his acolytes persist in trying to minimize the dangers of the coronavirus, the rest of the world -- and the virus -- are not following his lead.
Ohio State went 12-1 this season. Meyer was suspended for the first three games of 2018, stemming from his handling of domestic violence allegations against a former assistant.
Everybody saw him as by far and away the best candidate we could field. So, that was an all-in proposition to try to get him to reconsider, Holmes said.
[22:20:01] And so, hopefully her tour, this information will help enlighten that. But the administration, instead of trying to actually address these problems, is wanting to build walls, wanting to stop people at the ports of entry from seeking asylum, essentially trying -- separating families, using tear gas against people.
Right? You know, I think Robert Mueller has known where this has been going for quite some time. You can sort of see the building blocks of a pretty methodical investigation coming together.

Sen. John Barrasso of Wyoming, the third senator Trump name-checked, spoke with Trump about health care on Wednesday morning, but his staff said they did not have anything to share at the moment when asked about the specific working group.
Under the current Obamacare system, we have a Washington- controlled system with skyrocketing premiums and dwindling choices. It's a death spiral. It's collapsing. The government makes you buy what you want to buy. And it's an open-ended subsidy for a lot of Americans.
There's more Democratic unity than ever on taking bold steps on an economic dignity compact, said Gene Sperling, who authored a 2020 book on that subject after working for both previous Democratic presidents.

The report showed that only 4% of employers with at least 50 employees said they shifted some staffers to part-time hours so they wouldn't qualify for health care, and another 4% said they were reducing the number of full-time employees they planned to hire because of the cost of health benefits. Kaiser found that 10% of employers reported that they were changing workers from part-time to full-time status to enable them to obtain coverage.

It worked like a charm during the 2016 campaign. Trump went from an asterisk to the White House by – and I am only oversimplifying slightly here – doing the opposite of what everyone said he should. (Thank you George Costanza!)

Thank you. God Bless You, God Bless America, and good night!
Cruz has been at the forefront of the fight to repeal Obamacare and to kill funding for Planned Parenthood. He is one of the Republicans who does not believe in scientific evidence about climate change. They're cooking the books, the senator said in reference to government research on the subject.
Trump has already thrown his weight behind the plan, tweeting: I am very supportive of the Senate #HealthcareBill. Look forward to making it really special!
(CNN) Many of us vividly recall the hotly contested 2016 primary race between Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton, whom I strongly supported. Sanders' message of fighting income inequality and pushing for Medicare for all resonated with many Democratic voters, as it does now, and after winning the New Hampshire primary he seemed to have momentum on his side. But the race inevitably shifted to the South and its heavy contingent of black voters.
Si el gobierno federal estuviera en buenas manos, se habría hecho cargo de la crisis mucho antes. Trump no habría resistido las llamadas urgentes para promulgar la Ley de Producción de Defensa hace semanas, cuando la Cámara de Comercio lo persuadió de no usar su poder para ordenar la producción de ventiladores.
The President can say whatever he wants about whatever he thinks Pence's role is in this scenario. None of what he's saying is accurate. Pence, as CNN's Ted Barrett reported, huddled with the parliamentarians for several hours earlier this week. And he's Mike Pence, so it's fair to say he's fully prepared -- and fully aware -- of what his role is here.
The bill does specifically envision private agreements — not insurance — between individuals and providers or groups of providers outside of Medicare for All. But providers, once they enter into such agreements, cannot participate in the government program for a year.
New York (CNN Business) Big health care companies will undoubtedly be political punching bags during the 2020 presidential campaign, as candidates all seem to have their own ideas on how overhaul the industry. And that could be a problem for investors in the stocks of major drugmakers, insurers and hospitals.
Total household debt climbed to $12.73 trillion in the first three months of the year, according to data released last week by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.
But the Wisconsin Republican, speaking on CNN's New Day, expressed confidence that congressional Republicans could coalesce around a plan despite multiple competing proposals. He also suggested that the strategy to replace Obamacare would involve a series of piecemeal reforms as opposed to a complete overhaul.
VISER: No. And I think your -- you know, if Mitch McConnell's watching this, you know, his stomach's turning a little bit because when people go back to their districts they tend to get more entrenched in their prior positions than to sort of lean more toward compromise. I think what's interesting here too, though, is that Collins was sort of the exception in marching in a Fourth of July parade. You know, senators even avoiding that sort of softball, you know, pitch down the middle, you know, going to a parade to march in because they're so afraid of engaging with constituents. And The Washington Post had a good line today too about, there are more senators on this trip to Afghanistan --
Trump likes to portray undocumented immigrants as dangerous. The reality is different. He will use this type of language throughout the election year. Here's a fact check from last year, when Trump said something similar in an Oval Office pitch for more border money.
HARLOW: Good morning. You were part of this call with the president while he was in Asia on taxes. And at one point, it's reported that you looked over to his chief economic adviser, Gary Cohn, and said to him, quote, We're not going to have a real conversation here. Can you just tell the president he's brilliant and say we're losing the connection and hang up? Seriously?
Those who are sick seek out coverage and enroll, he continued. But the advertising campaigns draw healthier residents who may not be as aware of the coverage or the subsidies -- and these folks can help balance the risk and lower premiums for everyone.
WASHINGTON, DC - MAY 2: New York Governor Andrew Cuomo holds a news conference at the National Press Club May 27, 2020 in Washington, DC.

Joe Biden is not the perfect candidate. I take issue with many of the votes he cast as a senator and I wish his candidacy resonated more with younger voters. But Biden understands the importance of black voters and he has his pulse on the electorate. He had a regular presence in African American churches and gained the support of 100 black faith leaders in South Carolina leading up to the state's primary.
SCARAMUCCI: Well, OK, so let's talk about that, OK? If you take the psychological equation of insecurity, plus under confidence, I've run two successful businesses. Insecurity plus under confidence always equals paranoia and backstabbing. It always does.
CRUZ: Well, look. I'll point out first of all it is a matter of public record that Donald supported John Kerry in 2004 over George W. Bush, and he supported Hillary Clinton, gave her two checks in a presidential campaign in 2008. And indeed, once she was secretary of State, he described her as one of the greatest secretaries of State in industry.
My Administration has acted decisively to confront the world's leading state sponsor of terror: the radical regime in Iran.
Facts First: It's not true that Trump playing golf at his own courses does not cost taxpayers money.
Now that they're rationing water for people, they're saying you're going to get, very shortly -- I heard the governor saying you get 50 gallons. Fifty gallons sounds okay. People tell me it's like nothing. By the time you do with your showers, and your hands, and your tissues, and everything, 50 gallons is very, very little. Can you imagine a state being rationed, when you have millions and millions and millions of gallons being poured out into the Pacific Ocean that you could have? And you'd have more water than knew what to do with. It's crazy. Crazy. Crazy. -- February 19 remarks to rural stakeholders on California water accessibility
'9/11-type commission' coming. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced in a House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced in a letter to House Democrats on Monday plans for creating a 9/11-type commission to investigate the January 6 attack on the US Capitol.
Trump said: Look, you had somebody -- just recently, you saw what happened. He got two months. He got sentenced to two months for leaking classified information at the highest level. And: But think of it: A man leaks classified information -- highly classified. They give him two months. -- February 12 exchange with reporters at meeting with Ecuadorian President Lenín Moreno
And this guy -- it was pretty even, and I think he won by 28 points, right? It was like -- Greg Murphy. -- February 7 speech at North Carolina Opportunity Now Summit
It's also wise to take market predictions related to politics with a grain of salt. No one knows exactly how the market will react to a new sheriff in town. And at the end of the day, the underlying health of the economy and corporate profits, not politics, is the real driver of stock prices.
Since World War II, only one period in American history had sustained annual growth in the gross domestic product of over 2% without a contraction – through the 1960s.
In 2007, just prior to the stocks losing more than half of their value during the financial crisis, more than four in ten 401(k) participants age 56 to 65 had in excess of 70% of their 401(k) account invested in stocks, according to an Employee Benefit Research Institute report. As a result, many older 401(k) participants saw substantial declines in the value of their nest egg.
Trump displayed the same bravado on NAFTA Thursday morning as he did on the campaign trail, despite backing down on a potential NAFTA withdrawal just the night before.
And working together, the Congress can reduce drug prices substantially from current levels. I have been speaking to Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa and others in the Congress in order to get something on drug pricing done, and done properly. I am calling for bipartisan legislation that achieves the goal of dramatically lowering prescription drug prices. Get a bill to my desk, and I will sign it into law without delay.
In March, the justices will take up Trump's bid to shield his financial documents from disclosure.
We must choose whether we are defined by our differences – or whether we dare to transcend them.
Conservatives once viewed Trump skeptically. Now the GOP is united behind him. That doesn't mean there isn't frustration with his behavior.
Facts First: Trump was at least slightly exaggerating Green's comments. In May, Green said this: I'm concerned that if we don't impeach this President, he will get reelected. In September, when Trump previously claimed Green had said we can't beat Trump without impeachment, Green told CNN, I never said we can't beat the President.
LEMON: There is today stunning news through the Michael Flynn revelations that came out, so much new information about the Russia investigation. Your party is taking charge of the House come January. You will have subpoena power. What do you plan to do first?
CAREY: What I can say is she has never disclosed anything of that nature. And since my sister is not here to speak for herself, that statement in itself is very questionable.
We may not always agree on where to go, but I think we can find some common ground on these issues, Becerra said.
BLOOMBERG: The current president doesn't seem to have any feeling of sacrifice for the good of the country. And maybe that's one of the real differences. It's not policy, it's how you purport yourself.
You said -- quote -- That's not our view in the House.
Special Agent Hernandez, please stand: We will always support the brave men and women of Law Enforcement – and I pledge to you tonight that we will never abolish our heroes from ICE.
ACOSTA: Eyeing the Bible belt states up for grabs on Super Tuesday next week, Trump appealed to Christian conservatives by sitting down with Televangelist, Pat Robertson.
New police radio dispatches and security footage from the January 6 US Capitol riot paint an even sharper picture of how the insurrectionists at times showed little fear of the police as they launched a large and coordinated attack.
CONSUEGRA: Basically, I just want to say that this type of situation, we have to end.
The American Cancer Society issued a report saying that the cancer death rate had fallen in 2017 for the 26th consecutive year. Trump suggested his administration was somehow responsible for this 26th decline. U.S. Cancer Death Rate Lowest In Recorded History! A lot of good news coming out of this Administration, he tweeted
Trump claimed on three occasions that Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer had falsely claimed Trump's phase one trade deal with China involved Trump taking off tariffs.
A lot of rain coming in and we already have these flash flood warnings going on. Some spots could pick up 20 or 15 inches of rain. I know that's not 40 or 50 like we had in Harvey, but this is a mountainous island so this is going to run off very quickly.
Facts First: The US has not just now become the world's top energy producer, and it's not true that we weren't number one: the US took the top spot : The US has not just now become the world's top energy producer, and it's not true that we weren't number one: the US took the top spot in 2012 , according to the US government's Energy Information Administration -- under the very Obama administration Trump is accusing of perpetrating a war on the industry.
Now is the time for bipartisan action. Believe it or not, we have already proven that it is possible.

The new poll marks the first time this election season CNN has looked at preferences among likely voters. Typically, likely voters in midterm elections are a bit more Republican-leaning than the broader pool of registered voters. This year, Democrats are expressing just as much interest in voting as Republicans, and voters who are Democrats or Democratic-leaning independents continue to be more enthusiastic about casting a ballot for Congress than those who tilt toward the GOP (56% are extremely or very enthusiastic vs. 50% of Republican voters).
The nomination exemplifies McConnell's enduring pledge to make the confirmation of judges his top priority, and infuriates Walker's critics who say he is unqualified in part because he only graduated from law school a little more than a decade ago. They are opposed to positions he has taken on the Affordable Care Act as well as his defense of then-Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
But White House officials make clear the real negotiation hasn't even started yet -- and that Biden, with decades of legislative work and relationships in the Senate, plans to give it time and space to come to fruition before moving in another direction.
LEMON: Yes. By the way, before you go, if they had not done it, that's what the story would have been about.

But eight in 10 consumers will be able to find policies for $75 or less. That's because the price spike means many enrollees will receive more generous premium subsidies, and some may be able to afford gold policies with lower deductibles or find bronze plans with no premiums.
(CNN) President Joe Biden is reopening enrollment on the federal Affordable Care Act exchanges as part of two health care executive actions that he signed Thursday, taking a step to help uninsured Americans that former President Donald Trump rejected.
Joshua Busby, an associate professor of public affairs at the University of Texas who studies energy and environmental policy, noted that manufacturers who simply require electricity to power their factories could get that electricity from renewable sources. Solar and wind are cost competitive across much of the United States with natural gas, and the lowest cost option in a number of locations, Busby said. And he noted that most US petroleum use is in transportation -- motor gasoline alone made up 46% of US petroleum use in 2018, according to the federal government -- not in industrial production; the use of vehicles that run without using petroleum could be greatly expanded. Some heavy industries will be difficult sectors to fully decarbonize and move to 100% renewables, but nobody is proposing to do that overnight, Busby said.
QUESTION: And then I also want just, sort of, an update on the new chief of staff, General Kelly.
BROCK LONG, FEMA ADMINISTRATOR: Good morning.

Merely since August 2019, there have been news stories about  11 suspicious deaths at the Louis A. Johnson VA Medical Center, how Veterans Affairs failed to stop a pathologist who misdiagnosed 3,000 cases and wasn't fired until 2018, how a Veterans Affairs medical center in West Virginia is being investigated over allegations that one of its physicians sexually assaulted more than a dozen patients, and how a veteran at a VA facility in Georgia was allegedly bitten by ants 100 times before his death.
All of that means that where the White House finds itself today with Jackson – dead in the water unless something changes – was entirely predictable. Governing by the seat of your pants is rarely a recipe for success; there's a reason, after all, that things like vetting exist.
SANDERS: It doesn't bother me that the press secretary would take a meeting with somebody involved in the media about a story. None of that was disclosed. They had a conversation and that was the end of it.
As the Senate is expected to vote on the latest iteration of the GOP plan next week, we're tracking what Trump has promised when it comes to health care, from the campaign trail to the Oval Office.
Bloomberg, of course, is hardly the only presidential candidate trying to step into the glow of the former president. At least five Democratic contenders have used Obama in their advertising.
Furthermore, researchers from Carnegie Mellon University who studied Environmental Protection Agency data found that air pollution increased between 2016 and 2018.
[13:35:28] UNIDENTIFIED CONGRESSMAN: Gentleman from Texas.
My Administration has cut more regulations in a short time than any other administration during its entire tenure. Companies are coming back to our country in large numbers thanks to historic reductions in taxes and regulations.
Not so. The penalty won't go away until 2019, and that means you still will owe Uncle Sam if you didn't have health insurance — or an exemption from the mandate — in 2017. The same holds true for this year.
After so many months of bad news, it's quite something to see the giddiness of people who have already got their shots in a new season of hope. If everything goes well, the long-awaited light at the end of the tunnel might just be the fireworks bursting in air on America's birthday.
That's - all of it will be eaten up by that. That's a debt crisis. And it will be debilitating to our economy and our children deserve better than to inherit a debt crisis.

They're making things up. This is the craziest thing anyone's ever seen, and the two articles that they put in, as you know, they're not crimes, they're not -- they're not even allowed to be put in. It's a disgrace. -- January 10 interview with Fox News' Laura Ingraham
Klobuchar spent the lead-up to the town hall with a trip through Wisconsin and Iowa, building on her campaign theme of retaking Midwest communities that have drifted away from Democrats in recent years. Klobuchar, a three-term senator from Minnesota, is pitching herself as a pragmatic lawmaker who is willing to work with those who oppose her to get things done.
Race for health care votes is on, again
You look around, there is -- there is debris littering like confetti around the fields and the hillsides. There have been a lot of mudslides. This -- we talked to the prime minister yesterday. This is an agriculture-based economy. Cane fields. You've got banana plantations, citrus growth. Gone. Everything. There's not a leaf on this island, Chris.
As part of our commitment to improving opportunity for women everywhere, this Thursday we are launching the first ever Government-wide initiative focused on economic empowerment for women in developing countries.
There are tougher tests up ahead. If Democrats retake Congress and the White House, would they be willing to spend the required political capital to pass new gun laws? The answer, for now at least, is probably not. There are more galvanizing priorities, like expanding public health care programs or access to higher education, that would almost surely come first.
We don't want insurance companies becoming monopolies, looking for favoritism in a cronyistic way at Washington. We want health insurers, hospitals, doctors, all providers of health care benefits competing against each other for our business as consumers.
That's why Klobuchar bungling an interview in Nevada and awkwardly being unable to name the President of Mexico could provide a flash point in Wednesday's contest.
Any increase in ObamaCare premiums is the fault of the Democrats for giving us a 'product' that never had a chance of working, he tweeted.
Capping off the best performance of the evening, Elizabeth Warren got the most of Bernie Sanders in a much-awaited exchange over comments he allegedly made to her once doubting whether a woman could be elected president. But this might not move the needle much: Sanders is not actually the frontrunner, Warren is going to need his supporters down the road, and negative campaigning could always backfire.
CUOMO: But the presidency of the United States, you have to respect it because it has so much power and so much influence in our government.

Facts First: There were approximately 5 million total stop and frisk stops during Bloomberg's tenure as mayor between 2002 and 2013, but Biden was inaccurate when he said that this was the number of young black men stopped. Of about 5.08 million total stops under Bloomberg, about half, approximately 2.6 million stops, were of black people -- men and women of all ages, according to police data compiled by the There were approximately 5 million total stop and frisk stops during Bloomberg's tenure as mayor between 2002 and 2013, but Biden was inaccurate when he said that this was the number of young black men stopped.

They talked about it. They explicitly made the idea of racism as a divide-and-conquer tool a part of worker education, a part of the rhetoric, a part of the protest signs. The zero sum is so pervasive in our politics and is part of the right-wing messaging that in order to counter it you have to engage with it head on, you have to call it out. Give people a way to recognize it and reject it.
One GOP leadership aide predicted that Poe's defection, which Fox News first reported, could be just the first of the defections from the group.
A person close to Trump vowed Trump will only ramp up his actions on trade – still searching to make good in bold fashion on Trump's campaign rhetoric.

Sen. Amy Klobuchar will take to the national stage on Monday headlining a CNN town hall in New Hampshire to make her most public case yet for why she should be the next President of the United States.
She later added, We live in an era where we knock down old American heroes for all their imperfections when no leader wants to admit to fault or failure.
Trump added Wednesday that veterans were on his side during the dispute, because McCain didn't get the job done with the Veterans Administration.
A Fox News poll on the impeachment trial
SCHIFF: Well, it tells me that, as we have seen in other cases that the special counsel has brought, the full story is not in the indictment, that it is very possible that the best evidence is yet to come, that, in fact, here, there were search warrants executed on multiple accounts of these Russian hackers that reveal communications between Roger Stone and WikiLeaks, and essentially directly with the GRU and Roger Stone, because the GRU is acting with the persona Guccifer 2.0.
The President has the support of millions of veterans in the United States. I don't think those veterans are in love with the fact that he's attacking John McCain, he said.
As rioters began to overrun the officers, creating an untenable situation, radio waves filled with desperate shouts and requests for backup:

Just over one-third of respondents to the Kaiser poll felt the bill would worsen the quality of their health care and their ability to get and keep health insurance, the Kaiser survey found. Only 15% thought quality would improve, and 16% felt their ability to get and keep a policy would be better. (About half felt the bill wouldn't make much difference to them.)
PIERS MORGAN, CNN ANCHOR: An unbelievable day of breaking news in Washington as the parties battled inside the Capitol, and that's why we're obviously all here tonight, there was panic outside.
For more on stimulus negotiations, CNN Political Director David Chalian breaks down the deliberations. Plus, it's looking more and more like there will be a Trump on the ballot in 2022.

Just landed - a long trip, but everybody can now feel much safer than the day I took office, Trump said on Twitter. There is no longer a Nuclear Threat from North Korea.
NEUGEBAUER: Well, it should be difficult.
COOPER: He was saying that the driver ran over one of the motorcyclists.
Insurers would likely raise their rates, further hobbling that market.
The next step forward in building an inclusive society is making sure that every young American gets a great education and the opportunity to achieve the American Dream. Yet, for too long, countless American children have been trapped in failing government schools. To rescue these students, 18 States have created school choice in the form of Opportunity Scholarships. The programs are so popular, that tens of thousands of students remain on waiting lists. One of those students is Janiyah Davis, a fourth grader from Philadelphia. Janiyah's mom Stephanie is a single parent. She would do anything to give her daughter a better future. But last year, that future was put further out of reach when Pennsylvania's Governor vetoed legislation to expand school choice for 50,000 children.
According to Carlos Conde, the Philippines researcher for Human Rights Watch's Asia division, the militant groups operated mainly on the southern island called Mindanao, but even then just a small portion of Mindanao. Conde added that the conflict Trump may have been referring to happened only in one city, Marawi.
CUOMO: I believe in the presidency. I believe in the respect for it. But maybe it's because I went to military school. And you know, there were a lot of guys I hated who were superior officers of mine, but I had to respect the rank--
We're leading with people that don't know what they are doing in terms of our leadership. I'd say a minimum of one year, maybe two years.
-- Effectively end Obamacare in 2020 by eliminating the federal subsidies that help people afford individual coverage.
There are also tens of millions more who are covered by private plans through Medicare Advantage, Medicaid managed care plans and on the Obamacare individual market.
They let you take action, the person said of the orders. It doesn't take place of something statutory.
MORGAN: So when will it all end? Well, I'll ask top lawmakers. Also a tropical Storm Karen taking aim along the gulf, will it make landfall and why is the shutdown making it tougher to track, we'll have all that later. And my interview with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and what he says about Iran that may surprise you as much as it surprised me.

The plan's effects will become more clear when the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) releases its analysis of the bill early next week.
Brian Beutler, a writer for the liberal magazine New Republic, had a similar lament, writing that McConnell didn't lock down the bill-writing process in order to block liberals from going over the bill with a fine-tooth comb.
And beyond the diplomatic implications, Trump has also had to confront the reality that China long ago stopped artificially devaluing its currency – instead working to prop it up, which benefits US exports.
And so what health savings accounts achieves -- this is a law that I helped write in 2003, something that we as conservatives have been fighting for for the whole time -- is we want to increase health savings accounts, which is what we do in this bill, so we have more competition and lower costs.
Association health plans, along with short-term health policies, are at the heart of Trump's drive to increase choice and lower costs in the health insurance market -- and chip away at the Affordable Care Act.
Facts First: Even if Trump meant that the flu has a much higher fatality rate than 0.1% -- rather than meaning that the flu's mortality rate is much higher than that of the novel coronavirus -- he was wrong. The mortality rate for seasonal flu is about 0.1%, 0.2% at the most, Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the National Institutes of Health -- who appeared with Trump at this same news conference -- : Even if Trump meant that the flu has a much higher fatality rate than 0.1% -- rather than meaning that the flu's mortality rate is much higher than that of the novel coronavirus -- he was wrong. The mortality rate for seasonal flu is about 0.1%, 0.2% at the most, Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the National Institutes of Health -- who appeared with Trump at this same news conference -- told this to USA Today in mid-February, echoing the comments of other experts and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data since 2010
Turning to immigration, Cruz has called for an amendment that would deny citizenship to the children of persons who were in the U.S. illegally. Cruz, who also wants to build a wall, has called for tripling the number of Border Patrol agents and vastly increasing the number of aircraft they have available, and greatly expanding the fencing separating the countries.
Trump attends a news conference in 2005 that announced the establishment of Trump University. From 2005 until it closed in 2010, Trump University had about 10,000 people sign up for a program that promised success in real estate. Three separate lawsuits -- two class-action suits filed in California and one filed by New York's attorney general -- argued that the program was mired in fraud and deception. Trump's camp rejected the suits' claims as baseless. And Trump has charged that the New York case against him is politically motivated.
Talking about how his campaign has canceled rallies because of the coronavirus, Trump said, And we had four or five of them that we were thinking about. We have a big one in Tampa, all sold out. We have over 100,000 requests for tickets, but I think we'll probably not do it because people would say it's better to not do. -- March 12 exchange with reporters before meeting with Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar
Facts First: Trump was exaggerating. The economy added 487,000 manufacturing jobs between January 2017, when Trump took office, and December 2019, : Trump was exaggerating. The economy added 487,000 manufacturing jobs between January 2017, when Trump took office, and December 2019, official data shows . The number is 514,000 jobs added if you go back to November 2016, the month of Trump's election, as Trump often likes to do.
In the last 3 years, ICE has arrested over 5,000 wicked human traffickers – and I have signed 9 pieces of legislation to stamp out the menace of human trafficking, domestically and around the globe.
Facts First: The Fox News poll Trump : The Fox News poll Trump appeared to be referencing found that 48% of people questioned said the Senate already has enough information to make its decision on Trump's articles of impeachment, versus 44% who said the Senate needs to hear more witness testimony. Forty-eight to 44 is a plurality, not a majority.
Insurers, however, were leaving Ohio's exchange even before President Trump took office in January, the state insurance department pointed out. Some 17 companies participated on the exchange in 2016, and there were at least four insurers offering policies in each of Ohio's 88 counties.
Facts First: While Iran's economy did shrink in 2019, Trump exaggerated the size of the contraction. In January 2020, the United Nations : While Iran's economy did shrink in 2019, Trump exaggerated the size of the contraction. In January 2020, the United Nations said Iran's gross domestic product shrunk by 7.1% in 2019. The International Monetary Fund said in October 2019 that it expected a 9.5% contraction in 2019. The same month, World Bank forecast an 8.7% contraction for the 2019-2020 period
The outgoing legislative affairs director told CNN that he has personal relationships with people who advise McCain and that he would reach out to those contacts during contentious points.
But if Democrats have learned anything from the campaign that ended with Trump's election, or the years of political brawling that created the environment in which a Trump candidacy could flourish and win, they should understand now that the old rules no longer apply. So it goes for the long-standing conventional wisdom, which holds that an independent streak, a maverick tendency to buck the party (as the clichés go), is the best way to win over either nonideological or ideologically opposed voters.
And he will use the freshly passed stimulus plan -- which the White House has said is necessary to jump-start the country out of crisis -- as reason for optimism.
Facts First: Trump was misrepresenting Kelly's immigration positions.
Of course, this is nonsense. For the Obama administration it was simply the best deal on offer. Could the Obama team have pushed harder for tougher sunset clauses on the deal that would have pushed even further into the future the moment when Iran could resume its nuclear program? Maybe.
JEFFREY TOOBIN, FMR FEDERAL PROSECUTOR: Well I think it's probably a combination of all of those things. I mean, look, the most important fact here is that the Republican Senate is not going to consider anybody. Barring some political development that just seems completely unlikely at this point.
And I was pleased to announce last year that for the first time in 51 years, the cost of prescription drugs actually went down, Trump said during his State of the Union address.
This is New Hampshire, anything could happen, she said when asked about the town hall at an event earlier in the day.
Over the weekend, according to two people familiar with the call, President Donald Trump spoke directly with the legislation's top sponsors Republican Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Lamar Alexander of Tennessee and expressed his support for the plan. But Democrats have rebuffed abortion restrictions that Republicans want to include in it. And some conservatives have balked at spending money to prop up a health care system they tried to repeal last year.
President Donald Trump has made some grand promises on health care.

Enrollment isn't final until consumers pay their first month's premium, and the tally usually declines after the sign-up period.
And, you know, in seeing the documentary, it revealed to me something that she did in that sketch that I was completely unaware of, which was the sketch was dying. And she just started to do some physical stuff to get it going and bring it to life. And it worked.
Under my Administration, we will never apologize for advancing America's interests.
We're here in Charleston, and you know who is going to be in Charleston later this week? It's Donald Trump, Warren said. He's going to be here to raise money for his buddy, Senator Lindsey Graham. Who funded Lindsey Graham's campaign for reelection last time? It was Mayor Bloomberg. And that's not the only right-wing senator that mayor Bloomberg has funded.
But also, other presidents had 'em. You know FDR had a lawyer, who was practically, you know, was totally involved with government. Eisenhower had a lawyer. They all had lawyers. Bill Clinton had a lawyer. You know he had a very good lawyer, you know (who) that was. They all had lawyers and they do things for 'em. -- February 13 radio interview with Geraldo Rivera
For 2016, more than 9.6 million people signed up via the federal exchange, healthcare.gov, which covers enrollment in 38 states. More than 4 million were new consumers, many of whom were on the younger side. Insurers covet younger enrollees because they tend to be healthier and less costly. Overall, the number of consumers age 18 to 34 remained the same as last year.
Ireland lives in Flint, where she's been affected by the water crisis, and for years she was unable to afford health insurance. When Michigan's expanded Medicaid was enacted, she enrolled and now receives annual physicals and preventative care. She is counting on Snyder to save Medicaid expansion in Michigan, and worries about the Trump administration's planned repeal of Obamacare.
Ellie reminds us that every child is a miracle of life. Thanks to modern medical wonders, 50 percent of very premature babies delivered at the hospital where Ellie was born now survive. Our goal should be to ensure that every baby has the best chance to thrive and grow just like Ellie. That is why I am asking the Congress to provide an additional $50 million to fund neo-natal research for America's youngest patients. That is also why I am calling upon the Members of Congress here tonight to pass legislation finally banning the late-term abortion of babies.
Jeffrey Sachs,  The main lesson of the Democratic primaries, wrote,  is the growing generational divide in US politics , one that reflects the deep and disruptive shifts taking place in the US economy. Former Vice President Joe Biden has captured the votes of older Democrats; Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders the votes of younger Democrats.
And I want to start with health care. You just introduced a bill this past week that would allow Americans over 50 years old to buy into Medicare. But more than 20 million people are uninsured under the age of 50. So a lot of your colleagues, as you know, are supporting Medicare for all, a plan that would cover everyone.
SCARAMUCCI: And figure out directionally where we're going. But I would recommend to every cabinet secretary and every teammate that I have here on the West Wing, have a tough skin.
This is not a problem that will be solved by blaming the news media as Trump did amid the market selloff. It requires smart, humane, energetic action.
The USMCA will create nearly 100,000 new high-paying American auto jobs, and massively boost exports for our farmers, ranchers, and factory workers. It will also bring trade with Mexico and Canada to a much higher degree, but also to a much greater level of fairness and reciprocity. This is the first major trade deal in many years to earn the strong backing of America's labor unions.
CNN's Lauren Fox and Ashley Killough contributed to this report.
The situation before Right to Try
Trump, who frequently seems to have his predecessor on his mind for no particular reason , is fond of claiming he has managed to do things President Barack Obama could not -- whether or not Obama actually failed to do these things.
Authorities that are being told by law enforcement source did find an envelope which they deemed suspicious. The envelope was addressed to the woman's boyfriend, they'd had his name on it. That envelope now being taken away for testing about bomb squad that's on scene, you got Hazmat teams that are on scene. We've also got federal law enforcement teams who are there waiting to go in, to execute a search warrant. But right now, what they wanted to do it they wanted to take everybody out of that complex to make sure that the area was indeed safe.
Most of the questions on Monday will come from New Hampshire voters, an electorate which prizes its position as the first-in-the-nation primary and is often known for asking discerning and pointed questions.
Facts First: This is basically true. By repeatedly recertifying the nuclear deal and waiving sanctions against Tehran as a result, the Trump administration effectively acknowledged that Iran was abiding by the terms of the deal even as the President publicly criticized it.
The bill also says the health and human services secretary will lay out a system by which claims of discrimination should be adjudicated and that courts can grant damages.
He asked nothing in return and we are getting nothing in return. And Cuba and its regime remains an anti-American communist dictatorship, helped North Korea evade U.N. sanctions. It's harboring fugitives of American justice, including people stealing our Medicare money and moving back to Cuba, all in exchange for nothing.
Governor Greg Abbott today held a press conference in Houston on the importance of election integrity legislation this session. The Governor named election integrity as an emergency legislative item during his State of the State address in February. Governor Abbott was joined for the press conference by Senator Paul Bettencourt and Representative Briscoe Cain, who have both filed several pieces of legislation to enhance election integrity in Texas
The names added to the the advisory team Thursday include:
You're going to vote 'no' and then shut down the government? asked Rep. Mark Sanford, a Republican from South Carolina, when asked if the House Freedom Caucus was doing little more than paving the way for a big increase in spending in a later deal by supporting short-term continuing resolutions.

Trump, center, stands at attention during his senior year at the New York Military Academy in 1964.
But millions of Americans in the health care safety net program already have jobs.
Klobuchar's electability in Minnesota, which has largely come by taking more politically moderate positions, has some Democrats questioning whether the senator will be able to capture the imagination of a party that has drifted to the left nationally.
Democrats in the Senate are keeping a close eye on their GOP counterparts and, according to a senior aide to a member of the caucus, remain overwhelmingly upbeat about the White House's proposal and the messaging around it.
Trump is going to swing like a guillotine and take everything up. So, I've been encouraging, you know, Cruz last night and even online today to do something very bold, shift the way talks about.
Sanders has insisted that he should emerge as the nominee if he wins a plurality of the votes. But other candidates have not ruled out an effort to thwart him at the convention in July.
KASICH: The president of the United States should be convening a meeting, should have convened a meeting with Apple and our security forces, and then you know what you do when you're the president? You lock the door, and you say, You're not coming out until you reach an agreement that both gives the security people what they need and protects the rights of Americans. This is a failure of his leadership to get this done as an executive should be doing it.
These policies are different from those offered on the exchange, said James Parker, senior advisor to Health Secretary Alex Azar. We make no representation that it's equivalent coverage. These policies will not necessarily cover the same benefits or extend coverage to the same degree.
All the while, a growing number Republican members of Congress have been publicly pushing back on Trump's comments, defending McCain.
On the fundamental question, poll numbers have almost always been on the young activists' side. Americans generally support tougher gun laws. But those surveys measure sentiment and sentiment, as we've seen over the years, cannot adequately fuel and sustain the kind of disciplined, strategic grassroots work required to alter specific policies and change underlying – and deep-seated – political dynamics.
The expectation is that changes to the House bill will happen in the Senate, but not in a formal committee markup like last week in the House. Instead, the current plan for Democrats is to take their bill -- with some potential changes that have been ironed out privately -- directly to the Senate floor.
The White House claims that Trump's leadership has been all but perfect, despite his downplaying of the virus and failure to order a huge preparation effort when it took hold in China.
Facts First: There were : There were 989 graduates in the class Trump spoke to, not 1,156. And while we don't know what a general may or may not have told Trump, previous presidents have also shaken every hand at service academy graduations; contemporaneous news reports about Barack Obama and George W. Bush, for example, noted that they shook every hand at the graduations they attended.
Each is appointed for life, and with the court deeply divided, the well-being of a single justice matters. Currently, court observers wondering about a retirement have focused on 81-year-old Anthony Kennedy, who has pondered retirement in the past.
Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah appears to have escaped the fate of other GOP lawmakers who faced fierce backlash from their respective state parties for reprimanding former President Donald Trump.
BROWN: So you need a president that's going to do that on opioids, call on a national -- it's -- whether it's called an emergency or not, get people engaged that way, not sign a resolution like this, and then go out and make speeches, like this president is doing, without really dressing real emergencies, because this isn't the emergency that gun violence is and infrastructure is and opioids is.

Facts First: Starting in 2015, about five years ago, Trump was campaigning for the presidency on a controversial promise to build a border wall; there is no evidence the Democrats wanted a wall at that time.

As secretary, Becerra would play a key role in combating the pandemic, which has now claimed more than 500,000 American lives, up from more than 283,000 when he nominated . The Biden administration has been operating without anyone in the post for more than a month.

Su conducta, que puede ser atemorizante, indica que a Trump lo mueve el deseo de dominar a los demás y de mostrar su dominio de la forma más vistosa posible. Piensen en un luchador profesional que tiene sometido a su contrincante y luego se pone de pie, con los brazos en alto, mientras detiene al otro tipo con un pie sobre el pecho. Simplemente tiene que meter el dedo en la llaga.
Trump did make a joke at a 2018 campaign rally in Arizona about Democrats wanting to give undocumented immigrants a free Rolls-Royce -- but then, at a rally the next day in Nevada, he made a non-joking claim that Democrats want to give them cars. He continued to joke about a Rolls-Royce in particular, but he was challenged on the assertion of fact. He said in Nevada: They want to open your borders, let people in, illegally. And then they want to pay for those people for health care, for education. They want to give them cars, they want to give them driver's licenses. I said last night, we did a great -- we did a great, great rally in Arizona last night, and I said -- I said last night, 'What kind of car will they supply them? Will it be a Rolls-Royce?'
The late senator's widow, Cindy McCain, publicized hateful messages she's been receiving since Trump's tweets, and daughter Meghan McCain has continued to respond to the President online and on ABC's The View, where she's a co-host.
It's difficult to measure the overall economic impact of the North American Free Trade Agreement since trade and investment trends can be affected by a number of factors, including economic growth, inflation and even a weakening dollar, according to the Congressional Research Service.
After three years of unfair and unwarranted investigations, 45 million dollars spent... -- December 17 anti-impeachment letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi
The plan provides some good insight into how banding together could help some employers. The chamber itself -- which has only 25 staffers -- saw its premiums drop 20% when it joined.
Klobuchar's electability in Minnesota, which has largely come by taking more politically moderate positions, has some Democrats questioning whether the senator will be able to capture the imagination of a party that has drifted to the left nationally.
Much will depend on how the new regulations are written, but here are the kind of policies Americans could buy if Trump's plan is realized:
At least two major insurers have indicated they are eager to expand their offerings.
His worst moment came when Warren and Biden challenged him to release women who alleged sexism and misogynistic behavior by Bloomberg and at his company from non-disclosure agreements. Warren said those women were being muzzled and that the drip, drip, drip of stories of women saying they have been harassed and discriminated against would be a massive liability in a general election.
Anybody that wants a test can get a test. That's what the bottom line is. And: Anybody right now and yesterday — anybody that needs a test gets a test. We — they're there. They have the tests. And the tests are beautiful. Anybody that needs a test gets a test. -- March 6 exchange with reporters after tour of the Centers for Disease Control of Prevention
But look, we're at a tipping point. The world is in a mess. This necklace of globalism that we've all talked about has crumbled and shattered into a thousand shards.
Trump's decision not to withdraw from NAFTA came only after Trump consulted with members of his Cabinet as well as business and congressional leaders, a senior White House official said Thursday.
All the while, a growing number Republican members of Congress have been publicly pushing back on Trump's comments, defending McCain.
Additionally, a spate of negative headlines about Klobuchar's demanding management style have trickled out around her 2020 announcement.
RYAN: And given the opportunity, there are no limits to what our workers and our entrepreneurs can do. Yet, while the world has changed, while the world has become more competitive, closer, smaller, our tax code has not. Instead of leading, we have been falling behind to the point where we now are the worst in the industrialized world how we tax our businesses. We tax our businesses a whole lot more than our foreign competitors tax theirs. They win, we lose. That's not fair. It is basically open season for our competitors to come in and take our jobs overseas under the current tax code.
The Senate problem. House and Senate Democrats aren't in complete unity right now.
Cruz can no longer mathematically capture the 1,237 delegates necessary to clinch the Republican nomination ahead of the party's convention in July. But he hopes a strong showing in the Hoosier State on Tuesday could help block Trump's ability to gain the necessary delegates and force the party into a contested convention.
I am running because I see that sense of community is getting fractured, Klobuchar said on Sunday in Iowa. It's getting fractured by someone in the White House who gets up every morning and tweets whatever he wants but doesn't respect the amendment that allows him to do it.
Klobuchar's primary pitch to voters is likely to be electability. The Democrat has been notably successful in Minnesota, winning her three terms in the Senate by an average of 26 percentage points. Klobuchar won re-election in 2018 with 60% of the vote, two years after Trump came within two points of defeating Hillary Clinton in the state.
I have asked congressperson after congressperson, not one can explain to me what's in the bill, even in the House version, certainly not in the other version, Bloomberg said. And so for them to vote on a bill that they don't understand whatsoever, really, you've got to question what kind of government we have.
I think the distinctions are very clear and you guys want to create a narrative that just doesn't exist.
We can't be sure why Republicans are now significantly less willing to get the vaccine, but remember Democrats have pretty much always said they were more concerned about Covid-19 than Republicans. It wasn't until mid-November, just after Trump's defeat in the presidential election, that the partisan gap began to really emerge in the Axios/Ipsos polling on vaccines. The bottom line is that there's still a lot of work to be done on vaccine hesitancy. Lives literally depend on it.
Speaking in China, for instance, Trump said he didn't blame China for taking advantage of the US.
MARQUARDT: Sarah -- switching over to Mulvaney for a second, he has been named acting chief of staff, emphasis on the acting. And somehow he is going to do that incredibly difficult and time-consuming job while also holding on to his job as the head of OMB?
Pelosi also signaled that she was ready to use a procedural device known as reconciliation to swiftly pass a bill to boost vaccine supplies, alleviate the housing crisis and extend unemployment benefits if Republicans didn't sign on.
ROMANS: Republicans in Michigan are also using a lame duck session to rewrite the rules. They could step in to defend a law allowing religious groups to refuse to place children up for adoption with same-sex calms. Incoming Democratic attorney general Dana Nessel has suggested she might not back that law in court.
The Freedom Blue plans are meant to complement the Obamacare policies, not to undermine them, Jeppesen said. They are designed to provide less expensive options for 110,000 uninsured middle class Idaho residents who don't qualify for federal premium subsidies and can't afford the policies on their own. The plans will also serve to stabilize the exchanges since they are expected to attract younger and healthier consumers, which would lower the rates for everyone.
When it comes to the price of his book, at least used, we rate Bush's statement as true.
This is the most controversial element of this bill. Sanders would make it illegal to sell private health insurance that covers the benefits offered by Medicare for All. This provision would certainly be subject to lawsuits. A subsequent section says additional benefits not covered by Medicare for All (cosmetic surgery, for instance) could be covered by a supplemental insurance plan.
Pelosi did acknowledge Sanders' appeal, however.
There are good trade deals and there are bad ones. So for example, here in Florida, we have benefited from the free trade deal with Colombia. It's allowed flower exporters to come into the United States but it's created jobs for hundreds of people who are now delivering those flowers and working in that industry. We have a surplus with Colombia.
I endorsed him at his request, and I gave him the kind of funeral that he wanted, which as President I had to approve. I don't care about this. I didn't get thank you. That's OK. We sent him on the way. But I wasn't a fan of John McCain, Trump said during a speech Wednesday at a tank factory in Lima, Ohio.
Health care is not a ministry, and it's not a golden opportunity for companies to rule their employees' lives. It is simply a precondition of life itself. Doctors and nurses make no attempt to judge the people we serve. But our government, mistaking itself for a higher power, wants that role. In turn, it is our government we must judge.
DINAN: Senator Rubio, your supporter, Republican Senator Jeff Sessions, said in response to Mr. Trump's comment last night, I'm sorry - Senator Jeff Flake, I apologize. Your supporter, Republican Senator Jeff Flake said in response to that comment, Republicans are better than this. Do you agree?

As it turns out, the best data shows that the individual mandate does not work. What does work is giving power to governors.
Loosen the age-band so insurers can charge older folks more. Under Obamacare, insurers could only charge older enrollees three times more than younger policy holders. The GOP bill would widen that band to five-to-one, which would hike premiums for those in their 50s and early 60s, but reduce them for younger folks.
Trump: I never was a fan of McCain, I never will be
Democrat members of Congress say to me that they were over at the White House more times in the first part of the Trump administration than they were in the whole eight years of Obama White House, he said.
They were both Washington fixtures for decades
She said it's going to produce 250,000 jobs and she was right, 250,000. Do you know who it was for? For South Korea, not for us. It was for South Korea. So, we renegotiated the deal. I have your permission. We renegotiated the deal and now we have a good deal with South Korea, OK? 'This deal is going to produce two' -- remember? 'This deal is going to produce 250,000 jobs for South Korea.' She didn't lie, can't say she lied. -- January 30 campaign rally in Des Moines, Iowa
Reality Check: Rubio on Cruz's budget votes
SCARAMUCCI: The president wants to do the right thing, Chris, he's got to operate inside this Byzantine system to do the right thing, and so we're practicing political entrepreneurialism of incrementalism. Let's get this done right now. We'll get it passed through the Senate, and then we'll do what all good entrepreneurs do. We'll make refinements to the process and the policy and make it better for the American people.
But Trump now seems to recognize the House Freedom Caucus's history as a rabble-rousing collection of leadership agitators, and being a part of a group the White House thinks brought down its first major legislative effort could be a politically vulnerable position.
And he joins me now from his home state of Ohio.
Obamacare is a disaster, but we've run it very well, and we've made it barely acceptable, Trump said. It was a disaster under President Obama, and it's very bad health care. What we want to do is terminate it and give health care. We'll have great health care, including preexisting conditions.
Trump has used the guaranteed television time afforded by the briefings to sneak in some of his favored campaign messages -- about how he supports strong borders, about how veterans have given high marks to their health care under his leadership, about how Republicans are fully backing pre-existing conditions (even though, in reality, they have repeatedly tried to weaken those protections in Obamacare, and are asking the courts to overturn Obama entirely).
Requires a pay-as-you-go provision, designed to make it harder for legislation to pass if it raises the budget deficit or reduces the surplus (the rule can be waived).
I was a little surprised, actually, because politicians will say anything.
Trump added Wednesday that veterans were on his side during the dispute, because McCain didn't get the job done with the Veterans Administration.
Increase funding for community health centers. The bill would provide an additional $422 million this year for community-based outpatient facilities that provide health services -- such as medical, dental and mental health -- to lower-income populations.
If you're feeling burned out on the job and working fewer hours isn't gonna fly with your boss, it's not the only way to get a better work-life balance. Working from home is really having a moment.

But what Trump's comments about McCain should remind us of is this: Whether there is political gain to be found in dishonoring a lifelong public servant, it is simply wrong. It is not who we are – or who we should be. That everyone – Republicans, Democrats, independents and all the rest – won't come together to say that as one is profoundly depressing and disappointing.
Passing meaningful immigration reform will take bipartisanship since Republican and Democratic votes would be required. Previous efforts to find middle ground have failed, long before Trump.
It really comes down to a binary choice. We now have the ability, through the budget rules that we have in the Senate, with our three- pronged approach, to actually make good on our word.
But weeks later, the North Korean nuclear threat still very much exists, and the problem of children separated from their parents has worsened as the US government clearly does not know exactly how many children it has or how to get them back to their parents.
The cancer death rate declined continuously from 1991 to 2017, the American Cancer Society said in the report. Obviously, Trump could not even possibly have been responsible for the declines from 1991 through 2016.

It wasn't about the policy, the official told CNN. It didn't matter what policy we made because they (the Freedom Caucus) didn't want a deal. We were captives in an internal House caucus fight. The Freedom Caucus had too much interest in killing this to send a message to Speaker Ryan: 'You have too much power.'

Facts First: By several : By several measures , US air was cleaner under Obama than it has been under Trump. Three of the six types of pollutants identified by the Clean Air Act as toxic to human health were more prevalent in the air as of 2018 than they were before Trump took office, according to Environmental Protection Agency data. There were more unhealthy air days for sensitive groups in 2018 than in 2016, and researchers from Carnegie Mellon University who studied Environmental Protection Agency data found that air pollution increased between 2016 and 2018.
It's difficult to say exactly what the coverage losses would be under the Graham-Cassidy bill, experts say. That's largely because it would give a lot of control over health care to the states, while at the same time curtailing federal funding.

The White House defended Trump's actions, saying in a statement: President Trump has repeatedly stated his commitment to protect individuals with pre-existing conditions and his track record shows that he has consistently done what is necessary to improve care for the vulnerable by opening affordable options for those who were priced out of the market by Obamacare, combating the opioid epidemic, protecting and improving Medicare, enacting Right-to-Try, advancing kidney health, approving more generic drugs than ever before, committing to end HIV/AIDs within 10 years, and much more. While the media refuses to cover the ineffective provisions of Obamacare that have made health care too expensive for too many, the radical left is doing Americans with pre-existing conditions a disservice by making them a political pawn in their agenda to expand the scope of government.
I can confirm that he is committed to replacing Obamacare with something that actually is affordable and accessible and allows you to buy health insurance over state lines, she said.
Trump mantuvo ese tono divisorio durante todo su discurso, lo que llevó al antiguo asesor presidencial y analista político de CNN David Gergen a calificar las declaraciones de «profundamente preocupantes» durante una edición especial del programa «CNN Newsroom».
Facts First: Trump's approval rating among Republicans is very high, regularly in the 80s and sometimes creeping into the 90s, but it has not been 95% in any recent major poll we could find.

So, let's start with Mr. Mariotti. You know, you say that federal prosecutors are essentially saying the president committed felonies by directing the payments to Stormy Daniels, Karen McDougal -- and Karen McDougal during the campaign. Does this mean they have the corroborating evidence to back that up?
Trump is now up to 1,990 false claims since July 8, when we started our counting at CNN. He is averaging about 59 false claims per week.
JAMES BRADY, CANCER PATIENT: Well, I have to say this is a scary situation for me. Right now, I feel like ObamaCare was the shining light of my dark situation, but now with the -- while the congressmen shutting down everything I feel like my life is in a coin flip right now, if ObamaCare pass and I get my life, I get my life gets increase, I have a chance of me surviving gets increased or will it turn to tails. It's all a really scary thought.
Last weekend, Trump attacked McCain in several tweets that targeted his ties to the controversial Russia dossier and his vote against repealing Obamacare. He also referred to McCain as being last in his class at the US Naval Academy.
Trump's remark about the funeral came as the President has continued to denigrate the dead senator's legacy.
TRUMP: First of all, talking about the polls, I'm beating him awfully badly in the polls.
Governor Greg Abbott today held a press conference in Houston on the importance of election integrity legislation this session. The Governor named election integrity as an emergency legislative item during his State of the State address in February. Governor Abbott was joined for the press conference by Senator Paul Bettencourt and Representative Briscoe Cain, who have both filed several pieces of legislation to enhance election integrity in Texas

3. It pulls out the stops for Trump's tax cuts
Medicaid recipients commonly work in agriculture, construction, leisure and hospitality and retail -- some 40% of enrollees are in these industries. About one-fifth work in the health services or education fields. Many of these sectors often don't offer employees health insurance. Also, part-time workers usually don't qualify for workplace benefits.
Still, some Democrats are already beginning to urge Biden not to get hung up on hopes of winning a bipartisan, filibuster-proof majority. Their ranks include veterans of the Obama administration's protracted and ultimately fruitless quest to win over Republican support for the Affordable Care Act more than a decade ago.
Grassley said, It is frustrating when the FBI refuses to answer this committee's questions, but leaks relevant information to the media. In other words, they don't talk to us, but somebody talks to the media. Director Comey, have you ever been an anonymous source in news reports about matters relating to the Trump investigation or the Clinton investigation?
COOPER: And I talked to her sisters about that. They actually dispute some of what the boyfriend has reportedly said. You have also been talking to your sources about medications that she might have been on. What have you heard?
Hablando de cuestiones políticas, parece que es tan 'boquisuelto' que desafía toda lógica, pero es coherente con su personalidad. Durante toda su vida, a Trump le ha costado controlar lo que dice. En su vida empresarial, este rasgo le dificultó trabajar bien con los demás, así que se vio privado de la oportunidad de ser mucho más exitoso de lo que fue.
In his speech on the day of DACA's creation, Obama called it a temporary stopgap measure and called again for Congress to pass legislation to protect DREAMers.
Then this happened on Monday night:
This is New Hampshire, anything could happen, she said when asked about the town hall at an event earlier in the day.
Let's be very clear. Obama didn't talk about it in terms of race. This is the point. Policies -- you can't avoid race. Race is the central character in the drama about government and our economy. If you don't acknowledge that and give voters another way of thinking about race, then you're just missing a huge part of the story.
TRUMP: Somebody said four months. Obama gave up Syria when he didn't violate the red line. I did when I shot 59 missiles in but that was a long time later. And when President Obama decided not to violate his statement that never cross the red line and then they did and he didn't do anything about it, you know, make a threat is OK but you always have to follow through with the threat. You can't make a threat and then do nothing. So, Syria was lost long ago. It was lost long ago. And besides that, I don't want -- we're talking about sand and death. That's what we're talking about. We're not talking about vast wealth. We're talking about sand and debt. Now, the Kurds, it's very interesting, Turkey doesn't like them, other people do. I didn't like the fact that there selling the small oil they have to Iran. But Kurds are selling oil to Iran. I'm not happy about it at all. At the same time, they fight better when we fight with them. When we send 30 f-18s in front of them, they fight much better than they do when we don't. And you've we want to protect the Kurds. But I don't want to be in serious forever. It sad and the death. If we fight ISIS-- you know where else they're going? To Iran, who hates ISIS more than we do. They're going to Russia, who hates is more than we do.
You know, health care is complicated. Right? Clinton said in a jab at Trump. That was somewhat gratifying.
Trump is aiming to use his executive powers to give more Americans access to cheaper health insurance plans, a key Republican goal. But association health plan policies would likely provide skimpier coverage since they would not have to adhere to all of Obamacare's protections.
Washington (CNN) Here are the stories our panel of top political reporters have on their radar, in this week's Inside Politics forecast.
The benefits, however, are roughly the same -- that's because consumers want more comprehensive coverage, said Dave Jeppesen, Blue Cross' executive vice president for consumer health care. The main differences are that the plans don't cover pediatric dental or vision, and one doesn't offer maternity benefits.

Back in October, you and the rest of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee invoked a law that requires President Trump to determine whether or not the Saudi crown prince, MBS, was responsible, directly or indirectly for the death of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. That deadline came and went on Friday with no response from the White House. The White House saying that the president -- quote -- maintains his discretion to decline to act on congressional committee's request when appropriate.

Any move to replace Azar would be contingent on President Donald Trump deciding to move forward, and there is currently little appetite inside the White House for a big shake up amid the coronavirus pandemic. The official stressed that nothing is imminent, but there are discussions underway at the White House about replacing Azar.

White House officials' meticulous review of the language of a potential executive order on NAFTA followed the administration's early stumbles as it eagerly sought to implement another one of the Trump's biggest campaign promises: banning travel from Muslim-majority, terrorist-prone countries.

Obama did, in fact, go to Congress in August 2013 to ask for authorization to strike the government of Assad in retaliation for a chemical weapons attack. That resolution was never passed by either chamber but was presented to the Senate after passing through a Senate committee.
Happy endings seem so rare these days. Maybe that's why it feels like the whole world is reveling in the rescue of 12 boys and their soccer coach from that flooded cave in northern Thailand. The 13 are now recovering in the hospital. They're in good condition, doctors say, and each boy lost about 4 pounds during the long ordeal. They didn't eat any food in the nine days before they were found and drank from the cave's murky water. So far, the boys have talked to their relatives through a glass partition because doctors want to reduce the risk of infection. They'll be in the hospital for at least a week.

All this additional growth results in deficit reduction assumptions that analysts say don't square with reality. I love the tax cuts and I think they'll be good for the economy, but they're not going to pay for themselves, Riedl said.
As the youngest president in the history of the NAACP, I understand what it means to be underestimated for a job — and I know there are many who may doubt if Abrams is capable of taking on the vice-presidential task. After all, when there is no precedent for your power, no figure in authority to emulate, it becomes difficult for others to accept the legitimacy of your capability.
GOP voters are also losing interest in repealing the Affordable Care Act. Among those who said health care was important to their vote, only 3% listed jettisoning the landmark health reform law as their top issue. In a 2016 poll, 29% of Republican voters named repealing Obamacare as their main concern, far ahead of health care costs.
The 50 appeals court judges appointed by Trump thus far beats the 48 Carter had appointed, though Carter was operating with a smaller judiciary.
Comedian's surprise reaction to Grammy win while working on set is priceless
There are two points I would make in conclusion.
Facts First: While Trump has made : While Trump has made 10 appointments to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, whose decisions he has previously complained about, it was not true at the time he spoke that the 29-member court was going to be even by next week between judges appointed by Republicans and Democrats (Next week has now passed.) The margin at the time was 16 Democratic appointees to 13 Republican appointees, and there were no additional vacancies for Trump to fill.
Just over half of consumers who looked for coverage during the open enrollment period for 2020 coverage encountered difficulties, and nearly 5 million folks sought in-person help but couldn't get it, according to a Kaiser Family Foundation analysis released Monday.
Another government measure, the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages, shows an increase of 12,074 in the number of manufacturing establishments between the first quarter of 2017 (343,972), when Trump took office, and the second quarter of 2019, the most recent data available (356,046).
We gather here to mourn the passing of American greatness, the real thing, not cheap rhetoric from men who will never come near the sacrifice he gave so willingly, nor the opportunistic appropriation of those who live lives of comfort and privilege while he suffered and served, McCain said at the time.
The messaging focused on affordability, highlighting the availability of subsidies to lower- and moderate-income enrollees, and on deadlines to enroll. Also, it reminded consumers about the penalty for remaining uninsured, which is $695 or 2.5% of income, whichever is higher.
Think about how early that is in the campaign, saying they wanted to help create some political synergy with the Trump campaign and the Russian government, and this person, who is not identified in the filing, even offered to set up a meeting with then-candidate Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin. And it says Cohen didn't follow up on that invitation.

Biden tied the reopening of enrollment to the ongoing pandemic -- and to his $1.9 trillion stimulus plan. That package, the President wrote in a statement Monday, will ramp up testing, tracing, and our national vaccination program, as well as take big steps to lower health costs and expand access to care for all Americans, including those who have lost their jobs.

Throw in the corrosive impact that the thickening cloud of intrigue over Russia's alleged election meddling is exerting on the White House, and add the challenges posed by the President's own habit of detonating political explosions that damage his own standing, and it's tough to predict the administration's first big political win – or how much that victory will cost.
There is no such thing as doing too much. We need to constantly remind people of who stood for them when they needed it most, said Guy Cecil, chair of the super PAC. Anything short of that allows Republicans to rewrite history and distract the country with the same divisive tactics they've deployed for the last decade.
But look, I was there when, and saw it, when the Egyptian ambassador to the United States was in the Rose Garden bringing the Arab Muslim world to work with us to repel Saddam Hussein from Kuwait.

His disappearance, along with Ivanka Trump and the family, at critical (or embarrassing) moments at the outset of Trump's presidency also helped replace the ideal of the couple with a kind of slapstick. As an early Obamacare repeal effort sputtered on Capitol Hill, they turned up in the mountains, quite literally, of Aspen, Colorado, on a ski trip. They were away too, in Vermont, when Trump imploded following the violence in Charlottesville, Virginia. The list goes on.

The GOP effort to gut the Affordable Care Act stalled last year and, despite ongoing and occasionally successful efforts to undermine it, seems stuck in place. At least through the coming midterms. In the budget, though, the White House calls for a two-part approach to repealing and replacing the law that begins with passing legislation modeled closely after the Graham-Cassidy-Heller-Johnson bill – one that, just a few months back, was killed by Republicans before it could hit the Senate floor.

I just spoke to @realDonaldTrump and he fully supports my plan to replace Obamacare the same day we repeal it. The time to act is now. — Senator Rand Paul (@RandPaul) January 7, 2017
And the business of making those promises a reality, coupled with his lack of relevant Washington experience, has left Trump with few choices beyond sticking to his rhetorical guns while scrambling behind the scenes to find ways to convert those bold ideas into sound policy.
But, the talks have dragged on. They've been productive. They are close to an agreement, but they have dragged on among staff. The initial fight over the filibuster delayed important talks over other procedural and weedy negotiations. The hope and expectation was that the agreement would look very similar to the power sharing agreement of 2001, but that 2001 agreement only lasted a few months and there are some operational changes that had to be made. It's taking time, maybe even longer than it should, but aides say they are close. It could be finished as soon as Tuesday.

The administration's second proposed regulation, which was released last week, will make it easier to obtain coverage through short-term health insurance plans by allowing insurers to sell policies that last just under a year. The proposal would reverse an Obama administration decision to limit the duration of short-term health plans to no more than 90 days in order to make them less attractive.

In March, Trump supported a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act. This is the latest in a series of attacks, with the administration having already given states powers to weaken Obamacare last October. About 30 million people covered would lose their health insurance if the Affordable Care Act was repealed without a replacement plan, according to the Economic Policy Institute. The expansion of Medicaid under Obamacare dramatically increased access to care for conditions such as substance addiction in the most-affected states.
I would expect such with a Republican Congress and a Trump administration. Unlike the manner in which congressional Democrats have circled the wagons to defend President Obama's unconstitutional overreach and Clinton's email debacle, Benghazi lies and failed tenure at the State Department, I fully expect to see a Republican Congress hold a President Trump accountable.

This is our time to help our friends and neighbors understand how the American Rescue Plan benefits them, and what Democrats are able to deliver when we have their support, Harrison says. We need to spread this message far and wide. Tell everyone. Scream it from the rooftops.
We don't shop like this for anything else we buy in our life. Why should we shop like this for health care?
What other option to we have? asked Rep. Mo Brooks, a Republican from Alabama, who said he was leaning yes.
Facts First: Trump's story was comprehensively inaccurate. Trump did not make his famous 2016 Russia, if you're listening request -- for help obtaining deleted Hillary Clinton emails -- at an event with 25,000 people, nor did he laugh after he said it; he made the comment at a July 2016 news conference, with a straight face, and there was no audible laughter in the room. News outlets did not deceptively edit the footage.
And we want to remind you of the Jimmy Kimmel test.

LEMON: So, they know it. Obviously, they had talked about it. So I think they made the right decision. But that was -- that was just right.
Coverage doesn't equate to care even for patients with Medi-Cal, as Castaneda can attest. Before the health law, they had trouble finding doctors who would see them because of Medi-Cal's low payment rates. That problem intensified as millions more signed up for Medi-Cal, driving many enrollees to seek services at safety-net care facilities.
Polo Sandoval, thanks so much for that report. All right. Still ahead, a federal judge has struck down the Affordable Care Act, Obamacare marking a win for President Trump but potentially putting the health care of millions of Americans in jeopardy.
MILLER: Thanks. Thanks for having me.
What I can tell you at this hour is that the entire city is without power right now. Also, many of the streets are impassable because of flooding. So a very, very difficult situation, and as you can see by the strength of the winds outside, this is not yet over. It's still going on very much, Alisyn.
Tonight, I urge all of my fellow Americans to stand up and vote for Donald Trump. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you.
If Democrats want to nominate someone who will build on Obamacare, not scrap it; take on the NRA and gun manufacturers, not protect them; stand up and give the poor a fighting chance and the middle class get restored, not raise their taxes and keep the promises we make, then join us, Biden said. And if the Democrats want a nominee who's a Democrat. A lifelong Democrat. A proud Democrat. An Obama-Biden Democrat, then join us.
TRUMP: I wish Mitt could be more of a team player. I'm surprised he did it this quickly. I was expecting something but I'm surprised he did it this weekly. Look, I endorsed him, he thanked me profusely. He said it. I read his op-ed. He agrees and I don't think he would be -- I don't think anybody would have been able to do the tax cuts like I did. Weep go we got the greatest tax cut ever. We got rid of the individual mandate, which is repeal and replace of Obama. It only was kept, Obamacare, it was only kept because of the individual mandate. Now that that's gone, I don't know how you can possibly keep it. So that's repeal and replace. John McCain voted against it, after campaigning for many years, John McCain voted against it. He went thumbs down and that was the end of that. For many years it was repeal and replace and then at 2:00 in the morning he went thumbs down. So, I'm a very flexible guy. We were part of that lawsuit as you know. A great judge, highly respected from Texas said the individual mandate's out. That means we should win at the supreme court where this case will go. Now, when we do, we will sit down with the Democrats and we will come up with great health care, far better, far better. We'll have everything included. We'll have everything included. Far better because Obamacare is too expensive.
The first two novels have sold over five million copies worldwide. The final one, The Mirror and the Light, wrote Kate Maltby, is an accomplishment in multiple forms at once: an expression of Mantel's advanced academic understanding of Tudor history; a poetic homage to the literary culture of the period; a theological meditation on the eschatology of a Christian soul; a Faustian tale of damnation; a feminist cry against the ways in which women have historically been bought and sold. But above all, it is an innovation in the ghost story.
COOPER: And that does it for us. Live from the campus here, at the University of Houston.
Trump said four times that the Democrats support open borders.
We know that there are significant numbers of ISIS fighters still in Syria today. And we don't want to have to go back again. I think that would come at much greater cost of lives and treasure.

On at least four occasions, Sanders said it would be good for Obama to face a primary challenge while running for reelection in 2012. He challenged Obama from the left on discussions of cutting Social Security and Medicare . And he said Obama hadn't done enough on regulating Wall Street or improving healthcare. He also said Obama was wrong on trade policies.

Buttigieg's strategy of largely avoiding Bloomberg, who drew most of the fire on the debate stage, was clear.

[21:30:00] AXELROD: Look, I certainly agree that it is progress and it is heartening to see the response that he got.

Under Obamacare, these companies had to provide affordable insurance to staffers who work more than 30 hours a week. They would face a penalty if they did not meet this criteria and their employee sought subsidies on the exchanges.

Take the individual mandate, which requires most Americans to be insured or pay a penalty unless they can prove a financial hardship. Since Congressional Republicans want to do away with the mandate, Trump could try to loosen the criteria for qualifying for a hardship exemption. That way fewer people would have to pay the penalty, which would be in line with Republicans' charge that Americans need relief from Obamacare's exorbitant costs.

One of Trump's big selling points throughout the campaign, especially at the onset, as he sought to distinguish himself from the career politicians vying for the Republican nomination, was his reputation as a deal-maker. The story always had some holes in it, but enough voters were clearly interested in seeing how his decades in private business would translate into a different kind of executive job.
Lawyers for the Democratic-led House of Representatives, as well as California and other Democratic-led states, seeking to keep the law intact, immediately appealed to the Supreme Court, saying the justices need to step in immediately given potential for the profound destabilization of the health care system, as California's brief put it.
Those expectations carry from 2018 through 2028, in spite of a coming surge in baby boomer retirements, meaning that our current expansion rate will have remained, by the time all is said and done, unchanged over two decades.

Obama said in 2009 that increasing the US share of trade with Asia from 9% to 10% could mean 250,000, 300,000 jobs, but he was not specifically attributing that estimate to the potential effects of a trade deal with South Korea. Republican Rep. Kevin Brady later used an estimate of about 250,000 new jobs from trade agreements with South Korea, Colombia and Panama combined, not just the one with South Korea.
Running against Obama -- Clinton went much farther than Biden when they both ran against Obama in the 2008 Democratic primary. Biden, who was on his second run, dropped out after Iowa and Clinton, who was in her first, stayed in it much longer, until June 3, when the last primaries took place.

During the four years during which Sanders envisions the Medicare for All system being set up, there is a rolling admission to traditional Medicare, with its low premiums, starting with 55-year-olds in the first year after the law is passed, 45-year-olds in the second and 35-year-olds in the third.
Now I can't tell you what's happening tomorrow because, you know, you have some pretty strange election laws here, right? Remember last time -- we won the primary tremendously? We should've won the election, but they had buses being shipped up from Massachusetts, hundreds and hundreds of buses. And it was very, very close, even though they did. But this year, you know we have a great governor, Governor Sununu, great governor, Chris.

A member may pop up and attempt to cite Thomas Jefferson or Richard Nixon in arguing Pence has unilateral authority to make decisions on electors. He does not. Period. And this examples aren't even remotely close to apples-to-apples precedent. (Jefferson's related to a technical glitch, not a change in outcome. Nixon's related to competing slates of electors in which he opened the question to Congress to object but didn't make the decision on his own.)

Again, a person walks in from the CIA and says, 'Sir, we have him.' I said, 'You have who.' 'Al-Baghdadi.' I said, 'You got to be kidding.' -- January 17 fundraiser (audio obtained by CNN's Kevin Liptak)
Republican Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, both of whom support abortion rights, could, in theory, break ranks with their party. But that seems less likely at this point than red state Democrats, especially those facing re-election, peeling off in favor of Trump's nominee.
That is all Pat Smith wants to know. Her son, Sean Smith, was one of the four Americans killed on September 11th in that terror attack on American facilities in Benghazi, Libya. Sean Smith, who is one of the computer specialists at the American consulate there. A month later -- a month after she watched her son's casket come off a cargo plane, a month after she says everyone promised her answers, everyone all the way up to the president of the United States. She says she is still waiting to hear. Still waiting for answers. Waiting for a call.
ROSSELLO: We'll get a better sense today. Today we will fly over Puerto Rico. We will see how the transmission lines handled the storm. If there is severe devastation in those transmission lines, it's going to take weeks and months to repair those.
The Freedom Caucus didn't immediately return a request for comment Sunday.
The bill passed by the Senate last weekend would continue the existing $300 weekly federal boost and two key pandemic unemployment programs through September 6. The Pandemic Unemployment Assistance program provides benefits to freelancers, gig workers, independent contractors and certain people affected by the pandemic, while the Pandemic Emergency Unemployment Compensation program increases the duration of payments for those in the traditional state unemployment system.
The Democrats want to continue to use this as a P.R. stunt, and are doing everything they can to keep this story alive and in the papers every single day. The president, the American people, they voted America first, not Russia first. And that's the focus of our administration.

Trump claimed to have beaten Hillary Clinton in the Electoral College by a margin of 306 to 223.
Sanders defended his sweeping plan to overhaul America's health insurance system, saying Medicare for All will reduce the nation's health care price tag.
These measures run counter to Biden's promise to expand access to Medicaid so his administration will likely seek to limit or undo these waivers during his term, as well as possibly restore the criteria on waivers' impact on increasing coverage.
And, now would also be a good time for current Obamacare enrollees who've lost their jobs or are making less money to return to the exchange and see if they qualify for larger subsidies to lower their monthly premiums.
The gig economy of freelancers and short-term workers comprises a big chunk of America's labor force, but a new report shows that it may not be growing as much as you think. CNN's Lydia DePillis reports on alternative workers and what they mean for the labor market.
The President has said repeatedly that he would roll out a new health care plan that would protect those with pre-existing conditions, but he has yet to do so. Last April, he backed away from pushing for a vote on a replacement plan until after the 2020 election.
SANDERS: I think the whole country is pleased with it.

Brooks-LaSure would be a key player in executing Biden's promises to rebuild the Affordable Care Act and strengthen Medicaid -- as well as institute a government-run public option and lower Medicare's eligibility age to 60, from 65. The $1 trillion agency, the largest within HHS, oversees much of Obamacare and the federal exchange, Healthcare.gov. In total, more than 145 million Americans receive their health coverage through programs the agency administers, including Medicare, Medicaid, the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) and the Affordable Care Act.
I endorsed him at his request, and I gave him the kind of funeral that he wanted, which as President I had to approve. I don't care about this. I didn't get thank you. That's OK. We sent him on the way. But I wasn't a fan of John McCain, Trump said during a speech Wednesday at a tank factory in Lima, Ohio.
'Those at the top are not doing their part:' WH looks to raise taxes on wealthy
CAMEROTA: Chris, fascinating interview there post-debate with Donald Trump. He said things that he didn't even say on the debate stage. Now, the punditry that I'm reading this morning in the papers here, say that they believe that Marco Rubio won and not only was it his strongest. They say that it's, like, the strongest debate of any candidate in any debate thus far.
CUOMO: Senate Republicans are making a last ditch effort to repeal Obamacare with the Graham-Cassidy bill. One of the men behind it is Senator Bill Cassidy of Louisiana. He's previously said he'd only support a bill that passed what he coined the Jimmy Kimmel test. Jimmy Kimmel himself does not think that's the case.
COOPER: So right after he said that, however, his spokeswoman said this to the National Review, quote, Governor Romney would of course support legislation aimed at providing greater protections for life. And then late today in Ohio Mr. Romney said -- gave one specific example of what he would do as president.
Facts First: There is no record of Hillary Clinton projecting an increase of 250,000 jobs because of the United States-Korea Free Trade Agreement (KORUS). Obama said the deal would support at least 70,000 American jobs.

You can get a decent estimate of what sort of savings effort will be required by going to a good retirement income calculator and plugging in the age at which you hope to retire, the amount you already have saved and how income you think you'll need when you retire. By running several scenarios with different savings rates, you should be able to come away with a sense of how much you'll need to ratchet up your savings rate to have a reasonable shot at success.

We know that Obamacare is failing. We know that inaction is simply not OK. We want to continue to make that a priority. We want to work with Congress to do that. We may look for other ways to improve health care in the meantime. We're also continuing to focus on tax reform. We've been doing tax reform listening sessions for the last month. We've been having -- we've had countless meetings with members of Congress, other organizations, talking about tax reform.
Some experts thought it strange that Aetna, which had voiced support and optimism about Obamacare earlier this year, suddenly canceled its plans to expand into more states and review its participation in its current markets.
Buttigieg said, By gutting the Iran nuclear deal, one that, by the way, the Trump administration itself admitted was working, certified that it was preventing progress toward a nuclear Iran, by gutting that, they have made the region more dangerous and set off the chain of events that we are now dealing with as it escalates even closer to the brink of outright war.

The key to reopening enrollment will be publicizing it and providing help for people to sign up, according to a recent Kaiser discussion with navigators who assist those looking for coverage on the exchanges. They also say the period should last more than six weeks.
But this much is certain: The sooner you create a plan and put it into action, the better the chance your early retirement dream will become a reality.
PINSKY: It's clear. I mean, all this focus on the government. It's very common to people to be psychotic symptoms focused on authority figures, people in the media speaking directly to them, controlling their thoughts or beaming thoughts into their head and take action too. And that makes sense to them in the moment.
The proposed regulations could smooth the way for franchise firms like Aloul's to offer coverage to their workers. There are several ways it could work. A franchisor could set up a plan for its franchisees nationwide. Or it's possible the International Franchise Association, which has 743,000 members with several million employees, could create one.

NATO countries other than the US spent a total of $262 billion on defense in 2016, according to official NATO figures (which use 2015 prices and exchange rates). The US spent $651 billion itself that year, more than two-thirds of the total, but it's not true that the US was the only one paying if this is what Trump was referring to.
Facts First: NATO does have an expensive new headquarters building, but Trump was exaggerating its cost. NATO told CNN on Tuesday that the building was constructed for a sum under the approved budget of 1.178 billion euro, or about $1.311 billion at Tuesday exchange rates, less than half the amount Trump claimed.
The typical possession with intent to distribute or drug conspiracy federal drug trial concludes after two to three days tops. Of course there are outliers in a few more complicated cases but the President's comment is nonsensical, he said in an email.
 'The globalists gutted the American working class and created a middle class in Asia. The issue now is about Americans looking to not get f—ed over. If we deliver' — by 'we' he means the Trump White House — 'we'll get 60 percent of the white vote, and 40 percent of the black and Hispanic vote and we'll govern for 50 years. That's what the Democrats missed. They were talking to these people with companies with a $9 billion market cap employing nine people. It's not reality. They lost sight of what the world is about.'

That's a decision that should be made in the whole context. You don't say, well, this congressman says take it down here, this congressman says build it up there. You really want to look more broadly than that.
Coming off their midterm election romp, progressive Democrats feel they have a mandate to push for a universal Medicare-for-all plan. But some of their Democratic peers support less drastic changes to the nation's health care system.
BORGER: But still. But of course they're going to use it. But the time frame is a little bit, is a little bit different.
Democratic voters, she said, are nervous about a narrow vision that just doesn't speak to the Americans who see real problems and want to see real change. But they are also worried about gambling on a revolution that won't bring along a majority of this country. She didn't name Sanders then, but the implication was clear.
Biden repeated his false claim that he opposed the war in Iraq from the moment the war began.
Henri Barkey, adjunct senior fellow for Middle East studies at the Council on Foreign Relations, who studies ISIS, said Trump's claim is a total fabrication.

Donald Trump attempted to move away from the Access Hollywood controversy by returning to the themes that animated his primary campaign. He returned to threats from ISIS, illegal immigration, liberal Supreme Court justices and Hillary Clinton's scandals — from email-gate to paid speeches to her husband's sexual past.
The bad news is trust in vaccines is splitting dangerously along partisan lines. In an average of Axios/Ipsos polls taken in January and February, 74% of Democrats said they'd either been vaccinated or were extremely or very likely to get vaccinated as soon it's available to them. Just 51% of Republicans said the same thing. Independents were in the middle of these two groups, at 61%.

Jill Dougherty, I appreciate your reporting. Fran Townsend, as well.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell this week revealed Senate's long-awaited plan to reshape America's health care system – the fruit of many weeks of work entirely behind closed doors by a group of 13 Republican senators that were selected by the majority leader.
And what's interesting here is that is a majority of them, about 14 of the 15 members of that panel all came to an agreement in the last few days. And all of them believe that perhaps the solution is to allow more teachers to carry weapons in the classroom.
Sanders promises Americans access to the doctors they currently see and more. But his system assumes that doctors will take part. Just as many doctors do not take part in the current Medicare and insurance systems, some would likely sidestep the government program and seek payment on a fee-for-service basis outside Medicare for All.
This prompted a group of Democratic states to step in. California Attorney General Xavier Becerra, who is leading that group, filed to appeal O'Connor's ruling last week.
Janna and I have three kids. They are 33 months apart. We call them Irish triplets. Our three kids had three tonsillectomies over the course of three years in Janesville, Wisconsin, from the same ENT at the same hospital. At each one of these times, I tried to find out, What's this tonsillectomy going to cost? Never could I get that answer to that question.
[11:04:59] That is a major staple of the law which was widely featured in the 2018 midterm campaign on both sides among Democrats and Republicans.
You don't have to take it from Pelosi – the National Review, a conservative magazine and website, called the omnibus spending bill a self-humiliation and Trump, hearing that criticism from across the GOP spectrum, has made noises about trying to cut some of the spending Democrats secured in negotiating the $1.3 billion deal.
The spending also reshaped the race for other candidates who couldn't come close to competing with what the Bloomberg campaign was doing.
Doctors like me have long advocated for giving families what they need to maximize health and well-being. Once signed, this bill will be a chance for President Biden and Congress to do so for many Americans. This economic relief will go to the many people who have been more visibly impacted by the pandemic as well as those affected by the now boiling-over overdose epidemic who might otherwise be overlooked during this global health crisis. For anyone still unsure about the necessity of this bill, consider this: without it, long after we have mass-distributed vaccines and achieved herd immunity for Covid-19, we will still be grappling with unnecessary death and despair wrought by addiction.
SANDERS: I'm sorry. Has he signed it?
Trump's penchant for moving the goalposts – promising insurance for everyone or, as alleged more recently, shifting positions on a DACA deal within a couple of hours – has actually been a hindrance to potential deal-making.

MILLER: I don't see how any iPhone users see this as an invasion of their privacy. The one thing that, you know, Director Comey says better than anybody else is, this isn't going to be solved by the FBI yelling at Apple and Apple yelling back at the FBI. This is a question for the American people that's not really about privacy.
One of many large boxes of returned products that fill the warehouse. The returned products in this box will eventually be sorted and categorized.
There's no way also that the US or any other foreign government can 'singlehandedly' engage in a battle like Marawi because the Philippine Constitution forbids it, Conde told CNN. Foreign troops and foreign military may help by providing intel, logistics, weapons but they can't, technically, actively participate in combat.
The program is not entirely dead, by the way. Whether Trump can just end it like he did is still playing out in the courts even as a bipartisan effort to force a vote in the House on protected status, over the objections of conservatives and Republican leaders, is just a few signatures shy of what it needs.
'Realest thing I've ever seen' on 'Bachelor:' Lemon reacts to finale twist
JULIE PACE, ASSOCIATED PRESS: No introduction needed.
In front of factory workers at the Ohio plant on Wednesday, Trump dedicated a considerable amount of time in his speech to disparaging McCain.
The difference between Hezbollah (which means Party of God) and Kataib Hezbollah (which means Brigades of the Party of God) is not trivial. Though both groups are backed by Iran, and though Kataib Hezbollah is known to have received support from Hezbollah, they are entirely independent entities, said journalist Hala Jaber, author of the 1997 book Hezbollah: Born With a Vengeance. The groups do have shared, common interests and ideologies, no question, and do support each other, but they are distinct organizations with their own country-specific reasons for existing, Jaber said.
CAMEROTA: It seems like Marco Rubio has found his voice and certainly found a phrase that he thinks resonates in con artist. And then, of course, Trump calling Rubio a choke artist. And the names are flying back and forth.

Vermont Democratic Rep. Peter Welch, who hasn't endorsed any candidate, told CNN that Hillary Clinton has deep roots and strong support inside the Democratic caucus and there is a lot of amazement in how well Sanders has done.
The two moderates have repeatedly used the debate stage to air their grievances with each other, with the Minnesota senator targeting the former South Bend, Indiana, mayor for his youth and experience on the local level as a way to blunt his rise.

The former aide also speculated about why only a few Republicans have criticized Trump's comments, saying that it's likely because they don't want to get in the Twitter crosshairs.
Democrats looking for a practical, moderate challenger to President Trump will likely give the Minnesota senator a second look in the final days before the Iowa caucuses. For a candidate trying to break into the top tier, that's a win.
(APPLAUSE) And America needs a president who stands with our friends and allies, as I will do, and who stands up and demonstrates strengths to our enemies. That's why on day one, I will rip to shreds this catastrophic Iranian nuclear deal because the Ayatollah Khamenei must never be allowed to acquire nuclear weapons.

The Senate problem. House and Senate Democrats aren't in complete unity right now.
Biden appears unlikely to enforce a recent move by Trump officials to withhold $200 million in Medicaid funding from California in the first quarter of 2021 due to the state's requirement that state insurance companies provide abortion insurance coverage.
SMITH: I always knew where he was when he told me. For example, this time he was in the Hague and that is where he was stationed. He was supposed to be there for about two years. And then he would transfer some place else. I did not know he was going to be in Libya.
CAMEROTA: And governor, do you have numbers yet on numbers of people who are hurt or any casualties?
The average fine in recent years has been $33,453, but 531 nursing homes amassed combined federal fines above $100,000, records show. In 2016, Congress increased the fines to factor in several years of inflation that had not been accounted for previously.
Reopening enrollment is a much easier lift, though it's unclear how much impact it will have.
Boehner and Cruz clashed over the government shutdown and Obamacare fights from the time Cruz took his Senate seat in 2013 to when Boehner stepped down last fall.
The late senator's widow, Cindy McCain, publicized hateful messages she's been receiving since Trump's tweets, and daughter Meghan McCain has continued to respond to the President online and on ABC's The View, where she's a co-host.
Besides his policy positions, Cruz has also been connected to fringe elements of the conservative world. In Virginia, he picked state Senator Richard Black to co-chair his campaign. Black has called for banning abortion in all cases, outlawing the morning-after-pill, and said that marital rape should not be a crime. He received the endorsement of Mike Bickle, the founder of the International House of Prayer who claimed that homosexuality opens the door to the demonic realm. He was endorsed by and helped raise money for the Gun Owners of America, a radical gun rights organization that thinks the NRA is too moderate.
When he finally had the chance to do it, he voted against repeal and replace, the President said. Remember thumbs down?
Klobuchar has admitted that she can be too tough on her staff in response to the stories.

Trump told a story about CNN host Van Jones urging him to press for a criminal justice reform bill. Trump then said this: So I got it done and about a week later I saw Van Jones making a speech. And he was thanking everybody. I call my wife; I say, 'Darling, come. I'm so proud of this. Come in, I'm sure he's going to say nice things.' He never mentioned my name. 'I want to thank the Reverend Al Sharpton.' Al Sharpton? I didn't even know he was involved. 'I want to thank...' -- people that I never even heard of. He was thanking people -- he never mentioned my name. So I had somebody call him and say, just -- 'You don't have to do that, but -- if it's so tough. Not fair. But, you know, you should do it.' He apologized. He said he made a mistake. -- February 7 speech at North Carolina Opportunity Now Summit
BASH: It's a great question. And Olivier Knox, I want to just say, I think one of the most important things that Paul Ryan said was, this is the closest we will ever get to repealing and replacing Obamacare. Like, listen, folks, you're used to being in the opposition. This is called legislating. This is the best we're going to do in the reality that we're in.
I'm going to Ohio in a little while. We have crowds of people that for, two-and-a-half, three days, have been standing out in the cold. I don't know how they do it. They're strong people.

Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a California Democrat, will have to maintain the support of nearly all of her party's members, including some progressive lawmakers who have already said they want to send even more help to Americans in need.
But I want to share with you two little vignettes that really stuck in my mind. And it's not financial, it's not how rich he is or what a great deal guy he is and so, you know, all those things. And I'm telling you after 35 years of being with the man through the valleys and up the mountains, he really is better than the billing that you see.

Despite Wednesday's topsy-turvy trading, the market appears to be back on solid footing after a recent dip following President Trump's failure to push forward on a deal to repeal and replace Obamacare.
Pete Buttigieg's disdain for President Trump's leadership in stepping away from the flawed Iranian nuclear deal naively dismissed that the deal lifted sanctions, enabling the bankrolling of terrorist operations for Iranian-backed proxies in Lebanon, Yemen, Iraq, Syria and throughout the region.
Most of the questions on Monday will come from New Hampshire voters, an electorate which prizes its position as the first-in-the-nation primary and is often known for asking discerning and pointed questions.
Two of you on this stage have parents who were born in Cuba and moved to the United States. Let's go back to my colleague Dana Bash.
But, by the same token, is it just one credible accusation? Is it more than one credible accusation? Where does due process fall into it? I just don't think that there's any one standard.
Facts First: Biden's number is incorrect. When CNN asked about it, his campaign said he misspoke. He's also wrong about when the vote occurred. It was 2005, not 2007. Fewer than half a million people in the US have died by gun violence since 2005 -- but he's correct that it's more than the number of military casualties since the Vietnam conflict.
'Those at the top are not doing their part:' WH looks to raise taxes on wealthy
Trump was vague about what he meant by we had 15,000 people; he might perhaps have been referring to his campaign's claim that 15,000 tickets had been distributed. In the past, though, he has made clear he was talking about the size of the crowd in attendance. (Media reports said that hundreds of Trump supporters were outside the venue , but there is no evidence 11,000 were outside.)
We need a commander in chief that understands our enemies…

ESCOBAR: Right. You know, we've known as a country since 2014, and really some of this blame lies on the shoulders of the prior administration as well, but we've known since 2014 that the new migrant is the Central American families, the mamas with their babies, the fathers who are coming across our ports of entry seeking asylum.
Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming, the No. 3 Republican in the House of Representatives, was censured by the Wyoming Republican Party earlier this month after she voted along with nine other House Republicans to impeach Trump.
Earlier on Tuesday, Whip Rep. Steny Hoyer, a Democrat from Maryland, said a deal on DACA needed to be part of a funding bill in order to get Democratic support.
Revise guidance: The President-elect could direct federal agencies -- such as the Department of Health & Human Services and the Internal Revenue Service -- to revise the guidance they've issued to carry out Affordable Care Act regulations so they are more in line with Republican ideals.
Facts First: The US has not just now become the world's top energy producer: it took the top spot : The US has not just now become the world's top energy producer: it took the top spot in 2012 , according to the US government's Energy Information Administration -- under the very Obama administration Trump is accusing of perpetrating a war on the industry.
She also became a Twitter meme as secretary of state, admired by a younger generation of women.
Trump's remark about the funeral came as the President has continued to denigrate the dead senator's legacy.
So it's absolutely time for him to go and wipe the slate clean. And I appreciate by the way the representative saying that this has nothing to do with what -- you know who is next in line and the risk of Republicans actually taking office. This has to do with right and wrong, and this -- these are clearly the wrong places for these people.
The speaker is making very clear in private and public, he's not going to do anything that is clean on the debt ceiling. He is not going to do a pass, anything that doesn't extract something with regard to the debt from the president and from Democrats.
Reality Check: Cruz on naval power
TRUMP: Could be a long time and it could be quickly. It is too important a subject to walk away from. I was here Christmas evening, I was all about except for all the guys out on the lawn with machine guns. I never saw so many guys with machine guns in my life, secret service and military. These are great people but I was all alone with the machine gunners and I felt very safe they're great people and there but they didn't do that and that's OK. Look, look, this is really something that should be bipartisan. And we'll see if it is. I hope it is. I hope it is, OK?
LEMON: Yeah. That's probably the best way, right? So you can enjoy that in the moment instead of thinking about -- because that adds so much more pressure. Listen, Gilda became famous by making millions of people laugh, but she also fought and ultimately lost a terrible bat with ovarian cancer. How hard was it as her friend and her former colleague to watch her go through all that?
Judging by their compelling critiques of a system rigged in favor of the wealthy and corporate interests and the strength of their respective cases for how to bring transformative change for the better, Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren both won Tuesday's debate.
Among Biden's top priorities will likely be saving the law itself from being declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court. The justices are currently considering a case brought of a coalition of Republican state attorneys general -- and backed by the Trump administration. It revolves around Congress reducing the penalty for not having health insurance to zero several years ago, which the states argue rendered the individual mandate unconstitutional and the entire law invalid.
But I want to make sure, also, in addition to collusion, there's something else I'm always stressing. Why isn't Germany and France and UK and all these other countries in Europe that are much more affected than us -- why aren't they paying something? -- January 22 interview with Fox Business' Maria Bartiromo
Bloomberg's comments critical of Obamacare weren't limited to the months after the bill's passage, though they were certainly his harshest.
I also promised our citizens that I would impose tariffs to confront China's massive theft of American jobs. Our strategy worked. Days ago, we signed the groundbreaking new agreement with China that will defend our workers, protect our intellectual property, bring billions of dollars into our treasury, and open vast new markets for products made and grown right here in the United States of America. For decades, China has taken advantage of the United States, now we have changed that but, at the same time, we have perhaps the best relationship we have ever had with China, including with President Xi. They respect what we have done because, quite frankly, they could never believe what they were able to get away with year after year, decade after decade, without someone in our country stepping up and saying: Enough. Now, we want to rebuild our country, and that is what we are doing.

A second Holocaust survivor who is here tonight, Joshua Kaufman, was a prisoner at Dachau Concentration Camp.

May 16, 2019 - In a letter to Congress, the Government Accountability Office's general counsel says HUD broke the law when it spent about $40,000 in 2017 for a new dining set and dishwasher for Carson's office.
Overall income figures mask a K-shaped recovery leaving affluent professionals unscathed and lower-income service workers badly wounded. Biden's package responds not just to that short-term disparity, but also to decades of divergence between rich and poor that Democrats have aimed to narrow.

Gabriel Sherman, en Vanity Fair, escribió que, según algunos informes, fue Kushner quien le dijo a Trump que «…Estoy haciendo mis propias proyecciones … Nueva York no necesita todos los ventiladores», asegura un participante en una reunión reciente en la Casa Blanca. Andrew Cuomo explicó durante un foro de CNN sobre el coronavirus: «Es muy simple: una persona ingresa a la unidad de la UCI. Necesitan el ventilador o muere». La ayuda puede llegar, pero no sin demora.
A company owned by the brothers is backing Meredith (MDP)'s purchase of Time Inc. (TIME) with a $650 million investment. But that company, Koch Industries, will have no influence on Meredith's editorial or managerial operations, said Meredith spokesman Art Slusark.
Last month, the company told the Department of Justice that it would probably be forced to withdraw from Obamacare altogether if the agency blocks its pending merger with Humana (HUM) over antitrust concerns.
[08:25:00] CUOMO: I think there's correlation and causation to the two, but explain it the way you like.
Pelosi: I'm really good at what I do. I'm a legislative virtuoso. I really love legislating. It takes knowledge, and experience, institutional memory. I was forged in the Intelligence Committee and especially the Appropriations Committee. I know how you can reach agreement.
This time the main sticking point in budget talks is immigration. (You know, that old chestnut that could affect millions of people.) In 2013 the shutdown centered on Obamacare, which should surprise no one looking back.
When he finally had the chance to do it, he voted against repeal and replace, the President said. Remember thumbs down?
TOOBIN: Well, you know, he -- the president wrote a post today for SCOTUS blog which is a website devoted to the Supreme Court. And he talked about, you know, the kind of justice he wants. And it was, it was very clear, I thought, that the president is talking about a sitting judge, someone who is a judge now, who has a record as a judge, who has impeccable qualifications.
So a reinsurance program is to cover more than just the 1 percent, to cover the people who have high health care costs. So by having state innovation funds to go to the states, to set up these reinsurance programs, we would directly subsidize the people who have pre-existing conditions. Direct support for the people with pre- existing conditions, so that everybody else has cheaper health insurance.
Meaningful change on taxes would arguably have a much bigger impact on markets and the economy than replacing Obamacare and paring back the Dodd-Frank financial reform law. Lower taxes could unleash spending by real people and corporations.
There is a vast and diverse set of circumstances, many pre-dating Trump's arrival in Washington, that led Congress to this latest cliff. But the President has only pushed them closer to the precipice. His reported shithole countries comment and subsequent back-and-forth with himself over what precisely he said, was a drain on Republican time and credibility. It also handcuffed Democrats, making it more difficult for them to accept anything other than total victory in their showdown with a White House many of their supporters now openly regard as a racist.
While the immediate concern – as Graham rightly notes – is the 2018 election, the prospect of Moore in the Senate potentially has much longer tentacles. Democrats can – and will – portray Republicans as the party of Trump (more than a dozen women accusing him of sexual misconduct) and Moore (a series of allegations about inappropriate behavior toward teenage girls) at every chance they get.

Among the enormous challenges Congress and the Biden administration face in addition to Covid-19 is the drug addiction crisis, which, before the pandemic, had claimed more than 750,000 lives since 1999 and cost Americans more than $1 trillion in 2017 alone
Speaking at Dartmouth College in July of that year, Bloomberg added that law was just another program that's going to cost a lot more money.

The administration's short-term plan proposal was widely criticized by patient advocacy and hospital industry groups, saying it could leave people without coverage when they get sick. The two major insurance industry associations also expressed concerns about expanding the availability of these plans. In April comments to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, the insurer groups said that doing so could destabilize the individual market and cause premiums to rise for those who want comprehensive coverage.
The narrative that White people should see the well-being of people of color as a threat to their own is one of the most powerful subterranean stories in America, McGhee writes in her book. Until we destroy the idea, opponents of progress can always unearth it, and use it to block any collective action that benefits us all.

Supporting the Affordable Care Act, including its popular provisions that protect those with less-than-perfect health histories, helped Democrats retake the House in the midterm elections in November. Since then, the party's leaders have repeatedly said they will swiftly work to uphold the law.
In a normal Senate where there were a few votes to spare, one member wouldn't have so much power. But, if you have watched closely, you've seen the wave that a single senator's comments can bring when they talk about what they can support in a bill or in a nominee. Democratic Sen. Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona has done this on the minimum wage. Sen. Joe Manchin, a West Virginia Democrat, has almost single handedly sunk a Biden nominee with a statement. That's going to be the emerging story of the next two years.
TRUMP: I would want to somebody with political skill because I think that's where I would really want that. You know, with the dealing with Congress, et cetera, et cetera.
For four years the law remained a consistent target at the center of former President's Donald Trump's political dart board.
It was that concern – and qualms about the legal justification for the move – that drew objections from Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar, Attorney General William Barr and White House counsel Pat Cipollone as the White House debated its position on the Texas lawsuit, which was brought by a coalition of Republican-led states. The Texas ruling is being appealed by a coalition of Democratic-governed states, because the Trump administration declined to defend the law in the first place.
Although the federal government has passed legislation designed to cover costs for coronavirus testing and treatment for the uninsured, there are numerous loopholes that may still result in patients bearing the brunt of medical bills. The fear of financial jeopardy could deter infected people from seeking care, which would make efforts to managing Covid-19 even more challenging.
RUBIO: For over two centuries, America has been an exceptional nation. And now the time has come for this generation to do what it must do to keep it that way. If we make the right choice in this election, our children are going to be the freest and most prosperous Americans that have ever lived. And the 21st century is going to be a new American century.
One specific thing Trump has been clear on, however, is Medicaid. He has been consistent in voicing his opposition to any cuts to the program, which helps to provide coverage to low-income Americans. On the campaign trail, he often touted his promise to not touch Medicaid.
Facts First: China spent $25.9 billion in 2012, according to figures from the Department of Agriculture.
TAPPER: Senator Cruz, are you concerned at all that these kind of scenes potentially hurt the Republican p
A federal judge in Texas last month ruled that the ACA is unconstitutional because Congress eliminated the individual mandate penalty by reducing it to $0, starting this year. This rendered the mandate itself unconstitutional and the rest of the law therefore cannot stand.

El Paso Congressman Beto O'Rourke basically faulted the Department of Homeland Security for not being transparent enough. The leader of the Customs and Border Protection testified before Congress on Tuesday several days after this young girl had passed away and made no mention of this particular case.
We must move to universal health care. And I am so proud of the work we did as a party to protect the Affordable Car Act, Klobuchar said Sunday. We are to the point now where Obamacare is more popular than the President.

After all, Jackson had never run an agency even close to the size of the VA. And, it appeared that Jackson's main appeal to Trump was their personal rapport – as well as the clean bill of health Jackson had given Trump after his annual physical. (Jackson's performance at a news conference announcing the results of that physical didn't hurt either.)
Titled Healthy Adult Opportunity, the guidance permits states to apply for so-called block grants to cover certain low-income adults, particularly those who gained benefits under the Affordable Care Act's Medicaid expansion provision.

After avoiding one, Biden will likely convene his first formal news conference in the coming days to help advance his ideas. He's waited longer than any president in the past 100 years to do so.
Why would the uninsured rate grow?
It's Biden's first move toward delivering on his campaign promise to bolster the landmark health reform law that he championed as vice president. And it comes as more Americans could be facing the loss of coverage because of the pandemic-fueled economic downturn.

KING: Right. This matters, and I should have set up the context, it matters because Senate Republicans are in an internal family feud over what to do about repealing and replacing Obamacare. They wanted to pass a bill last week. Now they're hoping to pass a bill next week. But they're still working on this. Rob Portman one of the more moderate members who doesn't like the Medicaid cuts in the proposal as it now sands, doesn't think there's enough money for drug treatment of the opioid. With him on what we'll call the left of the Republican, the more moderate side of the Republican conference is Susan Collins of Maine, who did march in a parade back home and she says she's glad she marched because she right now is a no vote, and she says as she marched and as she listened to her constituents, she believes most of them are with her.

The Trump administration released a 44-page blueprint of how the President would reduce drug prices in 2018, but few of the measures have taken effect or made a dent in prices.

Still, several Nevada political strategists noted in interviews that Sanders' volunteer footprint in Nevada was unmatched, while Biden's organizing infrastructure has been lighter than expected. Despite Sanders' apparent edge, it remains unclear whether the friction over his health care plan with the Culinary Union will benefit more moderate candidates like Buttigieg, Biden and Klobuchar.

Cuando se paró en el podio de la Casa Blanca el jueves, lo que los estadounidenses escucharon fue la escalofriante actuación del creyente en un pequeño gobierno, hecha en un momento en que solo un gran gobierno puede salvar la situación.
Trump unveiled the executive order in mid-October, shortly after Congress ran out of time to repeal and replace Obamacare. Federal agencies still haven't released proposed regulations, though Trump's directive gave them 60 days to consider doing so.
RAMIRO FUNEZ: Hi, hello. Do you believe that growing frustration with the both of Democratic and Republican Parties will bring more attention to third party candidates in the next Presidential election?
Rep. Jayapal on Sen. Johnson: Stunning that a senator would say these things
As Judge Justin Walker correctly ruled, governments have a lot of latitude to deal with the coronavirus crisis-but they cannot act arbitrarily or single out believers,  he said.
There was supposed to be a second whistleblower. What happened to him?...There was supposed to be an informer. What happened to the informer? All of these people disappeared. And when they saw this transcript, they said, 'We got problems.' But they went ahead because they were already there because they -- they had a phony, concocted story made up. -- January 22 press conference in Davos, Switzerland
In the next few days, the House Budget Committee will finish assembling the final bill based off the sections that committees passed last week. This will ensure Democrats are able to get the caucus on board and pass the bill as soon as next week.
I know I can be too tough sometimes and I can push too hard, she told MSNBC earlier this month. That is obvious. But a lot of it is I have high expectations for myself and I have high expectations for people who work with me.
Speaking at her father's funeral last year, McCain, who didn't mention Trump by name, made several unmistakable and pointed references to him throughout her emotional remarks.
Donald Trump, keen to fill the halls of Congress with his acolytes while defending his record as President, is already fully involved in his administration's political efforts ahead of the 2018 midterms, senior White House officials tell CNN.
Here was Sarah Huckabee Sanders on that. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
Trump said three times that China had never spent more than $16 billion on US agricultural products in a year.
Workers' 401(k) plans can include a mix of stocks and other assets. US stock markets rose significantly under Obama. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, for example, increased 148% from the day after Obama's inauguration in 2009 to his last full day in office in 2016.
Repeal the individual and employer mandates. The GOP's bill would get rid of the Obamacare requirement that people must have health coverage or face a tax penalty. It would also eliminate the requirement that employers with at least 50 employees provide health insurance to their workers. Under Obamacare, these companies were required to provide affordable insurance to staffers who work more than 30 hours a week. They would face a penalty if they did not meet this criteria and their employee sought subsidies on the exchanges. These provisions take effect retroactively to 2016.

Nancy Pelosi just said, 'I don't know if we can be ready this week.' In other words, it's off to vacation for the Do Nothing Democrats. That's been the story with them for 1 1/2 years! -- March 10 tweet
NATO also has its own direct budget to fund its operations. While the US was also the biggest contributor to this budget in 2016, covering about 22%, it was, clearly, not alone ; Germany covered about 15%, France about 11%, the United Kingdom about 10%, and so on. Countries' contributions were set based on their national income.
The single mom with five kids had been struggling to pay the bills. I kept hearing that the rent was a lot cheaper out here, so I moved, she said.

The uncertainty hasn't stopped Trump from tying himself and his party to the issue.
But, look, you can see evidence in plain sight on the issue of collusion, pretty compelling evidence. Now, there's a difference between seeing evidence of collusion and being able to prove a criminal conspiracy beyond a reasonable doubt.
After Trump made a previous version of this accusation on January 15, Schumer responded the same day: I know what's in the deal. I'm not sure the president does. If he knows what's in the deal -- he should throw it away and take China back to the negotiating table. I will cheer him on if he does.
DONALD TRUMP, (R) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Thank you everybody.
The House voted Wednesday on a resolution affirming the chamber's authority to defend the Affordable Care Act in federal court.
The combinations would have the left the industry dominated by three giant insurers, the third company being UnitedHealth (UNH).
The whistleblowers have not vanished, Bradley Moss, a colleague of Mark Zaid, a lawyer for the two whistleblowers, said on Twitter in October, when Trump made another version of this claim.
The Senate problem. House and Senate Democrats aren't in complete unity right now.
House GOP lawmakers are preparing to fulfill their promise to repeal Obamacare ... or major portions of it, anyway.
Lawmakers need to fund the government before midnight Friday to avert a federal government shutdown.
Under Armour (UA) shares were 3.7% higher premarket after the company announced it will release a new partly 3D printed running shoe next week.
If we're going to build a new, positive vision, we need to start with a narrative that is grounded in the realities and desires and goals people have to have a better health care system – and do it in a way that is sustainable, and not worry that it's going to be tipped over every election cycle.
Why are many Republicans vaccine skeptics? Keilar rolls the tape
To your point, how can he go into the new year with a 35 percent approval rating. Pew's rating was 32 percent. He needs to change a little bit. I don't think he is going to do that. He is so combative, and he has a good chance of losing one or both chambers.
We learned on Friday that the special counsel obtained evidence of Roger Stone's direct communication with WikiLeaks, which he had said before didn't exist. And we also know that Stone was coordinating with a senior Trump campaign official, and those e-mails were hacked by the Russians.
… Islamic terrorist. HEWITT: Senator Rubio.
CUOMO: Yes. The special counsel. It's interesting because it showed us that while I've always assumed that the special counsel and the Southern District are going to be on the same page all the way down the line, they're not.
I was terrified that young gay people watching this tonight were going to see a man either booed or met with silence and he was not met with silence. He was met with applause. And we can be proud of that. That's bigger than Donald Trump.
Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley on Thursday told talk show host Hugh Hewitt that he hopes if any justice is close to announcing a retirement, it happens soon. Grassley noted that the Senate, which has the power to confirm or reject a president's nominee, is already looking ahead to the busy midterm elections, where Democrats could win control.
That means giving serious thought how you'll actually live after you do. Will you remain in your current home or downsize to something smaller? Stay in the same neighborhood or relocate to an area with lower living costs? Do you have a circle of friends and family that will keep you socially engaged? Have you lined up activities (part-time work, a workout regimen, a hobby or avocation, charitable work) that can help keep you physically fit and mentally alert?
In March, the justices will take on a bitter dispute about a Louisiana abortion access law and will deal with the President's attempts to shield his financial documents. They are also pondering whether to take up Obamacare. Again.
So I will take advantage of it; they're the laws. But I'm the one that knows how to change it. Nobody else on this dais knows how to change it like I do, believe me.
Trump tried to talk his way out of his most recent offenses toward women, claiming his words were just locker room talk while in the same sentence bizarrely calling in ISIS as an aid and a distraction: those crotch grabs? Not anything important, like ISIS chopping peoples' heads off. Did I mention I will defeat ISIS? If you had trouble following his logic here or at other moments of the evening, you were not alone.
I don't think he's a natural dealmaker, Trump told CNN that October. It's like sports – you have natural hitters in baseball and natural shotmakers in basketball and natural putters in golf. He's not a natural dealmaker, it doesn't come naturally to him.
Without Trump administration approval, federal money for Indiana's expansion will run out Jan. 31, 2018. Indiana officials said the Medicaid expansion would continue even if Washington follows through on a Republican proposal to distribute federal Medicaid funds through a block grant program that would give states more flexibility in setting benefits and eligibility levels.

Biden also criticized Sen. Bernie Sanders, saying the Vermont independent has not lived up to his rhetoric on guns and has not done enough about the issue. He pointed to Sanders' 1990s votes against gun control measures, when Sanders was in the House of Representatives.
Infrastructure. We're going to continue to focus on all of those priorities and move them forward.
And I went over, and I said folks, you got to pay your bills, you're delinquent, you know, you're delinquent. And then, they don't like me. They say, 'We like Obama better.' They should like Obama better. Obama would go in and say, 'Thank you very much for coming. I appreciate it. Bye-bye.' -- January 9 campaign rally in Toledo, Ohio
Trump claimed he has started the process of ending the AIDS epidemic in America, then said the Obama administration didn't start it.
SEN. SUSAN COLLINS (R), MAINE: I'm disappointed.
Pence's comments may have been more political in nature -- serving to put Congress on notice that Trump wants a repeal and replace deal done soon, Miller said. The President-elect may also want to calm fears that he's looking to dismantle Obamacare immediately regardless of whether it leaves millions of enrollees uninsured. Or he may want to let his base know that he's in charge.
But, contrary to what the president says, the law's other two pillars deserve a grade of incomplete. The jury is still out on whether the ACA has delivered on its promises of affordability and quality of care, and surely everyone – whether Republican or Democrat – agrees that it will require dramatic changes to be sustainable in the years to come.
It did not play great at the U.N. As we know, this is unusual, to say the least. But I think that you are dealing with advisers to President Trump who are trying to basically contain his own reactions to a situation at hand, and I think that they have a dual hand to play there.
The fact that it has taken so long to achieve some level of profitability speaks to the challenges that have long existed in the individual market, said Kristine Grow, a spokesperson for America's Health Insurance Plans, an industry trade association.
Carla Sands is the chairman and CEO of Vintage Capital Group, which her late husband founded. She was appointed by former California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger to serve on the board of the state's culture and history endowment.
For example, the IQVIA Institute for Human Data Science, which studies drug prices, found that net drug prices in the United States increased at an estimated 1.5% in 2018.

Secretary Azar is busy responding to a global, public health crisis and doesn't have time for palace intrigue, HHS spokeswoman Caitlin Oakley said in response to the reports.
Trump's remark about the funeral came as the President has continued to denigrate the dead senator's legacy.
We've lost our jobs. We've lost everything. We're losing everything. Our jobs are gone, our businesses are being taken out of the country. I want to make America great again and I want to leave Social Security as is. We're going to get rid of waste, fraud, abuse and bring back business.
Health care is a complicated business. Everybody knows that. Literally, everybody, he says, mocking Trump's remark last week that nobody knew health care could be so complicated.
Here are the repeat false claims we have previously fact checked in a weekly roundup:
What it doesn't have is any form of the bills Collins wanted to stabilize the Obamacare insurance market. And there's no talk, at the moment, of a new debate on it.
At her event in Goffstown, Klobuchar pitching herself as a candidate who can win independent and lean Republican voters. She pledged to go everywhere, not just where it is comfortable, but where it is uncomfortable and outlined a platform that included overturning Citizens United, reinstating the Voting Rights Act, rejoining the Paris Climate Accord and getting on the path toward a public option for health care.
The move to intervene, however, is largely symbolic. Some Affordable Care Act supporters say that Democratic lawmakers would be better off passing legislation to address the lawsuit.
CAMEROTA: OK, you've given us a lot to gnaw on there. There's some even new phrases, symmetrical loyalists. I look forward to exploring and defining a lot of stuff to talk about. Thank goodness, we have all of our political heavyweights here on our panel are going to weigh in on everything that they've just heard from the White House.
BASH (on camera): Governor, you just sent a tweet that was pretty harsh. You said to Donald Trump, you aren't just a loser, you're a liar and a whiner. John McCain is a hero. Over and out.
Trump said twice that the US military has spent $2.5 trillion during his presidency.
BASH: Thank you, Senator Rubio. Senator Cruz, if you become president, would you reverse course and once again break diplomatic relations with Cuba?
So to safeguard his brand as a relatively independent voice, and to avoid being tarred as a rubber stamp for Biden, Manchin probably needed to make a stand somewhere. He explained that he could not support Tanden because she represented the kind of divisive politics that Biden wants to purge from Washington.
Trump said the administration had already pretty much killed it because we got rid of the individual mandate.
I am running because I see that sense of community is getting fractured, Klobuchar said on Sunday in Iowa. It's getting fractured by someone in the White House who gets up every morning and tweets whatever he wants but doesn't respect the amendment that allows him to do it.
Ian Sams: How Biden won the foreign policy debate
After months of railing against NAFTA, some of Trump's top aides signaled Wednesday he might withdraw from the deal altogether in the coming days.
After years and years of devastating defense cuts, we have fully rebuilt the United States military. Some of it's still coming in. We have everything. We've got new planes, we've got new rockets, missiles, we've got new everything, and it's either here or coming in, $2.5 trillion in new investments. And: What we have now, we've never had anything like it. You know, we were looking at planes that were old and tired, 50-, 60-year old planes. You've heard this story. The grandfather flew them, the son flew them, the current wonderful person flew them, the whole family flew them. Those are all gone now, folks. Those are all gone. -- January 9 campaign rally in Toledo, Ohio
Chief Justice John Roberts asked the administration at one point whether its rule might sweep too broadly. He also seemed unclear on why an accommodation could not be found between those with religious objections and women seeking coverage. Is it really the case, he asked, that there is no way to resolve those differences?
We counted at least 14 false claims in our first dive into the transcript, plus four claims that were lacking some important context.
The Republicans who are willing to throw their support behind the senator as they take principled stands against Trump reveal clearly how far the party has moved to the right in recent years and just how desperate some have become to keep the reality TV star off the ticket

(CNN) — A pesar de que asegura que está por encima de la política, Donald Trump ansía tanto que lo reelijan que creó un comité de campaña para 2020, unas semanas después de haber llegado a la Casa Blanca. Como tiene el poder de ser el presidente en funciones y les lleva ventaja a sus oponentes, Trump tiene todo a favor… excepto su propia 'bocota'.

The most egregious false claim: Saving Social Security
The worst for Bloomberg was when he was asked about settling lawsuits from women. He seemed to spend more time defending the Non-Disclosure-Agreements he has in place than discussing any other single position throughout the entire debate. And his language choices were awful. When asked about the suits, Bloomberg replied, Maybe they didn't like a joke I told. Bloomberg said that the NDAs were entered into consensually. That answer is wrong on so many levels and he was rightfully called out by his opponents for it.
For five of the six candidates onstage, the answer was to roll the dice, perhaps allow superdelegates in on a second ballot and, as a couple put it, let the process play out. Bloomberg, Warren, Biden, Buttigieg and Klobuchar all said that a candidate with a plurality of delegates should not automatically be handed the nomination.
This is New Hampshire, anything could happen, she said when asked about the town hall at an event earlier in the day.
Kelly Ingram Park was the four-acre epicenter of the 1963 protests. It's where black school children were lashed with water hoses. It's now a civil rights monument, ringed with sculptures of King, statues of demonstrators facing off against lunging attack dogs, and benches adorned with photos of civil rights martyrs.

Green Party presidential nominee Jill Stein waits to be introduced prior to a press conference at the National Press Club August 23, 2016 in Washington, DC.
Klobuchar's electability in Minnesota, which has largely come by taking more politically moderate positions, has some Democrats questioning whether the senator will be able to capture the imagination of a party that has drifted to the left nationally.
That's the value of the new round of tariffs on Chinese goods – including fruits and vegetables, handbags, refrigerators, rain jackets and baseball gloves – that the Trump administration is prepping.
We gather here to mourn the passing of American greatness, the real thing, not cheap rhetoric from men who will never come near the sacrifice he gave so willingly, nor the opportunistic appropriation of those who live lives of comfort and privilege while he suffered and served, McCain said at the time.
BUTTIGIEG: Well, you are certainly entitled to due process in a criminal investigation. When it comes to the question of holding political office, I think
Let's turn to another issue of real importance here in Florida. Just over a week from now, President Obama will visit Cuba, the first time in 88 years that a sitting U.S. president will set foot in Cuba.
Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah appears to have escaped the fate of other GOP lawmakers who faced fierce backlash from their respective state parties for reprimanding former President Donald Trump.
That is how the great American free enterprise system works in all other aspects of our lives and our economy. That's what should work in this system as well.
(CNN) President Joe Biden has ringed two days — May 1 and July 4 — on the calendar of every American. By the first deadline, he says he will force states to make every adult eligible for a Covid-19 vaccine. And if all goes well, sufficient citizens will be immunized to attend parties on Independence Day.
Rep. Jayapal on Sen. Johnson: Stunning that a senator would say these things
Even as former Vice President Joe Biden tried to denigrate President Trump's foreign policy, he neglected to mention that President Obama's national security adviser Gen. James Jones said the Trump administration was absolutely correct to kill top Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani, and that history will say that this was the right thing to do.
BASH: And now, we are the day before the New Hampshire primary, and you're calling an opponent a loser, a whiner and a liar.
SCARAMUCCI: No, no, no. That's exactly what you're doing.
He also dug into McCain's now-famous vote against a repeal of the Affordable Care Act.
What's still unknown is whether arguments will be scheduled before Election Day on November 3. Under normal circumstances, a case granted this early for the following term could be a contender for October arguments. But the significance of that would not be lost on justices eager to avoid the political fray.
And for low taxes, I have a tax bill. And according to Larry Kudlow, I have the biggest tax cut of any candidate. I mean, I have a massive tax cut because, right now, we're the highest taxed country in the world. So, Jeb is having some kind of breakdown I think. And, you know, look, he's an embarrassment to his family. He has to bring his mother out and lug his mother around at 90 years old. I think it's a very sad situation that's taking place. But he lies.

BASH: And seizing control of the political conversation.
The Iranians have repeatedly said they won't renegotiate the nuclear deal, which means they could restart their nuclear enrichment program. That, of course, will lead to renewed tensions with the United States, Israel and the Gulf States that the nuclear deal was designed to tamp down. And that path takes us back to the real and renewed possibility of a war in the region.

DeSantis announced during the press conference that a COVID-19 antibodies test will be available. The test can show if a person has had the virus in the past without showing symptoms, and therefore may be immune to it.

In the next few days, the House Budget Committee will finish assembling the final bill based off the sections that committees passed last week. This will ensure Democrats are able to get the caucus on board and pass the bill as soon as next week.
Most notably, the administration is supporting a coalition of Republican-led attorneys general who are seeking to overturn the landmark health reform law. They argue that Congress' reducing the penalty for not having insurance to zero invalidated the individual mandate, and the entire law must fall. The challenge is currently before the Supreme Court
But the reason it's set where it is is, we don't want to have a job penalty. Go back a few years ago and when CBO said Obamacare produces job lock. Obamacare says that the equivalent of 2 million to 3 million people will not go into the workforce, will not take jobs, because of the way the Obamacare subsidies work.
The greatest political sleight of hand in the 2016 campaign has been Sen. Ted Cruz's remaking himself into the reasonable, establishment candidate in the GOP race.
It's got to be an enduring defeat, though. And so, when you have a situation like we have now, where you're -- you have seen the caliphate -- as the president is saying, there will be this announcement that the caliphate has been 100 percent taken back. I hope that's right.
On July 4, nearly 2,000 advocates, toting signs and chanting slogans, rallied outside Congress. Activists said the TEA Party Day -- an acronym for Taxed Enough Already -- was in response to runaway government spending.
On Tuesday, Trump falsely accused McCain of misleading the White House over how he would vote.
I think the president has been clear and the Republicans in the House have certainly been clear that we absolutely have got to secure the border.
TAPPER: … Donald Trump has so far won 35 percent of the vote. Those people are signing up to his vision of the Republican Party. What do you think is wrong with that vision?
Trump was at a press conference at his Doral resort in Florida in 2016 when he made his Russia, if you're listening request for help obtaining Hillary Clinton emails. The journalists in the room were silent as he spoke.
Now, my advice to these people here is give him the air cover, give him the opportunity, and if it you want to blame it on him or blame it on us here at the White House, go ahead, but do the right thing for the American people en masse and the society and the system will get better. If it you stay in the status quo in the lockstep of this establishmentarian, status quo, it will lead to disaster, Chris. You know that and I know that. You don't have to be that good at arithmetic to understand that in 2019, 2020, Obamacare is imploding. You don't have to be a math genius to see that. So why --
Also, if my premiums go up and my subsidies go down, I'm going to end up paying more. That's basic math there, fella, the cowboy continues.
Administration officials said that the plans will contain notices urging consumers to read their policies carefully so they are aware of any exclusions or limitations regarding coverage of pre-existing conditions or health benefits, such as hospitalization, preventative care or prescription drugs. The notices will say that these plans are not required to comply with Affordable Care Act requirements for health insurance and do not meet Obamacare's minimum essential coverage requirements, meaning policyholders may not be able to switch to a plan on the exchange outside of Obamacare's open enrollment period.
BASH: And just to... BROWN: ... and worker against worker.
Allo, who said he was one of the people who nominated Ahmed for the prize, emphasized that even Ahmed did not save any country, though Ahmed did do some really amazing things. Both Eritrea and Ethiopia would have continued to exist with or without the deal, Allo said.
Klobuchar speaks during a Democratic presidential primary debate
Trump did falter badly on Syria. He seemingly sided with Putin over his own running mate, emphatically saying he disagreed with Mike Pence on the policy and hadn't even spoken to him about the crisis in Syria.
'Those at the top are not doing their part:' WH looks to raise taxes on wealthy
And I want to tell you what Lindsey Graham said this morning on the Today Show. He said, If this is true, this Washington Post reporting, it was a bad decision by the president which will make us ask more questions. When you get caught in a lie about one thing, it makes it hard to say, 'We'll just let the other stuff go.'
BASH: I hate to do this. We have to take a break. We've got a lot more to talk about.

And let's back up a second even further. This bill has been worked on for a year. This bill was worked on from January to June last year so that we could offer our constituents and the American people, in our Better Way agenda, what we'd replace Obamacare with. We offered it up in June. We ran on it all through the election. And now we've translated it into legislation.
In the last week, the #metoo movement has come to Capitol Hill – after becoming a driving cultural force in entertainment and media in the months since allegations about Harvey Weinstein's behavior went public.
The ads seek to compare Trump's positions on taxes, Obamacare, firearm bans and North Carolina's law banning transgender people from using bathrooms that differ from their biological sex. The spots are virtually identical, with one referring to gun control and taxes and the other mentioning Planned Parenthood and Obamacare.
Facts First: Trump was exaggerating. The US did have fewer confirmed coronavirus cases than some countries, including China, Italy, Iran, South Korea, France and Germany. But it had more confirmed cases than big-population countries like India, Indonesia, Pakistan, Brazil, Russia and Nigeria, plus neighbors Mexico and Canada, plus many other high-income countries.
Trump failed. He failed to take the opportunity to bury the story and instead doubled-down on the locker room talk explanation. Trump failed to show his understanding of modern social norms, instead sticking to a sensibility stuck in the culture of the '70s Playboy mansion. And he failed to assuage his Republican colleagues, who are abandoning his campaign in droves, that he can speak to women voters.
(CNN) Welcome to CNN's fact check coverage of the Democratic presidential debate hosted by NBC News and MSNBC and held in Las Vegas ahead of Saturday's Nevada caucuses.
CAREY: My sister just totally didn't deserve this, and there are going to be a lot of different stories being told from people who may claim that they know her who don't know her. My sister was a loving mother. She was a law-abiding citizen. She had no political agenda, and she did not deserve to have her life cut down at the age of 34.
Bloomberg's hundreds of millions of dollars in television advertisements have led to this moment: Two-plus hours on stage, unscripted and televised, against opponents who have been rearing to attack him for weeks.
So they should not see any break in benefits.
BOOKER: If you know areas like mine, minimum wage won't help you escape poverty.
QUINN: Do we have to? Yes.
There is no urgency to consider the case, the Justice Department said, since the key issue -- how much of the law should remain in effect -- is still being litigated. The administration is siding with Texas and several GOP-led states in arguing the law should be struck down.
Klobuchar, who announced her presidential campaign during a snowy outdoor event in Minneapolis earlier this month, is the third potential presidential hopeful to appear at a CNN town hall. Sen. Kamala Harris appeared at an event hosted by Jake Tapper and former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz, who is considering an independent bid for the presidency, headlined a town hall hosted by Poppy Harlow.
The Democrats and the Fake News are trying to make terrorist Soleimani into a wonderful guy, only because I did what should have been done for 20 years. -- January 13 tweet
In addition, major store chains, such as Home Depot and Lowe's, allow people to drop off fluorescent bulbs there for free recycling. (We confirmed with the Home Depot and Lowe's stores in the Battle Creek area that people can do so at those locations.)
The ad features remarks from Biden after the Senate passed the American Rescue Plan, intermixed with images of businesses reopening, American families together and vaccines speeding through factory lines.
The expectation is that changes to the House bill will happen in the Senate, but not in a formal committee markup like last week in the House. Instead, the current plan for Democrats is to take their bill -- with some potential changes that have been ironed out privately -- directly to the Senate floor.
And the only way to make that argument is to have somebody like Ted Cruz get upset in his own home state and then leave the rest of the calendar for Marco Rubio to go with Donald Trump. But ...
TRUMP: Well, I don't know if he's saying that. Look, I'm just saying very simply we have a country that I've never seen anything like it. I've been going over budgets and looking at budgets. We don't bid things out. We don't bid out, as an example, the drug industry, pharmaceutical industry. They don't go out to bid. They just pay almost as if you walk into a drug store. That's what they're paying.
This one is pretty simple: the members of the 117th Congress. Part of the day they'll be together in joint session. Part of the day they'll separate to their own chambers to handle expected objections. There will be debate and there will be votes. But this is mostly a day of watching the respective floors.
The primary Senate and House Republican campaign committees have so far cautiously approached Trump's 2018 involvement.
Trump's age in 2054. You are 37 years old. You're the youngest candidate in the Democratic field. If elected, you would be the youngest president ever. President Trump is the oldest president ever elected president.
Breyer, who will be 80 in August, endured several spring bicycle accidents. The first to make headlines came in 1993 when President Bill Clinton was considering Breyer, along with other US appeals court judges, for a high court vacancy. Breyer had been hit by a car, punctured a lung and broke ribs, and was in the hospital when Clinton aides interviewed him. Breyer was still in a painful recovery when he met the president, who in the end opted for Ginsburg in 1993. Breyer became his nominee for a 1994 vacancy.
The two major industry lobbying groups either declined to comment or did not return an email requesting a response to the new deadline.
CAMEROTA: Governor, when you say this is the worst that we have seen in anybody's memory, just two weeks ago you were hit by Irma and obviously we've heard that there are still scores of people who were without power as a result of Irma. So how does this compare to other hurricanes you have seen and Irma?
But when nominations depend on a party-line vote and a tiebreaker cast by Vice President Kamala Harris, Democratic leaders can't offer any political cover -- at least without some defections from GOP ranks.
She cited the CDC's latest Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report -- which showed that around 60% of high school and middle school students are reliably masked. This has to be universal, Walensky said, in addition to practicing 6 feet of distancing and other mitigation measures.
KUCINICH: Particularly these moderates. Particular Dean Heller in Nevada. And you mentioned Susan Collins, Rob Portman. They're hearing from people, not necessarily protesters, but people who are affected by this bill. Susan Collins had another line in I think that same Washington Post story that said -- oh, no, I'm sorry, it was Angus King, who is an independent. But if you look at this bill, it's the worst bill you could possibly have for Maine. So they are getting -- they're hearing from people and, yes, Mitch McConnell has to be frustrated by this because he is someone that's known as a deal maker, as someone who can get things done. But right now the numbers are just not there for them.
Also tonight, the shutdown acquisitions of game playing and possibly hints of the end game. We'll be right back.

I want to build on the momentum that we saw here in 2018, Klobuchar told reporters Saturday in Wisconsin. No one ever thought that the Democrats were going to be able (to defeat) Gov. Walker, but we did it, and we did it in a smart, Wisconsin way with a grassroots campaign with (Democratic Sen.) Tammy Baldwin at the top of the ticket, and we can do it in the presidential, as well.
NEWMAN: Well, there are some people that can see the big picture. I was not one of them. I mean I just knew that I was having a lot of fun.
Sitting beside Iain tonight is his great hero. Charles McGee was born in Cleveland, Ohio, one century ago. Charles is one of the last surviving Tuskegee Airmen – the first black fighter pilots – and he also happens to be Iain's great-grandfather. After more than 130 combat missions in World War II, he came back to a country still struggling for Civil Rights and went on to serve America in Korea and Vietnam. On December 7th, Charles celebrated his 100th birthday. A few weeks ago, I signed a bill promoting Charles McGee to Brigadier General. And earlier today, I pinned the stars on his shoulders in the Oval Office. General McGee: Our Nation salutes you.
Given the current fiscal situation, the administration is not proposing a budget at the new non-defense caps, reads an addendum letter to the budget, written by Mulvaney. Instead, the budget creates a new non-defense spending baseline, slightly lower than the amount Congress authorized Friday.
[14:05:00] I don't know how people allowed that in my position, allowed these things to happen. And we're not allowing it to happen anymore. I could be the most popular person in Europe. I could run for any office if I wanted to but I don't want to. I want people to treat us fairly and they're not. And it's not -- there's no angles. There's no angles. There's nothing -- you know, when a country sends us 200 soldiers to Iraq or sends us a hundred soldiers from a big country to Syria or to Afghanistan and then they tell me a hundred times, oh, we sent you soldiers, we sent you soldiers. And that's 1/100th of the money they take advantage of, they're just doing it to make me happy. I've heard past Presidents say they've involved in the Afghanistan war because they sent us a hundred soldiers. Yet it's costing us billions of billions of dollars. I get along with India and the prime minister and he's constantly telling me he built a library in Afghanistan. You know what that is? That's like five hours of what we spend. And he tells it is and he's very smart and we're supposed to say oh, thank you for the library. I don't know who's using it in Afghanistan but one of those things. Well, I don't like --
And what health savings accounts does, is it helps hardworking taxpayers get access to affordable solutions to help them pay for their out-of-pocket costs, but it's also their skin in the game, their money.
(INAUDIBLE) the hypocrisy in terms of this governor thinking he even weighed in on whether or not Lieutenant Governor Fairfax should go. All three of them need to go. And it is not a distraction to talk about racism in this country because it is in the DNA of this country.
Facts First: Trump exaggerated. According to Russell Wheeler, a visiting fellow at the Brookings Institution who tracks judicial appointments, there were 103 vacancies on district and appeals courts on Jan. 1, 2017, just before Trump took office, plus a vacancy on the Supreme Court.
Mr. Chairman, the speaker of the House is not out of order.

Speaking to CNN's Manu Raju on Thursday afternoon, a Democrat described the mood among the party's Senate caucus as resolute, determined and united. On the other side, Republicans like Lindsey Graham, Mike Rounds and Rand Paul have indicated they will not support a month-long continuing resolution, potentially lumping them in with those Democrats, all but guaranteeing a shutdown in the absence of a long-term deal.

CNN reviewed more than 800 videos and audio files that the House impeachment managers submitted as evidence for Trump's impeachment trial.
I'm on board by helping people that need help, people that really can't make it, people that don't have a job, Manchin told CNN's Jake Tapper on Sunday. Sending checks to people that basically already have a check and aren't going to be able to spend that or are not going to spend it -- usually are putting it in their savings account right now -- that's not who we are.
Eliminating these two provisions could lower premiums somewhat and give consumers a wider choice of plans. But it would also make it harder for people to buy comprehensive coverage and weaken the protections for those with pre-existing conditions.
House Republicans have so far failed to secure the votes needed to pass a health care bill that would repeal major portions of Obamacare.
The Dow surged nearly 200 points Wednesday after payroll processor ADP issued a strong jobs report about the private sector. That's raising hopes that the official government figures that will come out Friday morning will also show healthy job gains.
But, you know, remarkably enough, when you look back on all the things you ticked off, the year started with Michael Flynn talking to the Russian ambassador. Michael Flynn of course at the end of that year being indicted. The year also ended with Michael Cohen admitting in court that he had perjured himself when he suggested that the Trump tower deal in Moscow had ended much earlier than in fact it did.
The public response to Trump's Ukraine calls
Trump: I never was a fan of McCain, I never will be

Facts First: Hillary Clinton earned 232 votes in the Electoral College, not 223. This was not a one-time slip; Trump has habitually said 223.
Trump has realistic goals and Sanders doesn't, she said, but what (Sanders) wants to do is life-changing for all of the people.
COOPER: Also today the federal government announced a critical part of the Obamacare web portal is going to be taken down for a portion of the weekend to try to fix the glitches that were plaguing it. It is pretty stunning that you know, the signature piece that was on the agenda for the Obama administration has been plagued by so many problems with their web site.
And when it comes to trade, I will tell you this, they can't manipulate their currency. That will not be anything that I would allow them to get away with. And if I saw them doing it, I would take immediate action and make sure that the American worker is protected.
Two-thirds of respondents say they don't support turning Medicaid into a grant program. They prefer the status quo, they said.
Anthony Scaramucci, good luck going forward. You're always welcome on NEW DAY to make the case.
Reopening enrollment is a much easier lift, though it's unclear how much impact it will have.
A spokesperson for the campaign said that Biden meant to say 150,000 -- and was referring to the number of homicides. That number checks out, if you're counting from 2007 . But the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says there were 173,325 homicides committed with firearms between 2005 and 2018.
They ran in very different fields
1) The Iowa caucuses on Monday were an absolute debacle, failing to report ANY results until Tuesday afternoon and not getting to 100% of precincts reporting until late Thursday. And amid that chaos, there was failing to report ANY results until Tuesday afternoon and not getting to 100% of precincts reporting until late Thursday. And amid that chaos, there was no clear winner , with former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders in a virtual tie. The Democrat Caucus is an unmitigated disaster, tweeted Trump on Tuesday. Nothing works, just like they ran the Country. Remember the 5 Billion Dollar Obamacare Website, that should have cost 2% of that. The only person that can claim a very big victory in Iowa last night is 'Trump.'
And so what we have, I think, is we are steadily into worst-case scenario territory where it appears at the very least Russian intelligence was deeply involved and embedded and active on the periphery of the Trump campaign.
And it was disappointing. I sure felt, after having talked to so many Americans, that the direction we were trying to head was exactly right because look what was going on back then. Some of us remember. The insurance companies called all the shots. If you had pre-existing conditions, you were out of luck. If you're a woman, you paid more than a man. If you were a young person, there was no way you could get insurance. And there were lifetime limits that prevented people from getting the health care they need.
Special counsel Robert Mueller recommending no jail time for President Trump's former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, because of, quote, substantial help in the Russia probe. Much of what Flynn told the special counsel remains shrouded in secrecy. You can see the report there heavily redacted, but Mueller does say, Flynn's early cooperation convinced others to be forthcoming, the key line in those documents, and that Flynn's lies about his contacts with the Russian ambassador in late 2016 were repeated by senior Trump transition team members.

Instead of going to Mars, we have invaded the Middle East. We don't need to see Hillary Clinton's deleted e-mails. Her incompetence is in plain sight. She pushed for a war in Libya and today it's a training ground for ISIS. On this most important issue, Donald Trump is right. It's time, it's time to end the eras of stupid wars and rebuild our country.
Right now, we have a love affair with Mexico because the Democrats, the Democrats, wouldn't give us what we needed and I got Mexico. They're great. They put up 27,000 soldiers on our southern border.-- January 30 campaign rally in Des Moines, Iowa
From the latest movements of tax reform on Capitol Hill or what's going on in the retail world, here's a look at the news you need to know:
But you don't need them in hand to complete your taxes, which are due on April 17 this year. You should have other substantiation that you had health insurance, such as W-2 forms, Medicare cards or explanations of benefits from your insurance company, Flores says.
Realistically, there are only perhaps four who would vote in favor of calling witnesses who could testify against the President. That short list includes relative moderates Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Trump-frustrated conservatives like Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah and endangered senators up for reelection like Sen. Cory Gardner of Colorado.

This is New Hampshire, anything could happen, she said when asked about the town hall at an event earlier in the day.
Together, the proposed regulations would have decreased the number of people on food stamps by 3.7 million had they been implemented last year, according to a November report from the Urban Institute.
The town hall format is familiar for Klobuchar, who has found success in her home state – which almost went for President Donald Trump in 2016 – by consciously visiting each of Minnesota's 87 counties, often to hold town-hall style events.

Bannon, a self-fashioned kingmaker in conservative politics, has made it clear that he intends to be active during the midterms. While he has kept most of his focus on the Senate – he campaigned twice for Moore in Alabama - a source close to Bannon says he intends to be active in House races next year.
LEMON: Well, and we should know that the Southern District is not playing, and that's where -- you know, we may think that Mueller holds the cards. Maybe it's the Southern District. Maybe there was a strategy in handing the Cohen thing off because then there are no pardons. People can be prosecuted in ways that they can't be federally. So, I would pay close attention to what happens in the Southern District.

The for colored only signs may be gone, but the Jim Crow economy remains.
The root of this point, one intended more as an inverse analysis of Trump's supporters than the man himself, spread over time and began to color views of what his presidency might be like. But it was, at least for those on the left, mostly wishful thinking.
[14:55:35] BALDWIN: Ken Cuccinelli, let me hear from you, CNN legal commentator, former Virginia attorney general. Would you agree, Ken, that the White House has not been telling the truth here.
But U.S. attorney's offices are pretty independent. And here you have the Southern District of New York, a very distinguished office that is doing its job and prosecuting this without interference. Frankly, that's a good thing for the rule of law, but there have been a lot of pretty unprecedented efforts by the president and his allies to obstruct and to undermine this investigation.
Which brings me to Tuesday and Trump's comments about McCain, who died in August 2018 after a battle with brain cancer. Here's all of what Trump said:
In the past two years, since the retirement of centrist conservative Justice Anthony Kennedy, Roberts has crept ever so slightly to the center on the sharply divided bench, perhaps to prevent more 5-4 ideological outcomes.
Pelosi: It's about who has the leverage. Like, we killed them on the Omnibus bill. You know why? Because we are united, and they are not. They need our votes; that gives us leverage. … If we have the majority, it's a different negotiation with the president of the United States. He'll know we're in a different place. … The gavel. [Picks up a knife, bangs its base on the table.] The gavel makes all the difference in the world … I didn't mean to pick up the knife. [Laughter.] The awesome power. The speaker has awesome power.
The event's theme is America Uncanceled, a title that underscores another focus: cancel culture, or conservatives' belief -- amplified since Twitter and other social media platforms banned Trump in the wake of the deadly January 6 insurrection -- that expressing their views has placed them at risk of backlash.
Yet the former vice president cannot afford TV advertising to amplify his argument that Bloomberg was hardly always a big Obama admirer.
We are now spending twice as much per person on health care as do the people of any other country. That is insane, Sanders said.
I feel like they've ostracized themselves like they haven't ever done before, the aide told CNN. I think this could be a breaking point for the membership of the Freedom Caucus.
That includes Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar and former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg. Both candidates have failed to capitalize on encouraging performances earlier in the race.
In response to Trump's tweets, Meghan McCain tweeted that No one will ever love you the way they loved my father, adding that the President should be spending time with his own family instead of obsessing over mine.
When it comes time to raise the debt level, he is one of the Republicans willing to send the nation into default to prove a political point. During the confirmation hearings for Chuck Hagel to be secretary of defense in 2013, he engaged in guilt-by-association McCarthyite tactics by suggesting that the senator was too close to Iran and North Korea, a charge that even made some fellow Republicans shake their heads. These were the kinds of actions that led South Carolina Sen. Lindsay Graham to joke, If you killed Ted Cruz on the floor of the Senate, and the trial was in the Senate, nobody would convict you.
We get billions in intelligence resources, billions in military resources. And the Palestinian Authority that Donald, along with Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama say they want to treat neutrally, the same as Israel. The Palestinian Authority is in a unity government with Hamas, a terrorist organization.
Editor's Note: Watch CNN's town hall with Sen. Amy Klobuchar hosted by Don Lemon at St. Anselm College in Manchester, New Hampshire, Monday at 10 p.m. ET on CNN.
NATO countries other than the US spent a total of $262 billion on defense in 2016, according to official NATO figures (which use 2015 prices and exchange rates). The US spent $651 billion itself that year, about 71% of the total. That's a large percentage, but close to 100% is a significant exaggeration.
Justice Samuel Alito appeared to side with the administration. And Justice Clarence Thomas repeatedly questioned whether the lower court was correct to block Trump's rules nationwide. Thomas has often criticized the relatively new phenomenon of lower courts barring a policy from taking effect across the country while appeals play out.

Klobuchar's primary pitch to voters is likely to be electability. The Democrat has been notably successful in Minnesota, winning her three terms in the Senate by an average of 26 percentage points. Klobuchar won re-election in 2018 with 60% of the vote, two years after Trump came within two points of defeating Hillary Clinton in the state.
Even without it, the measure would slash the number of children living in poverty and families without health insurance. It reflects the consequence of last month's Senate runoff victories in Georgia, which unexpectedly gave Democrats narrow control of the Senate as well as the House -- a moment of pent-up demand, party solidarity, and legislative opportunity that former presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama could only envy.
BASH: You're -- you are talking about transparency, but I guess the question is, in terms of what the substance of his -- his findings are, Robert Mueller, will you -- given the fact he has had such an extensive investigation, will you accept the findings, separate from the investigation that you are doing?

Biden also supports allowing consumers to import prescription drugs from other countries.
Further, the adult uninsured rate rose to a four year high in the fourth quarter of 2018. It stood at 13.7% due to a number of factors, one of which is the Trump administration's efforts to undermine Obamacare and the public health safety net.

Increasing the number of insured Americans by strengthening the Affordable Care Act was at the heart of Biden's health care campaign promises. However, his two main measures -- creating a government-run public option and increasing Obamacare's federal premium subsidies -- will require Congress and face plenty of opposition.
The CDC estimates that between 12,000 and 61,000 people have died in the US in each flu season between 2010-2011 and 2018-2019; its preliminary figure for 2018-2019 is 34,157 deaths.

It is possible that Trump was confused. Some conservative and industry groups have made a push to get the government to roll back efficiency standards for dishwashers. They argue that modern dishwashers take too long to finish. Trump might have thought that the longer run times mean more water and electricity use, but that is not true.
TRUMP: Yes. If you look back to Iowa, Ted did change his view and his stance on ethanol quite a bit. He did and - at the end. Not full on, but he did change his view in the hopes of maybe doing well. And you know, I think everybody knows that. It was a front page story all over the place, and he did make a change.
Facts First: Trump exaggerated Starr's comments. While Starr said on Fox News that it is just not the case that the evidence against Trump is overwhelming, Starr did not say it's not even close.

'Nothing deplorable' about defending the Constitution
The nature of 21st century polarization makes culture at least as important as the economy in driving election outcomes. No one doubts Trump could return to truculent populism if he deems it necessary to motivate core supporters, whatever economic advisers say.

This isn't the first presidential budget proposal to crash headlong into unaccommodating political realities.

Bottom line: President Joe Biden has the House. Biden has the Senate. He has a procedural process that gives him the chance to pass a $1.9 trillion relief package with just Democratic votes and conveniently, it's a process that Republicans used just four years ago to jam through a tax plan and try to repeal Obamacare.
And with more than 432,000 Americans dead from Covid-19 and the economy in ruins, hopes are fading -- amid the acrimony -- of a bipartisan effort to beef up the crucial vaccine drive.

But he had to cancel an event at Morehouse College after just two people showed up. A CNN reporter's photo of the room filled with empty chairs went viral.
The individual mandate, one of Obamacare's least popular provisions, requires nearly all Americans to get coverage or pay a penalty. The CBO estimated in November that 4 million fewer people would be insured in 2019 because healthier people would be less likely to buy policies without the mandate in place.

To Debra, Heather, Madison, please stand: few can understand your pain. But I will never forget, and I will fight for the memory of Gerald and Sharon, that it should never happen again.
Removing air traffic control from government control
After the administration kicked off the week with its surprise shift to supporting the invalidation of the Affordable Care Act in the Texas case, Trump has been beating the drum constantly, thrusting the thorny issue into the center of the political arena even as federal judges in other cases ruled against him. On Wednesday, one jettisoned the administration's approval of Medicaid work requirements in two states and another on Thursday blocked a rule that would make it easier for small businesses to band together to buy health insurance, which could undermine Obamacare.
Who are the four prosecutors (Mueller people?) who cut and ran after being exposed for recommending a ridiculous 9 year prison sentence to a man that got caught up in an investigation that was illegal, the Mueller Scam, and shouldn't ever even have started? -- February 11 tweet
Rubio's claim that Cruz supported Paul's budget – which was advertised as reducing the size of the military, but which actually increased defense spending – is true. But his assertion that Cruz hasn't supported other measures is false, since he supported Rubio's own bill that increased spending.
TRUMP: First of all, there's nobody on this stage that's more pro Israel than I am. OK. There's nobody.
DAVID GREGORY, FORMER MODERATOR, NBC'S MEET THE PRESS: You know, we can talk about the kinetics. We can talk about how robust it was. I agree with you. And from a debate performance point of view, you say, Yes, Rubio finally discovered Google and finally discovered a way to attack Donald Trump, and so did Ted Cruz, and they got into it a little bit more.
CUCCINELLI: Until -- until the second sexual assault allegation. Then it broke it loose again. But if you look at that timeline it got very quiet, and it was, we might be more accepting of racism or rape than we are of Republicans. It started to look like that.
And the litmus test for any parent as we all know is in the children, and my mother used to say you learn what a man is by listening to your mother but you learn how to be a man by watching your father. You watch this man, you get it.
MORGAN: Deborah, it's a fascinating story and the motivation for what her do that obviously led to her tragic death and we'll have to just wait and see how that plays out. But for now, Deborah, thank you very much indeed. The Capitol Hill is at lockdown because of the chase (inaudible) lifted on. Dana Bash got a hold on Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid to talk about the shutdown showdown.
Over the weekend, Trump revived his long-running feud against McCain – who died in August after a long battle with brain cancer – citing his ties to the controversial Russia dossier and his vote against repealing Obamacare. He said in the Oval Office on Tuesday that he was never a fan of John McCain and I never will be and complained on Wednesday that he wasn't thanked for giving McCain the kind of funeral that he wanted.
CNN's Greg Krieg looked at a long list of things Trump has tried to take credit for earlier this year.
Roberts is also keenly aware that his bench -- five Republican-nominated conservatives and four Democratic-nominated liberals -- faces criticism for deciding cases in favor of political conservatives. As he undertakes a role that is distinctly separate from his leadership at the high court, he will try to preserve the integrity of the court and his own reputation.
But Trump's budget makes assumptions about growth and the effect on the deficit from tax cuts that are at odds with what most economists expect.
Los índices de aprobación del presidente en muchos distritos cambiantes clave en todo el país son bajos. La última serie de controversias que rodean al presidente y su gobierno con las múltiples investigaciones sobre Rusia puede hacer que algunos en el Partido Republicano opten por alejarse de las propuestas impulsadas personalmente por Trump. En lugar de eso, enfatizarán en áreas donde difieren del Presidente, como la protección de programas que impulsan la investigación sobre el cáncer.
There is still sufficient time and a viable path forward potentially to complete the transaction, it said in a statement early Wednesday, announcing that it was suing to stop Cigna pulling out.
And his Justice Department is siding with a coalition of Republican states that are fighting in federal court to invalidate the Affordable Care Act. An appellate panel last month upheld a lower court ruling that found Obamacare's individual mandate unconstitutional but sent the case back to the lower court to decide whether the entire law must fall.
Feeling overworked? You're not the only one. But along with all the other things you'd rather be doing during the workday, here's a new reason to work fewer hours, as if you needed another one.
But with Biden declaring there will be enough vaccines for 300 million Americans by the end of July, vaccine hesitancy -- not supply -- could soon become the defining pandemic hurdle.
[12:20:05] COLVIN: We've seen what's happened at these town halls where, you know, Republicans show up and they're just -- there's a deluge of hundreds or thousands of people who are there booing and screaming at them. You understand why they don't want to face that. There's no obligation for them to have to stand up and take that kind of thing. But, you know what, I think there's an interesting thing with the timing here. With the vote delayed, you know, you now have members having to go back home now, having to face the people who are actually going to be effected by these policies and hearing from them. And I actually do wonder whether the folks who did show up, who did schedule events, maybe are thinking about it maybe a tad bit differently now.
He also dug into McCain's now-famous vote against a repeal of the Affordable Care Act.
Since 1974, CPAC has grown from a small gathering of a few hundred conservative activists to one of the largest annual political events in the country, regularly drawing thousands of attendees and speeches from top Republican politicians.

Klobuchar has admitted that she can be too tough on her staff in response to the stories.
Rubio, for his part, has been less aggressive going after Cruz on the airwaves in Iowa, instead devoting his focus to New Hampshire. But in stump speeches and interviews, Rubio frequently criticizes Cruz for his vote to reform the NSA surveillance program, which Rubio argues removed a valuable tool from counterterrorism efforts, and has used the vote to characterize Cruz as soft on security.
And then, I hear him -- Wolf, I hear him saying that Marco Rubio, he's my friend. He's my friend. Why does he say he's a friend? They're not friends. He hates Marco Rubio so much, he can't even stand the sight of him because, frankly, Marco Rubio did something where he said he's better than Jeb. He probably is, by the way. But he's better than Jeb and he violated the relationship.

MIAMI GARDENS, FLORIDA - MAY 06: Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis speaks during a press conference at the Hard Rock Stadium testing site on May 06, 2020 in Miami Gardens, Florida. Gov. DeSantis announced during the press conference that a COVID-19 antibodies test will be available. The test can show if a person has had the virus in the past without showing symptoms, and therefore may be immune to it. The test will be available to first responders and health care workers first, with the goal of being able to expand testing to the general public. (Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)
It's harder to qualify in states that didn't expand, particularly for those without dependent children. But kids could still be eligible for the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP), depending on the state and their family income.

CNN's Jim Acosta and Jeff Zeleny contributed to this report.
The President has the support of millions of veterans in the United States. I don't think those veterans are in love with the fact that he's attacking John McCain, he said.
We will destroy ISIS and Mr. Putin, you better understand, you're either with us or you're against us. We're not rattling a sword. You're not our enemy but we're not going to put up with this nonsense any longer.
SWERDLICK: Yes. No -- I think we're going to -- it's a little bit of a wait and see. I mean this Texas federal judge has a reasonable if not ultimately winning point that if the Supreme Court in 2012, you know, premised its upholding of the Affordable Care Act on the idea that this was part of Congress's taxing power but now the law does not include the penalty or the tax then that premise is gone.
Another 3.1 million selected plans through the exchanges in states that run their own programs.
But the figures he threw out, as recently as in his recorded farewell video, were misleading and didn't live up to what he initially promised. As of January 8, 2021, 453 miles of border barriers were built under the Trump administration, just 47 of which were erected where no barriers had existed before.
Stabenow, who serves in the Senate Democratic leadership team, said she has some ideas on how to tackle problems with Obamacare, including the rising costs of insurance.
Newman won earlier support from major reproductive rights groups, some of which had been slow to coalesce around her in 2018. A coalition of groups including EMILY's List, NARAL and Planned Parenthood has spent $1.4 million backing her.
He also blamed McCain for wars in the Middle East.
The White House made a fair argument about House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's decision to publicly rip up her copy of Trump's State of the Union address, saying she was disrespecting the heroes, victims and other citizens Trump had mentioned in the speech. But Trump allies like Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz and Charlie Kirk, the executive director of conservative group Turning Point USA, went further -- suggesting Pelosi may have broken a federal law prohibiting the destruction of government records.
But even though the Trump administration put Iran on notice in the first weeks of Trump's presidency, there's been little follow-through.
Health officials in states around the country continued to report a shortage of tests and other problems. Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told Congress the same day: The system does not -- is not really geared to what we need right now ... that is a failing. It is a failing, let's admit it.
SCARAMUCCI: Well, I wouldn't say just the White House. He's putting a plan together for the inter-agencies and I want to work very closely with him as the director of communications and I want to work with the other agencies and departments to get our message coordinated amongst ourselves and we want to uproot some of these leakers, because yes, I'm not naive, I know that we're never going to end all the leaking. I didn't suggest that, but I want to put a culture in place where people trust each other.
I feel like they've ostracized themselves like they haven't ever done before, the aide told CNN. I think this could be a breaking point for the membership of the Freedom Caucus.

Last year, McCain died of brain cancer, and as part of his services, lay in state in the Capitol building in Washington.
CNN's Kyle Feldscher and Dan Merica contributed to this report.
In A Better Way, we describe how Congress can reclaim its constitutional responsibilities. Those responsibilities go to the heart of the notion of self-rule. Our Founders recognized that in our country, the people are the sovereign. The people exercise that sovereignty through elected representatives, who in turn enact laws to which the people are subject. If the people do not consent to those laws, they can change their representatives.

Sen. Joe Manchin, a moderate Democrat from West Virginia who has expressed concerns about the $1.9 trillion price tag, wouldn't say if he'd back the budget resolution when repeatedly asked, saying, We're gonna try to make Joe Biden successful.
Brad Karkkainen, a University of Minnesota law professor and expert on environmental and land use law, said in an email that he has never heard of a highway project taking 18 or 20 years, though it's certainly possible that when the median time was six or seven years, a few projects took twice as long, perhaps more. He said some projects can sail through much faster than the median time, but to suggest as Trump does that the typical time has gone from 17+ years to two years is just nonsense.

One percent of the people in these markets drive 23 percent of the costs. One percent of people in the individual health insurance market drive 23 percent of the costs.
President Ronald Reagan famously said in 1981: government is not the solution to our problem, government IS the problem.
And the answer to that, I've laid out a very, very detailed immigration plan on my website. We're going to build a wall, triple the border patrol. We're going to end sanctuary cities. And let me tell you how we're going to do that.
The head of the agency all but terminated the entire board of advocates who advise the agency about fair lending and underserved communities. Here's why that matters.
SCARAMUCCI: So my message to you and the American people, be patient, have confidence that you've got people here that really understand what they're doing over time. If you're expecting an instant panacea or an instant cure, it's not going to be provided by anybody here in Washington. But if you listen to the president, who is a great builder and has a great vision, and you have a three, five, and 10 year period of time to look out at, by the end of the decade we can actually make this dramatically better.

Facts First: Trump was significantly understating Chinese agricultural purchases. In 2017, the year before the trade war began, China spent $19.5 billion, according to Department of Agriculture figures. In 2016, it was $21.4 billion. Chinese purchases plummeted to $9.1 billion in 2018.

The Utah Republican Party signaled support in a statement Monday for both Romney, who voted to convict Trump, and Utah's Sen. Mike Lee, who voted to acquit.
Tonight, I stand before you to share the incredible results. Jobs are booming. Incomes are soaring. Poverty is plummeting. Crime is falling. Confidence is surging. And our country is thriving and highly respected again, the President said, in a unifying opening to his speech.
Good afternoon. And welcome to THE LEAD.
But the conservative House Republican Study Committee was not as pleased.
I'm really hopeful that we're going to be able to be a participant in that conversation, he said.
The statement was just one of Trump's handful of tweets on the subject.
Now is the time for bipartisan action. Believe it or not, we have already proven that it is possible.
His first venue will be a primetime address Thursday night, a direct-to-camera reckoning on a year of pandemic that aides say will still lean heavily into positive signs the country is slowly emerging from crisis -- fueled along, he'll say, by the contents of his new law.

I believe that President-elect Biden has a very optimistic view of the Republican Party. He has made past statements (saying) once Trump is gone, they will see the error of their ways, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York told reporters after a virtual town hall last week. I applaud his optimism, but disagree with his assessment.
The first President Bush was so serious about taming the national deficit that he vetoed a spending bill that didn't curb spending and raise revenue. The shutdown began after the House failed to override his veto. The shutdown ended after three days when a short-term spending bill was approved along with a promise by lawmakers to find more areas for deficit reduction.
Speaking of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) initiative created by the Obama administration in 2012 to protect DREAMers, people brought illegally to the US as children, Trump said, You know, President Obama signed that bill.

Otter says that he's using the flexibility provided by the Trump administration to bring down costs. Idaho's Department of Insurance is now allowing insurers who offer policies on the Obamacare exchanges to also sell individual plans that base premiums on a consumer's health background, limit coverage to $1 million a year and cover fewer benefits -- all violations of the health reform law.

And, frankly, John Kasich also has this belief that you can, you know, save money so much that you can't -- you know, that, on a net basis, you don't have to increase defense spending. It's not -- I don't think that's an honest evaluation of the needs of the military right now.
New police radio dispatches and security footage from the January 6 US Capitol riot paint an even sharper picture of how the insurrectionists at times showed little fear of the police as they launched a large and coordinated attack.

Obama scoffed at Trump's promises to bring back what Obama called jobs of the past without providing specifics on how he would do so. Contrary to Trump's claims, though, Obama didn't say manufacturing was dead or that new manufacturing jobs could not be created; Obama boasted of how many manufacturing jobs were being created during his presidency, saying, We actually make more stuff, have a bigger manufacturing base today than we've had in most of our history.
If they're going to impose this on us, we better prepare to protect the state from it, Rubio said, referring to efforts in Florida to create a cap-and-trade program. I have never supported cap-and-trade, and I never thought it was a good idea, and I was clear about that at the time.
Trump claimed twice that real median household income has increased by $10,000 during his presidency. In addition to $5,000 in wage gains, he added $3,100 from regulatory cuts and $2,500 for energy savings.
HECK: But to say I'm suspicious is an understatement. Well, listen, as I have said before with respect to that meeting, it is prima facie collusion. It's hiding in plain sight.

Republican senators profess they are offended over some of her now-deleted tweets that blasted the GOP and individual senators who she now needs to vote for her. Of course, it's a little rich for Republicans to complain about anyone's tweets after spending four years enabling a president whose social media vitriol left Tanden in the dust. And then there is the question of whether Tanden, a prominent female political figure born to Indian immigrant parents, is a victim of prejudicial double standards.

Follow him on Twitter @FordVox. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his. (CNN) — How could a Conscience and Religious Freedom Division in a federal government agency be a bad thing? When it's not your conscience they're talking about. When it's not your religious freedom the division serves to protect. When other people's conscience and religious freedom supersede your constitutional freedoms. And when it's your health care at stake. President Donald Trump may have campaigned on a wall between the United States and Mexico, but his appointees are busily dismantling the wall between our secular government institutions and a particular strain of activist Christian evangelicalism. Ford Vox To bolster its semantic credibility, the new division (its creation was announced last week) is situated within Health and Human Services' Office for Civil Rights. We rely on that office to ensure fair and equal access to the care we need, from making sure that hospitals provide sign-language interpreters for deaf patients to demanding that nursing homes accept patients with HIV. The office is led by Roger Severino, a Trump appointee who once worked for the Heritage Foundation, the conservative think tank, where he wrote a paper excoriating Obamacare for trampling on the freedom of conscience of many in the medical community.
BALDWIN: OK, so, something isn't adding up here.
The bottom line: The divide you are seeing rip through the Republican Party right now isn't between conservatives and moderates. This isn't the Freedom Caucus vs. leadership. It's not even as simple as members who might run for President in 2024 vs. those who will not. What you are seeing right now is a gamble members are taking on whether the GOP can finally shake Trump going forward or whether there is no way to win the White House again without him on their side.

Klobuchar's electability in Minnesota, which has largely come by taking more politically moderate positions, has some Democrats questioning whether the senator will be able to capture the imagination of a party that has drifted to the left nationally.
On Tuesday, he continued his criticism, telling reporters at the White House that I was never a fan of John McCain and I never will be.
And with that, we'll keep it short today, and I'll take your questions now.
Adding to the sense of unchained uproar, the Republican Party is eating its own. Trump protege, Rep.

We meet tonight at a moment of unlimited potential. As we begin a new Congress, I stand here ready to work with you to achieve historic breakthroughs for all Americans.
A Moore loss would suggest that the shift in the culture has come to politics – even in a state as traditionally red as Alabama. A Moore win, on the other hand, might well serve as a sort of silencing mechanism for women in politics who are weighing whether or not to come forward with their own allegations of sexual misconduct. If Moore succeeds in spite of all of the women who have come forward, all telling very similar stories about how he approached them and what he wanted, there could well be a sense among women weighing whether to go public that it's simply not worth it given the potential fallout.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell this week revealed Senate's long-awaited plan to reshape America's health care system – the fruit of many weeks of work entirely behind closed doors by a group of 13 Republican senators that were selected by the majority leader.
Several other states including Kentucky and Ohio are considering adopting features of Indiana's Medicaid plan.
So one could argue there has been too much complacency in the market. Investors now need to be more prudent. And Trump has to actually deliver on his promise to come up with a tax plan that can make it through Congress.
He refused to accept losing the 2020 presidential election for months, directing a storm of Trump campaign lawsuits that largely failed in court and fomenting so much distrust in the democratic process among his supporters that it led to deadly violence at the US Capitol.
Biden's claim that Trump offered Kim Jong Un the legitimacy North Korea has long craved echoes a widespread criticism of the President's approach to dealing with the Hermit Kingdom.

Underscoring the urgency is the reality for Democrats that the economy is still struggling to reboot as Covid continues to ravage the country. Democrats are also cognizant of early mistakes in the Obama administration when Democrats spent months trying to win over Republicans on health care only to ultimately move ahead on their own.
Second, state executives have to debate the larger question of what to do with the entire Medicaid program. Republican lawmakers are itching for the opportunity to completely overhaul it and shift more responsibility, control and risk to the states. While governors would like more power over the program, many aren't as keen to receive only a fixed amount of funding from Washington D.C.
Klobuchar, who announced her presidential campaign during a snowy outdoor event in Minneapolis earlier this month, is the third potential presidential hopeful to appear at a CNN town hall. Sen. Kamala Harris appeared at an event hosted by Jake Tapper and former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz, who is considering an independent bid for the presidency, headlined a town hall hosted by Poppy Harlow.

As the coronavirus spreads across the nation, the Trump administration has been criticized for its handling of the pandemic, namely by governors, on both sides of the aisle, in desperate need of critical supplies for their states as the President has moved forward on indicating that many states can reopen by May 1.

Facts First: Foreign governments don't conduct the Diversity Immigrant Visa Program : Foreign governments don't conduct the Diversity Immigrant Visa Program lottery for US green cards. The US State Department conducts the lottery.
Facts First: Hillary Clinton earned 232 votes in the Electoral College, not 223. This was not a one-time slip; Trump has habitually said 223.
Lower-income enrollees could have their premiums eliminated completely for the same period, and those collecting unemployment benefits could sign up for coverage with no premiums in 2021. The latter provision may take more time to set up since it is new.
Days after the California appearance, Clinton delivered pointed criticism of the Trump administration. In remarks at Georgetown University, she blasted the President's budget blueprint, which proposed deep domestic spending cuts and reductions in foreign aid.
Patrick Foy, a captain in the law enforcement division for the California Department of Fish and Wildlife, sent CNN the relevant section from the state's Fish and Game Code , which sets out the maximum state penalty for killing a bald eagle at a fine of $5,000, imprisonment in a county jail for a year or less, or both.

MARQUARDT: You say you are nervous. At the same time you say that the Supreme Court listens to the will of the American people. But now we have a Supreme Court that has two new conservative justices in Gorsuch and Kavanaugh on it. So if this makes its way to the Supreme Court, do you have any sense of how you think they might rule or how the whole court would rule?
Facts First: Trump was exaggerating how long it had been since there had been a decline in prescription drug prices. The Consumer Price Index for prescription drugs showed a : Trump was exaggerating how long it had been since there had been a decline in prescription drug prices. The Consumer Price Index for prescription drugs showed a 0.6% decline between December 2017 and December 2018, which was the first calendar-year decline since 1972 -- the first decline in 46 years , not the first time in 51 years.
Or it could be something else. Normally, it's the unanimous, low-profile cases that are the first to emerge. This term, there aren't as many of those. Instead, the docket is chock-full of high-profile cases that will touch the nerves of an ideologically divided court.
Governor shares what past year has been like for Asian family members
TRUMP: The United States has great strength and patience. But if it is forced to defend itself or its allies, we will have no choice but to totally destroy North Korea. Rocket Man is on a suicide mission for himself and for his regime.
What is not good is this. We're looking at essentially tax cuts that help more wealthy people than not help the corporations, bigger corporations, than middle-sized corporations. And there's a fear that a lot of people have that corporations, what they'll do if they have more money to spend, they won't necessarily invest it in plant and equipment, in their workers. They'll actually use it for stock buybacks and drive up the stock and the value of the companies and help actually boost compensation for very senior members of the company.

All this additional growth results in deficit reduction assumptions that analysts say don't square with reality. I love the tax cuts and I think they'll be good for the economy, but they're not going to pay for themselves, Riedl said.
But this is Speaker Ryan's baby. This was his drive and he was the driving force behind this. His team was the driving legislative force behind what we're looking at right now, that House bill. And his team has really been working on this, as you've noted, not just for a year or two years, but particularly when it comes to the entitlement sections of this, years on end, PowerPoints on end. One story in particular, the president's top adviser, Reince Priebus, Steve Bannon, Gary Cohn, all of those individuals were treated to a similar PowerPoint behind closed doors a couple months ago as this process all started. When they need an explainer in chief, the speaker's the guy.
There's a hefty amount of media skepticism that he could be a serious candidate.

And looking ahead to the next major election to come – the presidential nominating contests – the Democrats who are among the top contenders for their party's presidential nomination are generally viewed more favorably than unfavorably by their partisans. But outside of the very top tier of candidates, many potential presidential hopefuls are widely unknown.
The unemployment rate for women reached the lowest level in almost 70 years – and last year, women filled 72 percent of all new jobs added.
declaring a national emergency on Friday in order to secure funding for a wall along the southern border. It's intended to bypass Congress and allow the president to redirect billions of federal dollars toward the wall.
He's very committed to repealing and replacing it. Mr. Trump has been very up-front about what some of those particulars are, she said. And we also know that you have popular provisions like coverage for pre-existing conditions. We also know there are Americans relying upon it now.
And in recent years, the parties have battled over a lot of things. This latest one was no. 19 since 1976.
He wrote -- quote -- Today, Elizabeth Warren, sometimes referred to by me as Pocahontas, joined the race for president. Will she run as our first Native American presidential candidate, or has she decided that, after 32 years, this is not playing so well anymore? See you on the campaign TRAIL, Liz.
'Those at the top are not doing their part:' WH looks to raise taxes on wealthy
Washington (CNN) — Los resultados que el exvicepresidente de Estados Unidos Joe Biden obtuvo durante el supermartes plantearon una competencia cara a cara con el senador por Vermont Bernie Sanders sobre el liderazgo en el Partido Demócrata y sobre quién enfrentará al presidente Donald Trump en noviembre.

Wood: In short: they're safe. Utah is solidly Republican and this issue alone won't change that. The blue wave in 2018 may have helped flip a congressional seat, but inside Utah it left the GOP with a slightly smaller supermajority than they had before. Gov. Gary Herbert has stated he won't seek re-election in 2020, but his successor is all but guaranteed to be a Republican, and control of the legislature will remain in Republican hands.
Health care legislation is still a work in progress, while the jury's still out on Trump's job claims. But so far it's not looking good.
Would the cost of premiums rise or fall under the GOP plan?
Klobuchar has admitted that she can be too tough on her staff in response to the stories.
Democratic super PACs are also stepping up in the fight, including Biden's top super PAC during the 2020 campaign, Priorities USA.
The Trump campaign is untraditional in almost every way, but considering the real possibility of a President Trump, the candidate's flagrant indifference to the details of public policy is particularly remarkable. He has said he forms his views through instinct and intuition rather than 'deep analysis.' He has boasted that his main policy adviser is himself and the advisers he does have say he doesn't read briefing papers. He has mocked Hillary Clinton for surrounding herself with 'eggheads' and churning out reams of wonky government reform proposals. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who will be speaking on Trump's behalf at this week's Republican convention in Cleveland, recently said 'it's pretty obvious he doesn't know a lot about the issues.'
CUOMO: Well, look. Of course, you're both making the right point, which is negative is supposed to be partnered with positive and you wind up showing the base that you have certain mettle but that you also have ideas to offer. And the proof is in John Kasich last night, the governor of Ohio, of course.
Views of the President are closely tied to preferences in the House ballot: Among those likely voters who approve of the way the President is handling his job, 89% plan to back the Republican in their district, while 87% of those who disapprove favor the Democrat.

For example, Mary Landrieu, then a Democratic senator for Louisiana, voted for the final bill that included the fencing. But she said during the debate: I'm not going to waste taxpayers' money on a dumb fence...I've been in tunnels under the fence. I've watched people climb over the fence. I'm not going to send taxpayers' money down a rat hole.
The move to replace Azar was first reported by the Wall Street Journal and Politico
US President Donald Trump and former President Barack Obama talk on the East front steps of the US Capitol after inauguration ceremonies on January 20, 2017 in Washington, DC.
ROMANS: Princeton's all-male a cappella group has dropped the classic Little Mermaid song Kiss the Girl from its act over concerns about consent.
The President's comments about the senators amounted to the latest attempt by the White House to reassure the public that it will have a replacement plan ready by the time the courts render a final judgment.
Spokesmen for Sens. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana and Rick Scott of Florida, two of the Republican senators Trump listed as being part of the group, said the senators have continued to have conversations with the President and their colleagues about healthcare issues, but made no mention of a working group.
It's a term for the ages, where the court's newly solidified conservative majority -- serving its first full term together -- may signal how fast and how far the court is going to move on controversial issues such as abortion.
In its usual tantalizing manner, the Supreme Court provided no information as to which justices agreed to hear the case. It would have taken at least four. It could have been the four liberals, dismayed with a district court ruling that invalidated the entire law and a federal appeals court that some think punted on the fate of the entire law to avoid an election year decision. Or was it the same five justices ( the liberals plus conservative Chief Justice John Roberts ) who all voted to uphold the law in 2012. Those five are still on the bench after all.
SANDERS: I was in the air. I was on the plane. But I wasn't part of the conversation. So I can't speak to anything beyond that part.
QUESTION: I wanted to ask about a comment Senator Lindsey Graham made this morning. (inaudible) wrong that there's no good military option regarding North Korea. He said there's a military option to destroy North Korea's program and North Korea itself.
This is anti blackness. So let's make this clear. This is anti blackness. Blackface in the mid to late 19th century, 1800s was about mocking black people, our humanity. Our beauty, our culture, what we mean to this country.
Saturday's result will underscore Biden's resilience after an uninspiring campaign that has included a string of sub-par debate performances, but that has also opened a window into the former vice president's humanity in interactions with voters who, like him, have suffered aching personal bereavements.
One of many large boxes of returned products that fill the warehouse. The returned products in this box will eventually be sorted and categorized.
Lately he's taken to saying that no one knew that coronavirus would be so contagious. Everybody knew except, apparently, the President. But Trump's talking points filtered down through partisan media and became a deadly form of misinformation, leading to a stark partisan gap on how seriously people were taking coronavirus in mid-March.
Facts First: The US was not paying for 100% of NATO before Trump's presidency, though its defense spending did represent the majority of total NATO defense spending.
A Klobuchar aide told CNN on Monday that the senator prepared for the town hall like she would for a major interview.
I think the Pesident's line about this has been basically correct, where he says, I'm happy to negotiate the budget. I want to have a discussion about long-term fiscal reform, but first reopen the government and raise the debt ceilings. So we're not doing this in a hostage situation.
But if it's about a brazen willingness to put on a show, the President's challengers are already in trouble.

Medicare has different ways of applying penalties. It can impose a specific fine for a particular violation. It can assess a fine for each day that a nursing home was in violation. Or it can deny payments for new admissions.
QUESTION: Very quickly on (inaudible). Does the president believe the (inaudible) original Fox News report that Seth Rich was responsible for the release of DNC e-mails to WikiLeaks?
Monday wasn't the first time McCain offered a strong rebuke of the President's character.
Facing an emboldened conservative majority and a docket marked by some of the most consequential cases in recent years, the liberals, led by the ailing 86-year-old Ruth Bader Ginsburg , will work to stall the conservative legal revolution launched with the election of President Donald Trump who is fulfilling his pledge to transform the courts.
There, Biden reminded the crowd, 99% of the Latino vote hasn't spoken yet.
CNN's Tal Kopan reported on Thursday that the current plan, according to multiple lawmakers and aides, is for the House to pass a bill that would fund defense for a year, reauthorize children's health insurance, and punt the rest into January. That bill is dead on arrival in the Senate, where 44 Democrats have gone on record opposing it.
Facts First: Zelensky did say there had been no pressure from Trump and made other statements to that effect, but he has not gone so far as to say Trump did nothing wrong.
The idea is to make it more painful to wage a filibuster against a bill -- to have more events like when Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas talked for hours opposing Obamacare, in part by reading Green Eggs and Ham, or when Sen. Rand Paul, a Kentucky Republican, talked for 13 hours against the use of military drones.
Trump said twice that the unemployment rate for women was the best or lowest in 71 years.
Republicans controlled the Congress. They had a chance to strike down Obamacare. They said no, we are going to leave Obamacare and strike down the tax penalty. So they have literally said it is severable. Republicans have spoken. They said it's severable.
Religious liberty is a fundamental value -- but allowing companies and universities to use religious beliefs to block employees' and students' birth control coverage is discrimination, not religious liberty, said Brigitte Amiri, deputy director of the ACLU Reproductive Freedom Project.
Trump told Republican National Committee members he would campaign for Heller.
It might not excite the left in 2018, but Pelosi in 2010 delivered the votes to seal the passage of Obamacare at a time when its fate was very much in doubt (after the party lost its supermajority in the Senate and House Democrats were essentially forced to either accept a lesser version of the bill they knew would cost them their jobs or walk away with nothing).
4. Market overview: U.S. stock futures were edging higher early on Friday.
All the while, a growing number Republican members of Congress have been publicly pushing back on Trump's comments, defending McCain.
Trump made 11 of last week's 56 false claims in an interview with Geraldo Rivera on Cleveland radio. But Trump isn't only dishonest when speaking to supporters and average citizens: he also made 11 false claims during a White House gathering with state governors.
CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story misstated the proposed changes in Affordable Care Act subsidies.
Venezuela was one of the richest countries in the world 60 years ago. The richest in Latin America 40 years ago. But not 20 years ago, Ricardo Hausmann, a former Venezuelan planning minister and central bank board member, said in response to a previous version of this Trump claim. Hausmann, now a Harvard University professor, was chief economist of the Inter-American Development Bank from 1994 to 2000.
By unveiling his proposal now, Sanders is effectively doubling down on his signature policy idea and betting that his calls to eliminate private medical insurers will be a winning one with Democratic voters, even as the party rallies around Obamacare amid an escalating court battle instigated by Republicans and backed by President Donald Trump.
RUDY GUILIANI, FORMER MAYOR NEW YORK: Donald Trump has a very big heart. When police officers or firefighters or even sanitation workers, correction officers, I can remember a teacher got injured or died, he would step forward and he would make an anonymous contribution. VOIGHT: For Donald it all begins with our young people.
The State Department sent a global warning to all US embassies before the strike occurred, a senior State Department official said and the department spokesperson confirmed, but it was not directed at specific embassies and did not warn of an imminent attack.
Monday wasn't the first time McCain offered a strong rebuke of the President's character.
And instead of parachuting in, my hope is that not only will she talk to federal law enforcement and tour the facilities and kind of see how inadequate they are, but my hope is that she also talks to human rights advocates, to the lawyers who are on the ground, to get a real holistic view of what's happening here in El Paso.
Without Sinema, the Senate cannot pass the relief bill, even using the budget process that allows them to pass it with just 51 votes.
Additionally, a spate of negative headlines about Klobuchar's demanding management style have trickled out around her 2020 announcement.
John McCain was tortured for more than five years in Vietnam and survived for more than a year after being diagnosed with brain cancer in 2017.
TAPPER: You have said that young people don't see as much conflict between the concept of capitalism and the concept of socialism as past generations have seen.
When you base your whole campaign on electability, a Bloomberg aide said on Wednesday, you really only get one shot.
Why are many Republicans vaccine skeptics? Keilar rolls the tape
When a presidency is anchored so fundamentally on an image, as it is with Trump, rather than a long history of political achievement or ideological consistency, any deterioration of that image can be especially perilous. For Trump, who may be more conscious of how he is perceived than any politician in history, the mockery is likely to be especially painful.
Media coverage of Trump donating his salary
The campaign noted Bloomberg's support of efforts to reform health care in early 2009 and a press release in support of the House version of the Affordable Care Act the day before it was passed . The campaign also pointed to an op-ed Bloomberg wrote in 2009 where he appears to be supportive of the House bill that was being crafted around that time and to a 2013 radio interview of the bill in which Bloomberg said, Congress passed this, so let's try it at least.
[22:55:07] The convergence between two different story lines is pretty striking. In the last couple weeks, remember, we found out that essentially the President was seeking to leverage his Presidential campaign to do business in Russia. And he had pursued for years the idea of a major project, a major building project in Moscow. It hadn't panned out and the fact that Michael Cohen is now admitting, admitting under oath, you know, to the Special Counsel that he called Vladimir Putin's office seeking help in that real estate deal while Donald Trump was campaigning for President. Remains to me, I think one of the signal breakthroughs in terms of our knowledge of this campaign.
You know, I thought it was interesting, when you watched the negotiations that have been going on between the -- our bipartisan and bicameral committee, when the committee members had a chance to go visit the border, when the committee members had a chance to hear from Border Patrol agents themselves in testimony, it really made a difference, I think.
So, yeah, it's just a diversionary tactic, and it's sad. I think they should just get out there, answer the questions, and move on and try to pursue some legislation for once.
Facts First: The US intelligence community, public health experts and officials in Trump's own administration had The US intelligence community, public health experts and officials in Trump's own administration had warned for years that the country was at risk from a pandemic. Some of the warnings specifically mentioned the possibility of a coronavirus pandemic. And when this particular coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, was identified in China in early January, health experts quickly cautioned it could be a major problem around the world.
A warning from the US embassy in London to Americans who will be in the UK during President Trump's visit there later this week. Widespread protests are expected. It's an extraordinary statement, considering Great Britain is one of America's closest allies.
But court watchers are left wondering what is taking so long.
Los programas son enormes. Quizás los problemas puedan resolverse pronto.
We rate Bush's claim as true because Congress did not bring the resolution up for a vote.
They must look to provide affordable health care for every American. While some major Democratic candidates for president in 2020 favored a Medicare for All plan , President-elect Joe Biden has vowed instead to add the public option to Obamacare -- reviving a measure that failed to pass in 2010. But we are long past the time for policy tinkering with the health of Americans. Of those who insist that Medicare For All is unaffordable we should ask another question: How can we afford not to? Medicare For All would increase jobs, employment and tax revenue through massive public investments that could increase worker productivity, economic mobility and ensure that families and children's health care would not be tied to a single job or eliminated amidst a pandemic.
The people whose names are selected are subjected to an extensive vetting process that includes a criminal background check.
No matter whether it is a candidate for president, or as a public citizen. I'm going to stay involved, Patrick said. No matter what decision we make tomorrow morning about the practical ability of this campaign to continue. I'm going to stay involved, and so must you.
But we don't want to lock the doors and pull down the blinds and leave the world. Because frankly, if we do that, prices will go up. People will buy less. Other people will be out of work. And we don't want to see that happen.
In his op-ed in the Wall Street Journal, titled How I Was Wrong About Obamacare, Kocher wrote that the quality of care has been negatively affected by the consolidation of doctors into larger physician groups, which he initially thought would be desirable.
ESCOBAR: There's actually a lot of work that needs to happen. That is the bare minimum. But part of what also needs to happen is she needs to evaluate the infrastructure. The facilities at the ports of entry. The holding facilities. She needs to talk to personnel. And I hope that they will be honest with her. I hope agents will tell her the deficiencies.

Klobuchar has admitted that she can be too tough on her staff in response to the stories.
4. It brushes past some complicated Capitol Hill politics
We are watching to see if House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy finally meets with Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene on Tuesday evening and whether he kicks her off of her committees or waits for House Democrats to make that move.
Here are the claims Trump made over these two weeks that we have previously fact checked in one of these weekly roundups:
The Republican's administration targeted 50-year-old Clean Air Act protections, carbon emissions caps, methane regulations, energy efficient light bulb requirements, the length of environmental impact studies for infrastructure projects and gas pipelines, animal protections, herbicide limits and limits for auto emissions.
I think the President just listed off the names of people he's spoken to on the phone about health care, one Senate Republican aide told CNN.
This is the time to re-ignite the American imagination. This is the time to search for the tallest summit, and set our sights on the brightest star. This is the time to rekindle the bonds of love and loyalty and memory that link us together as citizens, as neighbors, as patriots.
LONG: You got it. Thank you.
There's a new entry into the rising Democratic debate over wide-ranging overhauls of the US health care system, this one from a House Democratic freshman who flipped a Republican district in 2018.
The former Vice President's strength is that he comes across as sincerely believing that his work in government has been for the public good. The problem is that Biden simply doesn't know how to translate his convictions into persuasiveness. His messaging is overcrowded, often lacking a clear purpose.
I still look at him and I'd say to myself that's the guy who's the strongest in a general election, whether he can survive, you know, this cattle call remains to be seen.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: They need to act now. They need to act now.
Almost two months ago, experts were saying that the new virus in Wuhan was potentially a global threat, Lipsitch said in an email. One month ago, experts were saying that it was likely to be pandemic, and the White House's response was that this was under control, despite the fact that the US's lack of testing was demonstrably giving a false picture of the extent of infection.
Klobuchar's electability in Minnesota, which has largely come by taking more politically moderate positions, has some Democrats questioning whether the senator will be able to capture the imagination of a party that has drifted to the left nationally.
Trump said of Iran: Their economy went down 25% last year. Their GDP is down so much. Nobody's ever seen anything like it. -- February 13 radio interview with Geraldo Rivera
Polling is working against Trump, too. A CNN poll released Tuesday found that Trump has the lowest approval rating of any modern president at the end of their first year in office, with 35% of American approving of his handling of the job.
Without knowing how many states might be objected to, there is no way to predict how long Wednesday will go. We may get more clarity on Tuesday, but we may have to watch this play out in real time. I am told by a Senate GOP source that Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas and the 11 members who signed a statement Saturday saying they will support objections are still considering whether they will object to particular states or merely vote for the objections that Hawley brings. The outcome of the Georgia election could also factor into senators' thinking: If GOP Sens. Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue both win, does that change the calculus for whether members want to challenge the state of Georgia, for example? Will members be ready to move on more quickly?
Another source who is close to Azar but critical of some of his actions said he believes the talk about possibly replacing him is coming from advisers close to the President who are using Azar as a scapegoat for White House missteps, including Trump's statements at the White House briefing this week regarding disinfectant and heat being able to kill the virus.
The belief is that the Senate will send something back to the House, likely with Obamacare payments or possibly just a short-term funding extension into January. All the while, parties negotiating a DACA deal in both chambers remain optimistic about the progress of talks.
BUSH: I don't know. I don't think about it that much in reflection because we're in the heat of battle right now. And we're all big boys. We all can take it. I get a lot of incoming from Donald Trump. I don't know if you've seen it.
And his Justice Department is siding with a coalition of Republican states that are fighting in federal court to invalidate the Affordable Care Act. An appellate panel in December upheld a lower court ruling that found Obamacare's individual mandate unconstitutional but sent the case back to the lower court to decide whether the entire law must fall.
An Indian news website promptly published a photo gallery of seven Trump handshakes during his trip.
However, the most damning finding of the CBO report was that 24 million more people would be uninsured in 2026 under the GOP bill than under Obamacare. An estimated 52 million people under age 65 would be uninsured, compared with 28 million if Obamacare remained in place.
Mr. Shimon Prokupecz is here as well as Ms. Sara Murray. Good evening to both of you. I'm glad you're on, and I'm glad you're all safe and we're in the building tonight.
Many Republican Senators want me to Veto the FISA Bill until we find out what led to, and happened with, the illegal attempted 'coup' of the duly elected President of the United States, and others! -- March 12 tweet
Senator-elect Cory Booker of New Jersey now joins me from New York.
We may have to fight to get that information. Bill Barr has not been willing to commit to provide that report, either to the Congress or to the American people. We're going to need to see it. The American people are going to need to see it.
(CNN) The lived effects of racism and inequality constitute America's biggest public health and safety crisis , and it demands bold, courageous action in 2021. The Biden-Harris administration's first 100 days should be devoted to developing, unveiling and implementing a National Racial Truth, Justice and Healing Commission, with executive authority charged with three broad missions. The commission could be run out of the Oval Office, perhaps overseen by senior domestic adviser Susan Rice, and have a staff that included a congressional liaison to help pursue legislative programs while simultaneously using executive authority wherever possible to achieve its objective.
Prior to the pandemic, the opioid crisis was Trump's top public health focus. The President declared a public health emergency over the issue and signed Congressional legislation into law that increased funding for the epidemic.
HARLOW: Hold on. Hold on, Senator.
ROSA FLORES, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, Chris, there are at least 10 collapsed buildings here in Mexico City who are believed to have people trapped inside. The building that you see behind me is one of them. At this hour, rescuers telling us that operations here have stopped because of the rain that pummeled Mexico City overnight. That rain added weight to the building that is already unstable. And this rain just one added stress to an already very dangerous operation to save lives.
President Donald Trump complained Wednesday that he didn't receive a thank you for approving the funeral the late Sen. John McCain wanted, marking his latest grievance in his recent onslaught against the Arizona Republican.
The goal is to be finished and have the bill signed into law by March 14, this Senate aide tells CNN. That gives some time for lawmakers to pass this before unemployment benefits run out at the end of March.
Now, the sheriff also tells me that they obtained a warrant for this subject's home and that they are working on exercising that warrant, trying to figure out if there are any clues inside his home.
MARQUARDT: He's a terrible human being. I wonder if the President has actually seen that piece of video. Assuming he does at some point, do you think that Mulvaney will actually become the permanent chief of staff?
QUESTION: Were you in the room at the time?
In March, the Supreme Court will take up the first abortion-related case since Kavanaugh and Gorsuch took the bench. The case does not directly challenge the landmark 1973 opinion Roe v. Wade, but some believe it could give the conservative majority a chance to chip away at abortion rights.
CNN fact checked candidate's claims raging from policy projections, their work history and alleged accolades and attacks on those sharing the stage.

At least nine states have submitted waivers to require these enrollees to participate in some type of community engagement, such as working, volunteering, going to school or entering a job training program, in order to qualify for benefits.
But the exhaustion date is still 11 years later than had been projected before Congress passed the Affordable Care Act, now known as Obamacare.
The numbers matter here. The lawsuit, which alleged that Trump violated the Constitution by obtaining financial benefits from foreign government officials who stay at his properties, was tossed out by the three-judge panel precisely because the lawsuit had not been brought by a sufficient number of members of the House or the Senate.
Scaramucci told Berman that he always got along with McCain, adding that he was a decorated Vietnam War veteran.

Lawmakers on Capitol Hill are still sorting out their plans on how to revamp Obamacare, but some Americans are worried about what their future coverage options will look like.

Overall, Obamacare enjoys much more positive ratings than the American Health Care Act. Some 49% view Obamacare favorably, compared to 31% for the GOP bill. That's the highest rating for Obamacare since shortly after it became law in March 2010.
But we've got to start now. We've got to start right here. And I tell me fellow Republicans get on side. Don't fight with the president here. We need your help. It's better for the American people long-term. It's better for your constituents long term. Take the incremental political heat today for a better society in the future. That's my message to my fellow Republicans.

The two parties came to an agreement to fund the government through January 15 and raised the debt ceiling until February 7. If they had not raised the limit by today, the government would not have been able to borrow more money, which means they would have run out of the money they need to pay all of their bills.
What we need to do is look at it more broadly. My Patriot Corporation Act is simple. It simply says, you throw out the Trump tax bill, the trillion-and-a-half-dollar mostly giveaway to the richest people in this country and to huge corporations. That's fundamentally what it was. Seventy percent of the benefits went to the top 1 percent.
Roy Moore will be the gift that keeps on giving for Democrats and define the 2018 election, at least 2018, and to think you can elect Roy Moore without getting the baggage of Roy Moore is pretty naive.

A Klobuchar aide told CNN on Monday that the senator prepared for the town hall like she would for a major interview.
It's hard to imagine that there are pundits who are calling this debate a draw -- or even a victory on points for Trump. He blustered, he blathered, he blazed a scorched-earth trail of spite and fury across the stage, and through it all, Clinton remained cool, collected and, dare I say it, presidential.

I don't want us to become a factionalized majority. I want us to become a unified majority, and that means we're going to sit down and talk things out until we get there and that's exactly what we're doing, Ryan said Tuesday.
Later, we'll also hear what kind of tone Donald Trump takes and what kind of message he sends to America in his speech tonight.
You called the decision -- quote -- plainly unconstitutional. But the law does give the president broad discretion on when to invoke these statutes. And Congress has never really defined what a national emergency is.
Cruz is wrong that the U.S. used carpet bombing in the first Persian Gulf War. To do so would have been a war crime.
White House officials' meticulous review of the language of a potential executive order on NAFTA followed the administration's early stumbles as it eagerly sought to implement another one of the Trump's biggest campaign promises: banning travel from Muslim-majority, terrorist-prone countries.

Top Donald Trump aide Kellyanne Conway – who is set to become a senior White House adviser – wouldn't commit to a time line for replacing Obamacare, despite a claim by a top Republican senator about Trump's position.
We're spending money we don't have, our health care system is going to bankrupt us, Bloomberg said. The last health care bill did not solve the basic problems, two basic problems with health care -- which in all fairness -- the President, he did say at the very beginning and then that's what I got lost in all of the negotiations as every special interest in Congress got a piece or lost a piece or negotiated about a piece.

That was one of the greatest answers I've ever heard, because Mike was able to talk for five minutes and not answer your question, Trump told a reporter.
But what Trump's comments about McCain should remind us of is this: Whether there is political gain to be found in dishonoring a lifelong public servant, it is simply wrong. It is not who we are – or who we should be. That everyone – Republicans, Democrats, independents and all the rest – won't come together to say that as one is profoundly depressing and disappointing.

BUSH (live): So, Wolf, you can see there that Jeb Bush obviously knows that he has to bring Marco Rubio back down to political earth if he wants to get ahead and do reasonably well here in New Hampshire tomorrow. But he clearly is not that comfortable with it, given the fact that the two of them have historically been friends. He still calls Marco Rubio his friend.
Pence's comments, however, left legal and health care experts -- as well as some Congressional staffers working on Obamacare's repeal and replacement -- scratching their heads as to what exactly Trump plans to do. A request to the Trump transition team for comment went unanswered.
The piece explains exactly who he's concerned about helping, and it's not the patient. Severino expressed worry about institutions like hospitals that don't want to accommodate transgender people, or employers who don't want their insurance plans to cover gender reassignment surgeries when doing so conflicts with their sincere beliefs. An extremely personal and agonizing choice such as an abortion might violate your employer's beliefs, for example. Even your birth control might make a corporation's holding family cringe in horror, as we saw in the Hobby Lobby case, in which the Supreme Court ruled that the owners of closely held corporations could opt out, on religious grounds, of covering contraceptives under Obamacare.

The proposal would allow association plans to be regulated in the same way as large employer plans. That would free them from having to adhere to all of Obamacare's rules, particularly the one requiring insurers to offer comprehensive coverage. So these plans would likely have lower premiums, but also provide fewer benefits -- which could leave sicker and older workers out in the cold. Also, the offerings could be less attractive to young women if they don't cover maternity benefits.

I will be so tough on them and ultimately that deal will be broken unless they behave better than they've ever behaved in their lives, which is probably unlikely. That deal will be broken.

CUOMO: I'm saying that experts disagree with the notion that Obama care is failing.

He understands his caucus and represents them well, Schumer said. He know how to fight and he knows how to cooperate. The job is not an easy one. So it's a testament to his qualities that he has done it longer that anyone in the history of the Senate.
China's legal system, of course, affords few rights to accused people, almost all of whom are swiftly convicted . In the US, some cases last longer than others, and appeals can extend the process, but veteran lawyers said Trump was way off. Kenyen Brown, a former US attorney in Alabama who now has a private litigation practice, said Trump's comment was hyperbole to the point of being ridiculous.
PROKUPECZ: And you know, you talked about what the Southern District said. Look, Michael Cohen came into court essentially and said as much last time when he pleaded guilty. And when you look at what the Southern District -- you know, and we can show it again on the screen, and how they describe what the president here did in saying that in particular, and as Cohen himself has now admitted -- this is when Cohen stood up in court, sworn testimony -- with respect to both payments, that is, the hush money, he acted in coordination with and at the direction of individual one. Individual one, of course, is Donald Trump.
And while he has continued to decry the US trade deficit with China and recently tied widespread loss of manufacturing jobs to the Asian powerhouse, Trump has confronted the reality of the US's complicated and delicate relationship with China in the last month as he's sought to enlist China in efforts to tame an increasingly belligerent North Korea.

MIRA: Fin de Obamacare dejaría a millones sin seguro médico en Nueva York
The administration has issued two proposed rules in recent months that will allow more people to sign up for alternatives to Obamacare. But the actions are expected to mainly help younger and healthier consumers, while hurting those with spottier health histories.
But keep in mind also, the Democrats would not be happy with a Brian Sandoval appointment. He is certainly more liberal than most Republicans today, but he is someone who said the Affordable Care Act was unconstitutional. Yes, he's been pro-choice as a governor. But Democrats care too much about this seat to give it away to a Republican.
Over the last 2 years, we have begun to fully rebuild the United States Military – with $700 billion last year and $716 billion this year. We are also getting other nations to pay their fair share. For years, the United States was being treated very unfairly by NATO – but now we have secured a $100 billion increase in defense spending from NATO allies.
But we have to do something over the long term in addition to make sure that we're not having this war forever. The question is how do we do that? And there's no guarantees that it'll ever happen. But what is clear to me, and I think a number of other people, is if we don't take down the temperature of the debate, then, the next time we go at doing this, we're still going to be more and more divisive.

Both the New Hampshire primary exit polls on Tuesday and the Iowa caucus entrance polls last week showed that health care has been a key priority.

Which leaves Roberts front and center, again. He was eviscerated by conservatives in 2012 and Trump for his ruling allowing the Affordable Care Act to remain, classifying it as a tax.
One of China's targets was to hit peak emissions  around 2030 . Another target was to get 20% of its energy from sources other than fossil fuels by 2030. That did not mean the accord somehow wouldn't kick in for China until 2030; 2030 was its (self-selected, non-binding) deadline, not a start date . Since the accord came into effect, China has implemented significant new policies to curb its emissions. The Obama administration set a target of reducing US emissions by 26% - 28% below 2005 levels by 2025 . That, similarly, did not mean that the accord would have only kicked in for the US in 2025.

I mean you saw that breaking news because nobody wants to report that stuff. I'm not sure anybody knows it. It might be sort of saying you have some -- I mean, that's good stuff. But they're a wealthy country. -- January 10 interview with Fox News' Laura Ingraham

Facts First: Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky : Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky did say there had been no pressure from Trump and made other statements to that effect, but he has not gone so far as to say Trump did nothing wrong.
This is a guy that talked about Obamacare being a disaster and about how he wouldn't support our administration in 2008, so there's a lot to discuss with Michael, Biden said.
Together, we can break decades of political stalemate. We can bridge old divisions, heal old wounds, build new coalitions, forge new solutions, and unlock the extraordinary promise of America's future. The decision is ours to make.
Already, Biden has sought to underscore the help his administration is bringing to small businesses.

Balancing out the risk pool is an important action that can be taken now to help stabilize the market, improve affordability, and send strong signals as health plans develop their products for 2018, she continued.
Facts First: Trump did not specify what he meant by simple road, but he was inaccurate even if he was talking about highways. While it can indeed take more than 10 years for some highway projects to receive environmental approvals, it isn't true that usually, you're not even able to get the permit. Brad Karkkainen, a University of Minnesota law professor and expert on environmental and land use law, said in an email: Trump's statement that most of the time you can't get the permit is just flatly wrong, by a wide margin. Just a complete fabrication.
Facts First: Leaving aside Trump's characterization of the result as a landslide, he got the numbers wrong -- again. If he was going by the number of electoral votes each candidate earned in the voting, the result was 306 for him to 232 for Clinton. If he was going by the final result, after some faithless electors defected from both him and Clinton, the result was 304 for him to 227 for Clinton. This was not a one-time slip; Trump is : Leaving aside Trump's characterization of the result as a landslide, he got the numbers wrong -- again. If he was going by the number of electoral votes each candidate earned in the voting, the result was 306 for him to 232 for Clinton. If he was going by the final result, after some faithless electors defected from both him and Clinton, the result was 304 for him to 227 for Clinton. This was not a one-time slip; Trump is habitually inaccurate about this.
Asked about illegal immigration, Trump brought up loopholes like how they pick lotteries, and they have people coming into our country.
Delgado unseated incumbent Republican Rep. John Faso in 2018 by five points – in a district Trump won by nearly seven points just two years earlier.
He couldn't get the Mexicans to build the wall. He couldn't get Congress to vote the money in. This is the -- in fact, the first emergency declaration like this in -- with that kind of construct, where he got turned down by Congress and then went ahead and did it.

Story highlights We must come together to find solutions to move this country forward, Poe said Leaving this caucus will allow me to be a more effective member of Congress, he said
It wasn't that long ago that we heard absurd attempts to rationalize the projected death toll from folks like Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson who told his home state paper, the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel, that getting coronavirus is not a death sentence except for maybe no more than 3.4% of our population (and) I think probably far less and added, we don't shut down our economy because tens of thousands of people die on the highways.
On Day 1 of his presidency, Biden is expected to quickly issue executive actions undoing Trump's past immigration orders, reinstating DACA and repealing the travel ban. But ultimately, the administration overhauled the US immigration system to largely bar immigrants from the US through successive changes that will be difficult for Biden to undo.
Scaramucci told Berman that he always got along with McCain, adding that he was a decorated Vietnam War veteran.

I began this evening by honoring three soldiers who fought on D-Day in the Second World War. One of them was Herman Zeitchik. But there is more to Herman's story. A year after he stormed the beaches of Normandy, Herman was one of those American soldiers who helped liberate Dachau. He was one of the Americans who helped rescue Joshua from that hell on earth. Almost 75 years later, Herman and Joshua are both together in the gallery tonight – seated side-by-side, here in the home of American freedom. Herman and Joshua: your presence this evening honors and uplifts our entire Nation.
BASH: Is that going -- is that going to hurt him?
The surveys, according to the senior official, are broad and open-ended questionnaires where each Republican hopeful is expected to detail their views on a host of issues, from Trump's plan for a border wall to their views on efforts to repeal Obamacare.
We have a chance of killing Obamacare. We almost did it but somebody unfortunately surprised us with thumbs down, but we'll do it a different way. You know what? We'll do it a different way, Trump told his supporters at a rally in Grand Rapids, Michigan on Thursday night. So we're going to get rid of Obamacare and I said it the other day: The Republican Party will become the party of great health care. It's good. It's important.
Trump has sometimes seemed to acknowledge, at least implicitly, that he has not permanently eliminated the amendment. In a January campaign speech to evangelicals, he said, We're going to get rid of the Johnson Amendment, and we did. It's no longer effective. And we're going to put it through and make it permanent, too.
Instead, Trump has said he wants to recapture money from other areas of the economy to shore-up Social Security.

Sanders was relying on a figure from the Institute for Policy Studies, according to the think tank senior scholar Chuck Collins but the number was inflated.

Our updated number is $710 billion, an increase of 30 percent, Collins told CNN during the debate.

Over the last period of just two years. I raised -- not from us, nothing from us -- $130 billion, but that's nothing. And over a short period of time, they will be paying $530 billion more, all of those countries. And: They have to pay -- $530 billion and the fake news doesn't want to even talk about it. They don't want to talk about it.' -- December 18 campaign rally in Battle Creek, Michigan
Facts First: There is no evidence that either San Francisco or Los Angeles has been fined. Trump's Environmental Protection Agency : There is no evidence that either San Francisco or Los Angeles has been fined. Trump's Environmental Protection Agency sent San Francisco a notice of violation in October, but that notice merely mentioned the potential for fines in the future. Will Reisman, spokesperson for the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission, the entity to which the EPA notice was sent, told CNN, We have not received any fines from the EPA. The office of Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti said Los Angeles had not been fined either.

CUOMO: Do you think you're being audited for being a strong Christian?
While Trump continues to take meetings, the source said his inner circle is smaller than in the past -- noting that Trump still feels betrayed by those who did not support his lies about election fraud and did not back him after the January 6 riot at the Capitol that Trump instigated with a speech encouraging angry supporters to march there.
Facts First: Even prominent Democrats who advocate the decriminalization of the act of illegally entering the country, such as Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, do not support completely unrestricted migration, as Trump suggests.
Today the President said it's his job. He's got a year left, and he's going to do it.
Trump said his administration has taken an unprecedented effort to secure the US-Mexico border.
SMITH: I think so. I believe I do. I believe it. It's my son. I had him for the first -- I told Obama personally, I said, look, I had him for his first 17 years and then he went into the service, then you got him. And -- I won't say it the way I said it. But I said you screwed up, you didn't do a good job, I lost my son. And they said, we'll get back to you. We -- I promise, I promise you. I will get back to you. COOPER: Some of the administration have said well, you know, we're investigating, we're still trying to find out answers. But you just want --
BRIGGS: Emails of top officials at the National Republican Congressional Committee hacked during the 2018 midterm elections. GOP sources tell CNN it was the work of an unknown entity. The breach was discovered by a vendor in April after emails from four senior committee aides had been surveilled for months. Our source says the hacker obtained passwords but did not access other NRCC systems as a result of the breach.

COOPER: You deserve -- you deserve answers.
But that pot would be smaller than it would be under Obamacare -- by $107 billion, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. Plus, the money would be redistributed so many states that expanded Medicaid -- which saw the greatest coverage gains under the health reform law -- would lose some of their funding, while those that didn't expand would get more.
I think he's a pretty honest guy and the President as you may recall just a few weeks ago, said that if we were in the 1980s he would have been considered something like a moderate Republican, Sanders said on WNYC in 2013 after Obama had been elected to a second term. And I think he's kind of a centrist somewhere in the middle of the Democratic Party. But no, I don't think he is a progressive.
But the justices ensured something else as well. They guaranteed that over the next several months, as the presidential election rages on and legal briefs flood the zone, the fate of the law and the court will be front and center during the campaign.

Both parties should be able to unite for a great rebuilding of America's crumbling infrastructure.
You have 22 years, you have a long time to go. It's not long in terms of what we're talking about, but it's still a long time to go, and I want to leave Social Security as is, I want to make our country rich again so we can afford it. I want to bring back our jobs, I want to do things that will make us, that will bring back GDP…
Trump repeated his claim that he had opposed the invasion of Iraq.
Incontrovertibly, we will need to broaden the criteria by which we test immediately. If the US government wants to demonstrate its strength, it should show its commitment to protect its people in the face of threat. We need to provide leadership -- and head-on investment in our health system so that it can protect and care for Americans. We need to broaden the available coverage, public health interventions and access to care. There are options.

At the end of February, a senior Centers for Disease Control and Prevention official, Nancy Messonnier, warned publicly that disruption to everyday life may be severe.
The rapid spread of Covid-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus , has put a new spotlight on the same frailties that Democrats successfully seized on in 2018 and are now moving to hammer away at again ahead of this fall's general election.
We have a chance of killing Obamacare. We almost did it but somebody unfortunately surprised us with thumbs down, but we'll do it a different way. You know what?

So we're going to get rid of Obamacare and I said it the other day: The Republican Party will become the party of great health care. It's good. It's important.
Trump isn't one for wonky policy details. He often makes vague pronouncements on issues like health care. In May, for example, he tweeted,​ Despite what you hear in the press, health care is coming along great. We are talking to many groups and it will end in a beautiful picture!
Trump was referring to the White House's Pledge to America's Workers initiative, in which Ivanka Trump has sought to get companies to commit to providing education and training opportunities for workers. As of March 19, 2020, companies had promised to create 15.7 million opportunities, including one million by Walmart alone -- but many of these opportunities are internal training programs, not new jobs. Also, as CNN has previously reported , many of the companies had already planned these opportunities before Ivanka Trump launched the initiative.
On July 18, 2015, then-candidate Donald Trump said this about John McCain: He's not a war hero. He was a war hero because he was captured. I like people who weren't captured.
But what we talked about was the fact that things have really gotten personal. Not just partisan but really personal with regard to him, to John Boehner, he questioned his courage, but also with regard to how Harry Reid and others talk about the party on the other side and especially their key constituency.
But it was 1989, I know many of you, especially you girls, were not alive then. And it was a Tyson fight and this time, Donald was big in Atlantic City and he called me up and said OK, let's go to the Tyson fight. I said I had one of my little sons with me. He said no problem, I'll bring Donny, let's go. Of course, in typical Trump style we hop in the Trump helicopter, we fly into Atlantic City and it's a zoo. We land, thousands of paparazzi, thousands of people everywhere, whisked to his limo, go to the front of the Convention Center and there's 10,000 cameras. He said let's go back to back of the Convention Center. We go to the back of the Convention Center. We start walking in and people harassing him like mad.
LEMON: Gentlemen, thank you. Have a good weekend. I appreciate it.
We don't want to see health care expenses continue to go from maybe it's 18 or 19 percent now, Chris, into the mid-20s. That would be disastrous for the economy. We've studied other countries where you can get it down, and we have a plan to get it down. And one of the bad news things about this, it's not going to happen overnight. You can't put something in place and expect it to be the panacea, Chris, immediately. But what you can do is, working with the great leadership of the president, is move the process along to get it in a place where the American people will like in the next three, five, and 10 years.
The scale of the looming disaster would have tested any administration and was bound to highlight flaws in governance at the local and state level as well. But Trump is being criticized so vehemently because he was so vocal in dismissing the threat from the virus for weeks. It also took him a prolonged period to fully embrace the warnings of his scientific advisers on the need for national self-distancing measures.
At the core of our system is America's generally competitive marketplace for health care services. America has the most innovative health care economy in the world. No other country even comes close. This innovation manifests itself in the latest biopharmaceuticals, medical devices and surgical techniques, as well as rapidly evolving health IT and quality and outcomes measurements. Because our policymakers avoided price controls and tried to create competitive marketplaces for many of these products, we've driven down prices for consumers and expanded options for patients – all while promoting innovation.
The late senator's widow, Cindy McCain, publicized hateful messages she's been receiving since Trump's tweets, and daughter Meghan McCain has continued to respond to the President online and on ABC's The View, where she's a co-host.
CUOMO: Of course they would. They'd rather pay the least. That could tell you that the tax penalty might be not high enough, that the mandate doesn't work well enough.
Pero no hay excusa para la incompetencia y las demoras durante esta crisis de coronavirus que han sido resultado directo del desdén de Trump & Co. por el gobierno.
Fundamentally, Orszag said, the ACA is working.
In North Dakota, despite a lobbying effort that included a visit with Trump at the White House, Rep. Kevin Cramer decided in January against a Senate run.

He tried to increase his percentage of the black vote by blanketing Facebook with ads that highlighted his long-standing commitment to civil rights. He also talked up issues of paramount importance to the black community -- criminal justice reform and social-economic injustice. Sanders enlisted the help of influential black surrogates such as Harvard Professor Cornel West and rapper Killer Mike . He began airing a TV ad that features former President Barack Obama's past praise of him, even though he has positioned himself as the anti-establishment candidate. Former Obama aides like David Axelrod questioned the ad given that Sanders and the former President were not particularly close. In Mississippi , his campaign funded an ad campaign on black radio.
Facts First: Though Trump did have a major rally at the Phoenix Convention Center in July 2015, it was not his first speech as a presidential candidate or as a potential candidate; he had launched his campaign nearly a month prior with a speech at Trump Tower in Manhattan, then : Though Trump did have a major rally at the Phoenix Convention Center in July 2015, it was not his first speech as a presidential candidate or as a potential candidate; he had launched his campaign nearly a month prior with a speech at Trump Tower in Manhattan, then held a rally in New Hampshire . And the crowd in Phoenix was smaller than 15,000; the Phoenix Fire Department cut off attendance at 4,169, a spokesperson told PolitiFact in 2015 . (There is no evidence for Trump's 2015 claim that the convention center broke the fire code by allowing 12-15,000 people in 4,000 code room.)
The administration has also rejected calls to reopen enrollment on the Obamacare federal exchanges and allow uninsured Americans an opportunity to obtain coverage. The deadline to sign up for a 2020 policy was December 15 in most states. But advocates, insurers, Democrats and at least two Republican governors were hoping that, with hundreds of thousands already ill and the federal government taking extraordinary steps to aid a spiraling economy, the White House might relent.

Trump claimed to have ended the war on American energy, then said, The US is now the number one producer of oil and natural gas in the entire world, by far.
I am running because I see that sense of community is getting fractured, Klobuchar said on Sunday in Iowa. It's getting fractured by someone in the White House who gets up every morning and tweets whatever he wants but doesn't respect the amendment that allows him to do it.
Avalere's projections for the plans' enrollment are roughly in line with the Congressional Budget Office's estimate of 4 million members. In addition, the CBO also noted that about 10% of the 4 million people buying these plans in 2023 and beyond would have been uninsured otherwise.
Replace Obamacare subsidies with refundable tax credits based mainly on age
The ads seek to compare Trump's positions on taxes, Obamacare, firearm bans and North Carolina's law banning transgender people from using bathrooms that differ from their biological sex. The spots are virtually identical, with one referring to gun control and taxes and the other mentioning Planned Parenthood and Obamacare.
Trump did have the record for the total number of appeals court judges appointed, Wheeler said.

Republicans oppose anything near Biden's ambition. Ten GOP senators -- the bare minimum needed to bypass a filibuster -- propose spending just one-third as much. After watching just seven Republican vote to convict at Trump's Senate impeachment trial, the White House doubts negotiations can produce an acceptable bipartisan compromise.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I love you too (inaudible).
Sen. Amy Klobuchar will take to the national stage on Monday headlining a CNN town hall in New Hampshire to make her most public case yet for why she should be the next President of the United States.

I would probably vote for it initially and then wait and see how the bill comes out, said Sen. Jon Tester, a moderate Democrat from Montana.
Thank you to @mirandadevine of the New York Post for your interesting (and correct) column today. 'Trump has gained 20 points since Impeachment began in October. He gets 67% on economy.

Alleging environmental violations related to San Francisco's population of homeless people and people who inject drugs, Trump said, And we fined San Francisco -- and Los Angeles and San Francisco.

Facts First: Mexico has deployed around 27,000 troops, but Trump exaggerated how many are being stationed near the US border in particular. CNN reported on November 2: Nearly 15,000 troops are deployed to Mexico's northern border, where they've set up 20 checkpoints, Mexican Defense Minister Luis Cresencio Sandoval said last week at a press briefing on the country's security strategy. At the southern border, 12,000 troops are deployed and have set up 21 checkpoints.
El muro fue lo siguiente. Este miércoles llegó con la firma de un decreto para designar fondos federales para la construcción del muro fronterizo, aunque no pronunció palabra sobre cómo obligará a México a pagar la cuenta. Ese mismo día, le dijo a ABC News que espera comenzar la construcción del muro muy rápido, aunque hacer que México pague por él puede complicar el asunto.
President-elect Donald Trump has been in the spotlight for years. From developing real estate and producing and starring in TV shows, he became a celebrity long before winning the White House.
Facts First: It is true that some : It is true that some prominent Democratic candidates want the US to end the use of fossil fuels over time, but achieving an end to American petroleum use would not mean there would be no American factories.
Trump claimed that this area of Pennsylvania, and Pennsylvania itself, has the best numbers it's ever had. It's got the best economy it's ever had. It has the best unemployment numbers it's ever had. And Scranton has the lowest and best unemployment numbers they've -- and employment numbers too -- that they've ever had, by far.
Christie's team is hitting back. In a speech Monday, he pitched his experience as a prosecutor and governor to New Hampshire voters, and argued that challenging times call for someone who has been held responsible and accountable for their decisions, not someone who just changes the next vote if the last one didn't work out. The address was a not-so-subtle dig at congressional rivals such as Rubio who, as Cruz is all too eager to remind people, changed his position on immigration reform.
Trump made 16 false claims about Ukraine, 13 about impeachment and nine about the economy.
I'd like to return to North Korea. With North Korea continuing to escalate nuclear tension, can we expect any action from the administration to ratchet up pressure of actions on China?
The first of the two shutdowns that occurred during Bill Clinton's presidency started after Clinton vetoed spending bills from the GOP-led Congress. Clinton was unwilling to accept a Republican plan that would balance the federal budget in seven years by cutting taxes; slashing Medicare, Medicaid and welfare benefits; and trimming hundreds of other federal programs. But there was another, more bizarre beginning to this one. House Speaker Newt Gingrich said he sent Clinton a tougher spending budget because he was forced to exit from the back of Air Force One while traveling with Clinton during an international trip. A short-term budget deal and a promise for more negotiations ended this impasse after just a week.
Trump actually did sort of declare victory on North Korea immediately upon touching down on US soil after the summit in June with Kim.
Tonight, Bloomberg called such attacks a side show and not relevant to his record as mayor.
Meanwhile, the Trump administration has recently argued that the entire law should not be invalidated nationwide, reversing a previous stance
Asked by CNN's Jake Tapper on State of the Union Sunday whether Trump and Paul agree that a replacement needs to be passed at the same time Obamacare is repealed, Conway dodged.
We should mention, Fran, as always -- as we always mention, serves on the CIA's external advisory committee. She recently traveled to Libya with her employer MacAndrews & Forbes. That was before the attack and actually had met with Ambassador Stevens.

It was an eclectic batch of dishonesty. Among other things, Trump took unearned credit for both the Ethiopia-Eritrea peace agreement and for the drop in the US cancer death rate, absurdly claimed that NATO had no money before his presidency, wrongly denied that his golf excursions cost taxpayers any money, and repeated his usual varied inaccuracies about impeachment, immigration and the nuclear agreement with Iran.

Apple (AAPL), Electronic Arts (EA) and U.S. Steel (X) are set to release earnings after the close.
Sen. Bernie Sanders, the incoming Budget Committee chairman, has been supportive of Biden's approach so far, but he wrote in a CNN op-ed on the eve of the inauguration that Democrats should be prepared to go it alone, using reconciliation.
And it's going to be difficult going down the line to argue the horrific things will happen if the debt ceiling is raised, but we refuse to negotiate. So I think the pressure is going to be on all of them and everybody sticks to their positions until they don't anymore. COOPER: David, do you see where the perimeters of a negotiation would be?

Whether it's unfair Chinese trade practices, the North American Free Trade Agreement he's dubbed a disaster or Iran's destabilizing actions, Trump has kept up much of his bold campaign rhetoric.

Biden is taking a gamble; setting dates against which you can be judged is always risky in politics. He is sure to face a backlash if vaccination delays nix his timelines. The pandemic has long busted expectations and its murderous hold on the world, with the help of new viral mutations, means no one can really know when it will end. And the White House's plan to set up a national vaccination booking website has some Democrats shuddering, as they remember the glitchy portal that hampered the rollout of Obamacare.

It marks an abrupt reversal from defense to offense for Democrats who have spent the last decade fending off Republican attempts to curtail or repeal Obamacare. In his new book The Ten Year War, journalist Jonathan Cohn notes that a Senate in which 50 members representing a clear majority of the population had the ability to pass legislation that could have produced a much more ambitious health care bill.
MORGAN: And that's frankly was a fantastic idea. Wouldn't we be great to see that how thing it works. They wouldn't let concentrate a few miles.

It's in a tiny little cubby hole and to at an airport in Washington. That's all tomorrow night.
Trump's defense strategy was headlined by efforts to push the US to exit foreign wars. And his foreign affairs strategy was dominated by his belief that the US was being taken advantage of by other nations, including allies.
He's hitting something that is socially unnatural. And so what is that? You're attacking somebody that died seven months ago, Scaramucci told CNN's John Berman on New Day.

Early in the debate, Sanders used an inaccurate figure that had been provided to his campaign by a progressive think tank that, among other things, keeps track of the fortunes of billionaires.
Women (69%) and non-whites (70%) are more apt than men or whites to consider a demographically-representative Congress deeply important. Democrats (82%) say it's more important than Republicans (44%). Democrats are also more likely than Republicans to say it's important for Congress to represent the nation's political makeup in terms of partisanship and ideology (76% among Democrats to 55% among Republicans). The economic makeup of Congress is also important to Democrats, who say Congress should represent the country in terms of income and education (78% among Democrats to 59% among Republicans).
The most recent agency review of the House bill found that it would reduce federal deficits by $150 billion between 2017 and 2026.

Republicans, however, have to convince the already skeptical American electorate that their victory will benefit them. Polls, including a CNN survey released earlier this week, find the plan is unpopular with a majority of American voters, given it is seen by most as benefiting the wealthy over middle class Americans. Republicans are confident the plan will get more popular over time as Americans see more money in their paychecks.
In July 2016, ICE deputy director Daniel Ragsdale testified to Congress that there were some exceptions to the rule: It is important to note that while countries may generally be cooperative, sometimes they may delay or refuse the repatriation of certain individuals. For example, El Salvador, a country that is generally cooperative, has recently delayed the issuance of a number of travel documents where there is no legal impediment to removal.

That's because the proposed regulations, combined with Congress' elimination of the individual mandate next year, will whittle away at Obamacare's sweeping protections for those with pre-existing conditions. This will leave those who are or who have been sick at risk of paying higher premiums, losing their comprehensive coverage or being left without an insurer on the Affordable Care Act exchanges.

This would be a massive new federal bureaucracy, replacing, by some estimates, 2 million US insurance and health industry jobs. Setting up, enforcing and evolving a health care system for about 320 million people and transitioning more than 200 million from a private system to a public one would be a gargantuan undertaking. Sanders' proposal imagines a regional administration system that would coordinate individual states and filter up to the HHS secretary, who would be in charge of setting policies. An official ombudsman would collect and hear grievances.

If you went back years, they had short range missiles and the threat was really -- you know, U.S. troops in South Korea, without a doubt, but the threat was more regional. Then the intermediate range missiles. And these are the missile tests. If you go back to the Dear Leader, then this leader's father, missile tests, yes, but not like this.

'Those at the top are not doing their part:' WH looks to raise taxes on wealthy
President Donald Trump's attacks on the late Sen. John McCain are stupid and socially unnatural, Anthony Scaramucci said Thursday.
So we had to do our solemn duty and look into it. And, as so often, we found no evidence for it whatsoever.
The President said Thursday he had tasked a handful of Republican senators with cobbling together an Obamacare replacement. No such working group appears to exist, however.
Voters on both sides of the battle for the House say they are largely casting votes to support their candidate rather than to make a stand against their opponent. About 6 in 10 voters who choose the Democrat in their district say they are doing so more to vote for the Democrat than against the Republican. Likewise, 60% of Republican backers say they're casting a supportive vote for the GOP more than one against the Democrats.

The bipartisan group's aim, it says on a sleek website littered with sometimes impenetrable banalities, is to consolidate public opinion around policies that would ensure that every single American has access to quality, affordable health care, no matter his or her station. What precisely that means, or how it should be achieved, is left open to interpretation. Those blank spaces have roiled the progressive left, so often criticized for failing to offer specifics in its own advocacy, as it works to build support for a single-payer, or Medicare for all, plan.

Under Obamacare, these funds were set to disappear by 2020 since the original law called for all states to expand Medicaid.
SANDOVAL: Currently only some teachers and school staff are allowed to carry firearms. Since the Parkland shooting, at least 14 other states have introduced similar measures. The changes have been met with some support in states where rural communities lack funding and resources to respond to a school shooter.
This week, Rolling Stone's Tim Dickinson – who wrote a must-read profile of the minority leader last month – published a transcript of their conversation. It's a roaring read. Pelosi might yet be beatable in a future leadership vote, and her take on the Ocasio-Cortez result might've read as petulant, but the interview should dispel any suggestion, as her critics often posit, that she's somehow past it.
CNN previously reported that the senator, who had been held as a prisoner of war in Vietnam, did not want the President at his funeral. McCain's daughter, Meghan McCain, also revealed earlier this year that she wished Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner, Trump's daughter and son-in-law and senior advisers, had not attended the funeral.
Chicago Tribune culture journalist Steve Johnson wrote in 2016: 'The Apprentice' was a genuine hit in that first season, ending as the seventh-most-watched TV show of the year, averaging almost 21 million viewers a week, but its ratings declined steadily each year after that, to 11th place overall in its second season, then 15th, then 38th. When, after its sixth season in 2007, it finished as the 75th-most-watched show (with 7.5 million viewers on average), NBC decided to scrap real people as contestants and bring on celebrities...The celebrity show did better, but it has been middle of the pack all the way, with finishes ranking from 46th to 84th before Trump announced his candidacy and NBC replaced him with Arnold Schwarzenegger.
But with the federal government again on the precipice of a shutdown, Trump's already dubious status as dealmaker-in-chief is facing yet another existential exam – one he appears to be on the verge of failing, amid a series of conflicting, confounding and offending remarks in public and in private conversations with lawmakers.
The President and first lady Melania Trump called her, she said, in the wake of an Axios report that Trump mocked the Arizona senator's Vietnam War injuries.

Governor Greg Abbott today held a press conference in Houston on the importance of election integrity legislation this session. The Governor named election integrity as an emergency legislative item during his State of the State address in February.

Anyone who loses job-based health insurance coverage is already eligible to sign up on the exchanges within 60 days of becoming uninsured. Enrollment in the first five months of 2020 jumped 46% compared to the same period the year before, the Trump administration said in June.
BERMAN: That is something we have heard in some cases from these corporate boards.
This is the Donald Trump they want you, if you're among those voters right now watching, that they want you to think of when you think of Donald Trump. They don't want you to think of the negative news coverage, they don't want to take negative of Ted Cruz's speech last night, they want to think of this very positive and narrative and the video we're going to see and what Ivanka Trump has to say about her father.
Scaramucci told Berman that he always got along with McCain, adding that he was a decorated Vietnam War veteran.
Plus, terror doesn't even begin to describe it. Chilling, frightening new video obtained by CNN from inside the Kenyan mall while gunmen take aim. That's coming up.
Also, it would not curtail federal support for the overall Medicaid program as the House and Senate health care bills would have.

BRIGGS: A dispute between the NFL and Cleveland police over when the league asked to see surveillance video of Kareem Hunt's altercation with a woman at a hotel back in February. Police say the NFL did not make a formal request until November 30th, the same date TMZ posted the video on its website. But a league spokesman claims there were multiple conversations with Cleveland police officers and a request for the video back in February.
KING: And so they're at home and she's still a no unless it's dramatically changed. Senator Cruz says he's still a no, but trying to change it as well. The issue in trying to get to 50 votes is, Senator Cruz is trying to take it to the right, Senator Collins is trying to take it to the left. If either one of them succeeds, you lose the other side. This math still looks, at the moment, impossible to me. Does anyone see it otherwise?
(CNN) More than 206,000 people signed up for Affordable Care Act policies on the federal exchange in the first two weeks of the special enrollment period ordered by President Joe Biden, federal data released Wednesday shows.
Open enrollment on the federal exchanges, which the Trump administration cut in half to six weeks, ended on December 15. But Biden has the power to reopen sign-ups, which will allow the uninsured to select policies, under a special enrollment period.
CHALIAN: People do not end campaigns for any reason other than they run out of money. And I think that is completely true. And if you look at Cruz ...
Cillizza: Finish this sentence: In two years, the fallout from this move by Republicans will be ____________. Now, explain.
The recent stock rally has helped push tech stocks like Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN) and Microsoft (MSFT) to all-time highs. The Nasdaq, which is home to these three as well as Facebook (FB) and Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL), again hit a new record earlier Wednesday.
These are not unreasonable changes to ask of someone like myself who is 25 or 30 years away from retirement, in exchange for leaving the program undisturbed for the people that are on it now or about to retire, and ensuring that we do not bankrupt our country and that this program still exists when my children retire, when my grandchildren retire, when I retire.
While longer-term spending negotiations were still ongoing, Democrats have dug in their heels and demanded that no spending caps be agreed to until there is a deal on the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which expires on March 5. Democrats have said they want assurances that DACA recipients are protected before agreeing to an omnibus spending bill, the best leverage they believe they have. And even on the short-term continuing budget resolution, many Democrats say they want an answer on DACA before they vote again to fund the government.
COOPER: Thank you for what you did.
With unyielding commitment, we are curbing the opioid epidemic -- drug overdose deaths declined for the first time in nearly 30 years. Among the states hardest hit, Ohio is down 22%, Pennsylvania is down 18%, Wisconsin is down 10% -- and we will not quit until we have beaten the opioid epidemic once and for all, Trump said during his speech.

He didn't even want to start his regular dinner time appearance before reporters by talking about the virus, on the deadliest day yet for Americans.
Health care has been at the forefront of the campaign since the beginning, but the party is split between radically overhauling the nation's health insurance system or taking smaller steps.

That alone, however, would not save the program much money unless the Health and Human Services Secretary is given authority to legally require lower prices, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.
By contrast, the entry of China into the World Trade Organization in 2001 likely had a much larger impact because of sudden competition from cheaper imports. But even the high end of job loss estimates from EPI found that the change in trade status for China caused a loss of 3.4 million jobs between 2001 and 2017.
BASH: What kind of nominee do Democrats want? Democratic Senator and potential presidential contender Sherrod Brown weighs in.
So Trump had the most judges to appoint since Clinton, but, clearly, other presidents also had appointing to do.
The move is already facing challenges in the courts. And Democrats are vowing to try to stop the president legislatively. Some Republicans are also criticizing the tactic. Senator Marco Rubio said -- quote -- No crisis justifies violating the Constitution.
Facts First: This was a very : This was a very small exaggeration , but an exaggeration nonetheless. (Trump habitually exaggerates even legitimate accomplishments.) The unemployment rate for January 2020, 3.6% , was the lowest since December 1969 if you don't count previous months under Trump when it was 3.5%. That is 50 years and one month prior, not over 51 years.
TRUMP: Marco talks about consequences. Well, we've had a lot of consequences, including airplanes flying into the World Trade Center, the Pentagon and could have been the White House. There have been a lot of problems.
And our special coverage continues with Brooke Baldwin right here on CNN.
Clearly, there are other topics you'll have to address as you prepare to make your early exit. You'll want to be sure you're following a consistent investing strategy that jibes with your tolerance for risk, balances growth and downside protection and keeps expenses to a minimum. If you won't have enough savings in taxable accounts to fund the initial years of your retirement, then you'll also want to look into ways of tapping tax-advantaged accounts like a 401(k) or IRA while avoiding or minimizing early-withdrawal penalties. And you'll want to monitor your progress as you near your planned retirement date to gauge whether leaving your job at 55 is still realistic or whether you might be better off delaying a year or two.
Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, a New Yorker and chair of the Democratic caucus, said earlier Wednesday that the standalone resolution is an opportunity to demonstrate support for the law.

BROWNSVILLE, TX - JUNE 22: A crying Honduran woman and her child wait along the border bridge after being denied into the Texas city of Brownsville which has become dependent on the daily crossing into and out of Mexico on June 22, 2018 in Brownsville, Texas. Immigration has once again been put in the spotlight as Democrats and Republicans spar over the detention of children and families seeking asylum at the border. Before President Donald Trump signed an executive order Wednesday that halts the practice of separating families who were seeking asylum, over 2,300 immigrant children had been separated from their parents in the zero-tolerance policy for border crossers.

Listen, he spends his weekend obsessing over great men because he knows it, and I know it, and all of you know it: he will never be a great man, McCain said on ABC's The View, where she is a co-host.
MIAMI GARDENS, FLORIDA - MAY 06: Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis speaks during a press conference at the Hard Rock Stadium testing site on May 06, 2020 in Miami Gardens, Florida. Gov. DeSantis announced during the press conference that a COVID-19 antibodies test will be available. The test can show if a person has had the virus in the past without showing symptoms, and therefore may be immune to it. The test will be available to first responders and health care workers first, with the goal of being able to expand testing to the general public. (Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)
And, if the economy does tip into recession, extend unemployment benefits. Instead of slashing food stamps and other aid to the poor, as the Trump administration is doing, expand it. Protect workers and support business. That's not just the moral thing to do, all of these measures will help the economy get back on its feet faster.
JEFFREY LORD, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: Welcome to the party of Donald Trump.
TRUMP: And strong doesn't mean good. Putin is a strong leader, absolutely. I could name many strong leaders. I could name very many very weak leaders. But he is a strong leader. Now I don't say that in a good way or a bad way. I say it as a fact.
Trump discussed a conversation he claimed he had with President Barack Obama about North Korea and its leader Kim Jong Un. Trump said, And I have a good relationship with him (Kim). I said (to Obama), 'Did you ever call him?' The answer is: Yes, he did. But I will tell you, I don't think they admit that; maybe they do. But called many times, and Kim Jong Un did not want to talk to him. -- March 5 Fox News town hall in Scranton, Pennsylvania
Trump said that NATO was going down like a rocket ship until he became president. He continued, I think my biggest fan in the whole world is Secretary General Stoltenberg, head of NATO. And he said he can't believe it, because for 20 years it went down. It's like a roller coaster dip. No -- none of this (temporary stabilizing); just down. They paid less and less and less. -- February 10 remarks at speech and question and answer session with governors
(CNN) Everything changed this week. The response to the worldwide spread of the COVID-19 coronavirus upended all of our lives.

Still, it's unclear how many people will turn to the exchanges over the next three months.
Manufacturing employment did increase during the first three years of Trump's presidency, but ultimately, any gains were gone by the end of his presidency, leaving the status of US manufacturing no better than when he took office. Between January 2017 and the end of 2020, there was a net decrease in manufacturing employment. While some of the decrease could likely be attributed to the pandemic, America's manufacturing sector was in a downturn even before that, as CNN reported in August 2019 that the sector shrunk for the first time since September 2009.

[21:00:46] ANDERSON COOPER, CNN HOST: Good evening, thanks for joining us, 8:00 P.M. here in Houston, inside of tomorrow night's CNN Republican Debate and Tuesday's primary. One of 13 primaries and caucuses being held March 1st, any or all of which Donald Trump now stands a good chance of winning. Which would only add and it going bus that he could take it all after dealing his two main rivals across in blow last night in Nevada, it was his third straight victory and fair to say it's shaken the Republican Party.

By the time he made his late entry into the Democratic primary race last November, Bloomberg knew that his only shot at winning the nomination was to outspend everyone. Over the next four months, the former New York mayor did just that, plowing more than a half billion dollars of his own fortune into television ads, and hundreds of millions more on building the biggest field operation of any campaign.

Well, as anyone knows who's been listening to me, I'm very much against the government being involved in every aspect of our lives, Carson said. Last year, there was an additional 81,000 pages of government regulations. If you stack that up, it would be a three-story building. This is absolutely absurd.
I received calls from the President of Mexico and the Prime Minister of Canada asking to renegotiate NAFTA rather than terminate, Trump tweeted Thursday morning. I agreed subject to the fact that if we do not reach a fair deal for all, we will then terminate NAFTA.

Facts First: There is no basis for the claim that there has been fighting over the Turkey-Syria border for 1,000 years; modern-day Turkey and Syria were both part of the Ottoman Empire that was only dissolved after World War I, and the border between them is less than 100 years old.
While we don't yet have an analysis of the Senate's plan, it is clear that if signed into law, the bill would fall well short of Trump's broad promises to insure everyone. According to the CBO, under the House bill that passed in May – which is similar to the Senate bill – 23 million Americans who already have insurance would lose their coverage within a decade.
And I don't think they will have some big old package that comes as a compromise and, you know, a super deal because they've tried that before and it hasn't happen, but again I think Dana is perfectly right at some point Republicans feel the need if you're going to raise that debt ceiling, which is already at $17 trillion, Republicans feel they need to have some cuts, something to take home with them.

Health care has emerged as the top issue for voters in the first two Democratic nominating contests , but voters remain divided over whether the future of health care should shift to a government-run Medicare-for-All-style system or expand Obamacare to include a public option. The emphasis on health care raises the stakes for Bloomberg as he paves an unconventional path for the nomination after he sat out of Iowa and New Hampshire.
We told people in 2016 what it would look like when we had the chance to replace Obamacare. That was our Better Way plan. That's what this is.
The second Obama election I wrote a very backhanded endorsement of Obama, Bloomberg said. Saying I thought he hadn't done the right thing, hadn't done, hadn't been good at things that I think are important and Romney would be a better person at doing that. But Romney did not stick with the values that he had when he was governor of Massachusetts.

Social Security will go bankrupt and it will bankrupt the country with it. So what it will require is people younger, like myself, people that are 30 years away from retirement, to accept that our Social Security is going to work differently than it did for my parents.
TOWNSEND: That's right. But if it's -- so if you're at a facility that you cannot protect, that it is not possible to protect from the threat that is present, then you shouldn't be there. If you are there and you believe you can protect, then you've got to give it adequate resources. It's -- this is less about to me about blame than it is about accountability. What we ought to care about is accountability to protect other diplomats.

The heartburn for members right now
Desde este punto de vista, los conservadores mantienen la fe en Trump porque él hace lo mismo en ellos. Su serie de decretos es una lista de deseos para la derecha: revertir los costos del Obamacare, comenzar a planear una muro en la frontera, reducir las regulaciones, etc. Su elección para miembro de la Corte Suprema es un Antonin Scalia joven. La blancura, la masculinidad y el conservadurismo de su gabinete demuestran que no está haciendo concesiones a la corrección política.

As we have noted before , the document Trump released explicitly says on its first page that it is not a verbatim transcript.
Some 13 months later, as Kushner's standing in the White House corkscrews and the notion of Ivanka's moderating influence over the President is all but evaporated, those sunny hopes – and they belonged, in fairness, to anxious establishment Republicans too – have given way to still more clouds over Trump era Washington.
Klobuchar's electability in Minnesota, which has largely come by taking more politically moderate positions, has some Democrats questioning whether the senator will be able to capture the imagination of a party that has drifted to the left nationally.

Klobuchar spent the lead-up to the town hall with a trip through Wisconsin and Iowa, building on her campaign theme of retaking Midwest communities that have drifted away from Democrats in recent years. Klobuchar, a three-term senator from Minnesota, is pitching herself as a pragmatic lawmaker who is willing to work with those who oppose her to get things done.
MARQUARDT: Very difficult because we have the Democrats coming in to taking over the House, and we're at possibly the end of the Mueller investigation. So this is a White House that's under fire.

Facts First: American taxpayers are paying for Trump's border wall. Immigration experts say redemption money is not even a term they are familiar with. Some guessed that Trump might have meant remittance money -- money immigrants send back home to their countries of origin -- but that wouldn't make Trump's claim any more factual: he has not implemented any of his proposals to pay for the wall by taxing or impounding remittances.

Sanders' relentless attacks on millionaires and billionaires didn't resonate with a large segment of the black community that takes pride in the successes of black billionaires such as Robert Smith , who paid off the student loan debt of the entire 2019 graduating class at Morehouse College. Sanders doesn't seem to understand that although many African Americans suffer from an economic system stacked against them, we are economically aspirational.
A federal judge in Texas last month ruled that the Affordable Care Act, more commonly known as Obamacare, is unconstitutional because Congress eliminated the individual mandate penalty by reducing it to $0, starting this year. This rendered the mandate itself unconstitutional and the rest of the law therefore cannot stand. Earlier this week, District Judge Reed O'Connor issued an order saying that the act can remain in effect pending appeal.

Klobuchar is markedly more centrist than many of the other Democrats running for President, including some of her colleagues in the Senate. Klobuchar has a liberal voting record, but she does not support abolishing the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency or Vermont Sen.

Like the others here, this plan, which would create an independent, non-government organization to handle air traffic control work, has been grounded – repeatedly. Trump offered something similar in his last budget and in a separate pitch last year. But it's never taken off, mostly because of bipartisan security and cost concerns.
CUOMO: I totally get it. I totally get it.
Trump twice repeated a previous false story about CNN host Van Jones. He said Jones asked him to help with criminal justice reform, but then, after Trump signed a criminal justice reform bill, Jones then gave an address, televised on MSNBC, in which Jones thanked the Rev. Al Sharpton and others for the bill but never thanked Trump. (In one of the two new versions of the story, Trump said Jones had been actually in tears when he had asked Trump for help with justice reform.)

The legislative lifeline, while extraordinary in scope, is only a temporary solution to pull America from its crisis. A legacy-making program along the lines of a modern-day New Deal for Biden would require an even more difficult measure of political capital.
As to whether employers are cutting jobs because of Obamacare, it's nearly impossible to determine from Labor Department data since the economy is recovering and adding jobs. The number of people who can only find part-time jobs has declined in recent years, signifying companies are hiring more full-time workers.

Facts First: The : The poll was positive for Trump, as 77% percent of respondents in that poll did say they had confidence in the federal government's ability to handle a coronavirus outbreak. But here's some important context: the poll did not ask about Trump in particular. The poll asked about confidence in the government's future acts, not about its actual work to date and, critically, it was conducted from February 3-16, when there were far fewer reported cases and Trump was still, at minimum, 10 days away from appointing Vice President Mike Pence as his point man on the response.
Perhaps, perhaps, perhaps worst of all, perhaps worst of all, Hillary Clinton has perfected the art of politics for personal gain. She reads ethics rules as carefully as Americans read their junk mail. Just look at her track record. She used her post as secretary of state to grease the wheels for Democrat lobbyists, special interests and political insiders connected to the corrupt Clinton machine. Her family foundation took millions of dollars in donations from countries notorious for human rights abuses and funneling money to radical Islamic terrorists.
Pero ahí no termina. Se espera que esta semana Trump también ordene la interrupción del programa de refugiados de Estados Unidos, al menos cerrándoles temporalmente la puerta a los sirios que huyen de la guerra civil y de la catástrofe humanitaria en su país.

The Freedom Caucus continued to push to repeal popular pieces of Obamacare, such as the requirement that insurers cover people with preexisting conditions, something President Donald Trump had publicly said he wanted to keep in place.
The notion in many quarters was that the lawsuit may have been political payback for coverage of President Donald Trump by CNN (which Time Warner owns) after Jared Kushner unsuccessfully tried to get the network to go easier on Trump. And it intensified when Rudy Giuliani, Trump's ever graceless and sloppy political spokesman, blurted out to the press that the President denied the merger.
LEMON: Right. Go on. So, what do you want to know?
Gorsuch often focuses on the plain text of a law when analyzing it. At oral arguments, he gave hope to supporters of LGBTQ rights when he suggested that it was a close call if the text of Title VII of the Civil Rights Law of 1964 that bars discrimination because of sex also encompassed sexual orientation and gender identification.
A Foreign Policy report late last month stated that the United States has never been less prepared for a pandemic, primarily because the Trump White House fired the entire chain-of-command that handled responses to pandemics.
There is some possibility he is very confused rather than intentionally deceitful. But that would still be bad.
Meghan McCain on Monday continued her fierce pushback against President Donald Trump, who over the weekend revived his long-running feud with her father, the late Sen. John McCain.
The former aide also speculated about why only a few Republicans have criticized Trump's comments, saying that it's likely because they don't want to get in the Twitter crosshairs.
Mr. Trump, you've called the education standards known as Common Core a disaster. What are your specific objections to Common Core?
One, because America is not a planet. It's a country.

This was the rare evening where Trump faced a high bar in terms of what he had to accomplish. Not only did he not manage effective damage control of his latest scandal, it seems unlikely that he won over any undecided or independent voters tonight. However, he likely may have alienated some with his boorish, petulant behavior on full display.
COOPER: A lot of those are pre-existing conditions. I guess, I still don't understand why Governor Romney during that debate would be saying that this health care covers pre-existing conditions, when by most people's definition of what pre-existing condition is and how you get that covered, his plan doesn't cover that.

CASEY: Well, Piers, I think right now, there are two basic facts I think that are operative here. One is that the Speaker could put the bill that we passed last Friday on the floor to -- it's an amendment really, it's six of us, a little more than 15 and a half pages long. They could put that on the floor. He could vote against it, a lot of Republicans can vote against it but he would get all the Democrats voting for it.

While the Trump administration does have new agreements with all three of Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador, those agreements are related to the handling of people who come to the US seeking asylum, not criminals the US is seeking to deport.

And while Trump can boast a higher-than-average 3.32% annual gain in real per capita disposable income, that average conceals the extent of those gains that flowed to the affluent, who benefited disproportionately from his tax cuts.

The Paragould, Arkansas, resident had been uninsured for five years prior to Obamacare because she couldn't afford the $3,000 in monthly premiums for an individual market policy. Under the health reform law, she pays $300 a month.
The Trump administration ratcheted up sanctions even as the President has met with Kim Jong Un three times without preconditions. In the past, the Trump administration has offered to provide relief from these sanctions only if Pyongyang completely denuclearizes, an outcome that has looked increasingly unlikely as Kim Jong Un has in recent days threatened to restart nuclear testing.
The FBI agents who have been doing this investigation are political corruption folks, and they've been digging in on this for quite some time now.

Trump obliged, tweeting: It would be great for the Republican Party of Nevada, and it's unity if good guy Danny Tarkanian would run for Congress and Dean Heller, who is doing a really good job, could run for Senate unopposed!
After all, while plenty of Republicans didn't agree with McCain's much-touted renegade nature – and his willingness to buck party leadership – no one ever questioned the man's service to the country (in the military and in elected office). And doing so was seen as the easiest way to destroy your political future.
We are also joined tonight by Matthew Charles from Tennessee. In 1996, at age 30, Matthew was sentenced to 35 years for selling drugs and related offenses. Over the next two decades, he completed more than 30 Bible studies, became a law clerk, and mentored fellow inmates. Now, Matthew is the very first person to be released from prison under the First Step Act. Matthew, on behalf of all Americans: welcome home.

The federal exchange's homepage was updated with information about the special enrollment period Monday morning.
I am running because I see that sense of community is getting fractured, Klobuchar said on Sunday in Iowa. It's getting fractured by someone in the White House who gets up every morning and tweets whatever he wants but doesn't respect the amendment that allows him to do it.
Klobuchar's electability in Minnesota, which has largely come by taking more politically moderate positions, has some Democrats questioning whether the senator will be able to capture the imagination of a party that has drifted to the left nationally.
Stadtlander helps create one type of association health plan that is regulated by states and likely won't be affected by the new Trump administration rules.

But with Biden declaring there will be enough vaccines for 300 million Americans by the end of July, vaccine hesitancy -- not supply -- could soon become the defining pandemic hurdle.

Rather, Joe Biden -- carrying out the policy of the US government and its European allies -- threatened to deny a $1 billion loan guarantee to Ukraine unless it fired a prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, who was widely seen as corrupt or ineffective; there is no sign Biden tried to thwart the Burisma case. Also, there is no evidence Hunter Biden was ever himself under investigation. And it is not even clear that Shokin was carrying out the investigation into Burisma or its owner, Mykola Zlochevsky, at the time Joe Biden applied the pressure; Shokin's former deputy, Vitaliy Kasko, has said that the investigation was dormant at the time: There was no pressure from anyone from the US to close cases against Zlochevsky. It was shelved by Ukrainian prosecutors in 2014 and through 2015.
Kagan added that at times during her near 10-year tenure, she's emerged from a closed-door meeting with her fellow justices with an urge to ram my fist through a wall after they took an initial vote on a pending case.
Drug companies, however, do appear to have slowed the rate of price increases, perhaps in part because of Trump's Twitter bully pulpit. Pfizer temporarily walked back hikes in mid-2018 after Trump tweeted that it should be ashamed for raising prices and taking advantage of the poor. Pfizer ended up raising them the following January.
Facts First: To the contrary, Trump's call with Ukraine's President was the subject of widespread discussion among members of Congress and in the media at the time; it was a central focus of Democrats' impeachment push.
GLASSER: You know. I mean, hey, you know, CEO of Exxon and former Secretary of State. Think about the Bush funeral.
Except it didn't destroy Trump. For all the hand-wringing and predictions of doom for his campaign, he just kept right on going – first to the Republican presidential nomination and then to the White House. For many of his supporters, Trump's broadsides against McCain were music to their ears – finally someone was standing up to the political establishment in Washington! Trump wasn't afraid of slaughtering a sacred cow – or all the sacred cows! He didn't care! And they loved it.
Trump himself has not issued any attack ads on TV, though he's gone after candidates in short video clips on Instagram. But the brash billionaire has vowed to return fire with a flurry of negative ads if he comes under attack.
ROSSELLO: There's no comparison, really. Luckily For Irma we were very prepared. We executed our protocols appropriately, so much so that we were far ahead in the rebuilding process, that we were able to serve as a platform for other U.S. citizens that were stranded on the island. Unfortunately, of course, now we're feeling a second storm in two weeks, this one much more devastating than the first one. And now who knows what the damage will be? We are at about 60 percent out of electricity in Puerto Rico, and we should expect by the passage of the storm to be 100 percent out. Telecommunications are failing. But again, infrastructure can be fixed. Lives can't. CAMEROTA: We are looking of video right now of Fajardo, that
[08:10:00] And my biggest concern is, yes, we will feel the brunt of it for the next 12 hours, but afterwards we are going to get a lot of rain. And people might have a sense that they have gone through the worst part of it, but as we know with hurricanes, it's the flooding, it's the heavy rains that tend to be the number one cause of death.

GOP Rep. Bradley Byrne of Alabama said he was struggling with his vote.
RAFAEL ROMO, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Alisyn, let me show you what this hotel had to do to prevent catastrophic damage.

Thursday marked Clinton's first public interview since Election Day. The wide-ranging question-and-answer session was conducted by the New York Times' Nicholas Kristof. In front of a friendly audience at a packed auditorium at the Lincoln Center, Clinton was forthcoming about the parallel universe in which she had hoped to be president.
De todas las veces que podía ocurrir una pandemia, ¿tuvo que suceder justo durante el reinado de una administración que quiere reducir el gobierno a una fracción de su capacidad? ¿Tenía que venir bajo un presidente que no respeta la experiencia o las calificaciones esenciales, que se ha rodeado de personas cuyo talento principal es su capacidad para rendirle homenaje público?

Bloomberg also gave Sanders a fresh target: a real, live billionaire onstage to hammer when he spoke about income inequality.
It will be the first time the individual mandate, which requires nearly all Americans to have coverage or pay a penalty, will no longer be in effect. (Congress eliminated the penalty as part of the 2017 federal tax overhaul.) Advocates fear that even more insurers will exit the exchanges, which could leave some enrollees with no options to choose from -- or only more expensive ones.

You think about the ways in which government provided for the common good during the 1930s, '40s and '50s and in ways that built the White middle class.

Along with housing, food and transportation, health care is one of the largest retirement expenses, accounting for up to 15% of spending on average depending on the retiree's age, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics' Consumer Expenditure Survey.
Free market reforms, patient-centered, turning more and more of the decisions of insurance back to individuals and back to the states in terms of regulatory environment. All the essential health benefits. I mean, all these marked reforms that have caused premiums to double and triple those are things that need to be replaced with things that work, free market based reforms, Johnson said.
Increasing the number of insured Americans by strengthening the Affordable Care Act was at the heart of Biden's health care campaign promises. However, his two main measures -- creating a government-run public option and increasing Obamacare's federal premium subsidies -- will require Congress and face plenty of opposition.
Donald Trump necesita de los medios de comunicación. Atacar a los medios es parte de la razón por la que ganó. El odio a los medios de comunicación es una de las cosas que reunirá a sus tropas a su alrededor mientras intenta hacer su trabajo. Irónicamente, los medios también necesitan de Trump. Como el presidente ha dicho muchas veces, él es bueno para el rating.

The most recent impasse hinged on the ongoing debate over immigration. Democrats voted against a bill to fund the government because they want a fix for DACA, the program allowing some young illegal immigrants to remain in the US, before it expires in March. Republicans want border security enhancements, including funding for President Trump's border wall, before they'll agree to help fix DACA. After a shutdown of three days, Senate Democrats reached a compromise with Senate Republicans to reopen the government and keep it funded through February 8 in exchange for a promise to deal with DACA before then.
Biden has pledged to protect Roe v. Wade , the 1973 landmark Supreme Court decision legalizing abortion nationwide prior to viability, which can occur at around 24 weeks of pregnancy.

Scholars and students of the court lauded Monday's announcement, even as they questioned whether it would truly modernize.
14 million more people would be uninsured in 2018.
The Trump administration's outrageous decision tonight to sabotage open enrollment will mean coverage could cost more next year and insurers could drop out of the marketplace, said Kevin Counihan, former CEO of Healthcare.gov. Having health insurance is still law of the land. If the president and Republicans in Congress want to change that, they should come up with a plan and show it to the American people, rather than depriving Americans of the chance to sign up for coverage and financial assistance they remain eligible for.

None of this is to say that Hunter Biden's name was not a factor in the Burisma appointment; Hunter Biden has acknowledged that he would probably not have been asked to be on the board if he were not a Biden. But Trump's repeat portrayal of him as an unemployed man is inaccurate.

The flexibility states will be given under the bill is where to cut, how much to cut and who to cut, said Sabrina Corlette, research professor at Georgetown University's Health Policy Institute.

And if those votes weren't taken, it probably would have been a different result. So I was sort of affected by that, too. Not that I mind. In that case, it was the first time I've ever done it.

Three of the United States' closest allies, Britain, France and Germany, are all signatories to the Iran deal. In recent weeks leaders of these countries have all begged Trump to remain in the deal. These allies were even willing to negotiate amendments to the deal about issues such as Iran's ballistic missile program under the rubric fix it, don't nix it, but even that wasn't sufficient for Trump.
Florida Sen. Marco Rubio then pushed back against Bush, saying, The authorization that Barack Obama asked for was not against ISIS, it was against (Syrian President Bashar al-) Assad. John Kerry described it as attacks that would be unbelievably small. I don't think the United States should be engaged in symbolic military activity. It was not against ISIS, it was against Assad.
The President is a negative motivator for a majority of voters, according to the poll, with 54% saying they would be more apt to support a candidate who opposes President Trump. About a third (36%) say they're partial to supporting a candidate who backs the President. Those figures have shifted against Trump since the question was last asked in May (48% said they'd prefer an anti-Trump candidate in that poll, 43% a pro-Trump one).

KAYE: Do you want him to?
BUSH: Oh, sure. I mean, there is waste, fraud and abuse in the government. And we've laid out a detailed plan how to fix procurement, how to have fewer civilians in the Department of Defense. But you've got to increase spending if you're serious about restoring America's presence in the world.

Biden has now written a letter of apology because I did the right thing, Trump said.
In the last few days, the Warren campaign found itself in a back and forth with the Bernie team over his volunteer phone call talking points and what he allegedly said at a meeting over a year ago.

Facts First: The United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement was not been sitting on Pelosi's desk for 8 months before she agreed in December to have the Democrat-controlled House to pass it. Though the Trump administration had pushed Pelosi to persuade the House to quickly pass the agreement, it had not sent her any implementing legislation.
Certainly as you can imagine was very frightening. The good news is that for myself and for our crew, you know, we immediately got information because of the proximity to power were we were. I mean, we really were able to hear what was going on, but there's no question that the people who protect, when I say, the Capitol, the people protect us everyday because I'm here everyday were pretty remarkable. I mean they got a standing ovation on the House Floor and they deserved that and much, much more. Because Piers they ran to deal with this in a nanosecond, everybody is here working. The entire police force, nobody is taking off and they're not getting paid right now because of furloughs, because of this government shutdown. They did all of their heroic work today without a paycheck.

How Trump's health care loss will shape his presidency
Trump's remark about the funeral came as the President has continued to denigrate the dead senator's legacy.
Will he flip? He's been careful to respect the process.
Senate Republicans are in the process of overhauling the House bill, but they are also struggling to bridge the many divides within the party.
I think the President fails to understand this, but more importantly, in my own – from my own feeling, we need more compassion, we need more empathy, we need more togetherness in terms of working together. We don't need more bullying and I'm tired of it, she said.
So, it will be interesting to see if that happens. I wouldn't put it past him once Trump realizes -- and his tweet didn't suggest that, but I think he has to have realized that things are starting to look really bad for him.
One fact of US health care is that American doctors make more money than their counterparts in other countries. There are many reasons for that, but one clear way to contain the cost of health care is to contain the amount doctors are paid. Granted, they should have a much simpler time being reimbursed under a single-payer system and more of their time will be spent treating patients. But their bottom lines might also shrink. That's one reason some doctors could opt out. Hospitals too. In the current system, private insurance pays higher rates to hospitals and doctors than Medicare and Medicaid do.

Mike Bloomberg owns more wealth than the bottom 125 million Americans, Sanders said at one point.

DIAZ BARRAGAN: No, but we need to think about doing what's right and what's right for Virginians and what's right overall. I mean, the race issue in today's day and age with the president at the helm who has been one of the most divisive presidents and, frankly, racist himself, is a conversation we do need to have. But looking at just the line of order and saying we're not going to do that because of the consequence is not the right way to do this. And so for me, I would -- I do think we need to have this conversation and we should continue to have this conversation, but it has to be front and center. And we can't forget about the person who is dividing us and who himself is injecting this into the country to live up again and coming out again. We haven't seen it be this bad in recent time until the president has really made this a race issue whether it's about African-Americans, certainly he's doing it all over the board with immigrants, but we need to have this conversation.

People who get Medicare for All would not pay for any part of their health care except, in some cases, up to $200 for prescription drugs for individuals making more than $25,200 annually or families of four making more than $52,400 (200% of the federal poverty level in 2020). The average cost of drugs per person per year in the US is currently more than $1,000 for drugs bought at pharmacies, but the average out-of-pocket spending per person is only $144. However, the current costs are concentrated more on some people than others. This would spread those costs.
We must move to universal health care. And I am so proud of the work we did as a party to protect the Affordable Car Act, Klobuchar said Sunday. We are to the point now where Obamacare is more popular than the President.
The administration expects premiums for Obamacare plans to increase by 1% next year and by 5% in 2021 because of the shifts.
The former aide also speculated about why only a few Republicans have criticized Trump's comments, saying that it's likely because they don't want to get in the Twitter crosshairs.

The usual practice has been for the court to put an audio link on its website each Friday, useful for the historical record and legal followers, but not necessarily an exciting draw for the general public. Only for a few high-profile cases have the justices even released audio recordings on the same day as an argument.
The move opens up a new front in the Democratic debate over the future of health care, which has created divisions that have been laid bare in recent months as progressives in Congress make a strong push under the banner of Medicare-for-All – that is, ditching the private insurance system and the Obamacare exchanges in favor of universal coverage paid for through taxes.
He's finally going to stop illegal immigration and make sure our government puts American citizens first. Working families, working families are the lifeblood of our country. And we can't thrive as a nation unless they are thriving. A lot of them haven't seen a bigger paycheck in a very long time.

BASH: Senator Rubio, I know you want to get in. Hang on one second, I just want to follow up with Mr. Trump. You're talking about waste, fraud and abuse, but an independent bipartisan organization, the Committee For a Responsible Federal Budget, says improper payments like you're talking about, that would only save about $3 billion, but it would take $150 billion to make Social Security solvent. So how would you find that other $147 million?

The savings rate you should shoot for will depend on how much you've managed to tuck away already, how many years you have until you retire and how much income you'll need your nest egg to generate. But the standard recommendation of 15% or so a year isn't likely to do it.

Still, hypocrisy is the grease that often makes the wheels go 'round in the Senate. And Tanden also has lukewarm support from her own side. She was forced to try to make up with Sen. Bernie Sanders, a Vermont independent who caucuses with Democrats, who now chairs the Budget Committee and would be her principal contact. Sanders' supporters accused Tanden of being among Democratic elites who they believe stacked the party's nominating race against him and in favor of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in 2016.

But it would certainly be right to say a newly surfaced nearly 13-minute 60 Minutes II segment (remember that show?) proves the vast majority of Trump's political strategy, down to his exact criticism of John McCain, was very much formed nearly 20 years ago, back when he was selling a book, his name and a possible run for president.

I know I can be too tough sometimes and I can push too hard, she told MSNBC earlier this month. That is obvious. But a lot of it is I have high expectations for myself and I have high expectations for people who work with me.
On WNYC in March 2011, Sanders said a primary challenge to Obama would enliven the debate.
Sen. Rand Paul claimed the President-elect supports the Kentucky Republican's calls to approve an Obamacare replacement on the same day Congress repeals the health care law.
The right thing to do is to help the affected industries survive.
We also have a tradition of valuing choice in our health care system. That means that rather than having health care decisions dictated solely by the government, most Americans still have the final say over decisions about the care they receive. While government plays a significant role in our health care system, we have chosen to take a different approach than have many other countries, including democracies in Europe and Asia. The federal government doesn't impose price controls or engage in direct negotiations over price on most health care products and services. Indeed, in the parts of the health care system where competition thrives, the marketplace maximizes choices for consumers while holding down their costs.
One thing I want to emphasize is that every inch of the 100 miles that we have constructed is new border wall system, acting DHS chief Chad Wolf said in January. It's not so-called replacement wall, as some of our critics claimed. It is new wall.
The GOP's bill would get rid of the Obamacare requirement that people have health coverage or face a tax penalty. It would also eliminate the mandate that employers with at least 50 employees provide health insurance to their workers.
DRUCKER: Republicans had to make a choice. Were they going to take tough votes and govern and pass something imperfect that is the only legislation that passes on anything or will they make the perfect the enemy of the good? It's a cliche, but if you need to pass something being you need to make a choice. The House Freedom Caucus which disrupted the Republican House majority's ability to do anything when President Obama was in power after the health care failure understood he was going to be either a session of failure with nothing to show for it or have to ban and compromise with their own principals and do something and hope it worked out.
Quote: A real trial has witnesses, a real trial has documents, a real trial has cross-examination, but because of Senator McConnell's rules, we're not really in a real trial.
When a judge put a nationwide hold on his plan to halt immigration from certain majority-Muslim countries, Trump cast blame for anything bad that might happen in that period personally on the judge who made the order.
As much as he publicly laments the country's debt, Donald Trump offers nothing in the way of substantive policy proposals to reform either Medicare or Social Security, beyond promising that he will not curb spending on them.
A person close to Trump vowed Trump will only ramp up his actions on trade – still searching to make good in bold fashion on Trump's campaign rhetoric.
...when I was hearing the amount of people that died with flu, I was shocked to hear it. Anywhere from 27,000 to 70,000 or 77,000. And I guess they said, in 1990, that was in particular very bad; it was higher than that. -- March 6 exchange with reporters after tour of the Centers for Disease Control of Prevention
And you know, again, Charlie Dent just said it. If you're the party making the demand, you are the party that usually loses. Just look back to what happened one year ago when Democrats were saying we're going to shut down the government until we get a fix for DREAMers. LEMON: Yes.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. CHRIS STEWART (R), UTAH: We have to have a relationship with some players that we don't agree with. Journalists disappear all over the country. Twenty journalists have been killed in Mexico. You don't think it's happened in Turkey and China? Of course, it does. Yet, we have to have a relationship with these individuals or countries.
Right now in the Texas court – probably ends up in the Supreme Court, Trump told reporters on Friday. But we're doing something right now that will be much less expensive than Obamacare for the people.
Instead, he is going out of his way to talk to people in the Trump administration, about what? Like what are they talking about? Are they talking about a pardon? Are they talking about secrets that they didn't want the attorneys to know? You know, that is the obvious implication to me. So there's a lot of interesting questions raised here as to what he is talking about and why.
Facts First: Trump's claims were comprehensively inaccurate. Energy-efficient modern dishwashers do not require people to press buttons 10 times or 12 times to start them. More importantly, those modern dishwashers use less water and electricity than older dishwashers, not more.
A Klobuchar aide told CNN on Monday that the senator prepared for the town hall like she would for a major interview.
Those Republicans voting against a challenge:
According to the Federal Reserve , the combined wealth of the top 1% of American households increased 18% from the fourth quarter of 2016 to the third quarter of 2019 -- from $29.18 to $34.53 trillion. The combined wealth of the bottom 50% of households increased 55%, but from a much smaller starting point -- from $1.08 trillion to $1.67 trillion -- and spread out across many more households.
Warren opened her town hall by keeping up her attacks on Bloomberg for refusing to release women who have signed nondisclosure agreements at his company, saying they should be able to tell their stories.
[14:10:00] So, with Mitt Romney, I'd love him to be a team player. Possibly he won't be. I'm surprised he acted so quickly. I gave him an endorsement, I was happy that he won in Utah. I have great popularity in Utah. I love the people of Utah. I did something for them that nobody else would have done, that had to do with their parks opinion woo we did that for a very special person who is now going to be retiring after 42 years, a great friend, a great senator, who is really a spectacular plan and also for Mike Lee, who really pressed it very hard. So, Orrin Hatch and Mike Lee. And the people of Utah, we did that for a very special person who is now going to be retiring after 42 years, a great friend, a great senator, who is really a spectacular plan and also for mike lee, who really pressed it very hard. So, Orrin Hatch and Mike Lee. And the people of Utah really appreciate what I did for him. Hundreds and hundreds of miles of park that they'll be able to now use as opposed to not. And so, I was surprised at Mitt Romney. But I just hope he's going to be a team player. If he's a team player, that will be great. I will say this, if he fought really hard against President Obama like he does against me, he would have won the election. Does that make sense to you?

MADDEN: Well, if you talk to folks in both camps, probably Cruz and Rubio camps, they'll tell you that the money is coming in, that they feel that they have enough of the resources that they need to go on and take Donald Trump on.
It wasn't about the policy, the official told CNN. It didn't matter what policy we made because they (the Freedom Caucus) didn't want a deal. We were captives in an internal House caucus fight. The Freedom Caucus had too much interest in killing this to send a message to Speaker Ryan: 'You have too much power.'
Bloomberg, who called Trump's prior assertions to protect those with pre-existing conditions a broken promise in the ad, responded on Twitter that the President should ask the Justice Department to drop the lawsuit.
Trump was dishonest both about matters pertaining to the coronavirus pandemic and about his usual array of other topics, from trade with China to his rally crowds. Here is a preliminary list -- which doesn't even include all of the inaccuracies:
But when Mitt gave his tax returns, just so you understand, it was about six months from now in 2012. It was exactly September 21. And that's when he gave his tax return. We're in a different world.
Meghan McCain on Monday continued her fierce pushback against President Donald Trump, who over the weekend revived his long-running feud with her father, the late Sen. John McCain.
Many of our laws, particularly Obamacare, make healthcare coverage more expensive for small businesses than large companies, said Labor Secretary Alexander Acosta. AHPs are about more choice, more access, and more coverage.
Wall Street could also live with other moderates still in the running, including billionaire Michael Bloomberg, former Indiana mayor Pete Buttigieg and Senator Amy Klobuchar.
But -- I mean but, again, as you said, why not just go? I mean this is -- this is democracy. And you're seeing -- we were talking a little bit during the break, you're seeing senators, in particular, doing other things. Rob Portman's staff sent out a notice today that showed rob Portman, you know, hugging people during a parade and how well liked Rob Portman is. But then they mentioned that he was visiting centers for people who were dealing with opioid abuse. He's having a roundtable. They're choosing these smaller events that still allows them to talk to people -- and it's not like they are locking themselves in their office -- but aren't necessarily exposing them to the free-for-alls that some of these town halls have become.
Facts First: There was no exchange in which Schumer, the Democrats' Senate leader, said, Uh, uh, sort of when asked if he knows the contents of Trump's China deal, or that he conceded he merely thinks he knows what's in it. Also, the deal does : There was no exchange in which Schumer, the Democrats' Senate leader, said, Uh, uh, sort of when asked if he knows the contents of Trump's China deal, or that he conceded he merely thinks he knows what's in it. Also, the deal does reduce , though not eliminate, some of the US tariffs on imported Chinese products.
But the impeachment argument is questionable for several reasons. First, the most visible public official dismissing the seriousness of the coronavirus threat was the President himself.
In addition to Time, Time Inc. owns Fortune, Money, Sports Illustrated and In Style, among other titles as well as People, the most profitable title in the entire magazine industry.
This isn't just about the specter of the President potentially attempting to assert free rein over the outlay of taxpayer-funded relief. American lives are at stake. The health of our economy -- not just Wall Street winnings, but the livelihoods of tens of millions of Americans, and our basic ability to put food on our tables and care for our families -- is at risk.
Like its broadcast counterparts, cable news has at times seen the amount of time it devoted to health care drop off amid the secrecy of the drafting process and the demands of other news.
How did these funds for this dam in Kentucky, how did they get attached, and does that concern you at all?
Obama repeatedly urged NATO allies to spend more. If we've got a collective defense, it means that everybody's got to chip in, and I've had some concerns about a diminished level of defense spending among some of our partners in NATO, Obama said in 2014. The situation in Ukraine reminds us that our freedom isn't free and we've got to be willing to pay for the assets, the personnel, the training that's required to make sure that we have a credible NATO force and an effective deterrent force.
SAM KILEY, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, there has been, whether directly to this, it's difficult to say, but the Turks announced that they would like -- they are going to issue arrest warrants for the former deputy head of intelligence, General Asiri and Mohammed bin Salman's right-hand man in the palace, particularly when it comes to media issues, Saud Qahtani, both relieved of their positions but neither of whom in the Saudi investigation have been accused or charged. Unlike a number of others who have been and, indeed, the Saudi prosecutor has said that they could face the death penalty for the alleged murder of Jamal Khashoggi.
The trade deals he touted, like those with China, Mexico and Canada , are far less sweeping than his extravagant claims.
Trump has repeatedly promised to protect those with pre-existing conditions, even as he has sought to kill the Affordable Care Act, which greatly expanded those safeguards.
On breaking through to voters as Trump dominates the headlines
BASH: Thank you Mr. Trump. Let's refocus this back on Cuba.
BERMAN: Gary Cohn, call your office right now, because you might be getting a call from Florida shortly.
But in the decade since the Affordable Care Act became law, elements of it -- such as requirements that insurers cover those with pre-existing conditions -- have become popular, turning health care politics in Democrats' favor.
After coming close to unseating him in the 2018 primary , Marie Newman defeated Lipinski on Tuesday amid a coronavirus pandemic that has caused several states to postpone their primaries. With 97% of precincts reporting in the district, Newman had 47.6% of the vote to Lipinski's 44.1%.
Pondría una moratoria sobre las deportaciones, acabaría con las redadas del Servicio de Inmigración y Control de Aduanas, detendría la construcción del muro en la frontera entre Estados Unidos y México, terminaría con las separaciones familiares y cerraría centros de detención con fines de lucro.
Adams is joined by Michelle Jones, a Fight for $15 activist. Bubbly with a big smile, the 28-year-old said she could barely afford to eat after paying her bills and bus fare on her $7.25 an hour wage at McDonald's.
There are some success stories in the country's pandemic response and in places where the vaccine is being delivered well. Here in New York, for example, I got my first vaccine shot and it was Air Force personnel who were delivering the shots and it was FEMA that had set up the site and it was on the grounds of a public community college. That is a beautiful thing, seeing our government do its job to help people who absolutely couldn't help themselves.
The Utah Republican Party signaled support in a statement Monday for both Romney, who voted to convict Trump, and Utah's Sen. Mike Lee, who voted to acquit.

THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.
Trump accused Democrats of seizing on the coronavirus, as examples of community transmission start to be discovered in the United States, as their latest hoax to damage him.
KAYE: You don't think his too conservative for Texas?
I am running because I see that sense of community is getting fractured, Klobuchar said on Sunday in Iowa. It's getting fractured by someone in the White House who gets up every morning and tweets whatever he wants but doesn't respect the amendment that allows him to do it.
But, you know, Burr hasn't exactly been a rabid partisan on this. Until the last couple of weeks, he's been working very closely with the Democrats. So, why do you think he's wrong?
The vast majority of the rules package was adopted on Thursday but in a largely party-line vote, with only three Republicans joining Democrats to pass it. That's because the package backs Democratic priorities, such as defending Obamacare in court and creating a select committee on climate change.
Now the Texas judge's decision centers round the individual coverage mandate which requires all Americans to get health insurance or pay a penalty. Congress effectively eliminated that penalty as part of the 2017 tax cut bill. Now the judge is saying that mandate is unconstitutional. So the entire law, he says, is invalid.
Ivanka Trump está impulsando un programa de asistencia familiar y de cuidado de niños por 25.000 millones de dólares que podría estar más en línea con la ortodoxia demócrata que con la republicana. No muchos legisladores republicanos llegaron a Washington haciendo campaña para agregar derechos. Pero el qué hacer con el proyecto favorito de la primera hija podría ser un tema delicado para los republicanos del Congreso que quieren mantener buenas relaciones con el presidente.
The associations could provide an attractive alternative to Obamacare for some people, especially younger and healthier consumers. This is particularly true because it would be easier for sole proprietors to join these plans.
So she -- she's made herself a laughingstock. I think the longer that she's out there, the more that people are going to be talking about this. And -- and it's just -- it's clear that, you know, she's somebody who can't be trusted.
From February through May, the nightly broadcasts on ABC, CBS and NBC devoted a total of 204 minutes to the effort in the House of Representatives to repeal and replace Obamacare, according to Andrew Tyndall, who monitors the network news coverage. That was less time than the networks spent covering the alleged Russian election interference (238 minutes), but more time than given to the news of the investigation into and firing of former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn (135 minutes).
Not all Biden's nominees slipped into trouble on Monday.
Without Sinema, the Senate cannot pass the relief bill, even using the budget process that allows them to pass it with just 51 votes.
Do you think Donald Trump knows what he's talking about?
ROSSELLO: So now our efforts, you know, obviously still within the warning signs and danger making sure that people are safe, saving life. But immediately after that, start rebuilding Puerto Rico stronger than ever.
LEMON: -- that Trump is how he is connected to Russia in these filings.
On Tuesday, she offered a preview of what might be coming.
Trump decided to bring his stump style to the national debate stage and Hillary Clinton responded more combatively than in the first debate.
Trump appears on the set of The Celebrity Apprentice with two of his children -- Donald Jr. and Ivanka -- in 2009.
HARLOW: All right, speaking of sports, that's President Trump's topic de jure, just a day after appearing to clearly endorse Roy Moore. Why a pivot to the feud, the ongoing feud with the father of that UCLA basketball player? Much more of that, ahead.
We want to finish it up. The 5.6 billion approved by the House is such a small amount compared to the level of the problem. When you see the Democrats want to give away $12 billion extra, and we are giving way 54 billion in foreign aid, so we give away money to other countries but not to our own country. It's another thing I've been complaining about. It's unfair when we give money to Guatemala and Honduras and El Salvador and they do nothing to us. When we give money to Pakistan, $1.3 billion, I ended that. A lot of people don't know it, because they haven't been fair to us. We want to have a great relationship with Pakistan, but they house the enemy, they take care of the enemy. We just can't do that. So, I look forward to meeting with the folks from -- and the new leadership in Pakistan, we'll be doing that in the not-too-distant future. I ended the 1.3 billion we paid, it's like water, we just do it. And I ended the money to countries that don't even vote for us in the United Nations. We give them billions and they don't even vote for us in the United Nations. It's not all about the rich countries because the rich countries really do take advantage of us because they pay a very small percentage of their military and they cheat on trade. They take advantage of us on trade. Other than that, they're wonderful, OK.
Facts First: While Page 8 of Sanders' While Page 8 of Sanders' bill does not specifically mention the figure cited by Klobuchar, it states that it shall be unlawful for ... a private health insurer to sell health insurance coverage that duplicates the benefits provided under this Act. And the Klobuchar's figure is close to the latest number provided by one study. Some 153 million people are covered by private plans sponsored by their employers, according to the latest report from the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation.
TRUMP: I know but how -- how he criticized --
Despite what many skeptics believe, Ryan on Tuesday said after a speech before the National Association of Manufacturers that he's confident there will be a tax reform bill on the floor this fall and passage by the end of the year.
what it was like on the floor when the rnc turned on ted cruz origwx allee_00003308.jpg
If we're going to stop bankrupting our kids and grandkids, you've got to be willing to take on the lobbyists, which means not just some fanciful waste, fraud and abuse, but specifying these are the programs I'll eliminate so that we can take care of the hard working taxpayer.
McConnell already spent two months trying to hammer out a health care deal with his conference in endless private meetings and exhaustive lunches. In the end, the only thing he could offer was a skinny repeal that did away with Obamacare's mandates and temporarily repealed the medical device tax. McConnell's closing argument was simply to pass something so that Republicans senators could go to conference with the House. That wasn't enough.
He also dug into McCain's now-famous vote against a repeal of the Affordable Care Act.
Well, back to the debate, Donald Trump was the bull's-eye in CNN's GOP debate last night. Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz hitting the Republican front-runner hard. So how does Donald Trump think he did? Trump's self-assessment next on NEW DAY.
A person close to Trump vowed Trump will only ramp up his actions on trade – still searching to make good in bold fashion on Trump's campaign rhetoric.
LEE: Trump volvió a ser el populista nacionalista de la campaña presidencial del 2016
COOPER: We -- Gloria and David stick around. I want to get there take in a moment on Senate Republicans fighting any Obama Supreme Court appointee and what the president can do about it.
LEMON: Well, I got to go because, you know, we got a lot of show.
The 45 percent is a threat that if they don't behave, if they don't follow the rules and regulations so that we can have it equal on both sides, we will tax you. It doesn't have to be 45, it could be less. But it has to be something because our country and our trade and our deals and most importantly our jobs are going to hell.
«El presupuesto propuesto por el presidente nunca ha tenido apoyo en el Senado o en la Cámara, de modo que la idea de que esto impone recortes no es verdadera», aseguró Cornyn sobre la propuesta presidencial de presupuesto a finales de marzo. «Dependerá de nosotros trabajar en ello y me atrevo a decir justo después de votar para que se incrementen los fondos de los Institutos Nacionales de Salud en el proyecto de ley de Curas del siglo 21, que sería difícil obtener los votos para luego recortar el programa».
Meredith wanted to buy Time Inc. back in 2012, but didn't want Time magazine, former Time editor Richard Stengel tweeted early Monday. The difference now is the Koch brothers' money. Even though they won't have a seat on the board, hard to imagine they won't influence the editorial side.
Yet nine months before Election Day, history places the Trump economy squarely in territory consistent with winning another term.
Facts First: It's not true that household income gains under Trump have already hit $10,000 in less than three years. A firm called Sentier Research found pre-tax income gains of about $5,500 between January 2017 and October 2019.
On the health insurance front, the incoming administration is expected to reinstitute guidance that states cannot bar Medicaid funds from going to qualified providers that also provide abortion-related services, such as Planned Parenthood. Medicaid funding does not cover abortions, except in cases of rape, incest or when the woman's life is at risk, due to the 1976 Hyde Amendment.
SCARAMUCCI: Those are the x's and o's right there.
How exactly that will come to be – and whether it will be a blessing or a curse for Republicans in 2020 – is still unclear.
Karkkainen said highway might well have a higher failure rate than other kinds of projects, given how complex and politically controversial they can be, but it's still not true that most are rejected.
SANDERS: We'll continue to keep you guys updated on his August schedule as those details are finalized.
Another factor that could determine the path and speed at which lawmakers act is the health of the economy, said John Hudak, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. If the nation's jobs report in early February shows a continued deterioration of the labor market , for instance, Congress may be spurred to move faster and approve more assistance.
– House Speaker John Boehner, responding to the idea that Democratic leadership saw the shutdown as a win. Bonus points for slamming his newspaper down as he said it
Data suggest that more affordable healthcare options are needed - especially for those forgotten women and men who are not eligible to have their premiums reduced by tax credits. — Administrator Seema Verma (@SeemaCMS) April 3, 2018
DOMINGO CAAL, GRANDFATHER OF GIRL WHO DIED IN U.S. CUSTODY: I'm not going to speak that much because I can barely take it. It's difficult for us. This happened because we are very much in need. The girl would jump in happiness that she would get to go to the United States, very happy and content. But she didn't know. For us it's very difficult.
TAPPER: So, this puts you and your philosophy at odds with President Trump.
The calculation here in South Korea has always been slightly different from the U.S. They've got artillery pieces right on the DMZ, right near Seoul and any conflict could be a massive disaster for this country. So they tend to push, at least with this new administration, towards dialogue. But with Kim Jong-un continuing to provoke, continuing to progress that missile system, very little dialogue will come from the South Koreans any time soon.
At each state, the vice president, in his role as the president of the Senate, will call to ask if there are any objections. If there is an objection it will have to come from one senator and one member of the House and be turned over in writing. At that point, the joint session breaks up, and both chambers debate separately for up to two hours. They will then vote on the objection and resume the joint session.
And just like he did in 2016, President Trump is making the wall a central part of his 2020 reelection campaign. He held a rally this past week in El Paso, Texas, and displayed signs reading Finish that wall, even though no new wall has been built.
We are joined tonight by one of those law enforcement heroes: ICE Special Agent Elvin Hernandez. When Elvin was a boy, he and his family legally immigrated to the United States from the Dominican Republic. At the age of eight, Elvin told his dad he wanted to become a Special Agent. Today, he leads investigations into the scourge of international sex trafficking. Elvin says: If I can make sure these young girls get their justice, I've done my job. Thanks to his work and that of his colleagues, more than 300 women and girls have been rescued from horror and more than 1,500 sadistic traffickers have been put behind bars in the last year.
And one of the things that this sort of begins to fill in some of the details of, that has always puzzled us, is that in the e-mails setting up that June 2016 Trump Tower meeting --
The most absurd false claim: Trump's lying
Second, there's a technical move in the bond market in the past signaled a slowing economy or recession, it's called an inverted yield curve. That scared the stock market, too.
Association plans also could try to cherry pick small businesses with younger and healthier staffers by charging very high premiums or offering skimpier benefits to firms with older and sicker workers or those with more women, who tend to use more health care services.
If lawmakers don't act, Social Security's trust fund will be tapped out in about 18 years.
BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: This is another example of Governor Romney hiding positions he's been campaigning on for a year and a half.
Here tonight is Debra Bissell. Just three weeks ago, Debra's parents, Gerald and Sharon, were burglarized and shot to death in their Reno, Nevada, home by an illegal alien. They were in their eighties and are survived by four children, 11 grandchildren, and 20 great-grandchildren. Also here tonight are Gerald and Sharon's granddaughter, Heather, and great‑granddaughter, Madison.
I am deeply concerned about what went on with Russia, Clinton said at the Women in the World summit in New York City. A foreign power meddled with our election and did so in a way that we are learning more about every single day.
I want to build on the momentum that we saw here in 2018, Klobuchar told reporters Saturday in Wisconsin. No one ever thought that the Democrats were going to be able (to defeat) Gov. Walker, but we did it, and we did it in a smart, Wisconsin way with a grassroots campaign with (Democratic Sen.) Tammy Baldwin at the top of the ticket, and we can do it in the presidential, as well.
Joining me now to discuss this and much more, the third-ranking Republican in the House, Conference Chair Liz Cheney. The congresswoman joins us from Casper, Wyoming.
REP. RANDY NEUGEBAUER (R), TEXAS: How do you look at them and how do you deny them access? I don't get that.
TRUMP: Well, if Ted was listening, he would have heard me say something very similar. I said we would not do the deal unless it was going to be a very good deal for us. And I think I said it loud and I think I said it very clear. And I think after 50 years, and I have many friends, I own many properties in Miami, many, many, and I have many people that know and they feel exactly the way I do, make a deal, it would be great, but it's got to be a great deal for the United States, not a bad deal for the United States. As far as Iran is concerned, I would have never made that deal. That is one of the worst deals ever, ever made by this country. It is a disaster. So for Ted to say I agree with this deal, I mean, it's a staple in my speeches that that may he worst single deal I've ever seen negotiated. So don't try to put it on me like it's wonderful, like I love it.
She's losing her parents to QAnon. Listen to her plea
Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-Connecticut, who is a Hillary Clinton supporter, told reporters that Sanders has tapped into the struggle of the middle class. That message, along with that of the other Democratic candidates' focus on jobs and wages, is in contrast to the sideshow and a circus and nothing but name-calling on the Republican side.
Trump: I never was a fan of McCain, I never will be
Thursday provided another reminder of just how cramped the news cycle can get in the age of Trump. Early in the afternoon, coverage of the Senate health care bill gave way to a different development: Trump's declaration that he did not, despite his previous suggestions, have recordings of his conversations with Comey.
COOPER: David, how do you see it? Are you surprised the lack of negotiations, the lack of movement?
Hurricane Maria Hits Puerto Rico; Interview with Governor of Puerto Rico Ricardo Rossello; Interview with FEMA Administrator Brock Long. Death Toll Soars to 216 in Mexico Earthquake; Interview with Senator Bill Cassidy of Louisiana. Aired 8-8:30a ET
I know I can be too tough sometimes and I can push too hard, she told MSNBC earlier this month. That is obvious. But a lot of it is I have high expectations for myself and I have high expectations for people who work with me.
We passed a health care bill that does absolutely nothing to fix the big health care problems in this country. It is just a disgrace, said Bloomberg at the Dartmouth Presidential Lecture in 2010. The President, in all fairness, started out by pointing out what the big problems were, but then turned it over to Congress, which didn't pay any attention to any of those big problems and just created another program that's going to cost a lot of money.
Health was also the top issue for Democratic, independent and swing voters, according to a Kaiser Family Foundation poll from mid-February. For Republican voters, health care came lower down the list -- beaten out by the economy, immigration and foreign policy/national security.
Quite frankly, I think he's flat-out lied about saying that the reason he went after -- the reason he made the strike was because our embassies were about to be bombed, Biden said.
You've - in the - in the context of illegal immigration, you've called for basically putting off any legalization process until we get the border secured.
Klobuchar, who announced her presidential campaign during a snowy outdoor event in Minneapolis earlier this month, is the third potential presidential hopeful to appear at a CNN town hall. Sen. Kamala Harris appeared at an event hosted by Jake Tapper and former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz, who is considering an independent bid for the presidency, headlined a town hall hosted by Poppy Harlow.
The scope of Bloomberg's campaign was most apparent in American Samoa, the only contest the billionaire won during his short-lived campaign. Bloomberg had an astonishing seven staffers on the South Pacific island, more than the six total national delegates the US territory will award and more than Biden's campaign had on the ground in Virginia.
On Tuesday, Trump falsely accused McCain of misleading the White House over how he would vote.
Sometimes, this version of Trump appears fragile and out of control, prone to emotional and impulsive reactions, and seems lonely in the White House. Wolff also claims Trump never really wanted the job of President at all.
But he said then-Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid resorted to that rule change – forced over the objections of Republicans – because Republicans, led by then-Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, were blocking President Barack Obama's picks to the DC Circuit Court of Appeals.
Klobuchar's primary pitch to voters is likely to be electability. The Democrat has been notably successful in Minnesota, winning her three terms in the Senate by an average of 26 percentage points. Klobuchar won re-election in 2018 with 60% of the vote, two years after Trump came within two points of defeating Hillary Clinton in the state.

German conglomerate Siemens (SIEGY) said Monday that it plans to sell shares in its health care division -- Siemens Healthineers -- in the first half of the year. It will retain a majority stake.
Of his six most recent predecessors, each one who avoided an economic downturn in the last half of his first term won reelection. Only Bill Clinton and Trump, so far, avoided any brush with recession at all.
COOPER: Right. Initially I thought, well, maybe it's -- you know, it's -- maybe they're in contact with Sean Smith's wife who is I guess in the Netherlands. But she was at this reception. They clearly talked to her.
As always, when it comes to Obamacare and taxes seek the aid of a tax professional.
Adopt some of Donald Trump's frankness in talking about issues, not in the lens of being conservative or ideological but just straight to the voters, because that's appealing right now. And as race to deal about adopting to what the voters want without mimicking the worst of his tactics.
Graham and Trump haven't always had the most stable relationship. During the election, the two sparred often when they ran against each other for the Republican nomination – with Graham eventually endorsing Trump for the presidency.
BLITZER: He's not just attacking you. He's attacking, as you point out, Marco Rubio as well. And at that Republican presidential --
The Trump administration is giving insurers a few more weeks to revise their Obamacare rate requests for 2018.
The comment elicited nervous laughter from the audience as it realized Walker was referring to the health care decision.
Trump has worked to undermine the Affordable Care Act from his first day in office, when he issued an executive order directing agencies to interpret its regulations as loosely as possible. He championed congressional Republicans' bills that year that would have weakened the law's protections -- which are among its most popular provisions and helped Democrats retake the House of Representatives in 2018.
We gather here to mourn the passing of American greatness, the real thing, not cheap rhetoric from men who will never come near the sacrifice he gave so willingly, nor the opportunistic appropriation of those who live lives of comfort and privilege while he suffered and served, McCain said at the time.
Governor Snyder describes it as a win-win for all sides; more people are receiving health care benefits, and there is a 44% drop in uncompensated care days at hospitals around the state. Michigan now has 646,745 people signed up for Healthy Michigan, despite only expecting 470,000 to enroll.
The Republican senator from South Carolina, who has previously fought with Trump, tweeted a story from CNN on Republicans not ready to back Trump just yet – and revealed he intended to support the President.
He's going to make that decision this week, White House counselor Kellyanne Conway said on Fox News Sunday. And that's a decision that only he can make.
So, this rule gave bureaucrats virtually unlimited authority to regulate stock tanks, drainage ditches, and isolated ponds as navigable waterways and navigable water. You believe that? Sometimes, you'd have a puddle -- a little puddle. And they'd consider that a lake. -- January 19 speech to the American Farm Bureau Federation
CARPENTER: Yeah, I do. Just because there's been so much pressure on both Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio to stop fighting each other and take on Donald Trump.
Number one, we need to negotiate trade deals protecting American workers first, not the corporate board room. Number two, we need to lift the regulations on American businesses here so we see jobs coming back. And number three, we need a tax plan like the tax plan I've introduced that will not tax exports and that will tax imports, and that will bring millions of high-paying jobs back to America.
Another provision: If the state spends less than the block grant amount, it gets to keep 50% of the federal share of those savings.
Just a day earlier, Marc Short, Vice President Mike Pence's chief of staff and the former White House legislative affairs director, claimed on CNN that the President will be putting forward plans this year to replace Obamacare through Congress.
So far, White House officials have argued the midterms will not be a referendum on Trump.

The third principle echoed musings familiar from President Donald Trump's own statements in the past: a potential plan to change the rules governing how and where insurance companies sell their plans.
Klobuchar is markedly more centrist than many of the other Democrats running for President, including some of her colleagues in the Senate. Klobuchar has a liberal voting record, but she does not support abolishing the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency or Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders' Medicare-for-all bill – instead pushing to lower the age when people are allowed to buy into the government health care program.

All right. Up next, we're going to hear from the family of a 7-year- old migrant girl who died in U.S. custody. And what U.S. officials are saying about how exactly this tragedy happened.
I think that's a good idea we can agree on. I think the effective tax rate for corporations in this country is between 15 percent and say, 20 percent. A number of companies do pay 35 percent. That's not very competitive with the rest of the world. So to the extent that we can bring -- ratchet down a bit is good.
CANDY CROWLEY, CNN CHIEF POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, it's messaging. I mean, call it what you want. The amount of work being done in Washington to get something settled is inversely proportion to the number of news conferences and times people appeared on camera. So we had nothing but that this week, which means, as Dana told you, nothing is happening behind the scenes.
And I have been to Iowa, New Hampshire, and we're going to Nevada and South Carolina in the next couple of weeks. Connie and I go -- Connie and I go together.
During the the most recent round of immigration debate in the House, Trump publicly supported an immigration bill, then reversed on which immigration plan he supported. He appeared to change position several times and Republican members of Congress were dumbfounded.

So they said, 'Trump stayed in Syria. Trump stayed.' So people said to me, 'Why are you staying in Syria?' Because I kept the oil. Which frankly, we should have done in Iraq, OK, a long time ago. You have no idea the things and the decisions I've seen. So they say, 'Trump stayed in Syria,' I didn't pull out. I did pull out. We have the oil really secure. -- January 14 campaign rally in Milwaukee, Wisconsin
Pat Smith did not speak about anyone's political agenda tonight. She is, however, bitterly, bitterly disappointed with the State Department, the Defense Department and the White House tonight. You're going to hear shortly about how the State Department is going to respond to her charges.
Then I read when we pull out, Russia is thrilled. You know why they're not happy? Because this be and we're killing ISIS also for Iran. And just while we're on Iran because people don't like to write the facts. Iran is a much different country than it was when I became President. Iran when I became President, I had a meeting at the Pentagon with lots of generals, they were like for a pry, better looking than Tom Cruz and stronger. I've had more I said this is the greatest room I've ever seen. I saw more computer boards than I think that they make today.
So I'm nervous. What's fortunate is the Supreme Court I think does care about the opinion of the American people. The American people have spoken. They believe that protecting people with pre-existing conditions against insurance market discrimination is a key contribution of this law. And indeed it is.
This happened when I was governor, the first time a bill came to my desk that related to life, I could not sign a bill that would take away human life. I came down to the side of life every single instance as governor of Massachusetts. I was awarded by the Massachusetts Citizens for Life with a leadership award for my record.
3. More hints from the Fed?: U.S. central banker Janet Yellen is scheduled to give a speech at 8:30 a.m. ET at a Federal Reserve conference about the economic futures of kids and communities.
BLITZER: A.B., how did they do it in the Senate. Two or three or four or five Senators who had serious concerns, but all of a sudden, once the House passes it, there will be a debate. It will pass. Mike Pence is there and if there is a tie, and I suspect there won't be, he is the president of the Senate and he can break the tie. The president may get this bill even though there were a handful of Republican who seriously thought of killing it.
The GOP effort to gut the Affordable Care Act stalled last year and, despite ongoing and occasionally successful efforts to undermine it, seems stuck in place. At least through the coming midterms. In the budget, though, the White House calls for a two-part approach to repealing and replacing the law that begins with passing legislation modeled closely after the Graham-Cassidy-Heller-Johnson bill – one that, just a few months back, was killed by Republicans before it could hit the Senate floor.
Now here's the good news. We've created associations, millions of people are joining associations. Millions. That were formerly in Obamacare or didn't have insurance. Or didn't have health care. Millions of people, he said in an interview with the New York Times. It could be as high as 50%. You watch. So that's a big thing.

«El presidente Trump y los republicanos pueden usar una retórica más calmada y aparentar moderación, pero sabemos que las palabras se las lleva el viento, son las acciones las que importan», concluyó.
BALDWIN: I'm trying to follow your logic. You're basically showing a parallel in that we're talking about the president of the United States saying one thing, and his press secretary sort of saying another, and a lawyer saying another, and that's just like the dysfunctional Congress who says one thing to us on TV and another to the constituents? Are you equating the two?
En la entrevista, Boehner repite muchos de los mismos ataques que usó el mes pasado cuando le pidió a su sucesor, Paul Ryan, a buscar la nominación republicana.
And we've almost forgotten how to add this up and I think what Susan said about how we're blessed with this justice system is really true. We've got somebody keeping track of it all, because you need a team of attorneys to follow this President's craziness, and not only the lies, but also the suggestion of crimes, because we now have with the paperwork related to Michael Cohen. A very strong suggestion that the President participated in criminal activity.

For example, in 2016, the Fish and Wildlife Service touted four civil settlements over the previous 18 months that resulted in commitments from wind companies to pay $55,000 in penalties and to spend a minimum of $1.86 million over three years on research and development of avian detection and deterrent technologies. Duke Energy agreed in a 2013 plea agreement with the Justice Department to pay $1 million in fines to conservation groups and to come up with a plan to avoid bird deaths in the future.
Donald Trump, with his campaign on the ropes, came out swinging. He made a few solid points, especially on reforming the tax code, but otherwise seemed irritated and irritable, in a continuation of the meltdown that began after a leaked video on Friday showed him making lewd comments about women.
For voters overall, 26% said health care was the most important issue in deciding their vote for president, narrowly beating the economy, at 23%. Concerns over the two are likely to overlap as the death toll from the coronavirus rises alongside jobless numbers.
BASH: How do you feel about the marginal tax rate on the super rich? Should that also be increased?
Obama seemed to be referencing his own experience and calling back to an old chestnut about how the awesome power of the presidency can subdue, or reorient, its occupant. Not so for Trump, who has carried on during his first year in the Oval Office pretty much as he did on the stump in 2015 and 2016.
...the people that made these trade deals, it's like, where did they come? Like the one in Korea, that was a Hillary Clinton special. She said this will produce 250,000 new jobs, and I said, well, what happened? He said, well, she was right except it was for South Korea, not for us. So it produced 250,000 jobs for South Korea. -- December 18 campaign rally in Battle Creek, Michigan
Pelosi gave a nod to the single-payer health care model, saying it was a very popular idea but said Democrats came together on another approach with Obamacare and touted that 18 million more Americans now have health insurance because of the law.
So Keeping Them Honest, was his statement to the Des Moines Register, to the Des Moines paper in a moderate swing state an attempt to tailor the message to voters there or was it simply a misstatement, a mistake?

Biden's initial struggles were part of Bloomberg's rationale for getting into the race in the first place. That strategy looked smart as Biden faltered through the first contests in Iowa and New Hampshire and Nevada. But when the former vice president ran away with the South Carolina primary, it set off a chain of events that ultimately left Bloomberg with no real path to the nomination.

This was the harshest I've seen the Massachusetts Senator in a debate. She took a stab at Bloomberg, saying that if he is elected, we'd only be replacing one arrogant billionaire for another. And Warren wasn't done with Bloomberg. She later tore apart his defense that he treats women well, pointing at all the women he'd hired who were fairly compensated. This wasn't a defense of his treatment of women, Warren argued. It was as meaningless as saying I've been nice to some women.
Facts First: It's not true that Trump closed down the country entirely, or that he banned travel from China outright. Only foreign nationals who had been in China within the past 14 days were outright banned from entering the US.

In the tricky art of diplomacy, a reasonably good solution is not the enemy of a perfect solution, since those are rarely on offer. To be sure, the deal didn't address the fact that Iran has a robust ballistic missile program, but the deal wasn't about the unilateral disarmament of Iran – which Iran would be quite unlikely to agree to since its only real ally around the world is Syria! – but rather it was to stop the Iranians from acquiring nuclear weapons with all the new, additional leverage that would give them in the region.
So if you look at the three principles of (USoC), they include anything that can get people access to the coverage they need, the care they need, protect them from bankruptcy and do it in a way that can be lasting from an economic and political standpoint. That absolutely includes single-payer and it includes other ideas that are either currently formed or that need to be formed.
The calculation becomes how much pain the senators want to actually inflict, because, again, we all know how this ends: Biden will be the next President. No Republican in the House or Senate is under any illusions that is the reality. This circus is for an audience of one. And the question of how many objections there will be is partly a question of when will Trump be satisfied that Republicans fought for him on the floor.
(CNN) — El expresidente de la Cámara de Representantes de Estados Unidos John Boehner llamó al aspirante republicano Ted Cruz «Lucifer en persona», en una fuerte entrevista en la Universidad de Stanford publicada el jueves.
Meanwhile, police are questioning this man, seen opening the door of the SUV before it then takes off on the highway running over someone. They say he is not under arrest, and police tell us they have now identified the biker who used his helmet to smash the window of the Range Rover and are preparing to arrest him. And they also said that after the window was shattered, the driver was pulled out of the SUV, thrown to the ground, beaten and slashed in the face. That part of the attack was not caught on video, but as that violence was unfolding, a neighborhood man who was walking by saw it, knew he had to do something. So he stepped into the street to protect the driver until police arrived.

Well, clearly say one thing, facts clearly show another. Right? And Republicans are the ones who gaveled him down. They wouldn't let him bring it up for a vote. So, you know, there's a lot of talk about this.
The longest shutdown in US history was, surprise, actually about money. The GOP-led Congress clashed with Democratic President Bill Clinton over the level of federal spending. The Republicans refused to OK a spending bill because they wanted the Democrats and the White House to, among other things, agree to deep cuts in Medicare and Medicaid. Plus the GOP wanted the White House to rely on Congressional Budget Office figures for their budget calculations, which weren't as optimistic as projections from the administration's Office of Management and Budget. The shutdown ended after 21 days, with Clinton bowing to a key Republican demand: submitting a seven-year balanced budget plan scored by the Congressional Budget Office.
He later said he expects to get the simple majority needed.
DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We're going to make America great again. We're going to use our best people.
The bad news is trust in vaccines is splitting dangerously along partisan lines. In an average of Axios/Ipsos polls taken in January and February, 74% of Democrats said they'd either been vaccinated or were extremely or very likely to get vaccinated as soon it's available to them. Just 51% of Republicans said the same thing. Independents were in the middle of these two groups, at 61%.
Take a listen to what he said at the State of the Union address.
The President has said repeatedly that he would roll out a new health care plan that would protect those with pre-existing conditions, but he has yet to do so. Last April, he backed away from pushing for a vote on a replacement plan until after the 2020 election.

BASH: And what does the second richest man in the world think about Amazon's decision to break up with New York? Fareed Zakaria sits down with Bill Gates next.
After coming out of the box sounding more like a playground punk, Trump picked it up a bit when he took Hillary Clinton to task for deleting thousands of emails while she was Secretary of State. She apologized (again), took responsibility (again) and said if she had it to do over again, she would not have used her private server. Clinton was wrong. She was investigated and cleared of any illegal acts. You either believe her, or not. Move on.
Although Trump claimed the Senate was one vote away, in reality the vote was only to go to conference with the House on the Senate's skinny repeal of Obamacare.
The White House has pushed to distribute the payments before the end of the month, hoping to increase the number of electronic deposits to get money to Americans quicker. Biden won't take a step his predecessor insisted upon: putting his name or signature on the physical checks.
The town hall format is familiar for Klobuchar, who has found success in her home state – which almost went for President Donald Trump in 2016 – by consciously visiting each of Minnesota's 87 counties, often to hold town-hall style events.
It is not. Trump, though, has preferred during the coronavirus crisis to own the spotlight himself, while frequently providing inaccurate or incomplete information, rather than cede airtime to experts who could convey accurate information.
BLITZER: He was alluding to remarks over the weekend when he lashed out at some of Bernie Sanders' backers. He accused them of sexist and even profane attacks against Hillary Clinton supporters.
It was that concern – and qualms about the legal justification for the move – that drew objections from Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar, Attorney General William Barr and White House counsel Pat Cipollone as the White House debated its position on the Texas lawsuit, which was brought by a coalition of Republican-led states. The Texas ruling is being appealed by a coalition of Democratic-governed states, because the Trump administration declined to defend the law in the first place.

The caps, however, are designed to reduce federal spending on Medicaid, said Cindy Mann, a partner with Manatt Health, a professional services firm that works with states. States would not be allowed to set caps on enrollment, so if they exceeded their federal funding limits, they would have to clamp down on eligibility, benefits or provider payments -- or be fully on the hook for the additional costs.

We have seen wages -- we've seen productivity go up. We have seen corporate -- corporate profits go up. We have seen corporate executive compensation explode, but wages have been flat. It's partly because of a tax system. It's partly because of a trade policy that sells out American workers and fundamentally sells out American communities.
House Democrats have a Rules Committee meeting scheduled on a resolution to remove her from Budget and Education on Wednesday. A reminder that just because they pass the resolution out of the Rules panel doesn't mean it has to go to the floor. It's designed to be a fail safe to force McCarthy to act.
We must move to universal health care. And I am so proud of the work we did as a party to protect the Affordable Car Act, Klobuchar said Sunday. We are to the point now where Obamacare is more popular than the President.
BROWN: Oh, yes. You pay for it by -- you wipe off the books, the Trump tax bill, that blew a trillion-and-a-half-dollar hole in the budget. You start with, instead of giving those tax breaks to the wealthiest people in this country, you focus those tax breaks on corporations that, shall we say, are patriotic, do their production here.
The idea of Sen. Roy Moore terrifies most Republicans who have to be on the ballot next year. That sentiment was summed up nicely by the ever-quotable Sen. Lindsey Graham on CNN on Monday:
Facts First: We usually don't fact check promises, but this one has already proved untrue. It's false that Trump administration and congressional Republicans left protections for people with pre-existing conditions; they have repeatedly put forward : We usually don't fact check promises, but this one has already proved untrue. It's false that Trump administration and congressional Republicans left protections for people with pre-existing conditions; they have repeatedly put forward bills and filed lawsuits that would weaken Obamacare's protections for people with pre-existing conditions. Trump is currently supporting a Republican lawsuit that is seeking to declare all of Obamacare void. He has not issued a plan to reinstate the law's protections for people with pre-existing conditions if the suit succeeds.
And in Mexico, the search for survivors after that massive earthquake continues in several collapsed buildings. At least 286 people are known to have died so far.
If President Biden signs the bill soon and there are no additional program requirements in the bill, we should be able to implement the extensions without any interruption in payments, said Kersha Cartwright, a spokeswoman for Georgia's Department of Labor. That is a lot of assumptions, though.
Americans are as divided as congressional Democrats about how to expand health care coverage to more people.
And later, the man in that picture, just one guy, standing between a badly beaten driver of an SUV and a pack of angry bikers who were attacking him. Just one guy who made a difference. He joins us tonight only on 360 and his story will inspire you. That and new report that an undercover police officer was part of the ride that day allegedly saw the attack and did nothing to intervene. We have new reporting on that. We begin though with the latest on the woman in the car in Washington. Her story.
Over the weekend, Trump revived his long-running feud against McCain – who died in August after a long battle with brain cancer – citing his ties to the controversial Russia dossier and his vote against repealing Obamacare. He said in the Oval Office on Tuesday that he was never a fan of John McCain and I never will be and complained on Wednesday that he wasn't thanked for giving McCain the kind of funeral that he wanted.

(CNN) The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has warned Americans to plan for the inevitable spread of the novel coronavirus (Covid-19) across the country. If we are going to mount an adequate response to a potential pandemic, our preparation must include an acknowledgment of the fractured state of health care access in this country.
These so-called association health plans have existed for decades, but haven't been very popular. Companies often had to navigate complex regulations and meet strict criteria, including being in both the same industry and location, according to Chris Condeluci, who runs CC Law & Policy, a health care legal and policy practice.
SANDERS: Look, that's not what I'm saying.
According to a person in the room, there was applause when leadership told the room they wouldn't compromise on the issue and that plans were to keep health care stabilization out of the proposal if Democrats wouldn't agree on abortion restrictions.

We also have a tradition of valuing choice in our health care system. That means that rather than having health care decisions dictated solely by the government, most Americans still have the final say over decisions about the care they receive. While government plays a significant role in our health care system, we have chosen to take a different approach than have many other countries, including democracies in Europe and Asia. The federal government doesn't impose price controls or engage in direct negotiations over price on most health care products and services. Indeed, in the parts of the health care system where competition thrives, the marketplace maximizes choices for consumers while holding down their costs.

As you know, he is running for president of the United States. And as you know, when he gets elected, he will make our country great again. The story begins in New York in the early '70s. The city was on the verge of bankruptcy, but Donald looked across the river and saw not a troubled city but a city that symbolized America's greatness and he was committed to making it great again.
And he raised $2.2 million in the first six weeks of his campaign.
We absolutely have to win this with a coalition. Arabs have to be with us. The Europeans have to understand that this threat is closer to them than even is closer - is as close as it is to us. And in addition to that, you have to be in the air and you have to be on the ground.
President Donald Trump's attacks on the late Sen. John McCain are stupid and socially unnatural, Anthony Scaramucci said Thursday.

What people are talking about -- there's a lot of frustration, a lot of confusion, frankly, out there among conservative groups and even among members -- is reconciliation has certain limits. So there are folks who would love to see us put in this reconciliation bill all these other ideas.
One thing, I moved my troops out of Syria -- on the border between Turkey and Syria. That turned out to be such a successful move, Laura. Look what happened. Now they protect their own -- they've been fighting over that border for 1,000 years. Why should we do it? -- January 10 interview with Fox News' Laura Ingraham
We face the usual hurdle, which is trying to persuade people that nobody else gets to make this decision for them, Patrick said in an interview with CNN in January. This race is wide open and the other candidates who have spent months and months and years and years, millions of dollars, making themselves famous but not locking down the race.
Even among the Southern states, when it comes to race, Alabama is the baddest of the bad.
The magnitude of that death toll has much to do with Trump's neglect when he was in office. The tumultuous forces now rocking Capitol Hill are, in most cases, linked to Trump or the extremism of his acolytes who have fully bought into his alternative reality that rejected truth and democracy itself.
Sen. Amy Klobuchar will take to the national stage on Monday headlining a CNN town hall in New Hampshire to make her most public case yet for why she should be the next President of the United States.
TOWNSEND: You know, look, this is really hard. In the first 48 to 72 hours, the first facts are often wrong.
Facts First: There is no evidence Bloomberg has requested a box to stand on to make him seem taller during debates. Bloomberg campaign spokesperson Julie Wood told CNN that Trump is lying; she called Trump a pathological liar. A Democratic National Committee official said on condition of anonymity that no, there have been no discussions about Bloomberg getting any height aid for a debate.
Thanks to our bold regulatory reduction campaign, the United States has become the number one producer of oil and natural gas anywhere in the world, by far, Trump said.
But we're still trying to find out what exactly is the connection between again this 800-pound gorilla, Ameridose and NECC and what that might mean for consumers sort of going forward, Anderson?
Republicans wanted to a way to get rid of Obamacare (some things never change) so they refused to back any spending bill that didn't defund the Affordable Care Act. Democrats balked at that, of course, and a 16-day shutdown was on. This shutdown got tied up with the debt ceiling, which needed to be raised at about the same time, so the GOP used that as leverage, too. This one ended after the Dems stayed united, while the Republicans essentially gave in and accepted a small Obamacare concession to save face.
Over the past two decades, members of Congress and presidents from both parties have raised the debt ceiling 15 times, and we look forward to working with Congress to ensure the full faith and credit of the United States government.
If we don't have a nominee who can win on the first ballot, I'm for none of the above, Boehner said at the Futures Industry Association conference. They all had a chance to win. None of them won. So I'm for none of the above. I'm for Paul Ryan to be our nominee.

For his entire adult life, and with special vigor during the 2016 campaign, President Donald Trump has insisted on his skills as a master negotiator.
Facts First: Trump is free to believe that Stone is innocent, but it's not true that nobody knows what Stone did or that nobody can define what he did. A jury : Trump is free to believe that Stone is innocent, but it's not true that nobody knows what Stone did or that nobody can define what he did. A jury convicted Stone of seven felonies: five counts of lying to Congress, one count of witness tampering, and one count of obstructing a congressional committee proceeding.
That simply did not happen . This is the President propagating a conspiracy theory, and undermining faith in American democracy, for no good reason.
So if we start at an easy place to find him is in his children. And you've all had the great opportunity to see his kids over the last couple days. What do you think of that?
Biden claimed the monitor was sent by the Obama administration, though the monitor was a private lawyer appointed by a federal judge with the Obama administration's endorsement.
So far, they have heard cases concerning LGBTQ rights, the Second Amendment and DACA. They are also untangling a messy case having to do with Puerto Rico's financial condition, as well as another related to the Bridgegate political scandal that occurred when Chris Christie served as governor of New Jersey.
On Tuesday, Trump demoted Glenn Fine, the man tapped last month to independently oversee spending on the $2 trillion federal coronavirus stimulus package. Because Fine, who was the acting inspector general from the Defense Department, was removed from that role , he also lost his chairmanship of the Pandemic Response Accountability Committee (only inspectors general are eligible to be on that committee). No explanation was offered.
I want to build on the momentum that we saw here in 2018, Klobuchar told reporters Saturday in Wisconsin. No one ever thought that the Democrats were going to be able (to defeat) Gov. Walker, but we did it, and we did it in a smart, Wisconsin way with a grassroots campaign with (Democratic Sen.) Tammy Baldwin at the top of the ticket, and we can do it in the presidential, as well.

PINSKY: Yes and the thing that concerns me the most is people will point at somebody's episodes and go there is something wrong with these people when in fact, this is a lovely woman whose brain -- why should we treat conditions above the neck different than below the neck. The brain was misfiring on that day. They have treatments for it. The treatments are good. But we have to enforce them. We have to make sure people follow through on them. And we have to make sure insurance companies allow doctors to use their judgments to do what they need to do.

Congress' elimination of the individual mandate could also hurt those with pre-existing conditions, particularly those who don't qualify for federal premium subsidies, health policy experts say. Without the mandate, which requires nearly all Americans to get coverage or pay a penalty, healthy people will have less incentive to enroll. So premiums for those left on the exchanges are likely to rise.
President-elect Donald Trump doesn't plan to sit back and wait for Congress to repeal and replace Obamacare.
At a 2016 campaign rally, Trump said , My first day, it gets signed, okay? My first day. There's no more gun-free zones. He later doubled-down on the promise, telling the media he was going to do something to end gun free zones.
A few days later, the President tweeted, Republicans should stop wasting their time on Immigration until after we elect more Senators and Congressmen/women in November. Dems are just playing games, have no intention of doing anything to solves this decades old problem. We can pass great legislation after the Red Wave!

Today, I'm about to sign two executive orders that basically, the best way to describe them, to undo the damage Trump has done, Biden said. There's nothing new that we are doing here other than restoring the Affordable Care Act and restoring Medicaid to the way it was before Trump became president.
But now the good news. Our historic Better Way platform puts us on offense. This is fitting, because we, the people's representatives, are the ones who should be setting the nation's policy agenda. It is in Congress where government of, by and for the people happens.

The New York Times reported in 2015 that it was widely acknowledged that the official numbers understated the extent of the problem.

In withdrawing the US from the Iran nuclear deal, President Donald Trump is taking a huge gamble. And aside from his desire to repudiate everything done by his predecessor, President Barack Obama, it's really hard to see why he is making this decision.

That's precisely the Senate the Georgia runoffs produced.

[04:54:11] ROMANS: The New York Times reports ex-CBS chief Leslie Moonves destroyed evidence and interfered with an investigation into sexual misconduct allegations. A draft report from lawyers hired by CBS says Moonves was evasive and deliberately lied. The report said to alleged multiple acts of nonconsensual sex in and outside of the workplace. If that proves true, it could cost Moonves a $120 million payout. Moonves has denied more than a dozen accusations of sexual misconduct.

The call for competing slates of electors. No competing slates have been delivered to Congress, because no competing slates have been submitted by the proper state authorities. This is outside the bounds of the session and will be rejected.
I noticed conspicuous by its absence in that debate. President Obama never uttered abortion or contraception in 90 minutes.
The biggest bombshell of the week was Elizabeth Warren claiming Bernie Sanders told her that a woman can't be elected president, a stunning attack for one of the three leading candidates to make on another. Sanders gamely denied it, and then just stood there as the moderator appeared to ignore his denial. Then he failed to challenge Warren straight up by demanding she admit she was lying!

But challengers of the law might calculate that it only takes four justices to agree to hear a case, and the liberals might contemplate the massive sweep of the law and decide it shouldn't languish in the lower courts -- bringing uncertainty to millions of Americans.
Trump made 27 of the false claims at his campaign rally in Toledo, Ohio. He made 16 more in a Fox News interview with Laura Ingraham. He made six in his speech on National Environmental Policy Act regulations, plus 10 in his exchange with reporters after the speech.
But in the end, the strategy appears to have hurt Bloomberg, a candidate who, by focusing on someone he wasn't running against, seemed to forget about the actual race he was in. It didn't help that Bloomberg proved to be a lackluster campaigner. His prepared speeches and choreographed events obscured his lack of rhetorical agility. He almost never took questions from the audience and engaged with them rarely.

Hay que ver cómo destacan esta división los demócratas, presionando a los republicanos a apoyar o rechazar el plan general de presupuesto y para que voten por separado sobre la propuesta de Ivanka.

Trump cast himself as a businessman-turned-politician that would not allow the US to be taken advantage of by the rest of the world. That nationalist mindset manifested itself in several ways, but especially on trade -- impacting the cost of goods from around the world and altering the US labor market.
And one effect that all of this may have in terms of the sentencing is that the judge has brought up in his court filings and, you know, you've seen the judge order prosecutors and lawyers and from the special counsel's office to file additional material in response to some of those claims.
Some parts of Obamacare I don't think will work, I don't think is fair, I don't think is intelligent, whatever. But I don't have a better answer other than let's try this, Bloomberg also said.
Schumer was asked if he regrets that Democrats used the nuclear option in 2013 to lower the 60-vote threshold to break a filibuster for most judicial picks – except those for the Supreme Court – because it's unlikely Readler could get 60 votes right now.
The administration also put many of President Barack Obama's attempts to warm relations with Cuba on ice, with the US recently naming the country a state sponsor of terrorism . His administration also targeted Nicolas Maduro's regime in Venezuela.
And we have the best military in the world. When I came in it was totally depleted, it was gone. We had fighter jets that were 54 years old.

Now, with with less than two days to go before the government runs out money, fellow Republicans are once again being frustrated by a combination of Democratic solidarity and Trump's conflicting statements. It's tough to negotiate – or align yourself – with someone whose baseline priorities shift daily, as Trump's have on issues as varied as the wall, the Children's Health Insurance Program and the futures of hundreds of thousands of undocumented immigrants who have been protected by the expiring Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. On all three subjects, Trump has publicly vacillated.

SCARAMUCCI: And I understand that, and I did too because we're both compassionate people. I didn't want to fire him as much as we wanted to give him the opportunity to resign, which he did. And I talk to him last night by phone. I said to him, hey, I'm here to help you find another job, because whatever happened right or wrong inside the administration, you've got a long life.

The town hall format is familiar for Klobuchar, who has found success in her home state – which almost went for President Donald Trump in 2016 – by consciously visiting each of Minnesota's 87 counties, often to hold town-hall style events.

Klobuchar's primary pitch to voters is likely to be electability. The Democrat has been notably successful in Minnesota, winning her three terms in the Senate by an average of 26 percentage points. Klobuchar won re-election in 2018 with 60% of the vote, two years after Trump came within two points of defeating Hillary Clinton in the state.
TRUMP: I hope so. I mean it's snow, and I hope the snow doesn't affect it. But I certainly have the biggest crowds and we have a great turnout. And it's all about making America great again and that's what we're going to do. And the politicians will never be able to do it. Nobody knows them better than me. You don't even know them as good as I know them. And I will tell you, they don't have it. They're not going to be able to make America great again. Not going to happen.
Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump said Wednesday his administration will continue to push the Supreme Court to invalidate the Affordable Care Act, defying a last-minute request from Attorney General William Barr to modify the administration's position.
Trump's invites to the White House pay off
Here's what I also know: There are certain things that are right and certain things that are wrong – whether you are a Democrat, a Republican or somewhere in between. And attacking a dead man who spent five years as a prisoner of war and another three decades serving the country in elected office, is simply wrong. That's true if Barack Obama, George W. Bush, Millard Fillmore, Franklin Pierce or whoever the next president will be did it. (None of them would have said what Trump did about a man with as decorated a past as McCain but the point still holds.
Iowa is an agriculture state that relies on sales of soybeans, pork and corn. These people are keenly aware of the benefits to the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) trade deal. Bernie Sanders was not wise to criticize the deal; other candidates acknowledged the USMCA has brought about about improvements.
Perhaps we can negotiate a different agreement, adding China and others, or perhaps we can't — in which case, we will outspend and out-innovate all others by far.
But certainly, still, some of the western part of the island, southern part of the island, southeast part of the island, we're still trying to break through. Keep in mind we're 24 hours just post-hurricane warning. And right now our efforts are to make sure that we have everybody safe and that we can rescue people. Our efforts have already produced almost 700 rescues. So we're clearly focused on that.

Prior to the pandemic, Trump saw poverty decline during his time in office, but as the economic effects of the coronavirus pandemic have continued to ravage the US, hunger and poverty have surged.

JEFF ZELENY, CNN SENIOR WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT: Hey, Wolf.
Association health plans, which have existed for decades and have a history of fraud and insolvency, have long been a favorite tool of Republicans. Trump and Republican Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky had been pushing to change their regulation so the plans could be sold across state lines with little, if any, local oversight. The goal would be to give consumers more options.
BASH: But Mr. Trump, just to be clear, there is an embassy that you would have to decide whether it would be open or whether you would close it. Which would it be? In Havana.
Biden's executive measures will also likely lead to the reversal of various measures the Trump administration put in place to chip away at the Affordable Care Act. These include broadening the duration of short-term health plans to a year, and, more recently, allowing Georgia to stop using the federal exchange , healthcare.gov, and shift to a private sector model instead. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services went a step further in recent weeks, establishing a pathway for all states to do this for 2023.
So what exactly would the presumed presidential nominees do about that?
But if the analysis of the Senate bill is similar the House bill's, this promise might also be broken. The CBO found that while the House bill would decrease health care premiums for healthier, younger Americans, it could drastically increases costs for sicker, older citizens.
Facts First: The site did have major problems when it was : The site did have major problems when it was unveiled in 2013 , but $5 billion is an exaggeration.

It's the unfortunate reality facing Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer right now: Include it, you lose at least one moderate senator. Leave it behind, you risk losing progressives.
The next president would be well advised to consider Ryan's proposals and accept that he or she will need to work with him either to improve the current law or to structure a new one.

Some jobless Oregonians, for instance, had no disruption in payments after the prior relief bill, but others had to wait until mid-February for their benefits to restart. In California, it took until early March to fully implement the December relief bill's provisions.
An atmospheric test would be a very big thing. There has not been one in nearly four decades. The Chinese were the last ones to do it. The United States banned them with a few other nations at the end of the Kennedy administration in 1963 in the partial test ban treaty. Because they are such an environmental disaster. And of course, we sickened a lot of people when -- near the Bikini Atoll when the U.S. conducted such tests in the '50s.

QUESTION: On that same issue, the head of the DEA wrote immediately after the president made those remarks to officers in the DEA telling them to disregard them and saying he had an obligation to speak up when something wrong happens.
The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal reported that, according to Times sources and a Journal review of drafts of Trump's speech, the text of Trump's speech said the restrictions will not apply to trade and cargo.
Speaking of Europe supposedly taking advantage of the US on trade, Trump said, They don't take your product. They don't take your cars. They don't take your farm product. They don't take your medical machines. We do a big business, they sell us, we don't sell them, because they put restrictions. We have better equipment than them, but they make it so that our equipment doesn't qualify. You know, it's called artificial barriers or non-monetary barriers. It's brutal. -- December 18 campaign rally in Battle Creek, Michigan
That'd be big news: Congressional Republicans haven't yet figured out what they'll replace Obamacare with – and Paul is on a lonely crusade to slow down what's expected to be a vote early in the year to repeal it.
(CNN) Nearly 30 years ago, I met Stacey Abrams at a training for student organizers hosted by the A. Philip Randolph Institute, an organization for African American trade unionists. I had just been suspended by Columbia University for protesting the university's plans to turn the Audubon Ballroom, where Malcolm X was shot to death, into a biomedical research facility. And Abrams was on her way to becoming student body president of Spelman College.

Fauci, who was not present for Sunday's briefing, told the journal Science that he knows Trump makes incorrect statements at the podium, but I can't jump in front of the microphone and push him down. Instead, Fauci said, he works behind the scenes to try to get Trump not to repeat the inaccuracies.
So we said in 2016 to our citizens, to the American people, to our constituents, If you give us this chance, this opportunity, this is what we'll do. Now is our chance and our opportunity to do it.
And while a Trump administration will be subject to checks and balances from a Republican Congress, I expect a President Trump to exercise the executive branch's checks and balances as well.
Infosys is one of the biggest recipients of H-1B visas. Its U.S. clients include IBM (IBM) and Lockheed Martin (LMT).
Health care – and Trump's attempts to roll back Obamacare – became a galvanizing issue for Democrats in the 2018 midterms. Four in ten voters in 2018 said health care was the most important issue facing the country, according to a CNN exit poll, as they swept a wave of Democratic lawmakers into office to give Democrats the majority in the House of Representatives.
We have not enough competition in a lot of counties, a lot of states, and as a result, prices have gone up, which is not what we want to do.
So ask yourself at home: How is this helping you? If your wages have been stagnant for 20 years; if you can't pay the bills, how does it help you to have a president come and say, I'm going to jack - I'm going to put a 45 percent tax on diapers when you buy diapers, on automobiles when you buy automobiles, on clothing when you buy clothing. That hurts you.
He wasn't the first one to say it. In fact, he was only one of what seemed like millions. Peter Thiel, the billionaire investor and Trump supporter, summed up his candidate's appeal – and what the press didn't understand – not long before Election Day.
It's the unfortunate reality facing Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer right now: Include it, you lose at least one moderate senator. Leave it behind, you risk losing progressives.
Now, you know, what we're hearing all the time with all these debates ObamaCare is horrible, evil, terrible, it must be abandoned. You are a senior oncologist, you are at the sharp end of all this, what is your view?
But then we started doing the big tariffs -- taking in literally tens of billions of dollars. And we started giving money back. I went to Sonny Perdue. I said, 'Sonny, what did China -- what was the number that China did last year?' He said, 'Sir, they bought $16 billion.' I said, 'Oh, that's good. What did they do the year before?' 'Sir, they bought $12 billion worth of product.' I said, 'Good.' So it's $12 billion. We gave you the $12 billion. Then, $16 billion. We gave you the $16 billion so you weren't hurt. -- January 19 speech to the American Farm Bureau Federation
In 2019, the US Department of Agriculture proposed three rules that could strip an estimated 3.7 million people of their food stamp benefits.
The town hall format is familiar for Klobuchar, who has found success in her home state – which almost went for President Donald Trump in 2016 – by consciously visiting each of Minnesota's 87 counties, often to hold town-hall style events.

Some have suggested that government needs to play a bigger role in negotiating prices for health care services and goods, such as pharmaceuticals. Such action would only stifle innovation, limit choices, and ultimately hurt patients and consumers here in America. Many Americans don't realize that, with respect to prescription drugs, they already benefit from aggressive negotiations between pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs), employers, and health plans to secure the best deal. This preserves choice for consumers while reaping the benefits of scale – namely, lower prices.

At her event in Goffstown, Klobuchar pitching herself as a candidate who can win independent and lean Republican voters. She pledged to go everywhere, not just where it is comfortable, but where it is uncomfortable and outlined a platform that included overturning Citizens United, reinstating the Voting Rights Act, rejoining the Paris Climate Accord and getting on the path toward a public option for health care.

Speaking at CPAC, Trump referenced the Arizona Republican's July vote against a skinny repeal of the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare.
LONG: Well, we're working very diligently with Governor Abbott in Texas to put together an innovative housing approach. The old way of doing business with, you know, the way that FEMA provided housing is not going to work for this unique event because of the magnitude of it. So, we are working with him to finalize agreements to where recovery is, basically supported by the federal government, managed by the state and executed at the local level.
Facts First: According to the most recent official NATO : According to the most recent official NATO figures , released in November 2019, US military spending represented between about 71% and about 73% of NATO members' total military spending in 2014, 2015 and 2016. That is a hefty percentage, but 100% is an exaggeration. (The US share of NATO military expenditures has declined to about 69% per year under Trump.)
According to the Miami Herald, he pays $180 per month but is required to provide three years of medical records before his emergency room coverage would bring his bill down to a still sizable $1,400. Consumers seeking better deals are left vulnerable. When our citizens are sick, this administration's actions endanger Americans' health and wallets, and it undermines access and coverage that is essential for surveillance, detection and early response in the face of an outbreak -- like Covid-19.
Trump was exaggerating even if he was describing the timeline for an entire case, not just the trial alone. President Trump's statement is a gross exaggeration and it is not true, said David Haas, a former federal prosecutor in Florida who is now a criminal defense lawyer and has represented people accused of drug trafficking. Most federal cases are resolved, either by plea or trial, within months of being filed. That length can vary but it would be unusual for any federal case to be pending longer than 12-18 months.
Facts First: There is simply no evidence that newspaper pollsters have manipulated their numbers to suppress the enthusiasm of Trump voters, as Trump has repeatedly alleged.
I will be signing something probably this week which is going to go a long way to take care of people that have been so badly hurt on health care, Trump said ahead of a meeting with Henry Kissinger, the former secretary of state.
In a 2010 speech, just months after the law passed, Bloomberg called it a disgrace. He described Obamacare as just another program that's going to cost a lot of money.
If that happens, it would take the federal government's coronavirus response over the last year to nearly a staggering $6 trillion -- all of it borrowed money.
Covered California, which saw a record 1.6 million people selecting 2021 plans for coverage starting January 1, intends to spend $6 million for its upcoming special sign up session, which will also run through May 15.
The bottom line is we can't just continue to tip-toe around this and throw out things like I'm going to get at fraud and abuse. Let's get rid of fraud, let's get rid of abuse, let's be more careful about how we spend foreign aid. But you still have hundreds of billions of dollars of deficit that you're going to have to make up.
It's unclear if the administration is going to be willing to help, however.
Klobuchar, who announced her presidential campaign during a snowy outdoor event in Minneapolis earlier this month, is the third potential presidential hopeful to appear at a CNN town hall. Sen. Kamala Harris appeared at an event hosted by Jake Tapper and former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz, who is considering an independent bid for the presidency, headlined a town hall hosted by Poppy Harlow.

The term carpet bombing dates back to World War II, when the Allies bombarded broad swaths of Nazi Germany and Japan, killing thousands of civilians. As technology advanced, enabling the military to conduct more precise airstrikes, the United States shifted towards narrowly targeted attacks. During the Gulf War, the United States used smart weapons systems designed to carry out attacks with surgical accuracy.

So this is going to be a moment of truth for my GOP colleagues.
NAFTA has been a horrible deal for the United States. It's been very good for Canada, it's been very good for Mexico, but it's been horrible for the United States, Trump said Thursday from the Oval Office, as if he were still rallying supporters on the campaign trail.
Delgado says his goal is a smaller bore overhaul in the marketplace – one that explicitly wouldn't displace people currently using private insurance and would have a mechanism to cover its cost, but still would open the door to universal coverage.
But presidents can issue executive orders -- which are signed and have the force of law -- to direct federal agencies and officials on how to execute laws and policies. Obama issued only one executive order concerning the Affordable Care Act, said Tim Jost, a health law professor at Washington and Lee University School of Law. It directed several agencies to establish a mechanism to ensure that federal money flowing through Obamacare -- such as the subsidies and community health centers funding -- would not be used for abortions, consistent with federal statute.
Clinton's time as First Lady shaped her public image -- Around the time Biden was being sworn into the Senate, Clinton was working on the the Watergate committee as a young staffer.

But she didn't become a household name until her husband, Bill Clinton, then the governor of Arkansas, ran in a fractious field in 1992. He was the Comeback Kid, whose career-minded wife stood by him as he battled allegations of infidelity and, later, worse. Her efforts to reform the health system were foiled. Travelgate. Whitewater. The vast right-wing conspiracy. She has been a magnet for conservative conspiracists ever since.

The account in the student newspaper is accurate, a source close to Boehner confirmed Thursday.
Cindy McCain also provided a health update on her husband, who was diagnosed with glioblastoma, an aggressive brain cancer, last July.
As much as Roberts publicly rejects the politics of Washington, as the top judicial figure in the nation he cannot escape it. In 2012, he negotiated to save the Barack Obama-sponsored Affordable Care Act, but more in keeping with his conservative record, he has limited the reach of Voting Rights Act's protections, curbed campaign-finance regulations and closed the doors of federal courthouses to lawsuits over intense partisan gerrymanders.
CUOMO: That's your job is to be ready. Let's talk about what matters. Health care -- the president says inaction is not an option. He is banging on members of his own party, most recently Senator Murkowski from Alaska this morning, saying she did her own constituents a disservice. It raises the question, how did she do her constituents a disservice? The bill that is out there right now, these kind of bald replacements, repeal statutes without understanding what the replacement is, the president called that notion mean when it came out of the House. Why is he now seeing the resistance by a senator as a failure?
In the last Congress, both parties came together to pass unprecedented legislation to confront the opioid crisis, a sweeping new Farm Bill, historic VA reforms, and after four decades of rejection, we passed VA Accountability so we can finally terminate those who mistreat our wonderful veterans.
(CNN) The White House is keenly aware of the Republican objections that have arisen to President Joe Biden's $1.9 trillion stimulus proposal , but they are urging Democratic allies to be patient for the moment, according to two administration officials.

And in saying just the other day that he didn't really need to do this, he just wanted to do it because it would help things go faster, he's pretty much daring the court to strike this down. So it's hard to imagine a poorer case.
Klobuchar's primary pitch to voters is likely to be electability. The Democrat has been notably successful in Minnesota, winning her three terms in the Senate by an average of 26 percentage points. Klobuchar won re-election in 2018 with 60% of the vote, two years after Trump came within two points of defeating Hillary Clinton in the state.
PAWLENTY: They didn't have the leverage here.
Let's make this abundantly clear: this process ends with the certification of Joe Biden as the 46th President of the United States. Everything in between now and the final elector tally being read off is noise. Boisterous. Unruly. Likely unseemly. At times barely tethered to reality. But it's not actionable or tangible in terms of having an actual effect. That being said, however long it takes -- and it will not be a short day -- this ends the same way: Biden is inaugurated on January 20.
I think without question this nominee would not get on the bench, Schumer said. The 60-vote threshold brought parties together and picked more judges to be moderate.
However, there hasn't been any announcement of additional funding for enrollment assistance, which the Trump administration slashed by 84%, on average, since 2017. Some 30 organizations received a total of only $10 million last summer.
Klobuchar's electability in Minnesota, which has largely come by taking more politically moderate positions, has some Democrats questioning whether the senator will be able to capture the imagination of a party that has drifted to the left nationally.
Last month, the 5th US Circuit Court of Appeals ruled Obamacare's individual mandate was unconstitutional, but had sent the case down to a Texas federal court to decide the fate of other provisions of the sprawling law.

Congressional Republicans are privately turning to four GOP governors -- two from states that expanded and two from states that didn't -- in the hope that they can hammer out a deal that can win approval from their peers and from lawmakers.
KELSEY SNELL, CONGRESSIONAL REPORTER, NPR: Well, she is very capable for bringing up bills to vote on her Congress at this point so that the House could potentially take a vote and uphold portions of the law or even bring back the penalty for the individual mandate that was zeroed out by Republicans last year.
The first whistleblower's lawyers, Zaid and Andrew Bakaj, wrote in the Washington Post in October: Because our client has no additional information about the president's call, there is no justification for exposing their identity and all the risks that would follow.
Klobuchar spent the lead-up to the town hall with a trip through Wisconsin and Iowa, building on her campaign theme of retaking Midwest communities that have drifted away from Democrats in recent years. Klobuchar, a three-term senator from Minnesota, is pitching herself as a pragmatic lawmaker who is willing to work with those who oppose her to get things done.

According to the Navy, the Navy decommissioned many older ships after the end of the Cold War in 1991, a decision that led to a smaller overall fleet.

There were several cries of no as Trump announced the honor, encapsulating the disbelief of many Democrats captive in their seats.
And you know what passing those laws would have - what impact it would have on the environment? Zero, because China is still going to be polluting and India is still going to be polluting at historic levels. So, I am in favor of a clean environment. My children live in South Florida. My family is being raised here. I want this to be a safe and clean place, but these laws some people are asking us to pass will do nothing for the environment and they will hurt and devastate our economy.
Trump claimed there were tens of thousands of people outside of his January rally in Wildwood, New Jersey.
Also, those with more meager earnings are eligible for plans with lower deductibles and out-of-pocket costs. They are open to individuals with annual incomes up to roughly $31,250 or families of four making up to about $64,400.

CUOMO: All right. The answer to a frequently-asked question. The reason you're seeing so much federal aid in Puerto Rico is two-fold. One, humanity demands it. And second, Puerto Rico is not a sovereign. It's a commonwealth of the United States. It's a territory. Those are Americans there. So you're going to see continued resources from the United States government.
As this year's primary season comes to a close, the slate of candidates chosen includes a diversity of backgrounds not often seen in American politics. With a record number of female candidates on major party tickets for Congress and groundbreaking candidates from racial, ethnic and religious minorities landing on ballots across the country, many Americans are now choosing among candidates who resemble them for the first time. The new poll finds a majority of Americans feel it is extremely or very important for Congress to represent the country's demographic makeup (62% say so), about the same share who say it's that important for Congress to represent the nation's political makeup in partisanship and ideology (63%). More, 67%, say it's critical for Congress to represent the nation's economic diversity.
Facts First: Trump does not have the overall record for judges confirmed at this point in a presidential term. But he does hold the record for appeals court judges confirmed, according to Russell Wheeler, a visiting fellow at the Brookings Institution who tracks judicial appointments.

Interview with Senator Tom Carper; U.S. Classifies Myanmar's Violence Against Rohingya Muslims as Ethnic Cleansing; Jerry Jones Speaks Out on President Trump; Aired 10:30-11a ET
JEFF ZELENY, CNN SENIOW WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Exactly. I mean, what we learned today from this press briefing, Brooke, is that there are still so many more questions about that flight on July 8 when the president was flying back from Hamburg, Germany, at the end of the G- 20 summit to Washington when the New York Times was first reporting about that meeting that now we've talked so much about. That meeting back on June 9, 2016. Now, Sarah Huckabee Sanders is confirming that the president weighed in, in her words, but that's in direct contradiction to what the president's own lawyers said. So now we are left to wonder, is the president's lawyer, is he accurate when he is saying the president had no part of writing that statement? Or is his spokeswoman, his new press secretary accurate, while saying the president weighed in. So, again, I mean, I think that this press briefing here, which certainly raised more questions than it cleared up over all this, is going to do one thing. It puts the White House back on defense on the entire Russia matter.
Left unsaid, however, is that Trump could hurt Senate candidates in Nevada and Arizona, two states that could tip the balance of the Senate in 2018.
That means relying entirely on Democratic votes -- and accommodating the expensive priorities required to secure them. Party leaders say $1.9 trillion is not too much to hold on to all 50 Democratic senators, as required for passage without Republican help.

To that end, Ryan made clear that the only appropriate way to defund Planned Parenthood – a key issue of principle for conservatives – is on a future bill like health care, rather than on federal funding legislation.
Barr and Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar have argued against supporting invalidating the law in full, engaging in a heated debate on this point with then-acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney and policy officials allied with him, CNN reported last year. But Barr and others have recently brought an additional dimension to their efforts, highlighting the coronavirus pandemic that has swept the nation. If the justices were to accept the Trump administration position, its decision could cause substantial disruptions to the health care of millions of Americans and cause the uninsured rate to spike.
Nearly 9 million of them could qualify for free or subsidized coverage, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. Individuals making up to about $51,000 and families of four earning up to about $104,800 are eligible for subsidies.
Where Klobuchar had trouble was with tougher questions. She was asked about her time as a prosecutor, which put her on the defensive. And then Klobuchar appeared to lose her cool when being grilled about a recent interview in which she couldn't identify policies dealing with Mexico or remember its president's name. When Buttigieg piled on, Klobuchar became angrily sarcastic, uttering I wish everyone was as perfect as you, Pete. It came across as defensive and petty.

In October, CMS discouraged its regional offices from levying fines, even in the most serious health violations, if the error was a one-time mistake. The centers said that intentional disregard for residents' health and safety or systemic errors should still merit fines.

But Schiff spoke the day after Trump released the rough transcript, not before Trump released the transcript.
China reported 6.1% GDP growth in 2019, its slowest rate since 1990. The US reported 2.3% growth in 2019 and 2.9% growth in 2018 -- both up from 1.6% in 2016 during President Barack Obama's last full year in office, but the highest Trump-era growth tying the 2.9% in 2015. While China's official figures are widely seen as unreliable, there is no doubt China has still grown faster than the US during Trump's tenure.

In terms of Medicare, the trustees project that the trust fund for Part A, which covers hospital costs for seniors, will run dry by 2028. That's two years earlier than they projected last year, due to lower than expected payroll taxes and a slower-than-estimated rate of reduction in inpatient use of hospital services.
And so, you got to just look at it for what it is. So, there are vagaries on the bell curve of his media style that some of you guys in the media don't like. And maybe some of the elites in Washington really don't like.
President Trump's ignoring those facts. And today he tweeted this really outrageous remark. Do the Dems realize that most of the people not getting paid are Democrats? The crassness of that statement is just stunning. And as usual, the president offers zero evidence to support it. No evidence.

But when I took over, I had a choice. We got rid of the most unpopular thing in Obamacare, almost got rid of Obamacare, but essentially we did. -- February 10 remarks at speech and question and answer session with governors
It is entrepreneurial and offers patients more control over their health care decisions than anywhere else in the world. One of the primary problems with Obamacare is that it does not prioritize these values. As the Trump administration and congressional Republicans consider what to do after the repeal of Obamacare, they should, as the Hippocratic Oath states, do no harm to those elements of our health care system that are functioning well. But they should also take steps to promote policies that emphasize choice and innovation.
We will begin with the national lead. I'm sorry your government was partially closed for more than two weeks and many of you weren't paid. Would some complimentary muffins make up for it? Vice President Joe Biden dropped off some baked goods at the EPA earlier today as furloughed workers made their way back in.
[21:05:03] BORGER: Cruz can say he wants something because he did, but Marco Rubio started out this campaign as everybody's second choice and seems to be finishing this so far as everybody's second choice. He's got to win somewhere. You can't become the establishment sort of candidate with all of these endorsements, but don't have -- you need voters, too.

Bloomberg's campaign spokesman Stu Loeser, did not dispute that Bloomberg did not support Obama in the 2008 election. Instead, Loeser cited remarks that Bloomberg made in 2008 where he said that rumors Obama was a Muslim were lies. The comments came at during a fight over delegates between Clinton and Obama.

He seized on the economic success of his presidency to parallel Ronald Reagan's Morning in America mantra from 1984 -- implicitly warning Americans they could jeopardize it all if they turf him out of office.
I'm self-funding my campaign. Nobody is going to be taking care of me. I don't want anybody's money. I will tell you something. We're going to go out to bid in virtually every different facet of our government. We're going to save a fortune. (APPLAUSE)

Now all of the cynics around here and the tweets and all these other nonsense saying the leaks are never to going to stop. And I say to those people, you are correct. I know the leaks will never stop, but if I can dial back the leaks in the department that I am representing and the department that I am running, then I will feel that I've accomplished something on behalf of our president.
QUESTION: Now, also, on John -- on General Kelly, you said yesterday that everybody's now reporting to the president through him. Is that an accurate characterization?

There's no heartburn over Biden's initial kind of play to make it bipartisan, to reach across the aisle, the aide said, adding that there is also no illusion among the Democrats over the prospect of Republicans coming on board -- a reality that was hammered home by moderate Maine GOP Sen. Susan Collins' recent comments questioning the need for more spending.
Here's a larger list of senators to watch and why they're facing pressure to break with their party.
Those comments come after a weekend in which Trump repeatedly attacked McCain, who, in case you forgot, is deceased, for graduating last in his class from the Naval Academy and for allegedly sending the so-called Steele dossier to the media. (Trump offered zero proof that McCain had leaked the dossier, put together by a former British intelligence agent, to the press.)
While Trump is known for his ad-libbed remarks rife with false claims, he tends to stick to the script for formal speeches such as the State of the Union. Nonetheless, here are the facts around what the President said in his third State of the Union.

One explanation for the lack of coverage might simply be the incredible amount of other important news.

In 2019, Trump issued a plan called Ending the HIV Epidemic: A Plan for America, which aimed to reduce the number of new HIV infections in the US by 75% within five years and by at least 90% within 10 years. Experts said Trump's plan builds on Obama's 2010 National HIV/AIDS Strategy and a 2015 update to that strategy.
Though Obamacare remained popular this year, 2019 could prove to be a different story.

Kamala Harris appeared at an event hosted by Jake Tapper and former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz, who is considering an independent bid for the presidency, headlined a town hall hosted by Poppy Harlow.
In order to get through, Democrats are going to have to prove that a provision has more than just an incidental effect on the budget. That word has been interpreted a lot of ways by multiple parliamentarians, but here is how it applies to minimum wage. On the one hand, the minimum wage proposal has a $55 billion impact on the federal budget over the next decade- more money than some past provisions that have gotten through this scrutiny. But, those impacts on the budget are also coming from the Congressional Budget Office estimating raising wages will raise prices of goods and services and that those higher prices will be passed onto the federal government as it buys materials. The CBO also estimates that if you raise the minimum wage it could have some effect on how much to government spends on some social programs like food stamps or unemployment insurance. Is that direct enough? Is that more than incidental? That's the question here.
Trump's efforts have prompted grumbles – private and public – from Republican lawmakers mindful of the uphill battle Trump is setting them up for.

In fact, confidential material is classified; confidential is a level of classification , not a separate, lesser thing. (Confidential is a lower level of classification than secret and top secret, but prosecutors said it is the highest level of classification of nuclear related equipment found aboard a nuclear submarine.) In addition, Saucier was not accused of sending the photos to his mother. The photos were discovered on a cell phone he had discarded in 2012 at a garbage dump in Connecticut; prosecutors said they later learned Saucier had shown them to someone he had served with and a woman he had lived with, and that his (former) wife had also seen them.

Facts First: Trump did not publicly oppose the invasion of Iraq before it began. Trump was tentatively supportive of the war when radio host Howard Stern asked him in September 2002, Are you for invading Iraq? He responded: Yeah, I guess so. I wish the first time it was done correctly. The day after the invasion in March 2003, he said, It looks like a tremendous success from a military standpoint. Trump did not offer a definitive position on the looming war in a Fox News interview in January 2003, saying, Either you attack or don't attack.
Now Trump is President -- But Clinton's apocalypse came to be. And much of Biden's strength, in exit polling, has to do with the perception that he is viewed as the candidate best equipped to take on Trump even if Sanders shares more policy priorities with much of the Democratic base.

As for expanding Social Security benefits, some propose making them more generous but just for the most vulnerable populations -- such as seniors living at or near the poverty line.
Plus, Trump is likely to try to exert executive privilege over witnesses, prompting some Republicans to suggest they don't even want to bother trying. It's a pragmatic approach, maybe, but one which doesn't do much for the constitutional idea of separation of powers.
Also, laid-off workers who want to remain on their employer health insurance plans through COBRA will not pay any premiums from April through the end of September, under the relief law. The agency is working with the Treasury and Labor Departments to enact this measure, but the official did not have a start date.
Fewer than three weeks before the Iowa caucuses, Elizabeth Warren is currently sitting in 4th place if you average the last three polls out of Iowa. In a state where the old political adage is that there are only three tickets out of Iowa , fourth place is not where any candidate wants to be.
On the other hand, the idea I think Ariane was talking about the severability problem earlier in your program -- the problem is does this make the entire law fail. And you know, I can't get into the minds of the Supreme Court justices, including Justice Roberts who is a conservative Bush appointee who's the chief justice, but who I think in 2012 clearly saw what would happen if the Supreme Court intervened to essentially undo the will of Congress. So I have to go with wait and see right now -- Alex.
The bill would repeal Obamacare's individual mandate, drastically cut back federal support of Medicaid, and eliminate Obamacare's taxes on the wealthy, insurers and others – which would be one promise kept.
Multiple federal courts have upheld the legality of Mueller's appointment and endorsed actions he took, such as subpoenaing witnesses to testify before a grand jury and bringing criminal charges against some senior Trump aides.
But if you don't fit into one of the exemption categories and you were uninsured in 2017, or will be in 2018, you're probably out of luck, says Alison Flores, a principal tax research analyst at the Tax Institute, the research wing of H&R Block, based in Kansas City, Missouri.
We are actually looking at reenergizing a program we had prior to the ACA, but [with] more [of] a focus [on a] short-term, one-year kind of plan, or transition plan, versus just the skinny benefit, which leaves a lot of people at some moral harm at some point, he said in the company's October earnings call. And so we have to think about what kind of plan it would look like ... we're already all over that. As soon as the executive order came out, we were on top of it.
House Democrats moved quickly to defend the Affordable Care Act once they retook control of the chamber Thursday.

Facts First: Trump was mixing up two separate issues. While the Trump administration does have : Trump was mixing up two separate issues. While the Trump administration does have new agreements with all four countries , those agreements are related to the handling of people who have come or are trying to come to the US seeking asylum, not criminals the US is seeking to deport. In 2016, prior to Trump's presidency, none of the four countries was on the list of countries that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) considered recalcitrant (uncooperative) in accepting the return of their citizens from the US.
Another key promise Trump repeatedly has made is that his health plan will lower costs. In January, for example, President-elect Trump told the Post that his plan would include lower numbers, much lower deductibles.

If the company were to withdraw from all its markets, it could leave at least 275,000 people with no Obamacare option next year, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation.
In the op-ed published on Bloomberg News, the former mayor praised Republican nominee Mitt Romney, but said he would grudgingly vote for Obama and offered a critique of his first term in the White House.
El presupuesto del presidente rebaja en gran medida los fondos de programas garantistas de derechos.

Except it didn't destroy Trump. For all the hand-wringing and predictions of doom for his campaign, he just kept right on going – first to the Republican presidential nomination and then to the White House.

Trump wasn't afraid of slaughtering a sacred cow – or all the sacred cows! He didn't care! And they loved it.

In a strange twist, richer federal premium subsidies actually made coverage more affordable for many people. Many insurers loaded the premium increases into their silver plans, upon which premium subsidies are based. So eligible consumers received larger subsidies to put toward buying silver plans or bronze policies, which have lower premiums.

Nobody expects error-free governance, but good leaders are able to deal with mistakes, swiftly correct them, and accept independent oversight. Anything else isn't democracy, it's dictatorship. Americans in urgent need of relief during and after the pandemic need to see this stimulus plan wisely and efficiently dispatched.
He has been pretty straight forward about that. We are looking forward to the next debate, but we're running like we're five points behind him in these swing states.
Facts First: While it's unclear what measures Trump is specifically referencing when he says unprecedented effort, his administration has taken some steps previous administrations haven't and officials have credited those measures with having reduced the influx of migrants into the US.
Facts First: There had not been a 49-year push to get such a law passed before Trump : There had not been a 49-year push to get such a law passed before Trump signed it in May 2018 . (The law aims to make it easier for terminally ill patients to access medications that have not been granted final approval.) Similar laws have been passed at the state level only since 2014, after the Goldwater Institute, a libertarian think tank, began pushing for them.
Trump's trips from the White House to his golf course in nearby Virginia do require only a drive. His golf outings in Florida and New Jersey, however, require helicopter and plane flights from Washington.
On Tuesday, Trump falsely accused McCain of misleading the White House over how he would vote.
So we want to make sure that we are aware, that we can inform and that we can keep informing people that the best solution for you right now, if you have family members, if you have friends in Puerto Rico is to let them know that they should stay in safe shelter. There is no reason to go outside right now. It's too dangerous. And after the winds come by there's going to be a lot of rain which presents a lot of danger as well.
Trade the individual and employer mandates for continuous coverage requirements
And now that they have lost the majority, Republicans have virtually no chance of passing any legislation that would repeal and replace President Barack Obama's signature health care law.
Donald convinced the banks that they had a moral obligation to invest in New York and negotiated a tax abatement with the city jump starting a project and creating new construction and hotel jobs. Donald's striking new building revitalized the neighborhood.
The expectation for hostility among the candidates is understandable, given the degree of vitriol coursing through our politics these days. But from my perspective, their civility was not only welcome but smart. With a smaller number on stage, we had a chance to see more of the character and temperament of each candidate. My sense was that the extra time and exposure made most of them seem more likable and attractive.
The realities of governing have hit Trump harder than most presidents.
Health care services in the suburbs are not robust enough to fill the needs of a growing low-income population, said Charlie Gillig, supervising attorney at the Health Consumer Center of Neighborhood Legal Services of Los Angeles County.
Facts First: While some American steel companies were struggling before Trump took office and before he imposed his tariffs on steel imports in 2018, others : While some American steel companies were struggling before Trump took office and before he imposed his tariffs on steel imports in 2018, others were thriving . And Trump has regularly overstated how well American steel companies have done since his tariffs; the stock prices of major steelmakers, including Nucor, Steel Dynamics and US Steel, have fallen substantially since then.
the For four years, and with exception of a few Republican members who have been more outspoken against Trump on a consistent basis, rank-and-file members have fallen in line behind Trump.
While the Senate bill's passage could help fulfill Trump's promise to repeal and replace Obamacare and cut taxes, it would also break a host of promises he made to Americans on health care.
El Congreso podría no hacerle caso a los recortes propuestos por Trump a algunos programas que se consideran críticos y populares, como el Medicaid y los Institutos Nacionales de Salud.
And the risk the president takes, the risk to future presidencies, is that we limit the president's power to act when it really is necessary, when it is not practical to bring the Congress into session on a moment's notice.
DANA BASH, CHIEF CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT: A huge siren. It was the emergency alert system that was actually installed here in the Capitol after 9/11 that went off. Now, sometimes it goes off just for drills, but that sitting in the Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid's office which is where I was because we were just getting ready to do an interview and hearing that loud blaring siren and then it was quickly followed by a person on the speaker saying that we were to be basically in lockdown, shelter in place they said.
Among its most popular provisions are allowing young adults up to age 26 to stay on their parents' policies and protecting those with pre-existing conditions. Prior to the Affordable Care Act, Americans trying to buy insurance on their own could be turned away or charged more based on their medical histories. In addition, insurers must provide comprehensive benefits on the Obamacare exchanges.
LEMON: OK. That was your answer right there.
Warren and Sanders went at it on the can a woman win? he said/she said. Senator Warren had a great moment which will be played over and over, explaining it was only the women on stage who had never lost a race. In the end, however, both Sanders and Warren were vociferous in their certainty that indeed a woman can win the Presidency.
Then she had to drive nearly 75 miles to the City of Hope cancer center in Duarte, California, for an operation to remove it. The procedure left her partially paralyzed. I walked into the hospital and I never really walked again.
Green Party presidential nominee Jill Stein waits to be introduced prior to a press conference at the National Press Club August 23, 2016 in Washington, DC.
CAMEROTA: OK, Joe, thanks so much for the update on the Democratic side.
The Telephone Consumer Protection Act was enacted as a response to intrusive phone calls. But the ban does not cover all calls. One exemption, added by Congress in 2015, concerns calls related to debts owed to the federal government. The government argued that the provision was necessary to ensure that debts owed to the United States could be collected as quickly and efficiently as possible.
TRUMP: The 45 percent tax is a threat. It was not a tax, it was a threat. It will be a tax if they don't behave. Take China as an example. I have many friends, great manufacturers, they want to go into China. They can't. China won't let them. We talk about free trade. It's not tree free trade, it's stupid trade.
Speaking at her father's funeral last year, McCain, who didn't mention Trump by name, made several unmistakable and pointed references to him throughout her emotional remarks.
So, on day two here, when there was somewhat of a reset with the new chief of staff, you know, with the ousting of Anthony Scaramucci, it's a reminder that all of the baggage, quite frankly, that was here in the first six months remains here. So, this is something that the White House will have to contend with, and again, it's clouding the waters and, you know, really damaging their credibility.

This is nothing new, of course. As a candidate, Trump wasn't even willing to fake interest in policy specifics. This, from a July 2016 Politico piece, is indicative of his broader approach:
Nayyera Haq is a former White House senior director and State Department spokesperson under the Obama administration, Nayyera is a regular commentator on politics and current affairs. She supports Hillary Clinton.
But Abrams also brings something to politics that is often lacking — creative approaches to complex challenges, and given the current pandemic crisis we are facing, we need her creative thinking, now more than ever.
I can confirm that he is committed to replacing Obamacare with something that actually is affordable and accessible and allows you to buy health insurance over state lines, she said.

Then on Thursday, in a brief appearance before the cameras, Trump showed he had already noticed Bannon's flattery on Breitbart radio, in his only comment so far on the book: He called me a great man last night, the President said.
We must move to universal health care. And I am so proud of the work we did as a party to protect the Affordable Car Act, Klobuchar said Sunday. We are to the point now where Obamacare is more popular than the President.
Court officials sometimes minimize the justices' health problems, and plenty go unreported. And the justices have differed in their responses to public inquires.

Some 4 million fewer people would be covered in the first year the repeal would take effect, the Congressional Budget Office said last week. That number would rise to 13 million by 2027, as compared to current law. Meanwhile, premiums would rise by about 10% in most years of the decade.
Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah appears to have escaped the fate of other GOP lawmakers who faced fierce backlash from their respective state parties for reprimanding former President Donald Trump.
Related: Actually, Obamacare will be available everywhere in 2018
Supporting the Affordable Care Act, including its popular provisions that protect those with less-than-perfect health histories, helped Democrats retake the House in the midterm elections in November. Since then, the party's leaders have repeatedly said they will swiftly work to uphold the law.
CRUZ: Now, let me tell you why you can do that, because it's easy to talk about the problem, but you have to understand the solutions. The Obama administration has abused executive power in forcing common core on the states. It has used race-to-the-top funds to effectively blackmail and force the states to adopt common core.
They let you take action, the person said of the orders. It doesn't take place of something statutory.
But while average premiums would go down in those later years, the relief would not be universal. Premiums would go up for older Americans and down for younger Americans.

These provisions were among Obamacare's most popular reforms, but they were also one of the main reasons why coverage on the individual market became so pricey. That has made these protections a target.
All the while, a growing number Republican members of Congress have been publicly pushing back on Trump's comments, defending McCain.
MORGAN: 800,000 federal workers are furloughed because of the shutdown. It's a big number. That's important to put (ph) a face to the suffering. Tom Penders is an employee at military base. He's also the sole provider of this family of four. And he joins me now.
Roberts, who voted in 2012 to save the law, might question whether the entire law needed to be invalidated, the liberal thinking goes.
But for the last eight months, members of the commission that was appointed to try to come up with a solution has been meeting trying to figure out a way of preventing something like this from happening again.
Trump's remark about the funeral came as the President has continued to denigrate the dead senator's legacy.
The CBO score could also pressure Republicans to consider going back to the negotiating table to find a path forward on their more comprehensive health care bill, which would leave 22 million more Americans uninsured over the next decade. That is what President Trump asked them to do on Wednesday during their lunch at the White House, though earlier in the week he called for lawmakers to repeal the Obamacare now and replace it later.
Trump is an incorrigible acclaim-seeker who has been open about his desire for a Nobel. At his January 9 rally, he claimed that he was a more deserving recipient than Ahmed -- not for some other initiative of his own but because, he suggested, he was the one who actually made Ethiopia's big deal. I made a deal. I saved a country, and I just heard that the head of that country is now getting the Nobel Peace Prize for saving the country, he complained.

The massively high stakes are why you see both President Donald Trump and former President Barack Obama – as well as a number of Democrats who would like to take on Trump in 2020 – getting involved in the race as it reaches its conclusion. Anyone who is anyone – or wants to be anyone – is making sure their voice is heard in Alabama right about now.
Facts First: Trump's claim about protecting those with pre-existing conditions is false. Though Trump says he would do this, his administration has consistently taken steps to undermine the Affordable Care Act -- including joining a lawsuit aimed at striking down the law -- without presenting alternative plans that would offer similar benefits.
She later added, We live in an era where we knock down old American heroes for all their imperfections when no leader wants to admit to fault or failure.
CAMEROTA: Michael, the video is just incredible. The aerial shots of what it looks like today. Thank you very much for the reporting from there.
But in this specific case he's right, that, you know, the kind of negotiation Republicans are trying to ask for right now it's not productive and the reasons they're asking for it is because they feel the only way they can impose their agenda is by getting it through this kind of hostage situation.

Facts First: Trump has not eliminated the federal estate tax. His 2017 tax law : Trump has not eliminated the federal estate tax. His 2017 tax law raised the threshold at which the tax must be paid, from $5.5 million to $11.2 million for an individual, but did not get rid of the tax entirely. It's also misleading to suggest that the estate tax had been a particular burden on farms and small businesses; very few of them were paying the tax even before Trump's changes came into effect.

DRUCKER: Plus, the low expectations everyone had for him and his policies are more popular than he is conceptually. That's a total reverse from Obama. People liked Obama, but not so much his policies. He never moved away from a campaign. Whether it be a Twitter or periodic campaign rallies. He goes after the Democrats like we are in the middle of a campaign. He is planning to engage in more of that if Republicans will have him. It will be difficult for the president to ever be in a different political situation than now. Republicans will need heavy turnout and enthusiasm. We will have seen all that was with the Democrats.

However, these plans also don't have to adhere to all of Obamacare's rules, particularly the one requiring insurers to offer comprehensive coverage. These plans would likely have lower premiums, but they would also provide fewer benefits – which could leave sicker and older workers out in the cold. Also, the offerings could be less attractive to young women if they don't cover maternity benefits.

It's already sure to be a focal point of the 2020 election. The law's future is at the center of the Democratic presidential primary, with more moderate candidates like former Vice President Joe Biden and former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg saying they want to expand on Obamacare by allowing Americans to buy into a Medicare-style public insurance option. More progressive candidates like Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren say they favor scrapping private insurance altogether for a government-run single-payer Medicare for All system.
Trump argues that he is building the most inclusive society in the world. But he has repeatedly said nice things about white nationalists and he has made the guiding principle of his political career to keep immigrants out of the country.

The atmosphere is very tense. Democrats aren't applauding. As Trump boasted about welfare stats, Democrats were heard objecting. Republicans howled in support.
YANG: Another tweet this morning also is when he said that we have all these trade deals with countries who aren't helping us and it shouldn't be lost that they're looking at steel tariffs and accusing China of dumping steel.
Toward the end of this town hall debate that featured relatively few questions from the audience, Trump described the American nuclear program as we're old, we're tired, we're exhausted. He could have been describing his sub-par performance.
But I will say, trade deals are absolutely killing our country. The devaluations of their currencies by China and Japan and many, many other countries, and we don't do it because we don't play the game. and the only way we're going to be able to do it is we're going to have to do taxes unless they behave.
BARONE: Well, I think the Republicans made a miscalculation by raising the issue of defunding ObamaCare, it polled poorly voters truly didn't want it, delay ObamaCare polls better I think that probably would have been a foolish thing for them to go on a ...
[22:00:00] CHRIS CUOMO, CNN HOST: Thank you for watching. CNN TONIGHT with D. Lemon starts right now. There is a lot of news to unpack.
Facts First: Trump was almost certainly referring to A Very Stable Genius, a new book by Washington Post journalists Philip Rucker and Carol Leonnig. The book has not been proven to be inaccurately reported, nor has there been any sign that the authors are embarrassed about anything they included.
CUOMO: Now, maybe too little too late, but I'll tell you something. I was raised by a governor, and I got one now as my best friend in my brother. That is what governors do. They do have the ability to get people in a room and lock the door and say, We're going to figure this out right now before the press gets to it. That was an interesting insight that no one else on that stage would make.
That has worried some navigator groups, who weren't prepared to keep increased staffing levels beyond the traditional open enrollment period in November and December.
I. TRUMP: For my father to step away from a company that he's deeply committed to in favor of running for elected office was a real sacrifice for him.
The tour is being funded by Our Country Deserves Better, a conservative political action committee.
Well, I don't trust you anymore. I don't trust you anymore. You -- I'm not going to say lied to me, but you didn't tell me and you knew.
But he (Bloomberg) had a deal with Hillary Clinton that he was going to become Secretary of State. It was very simple. People know that. And it wasn't going to happen. It was going to go to Terry McAuliffe. I mean, so they were playing with Michael. -- January 22 interview with CNBC's Joe Kernen
La plataforma educativa de Biden aumentaría los fondos para las escuelas en áreas de bajos ingresos, ayudaría a los maestros a pagar su deuda educativa y duplicaría el número de profesionales de la salud que trabajan en las escuelas.
A US Navy investigation into the incident concluded that the sailors were 1.5 nautical miles from Iran's Farsi Island, clearly within Iranian waters. It was reasonable for Iran to investigate the unusual appearance of armed U.S. Naval vessels within territorial waters so close to its shores, the investigation concluded . (The investigation also faulted Iran for its handling of the incident, but its criticism of Iran was not at all about where the sailors were located.) An illustrated map released by the US Navy also makes clear that the sailors were not mere feet from that line when they were stopped by Iran. Iranian and US officials told media outlets at the time that Iran's territorial waters extend 12 nautical miles from the island, a standard distance
CUOMO: David Gregory, as a writer of things religious, did you feel any kind of connection with Donald Trump in the after-action interview when he said that he is getting audited by the IRS because of his faith?
Biden, however, reopened enrollment to give the uninsured another chance to select policies during the coronavirus pandemic, and his administration is pouring $50 million into marketing and outreach to let people know about the opportunity. CMS is also providing about $2.3 million to 30 navigator organizations to assist consumers with enrollment, the agency announced this week.
Over 130 legislators in this chamber have endorsed legislation that would bankrupt our Nation by providing free taxpayer-funded healthcare to millions of illegal aliens, forcing taxpayers to subsidize free care for anyone in the world who unlawfully crosses our borders. These proposals would raid the Medicare benefits our seniors depend on, while acting as a powerful lure for illegal immigration. This is what is happening in California and other States – their systems are totally out of control, costing taxpayers vast and unaffordable amounts of money. If forcing American taxpayers to provide unlimited free healthcare to illegal aliens sounds fair to you, then stand with the radical left. But if you believe that we should defend American patients and American seniors, then stand with me and pass legislation to prohibit free Government healthcare for illegal aliens!
So before you cut your ties to the workforce, I recommend that you answer the five questions below that make up my Are You Really Ready To Retire? Checklist.
The Battle Creek arena had a capacity of about 5,500 for the Trump event, according to the city and local media . Brooks Hepp, a current Enquirer reporter, said in an email that he did not see the size of the overflow crowd at its peak, but he said the overflow area could not hold anywhere near 20,000 people, so that number is likely inaccurate. He said he would offer a rough guess of probably 2,000-3,000 people at its peak and 1,000 by the time Trump started his speech.
However, plans would not be allowed to set premiums based on workers' health status, which critics of the executive order had feared.
After some last-minute changes to the legislation, enough conservatives and moderates were convinced to support the bill Thursday.
Over the weekend, Trump attacked the late senator in several tweets that targeted McCain's ties to the controversial Russia dossier and his vote against repealing Obamacare. He also referred to McCain as being last in his class at the US Naval Academy.
A total of 1,991 pledged delegates are needed to win the nomination at the first convention ballot.
William Chavez, 62, said he is voting for Sanders and cited the senator's support of the Green New Deal, tuition-free colleges, and Medicare for All as reasons why he supports him.
PITTENGER: Thank you. Great to be with you. TAPPER: Our money lead. Just how much did this partial government shutdown end up costing us? Keep in mind that this is Washington, where even doing nothing is a pricey proposition.
Bloomberg did call the final Obamacare bill a disgrace during a July 2010 event at Dartmouth College, just months after the law's passage. Bloomberg added that the law did absolutely nothing to fix the big health care problems calling it just another program that's going to cost a lot more money.

In the letter to DOJ, Bertolini said Aetna has been operating in the exchanges at a substantial loss and said it would be some time before we recoup our investment.
The Affordable Care Act also boosted enrollment in insurers' Medicaid divisions, which are generally profitable, experts said. States are increasingly contracting with insurers to manage the health care needs of their Medicaid enrollees, said Larry Levitt, a senior vice president at Kaiser. This includes the more than 11 million low-income adults who entered the program through Medicaid expansion.
MORGAN: ... I don't think it is principle to shut down the American government over the established law like ObamaCare. It's not principle. BARRO: The principle is that they don't like the law. I'm not saying that it's a good principle or a good strategy for pursuing the principle but they do have an endgame here. They want ObamaCare repealed. The problem is they all -- all the Republicans know they're not going to repeal that ...
KASICH: Well, look, all I'm in favor of in Ohio is high standards. First of all, let me tell you, I would take 125 federal education programs, put them in four buckets, and send them back to the states. OK, I've been working on this for many, many years.
That's colorful. That's always sort of interesting. But I mean, so you -- is there any -- are there any repercussions from the escalating rhetoric?
By then, he had already promised universal coverage. When he was a presidential candidate in 2015, Trump told CBS's Scott Pelley on 60 Minutes that everybody's got to be covered. He conceded that it may be an un-Republican thing to say, but he wanted to ensure that everyone had quality health care.
Facts First: The decline -- shown in the Consumer Price Index, but not some other measures -- happened in 2018, not last year. And Trump was exaggerating how long it had been since the 2018 decline; it had been 46 years, not 51. (This may seem like a small exaggeration, but it is habitual; he has made it more than a dozen times since July 8. You can read a longer fact check : The decline -- shown in the Consumer Price Index, but not some other measures -- happened in 2018, not last year.

No one presented better arguments on a more consistent basis, retired Justice Sandra Day O'Connor once wrote of Roberts' style as an appellate advocate standing before the nine justices.
CNN's Brianna Keilar explains why many Republicans are hesitant to take the coronavirus vaccine.
The meeting has also included presentations from House Armed Services Chair Mac Thornberry, who touted the major increase in defense spending, and House Appropriations Chair Rodney Freylinghusen, who walked through the key components of the bill.
Their dueling votes showcase a diversity of thought, the statement said.
That's why Republicans should build on America's exceptional health care legacy. In replacing Obamacare, they should stay true to conservative principles and start with a foundation of the successful ideas that have both expanded Americans' health care choices and driven the innovations that are helping many of us to live longer and healthier lives.
DAVID CLARK JR., SHERIFF: What I see out of Donald Trump, it starts with a message, it starts with a positive message of respect for the American law enforcement officers. What we need from our national leaders and that's for when I'm getting it right now.
THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.
Bloomberg advocated stop and frisk even after a federal judge ruled in 2013 that the way New York was using stop and frisk was unconstitutional. He began apologizing for stop and frisk in November 2019, the month he launched his presidential campaign, saying he only belatedly realized that too many innocent people were being harmed. However, his account of what happened has left out important information.
LEMON: So, the government is in a shutdown right now, but someone in Washington is still working. And that man is special counsel Robert Mueller. Mueller and his team are still chugging along in their investigation into possible coordination between the Trump campaign and Russia and any other possible crimes that have come up along the way.
Instead of advocating for a $5 billion vanity project, a wall, she's going to see that a wall already exists in El Paso and that those resources could be better spent in taking care of people.
During a joint appearance with her mother on ABC's The View, Meghan McCain said the moment made her feel naïve following a conversation she had with the President last fall.
[21:55:05] I mean for those millions of iPhone users who see this as an invasion of their privacy, what do say?
In Washington, the number of new enrollees jumped by more than 50% in the first week, while visits to the state's exchange rose 24%, as compared to a year ago.
Recent statistics show a continued rise in drug prices, so Trump harkened back to a data point he mentioned at last year's State of the Union.
It's rebuilt completely. We spent $2.5 trillion. -- January 17 fundraiser (audio obtained by CNN's Kevin Liptak)
The former aide also speculated about why only a few Republicans have criticized Trump's comments, saying that it's likely because they don't want to get in the Twitter crosshairs.
Anthony Scaramucci, the only man among Trump's new additions, is the founder of SkyBridge Capital, an investment firm that controls about $12.5 billion.
MECKLER: It's a lot of conservative groups that are out there. Think tanks. The kind of support you would expect that you would have for a piece of major legislation. Paul Ryan is really in a bind here. This is his moment. He's been talking about this for so long. They've had years to talk about how they would replace the Affordable Care Act if they had the chance. Now they have the chance. Sort of the all - everything's in place for this legislative action to go forward. And if he can't get it through, that's going to be a - just a huge defeat for him. And I think that it - but it stands in I think real contrast to what we saw in 2009 when President Obama was trying to pass the law in the first place and you saw an incredible effort having learned from President Clinton's failed effort to try to round up supportive groups and really try to keep everybody in the tent. And, obviously, they barely did it, but they did do it. I just wonder, given how difficult it was for Obama to get it over the line, whether when they're starting out -
LEMON: He hasn't offended you as a person who happens to be a person of color.
Also it doesn't make a lot of sense to me, why Paul Manafort felt the need to reach out to people in the Trump administration directly when his attorneys were talking to Trump's team. I mean the safe way to communicate when you're under investigation and certainly when you're under indictment is through your attorney to other attorneys. Those conversations could have been protected by common interest privilege.

Trump claimed three times that the unemployment rate is at its lowest level in over 51 years.
For many people aspiring to retire early, getting and maintaining health insurance can be a major stumbling block. The reason: You're not eligible for Medicare until you hit 65. So if you retire before that date and don't have coverage through a former employer (or, if you're married, through a spouse's current or former employer), you'll have to buy health care coverage on your own. That can be a budget wrecker, which is why it's imperative you have a good idea of what the tab for health insurance will be before you actually leave your job.
My thinking is it's fine to go through the atrocities of the past election, Schlapp said. But better to rally folks to stop Biden policies.
But Mitch McConnell who has come out so strongly in favor of congressional authority, the national emergency that's going on is that the president is usurping the constitution and taking away the power of Congress for a fake emergency.
COOPER: What kind of mom was she?
Cruz ha estado argumentando durante varios meses que él es el candidato mejor posicionado para unificar el Partido Republicano de cara a las elecciones en noviembre. Pero su apoyo entre sus muchos colegas en la Cámara y el Senado ha sido tibio, si acaso, y solo unos cuantos senadores lo han apoyado.
Facts First: Obama didn't sign DACA, which was neither a bill nor an executive order; the program was created through a : Obama didn't sign DACA, which was neither a bill nor an executive order; the program was created through a memo by Obama's then-Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano. And while Obama had, earlier in his presidency, said he could not unilaterally suspend the deportation of undocumented high school students, he obviously did not say at the time DACA was created that he did not have the right to create it.
John McCain was tortured for more than five years in Vietnam and survived for more than a year after being diagnosed with brain cancer in 2017.
COOPER: But on the health care thing that we just talked about, I know his spokesman corrected him afterward. Why did he need to be corrected? You would think he would know what his position is saying that during the debate. Was that an attempt to kind of appeal to a wider range of people or is that also a misstatement?
MARQUARDT: And of course this is the kind of policy that the President has trumpeted numerous times --
It's why we've got to get beyond rhetoric of China bad, and actually get to how do you solve the problem. Because this solution would hurt jobs and hurt hard-working taxpayers in America.
As of mid-September 2014, World Health Organization (WHO) researchers reported that there was an estimated fatality rate of 70.8%. But the rate fell later in the epidemic with lessons learned in improving treatment, said Julie Fischer, associate research professor in the Department of Microbiology and Immunology at Georgetown University and director of the Elizabeth R. Griffin Program. Still, even at 70.8%, death was never guaranteed for infected people, as Trump suggested when he said if you got Ebola, that was it.
Who appointed these people king? Clinton asked.
I want to build on the momentum that we saw here in 2018, Klobuchar told reporters Saturday in Wisconsin. No one ever thought that the Democrats were going to be able (to defeat) Gov. Walker, but we did it, and we did it in a smart, Wisconsin way with a grassroots campaign with (Democratic Sen.) Tammy Baldwin at the top of the ticket, and we can do it in the presidential, as well.
and presidency are all under investigation.
All eyes are on the Senate. House Republicans, who passed a comprehensive repeal-and-replace bill, say that if something is going to happen on health care it will have to come from across the Capitol.
Schlapp acknowledged that much of the conference will be devoted to Trump's claims about the election. He said it would be better if conference participants also focused on Biden's agenda, though.
Trump's claim is correct, but it needs context. Drug overdose deaths declined in 2018 for the first time since 1990, 28 years prior. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that there were 67,367 drug overdose deaths in the United States in 2018, a 4.1% decline from 70,237 deaths in 2017. Read more
RUBIO: No, I support free trade deals that are good for America. We're 5 percent of the world's population. If all we do is sell things to each other, we can only sell to 5 percent of the people on earth. We have to have access to the hundreds of millions of people in the world today who can afford to buy things.
Grateful for this strong, eloquent ruling defending Kentuckians' religious liberty from Judge Justin Walker, @POTUS's outstanding nominee for the D.C. Circuit.

Facts First: Trump was correct about Steyer's : Trump was correct about Steyer's Iowa showing but understated Steyer's New Hampshire showing. Steyer got 3.6% of the vote in the New Hampshire primary, not less than 3%.
You can avoid the penalty if you qualify for one of the health law's several exemptions. For instance, you may be exempt if you were uninsured for less than three consecutive months of the previous year, if your income is low enough that you're not required to file a federal tax return or if you belong to a health care sharing ministry.
SCARAMUCCI: That's a completely contrived opinion. That's like the tobacco company saying that smoking is good for you.
We have basically a few options in front of us.
Which brings me to Tuesday and Trump's comments about McCain, who died in August 2018 after a battle with brain cancer. Here's all of what Trump said:
MATT VISER, THE BOSTON GLOBE: It's also that, you know, looking at Trump's business career, his past background in his relationships with people were often transactional. And -- but they would sign a dotted line and move on. This is a different case with Xi, where he's trying to sort of move him in a certain direction, develop a relationship where you can sort of move somebody in a certain direction. And they don't seem to have that bond or that trust. And so what does President Trump do? People are -- there's more talk about maybe diplomacy. You know, do you head in a diplomatic direction. But, again, Trump was sort of very critical of the Iran deal, which was all about diplomacy and sort of tamping down nuclear threats. And that's sort of where he's at right now and does he head down that diplomatic path in a way that he criticized in the past.
The federal government began funding 100% of the cost of the expanded enrollment nationwide, but it will be stepping down to 90% by 2020. But, with the Trump administration and Republicans in Congress on course to repeal, and potentially replace, Obamacare, all of that funding for Medicaid expansion could go out the window.
SCARAMUCCI: I think that's pretty upfront. He just happens to be sharing with 113 million people. CUOMO: But he's not even talking to Jeff Sessions? He goes to Twitter, one of his earliest supporters?
Last week, Kelly busted Kushner down from a top secret/sensitive compartmented information interim clearance to a merely secret one. Now a source tells CNN that Kushner is feeling at sea, a marked man confused by his diminished role. His question for colleagues: Why is John Kelly doing this?
Last weekend, Trump attacked McCain in several tweets that targeted his ties to the controversial Russia dossier and his vote against repealing Obamacare. He also referred to McCain as being last in his class at the US Naval Academy.
One case concerns a New York prosecutor's grand jury subpoena to Trump's longtime accounting firm, Mazars USA for his financial documents. Trump's personal lawyers argue he has broad immunity from such investigations.
The administration pushed back on the report.
The disadvantage: These policies can exclude those with pre-existing conditions or base rates on consumers' medical history. They can also offer skimpier benefits so policyholders may have to pay more out of pocket if they actually need care.
COOPER: Welcome back. Some breaking news, we just learned new information about that motorcycle mayhem here in New York. An undercover New York City police officer was one of the bikers on the ride. He allegedly witnessed the confrontation, a biker smashing in the driver's side window of an SUV, caught by another biker's helmet cam. The officer was off duty at the time, a member of a bikers club. A source telling our Susan Candiotti tonight the officer did not intervene to stop the confrontation and did not tell his superiors that he was there until Wednesday. It's unclear if he violated police department policy by waiting so long to report it. Internal affairs is investigating.
The campaign also spent big on rent for their 200-plus offices across the country, including more than 100 just in Super Tuesday states. According to one aide, Bloomberg's team paid around $44,000 a month for just one office in Charlotte, North Carolina, an opulent expense that most campaigns wouldn't even consider spending on a state-based office.
security, Chuck. I will take the mantle. I will be the one to shut it down. I'm not going to blame you for it.
But Trump has been obstinate in the face of those political warning signs, instead concerned that repealing and replacing Obamacare remains the one signature 2016 campaign promise he has yet to make good on.
March 4, 2015 - On CNN's New Day, Carson asserts that homosexuality is a choice because people go into prison straight – and when they come out, they're gay. He later apologizes for his comments, but says that the science is still murky on the issue.
When it's sitting there waiting for you, but it's very bad. It's very bad for business in terms of - and it's very bad for our workers and it's unfair for our workers. And we should end it. Very importantly, the Disney workers endorsed me, as you probably read.
MAGGIE HABERMAN, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST: I don't think that the remarks that are said publicly about -- by administration officials about what President Trump says are always the most genuine.

The lottery for US green cards is : Trump was vague here, but he suggested -- as he has previously claimed explicitly -- that it is foreign countries, they, who conduct lotteries for immigration to the US. The lottery for US green cards is conducted by the US State Department , not by other governments.
SCARAMUCCI: I'm not going to answer that question because --
Of course we are worried. Look, she has two babies, this woman tells us. The kids were practically slipping off the raft.
CUOMO: All right, Joe. So we have Rocket Man on one side, dotard on the other. War of words. The question is, where does it lead?
Trump twice claimed to have gotten the Veterans Choice health care program passed into law. On one occasion, he said others had tried to do so for over 40 years. On the other, he said they had tried for almost 50 years.
The United States condemns the actions of the Maduro dictatorship and we hold Maduro personally responsible for the health and safety of both men and any others seized by his dictatorship.
MA plans are able to achieve higher satisfaction and better outcomes for an equal or lower cost because they better manage care and effectively negotiate costs for everything from doctors and hospitals to prescription medicines. The cost-effectiveness of MA plans also has positive, spill-over effects on traditional Medicare. A recent study in the journal Health Affairs found that the greater the penetration of Medicare Advantage in a particular market, the lower the costs for traditional Medicare patients there.
SNELL: This has been very difficult for them to get through controversial nominees. We've seen a lot of nominees get through on very narrow votes. We've seen the Vice President have to break more ties his than several of his predecessors combined.
He's hitting something that is socially unnatural. And so what is that? You're attacking somebody that died seven months ago, Scaramucci told CNN's John Berman on New Day. Now, I understand the point and I understand the grievance that the President's bringing up, but you're not scoring any points with anybody.
Journalists with a Pentagon facility access card, and whom have entered the building prior to 1:30 p.m. EDT, may go through security screening at the River Entrance to obtain their wristband. All journalists wishing to cover the honor cordon, including those with a Pentagon facility access card, must be in place no later than 2:15 p.m. EDT. Once security screening has been initiated at the base of the bridge, all journalists entering the building via the bridge for any reason, including those with a Pen
Allow states to institute work requirement for Medicaid. States would now have the option of requiring able-bodied Medicaid recipients to work, participate in job training programs or do community service. Pregnant women, children under the age of 19, single parents of children under age six and single parents of children with disabilities are exempt.
The final part of my agenda is to protect America's National Security.
REP. BETO O'ROURKE (D), TEXAS: I have been thinking about running for president.
In 2000, George W. Bush made his first appearance at CPAC, winning over the crowd with a speech criticizing outgoing President Bill Clinton while on his way to winning the GOP nomination and then the presidency later that year. Twelve years later, during his own successful bid to be the Republican nominee, Mitt Romney touted to the CPAC crowd his severely conservative record as Massachusetts governor.
We're going to take a quick break.
Facts First: Guzmán, the notorious Mexican drug lord, was indeed : Guzmán, the notorious Mexican drug lord, was indeed held in solitary confinement at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in Manhattan before his trial. l In a 2017 court filing in which his lawyers sought to get him taken out of solitary, they said that he spent 23 hours of every weekday in a small cell with no windows and all 24 hours of weekend days in that cell. He was not allowed any contact with other prisoners.
But the Congressional Budget Office, the nonpartisan scorekeeper on Capitol Hill, released its best guess in its official score of the legislation, and some of the numbers are quite large. Below are some key figures from the report. You can read the entire document here.
Pelosi: I think it's a gift to the Republicans. … Because people really want to know how we will improve their lives. We don't really know what Mueller has. We have a responsibility, if we have information, to act upon it. But we don't know what Mueller has.
REP. NANETTE DIAZ BARRAGAN (D-CA), HOMELAND SECURITY COMMITTEE: We need Virginians to have somebody that can lead in that position. And that's my concern.
President Donald Trump complained Wednesday that he didn't receive a thank you for approving the funeral the late Sen. John McCain wanted, marking his latest grievance in his recent onslaught against the Arizona Republican.
We need vocational education starting in the seventh grade where kids can get that kind of education that can take them to college, but all the way through their K through 12 they ought to be connected with real-world jobs.
Biden's special Obamacare enrollment period opened today. Here's what you need to know.
The American Rescue Plan provides heftier federal premium subsidies for Affordable Care Act policies for two years. About 15 million uninsured Americans will be eligible for financial assistance, as will those who have Obamacare coverage but earned too much to qualify for subsidies.
Facts First: Trump referred inaccurately to Muhandis -- a : Trump referred inaccurately to Muhandis -- a founder of Iraq-based militant group Kataib Hezbollah, which is separate from the Lebanon-based militant group Hezbollah. The head of Hezbollah, Hassan Nasrallah, was not with Soleimani and is still alive. It's possible that Trump was confused because Soleimani had met with Nasrallah in Beirut in the days before the airstrike, according to Nasrallah
SANDERS: Again, I'm not going to broadcast. As Secretary Mnuchin said yesterday, we'll consider all options and keep you guys updated.
Muchos profesionales del gobierno están haciendo todo lo posible en una emergencia sin precedentes, pero los primeros días del plan de rescate no son alentadores. Los trabajadores de restaurantes, desempleados de repente, con familias que alimentar, pueden no recibir el cheque prometido de US$ 1.200 por meses. A pesar de los votos para que las personas contaran con el dinero en dos semanas, parece que podría tomar 20 semanas, es decir, cuatro meses, que los cheques sean enviados por correo.
This election, this debate is not about insults. It's not about attacks. It's not about any of the individuals on this stage. This election is about you and your children. It's about the freedom America has always had and making sure that that freedom is there for the next generation, that we stop Washington from standing in the way of the hard-working taxpayers of America.
Notably, Donald Verrilli, who defended the law as former President Barack Obama's solicitor general and is now in private practice, is also on the brief representing the House.
At the same time that Sanders was rallying voters and leading a march to an early voting location, former Vice President Joe Biden took the microphone at a middle school gymnasium just a 10-minute drive away. Attendance at his Latino-focused phone-banking event was sparse, filled in part with footsoldiers from California who had come to the state to help canvass for him.
Facts First: The Veterans Choice bill, a bipartisan initiative led by senators Bernie Sanders and the late John McCain, was : The Veterans Choice bill, a bipartisan initiative led by senators Bernie Sanders and the late John McCain, was signed into law by Obama in 2014.

Anthem (ANTX), one of the largest Obamacare players, has said it is reviewing its involvement in the 14 states where it currently participates. The insurer has filed to be on the exchanges in some states for 2018, but it could still pull out. Anthem is a Blue Cross and Blue Shield company, which has served the individual market for more than seven decades.
COOPER: It probably still doesn't seam real.
Her only specific solution is to ask the highest-income Americans to pay more, including options to tax some of their income above the current Social Security cap, and taxing some of their income not currently taken into account by the Social Security system.
SCARAMUCCI: We're going back to the mean word, which is fine. That shows what the president's compassion and it shows you the president's heart.
There needs to be some degree of accountability. It should be accountability based on outcomes. Hold us accountable for having healthier people.
It's hard to measure this stuff, but one metric is the socially conservative American Family Association's annual list of retailers that it considers naughty or nice when it comes to its willingness to use the word Christmas in promotional materials. Not one of the 17 naughty companies the AFA listed in a press release in December 2015 , the year Trump launched his presidential campaign, had been promoted to nice on the 2019 list, though two had moved from naughty to marginal.
Biden propone pagar el proyecto de ley elevando los impuestos sobre la renta de los estadounidenses más ricos al 39,6%, revirtiendo parte de la Ley de reducción de impuestos apoyada por un Congreso de mayoría republicana en 2017, y al exigir a quienes ganan más de un millón de dólares al año que paguen 39,6% de impuestos sobre las ganancias de capital, en lugar del 20% actual.
He takes his role as the leader of the party very seriously, White House political director Bill Stepien said in an interview. He loved the campaign trail last year. He loves governing. I am sure he is going to love to get back to the campaign trail next year.

Republicans have been targeting Becerra since his selection was announced. Arkansas Sen. Tom Cotton on Monday launched a digital advertisement in Georgia and New Hampshire tying Becerra to California's response to the pandemic -- while pressuring any lawmakers up for election next cycle.
There is purposely nothing that all the people who put their names on the website are going to all agree to – their interests are more purposely diverse. This isn't a convening body which is aiming to forge a tepid consensus. These are people who know that it's going to be OK to publicly to disagree.
As she has in prior debates, Klobuchar asserted Wednesday that she's won elections in Republican-held areas.
Donald Trump is a perverse man who is perverting not only our democracy but the very concept of truth. He tried to win the debate just like one wins a limbo contest — by lowering the bar. That should depress all of us.
COOPER: Well, George and Heather, again, you know, speaking to us just one day after the memorial service for Lillian, I appreciate you being on again. We are so sorry for your loss.
It's no secret we disagree on a whole lot of issues, both political and philosophical, but that doesn't mean we can't or don't work together or that I don't admire the qualities that have helped make him the longest serving Republican leader, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York said on the chamber floor.

WASHINGTON, DC - JUNE 26: U.S. Sen. Susan Collins (R-ME) attends a lunch meeting for Republican lawmakers in the Cabinet Room at the White House June 26, 2018 in Washington, DC. The president called the Supreme Court's 5-4 ruling in favor of the administration's travel ban a tremendous victory, according to published reports. (Photo by Al Drago-Pool/Getty Images)
Trump complained about a controversial research dossier compiled by former British spy Christopher Steele, calling it the fake dossier, then added, And now Christopher Steele admits that it's a fake because he got sued by rich people. I should have sued him too. -- February 6 speech on Senate impeachment acquittal
So, we've gone a while and I think the reason you're seeing Trump tweet so much right now is because he knows he's losing this war right now. And his leverage is only going to decrease as soon as Nancy Pelosi takes the speaker's gavel because she's going to pass over and over again a bill that will reopen the government and you know, the pressure is going to be increased tremendously on Mitch McConnell in the Senate to put that on the floor and reopen the government. And it's just going to look increasingly bad for the president.
ANGUS: Thank you. Our biggest concern was definitely putting a face to the statistics because this is more than just numbers. These are human beings and loved ones and people. Hopefully, by sharing our story, we're able to help bring more awareness to this to get stricter guidelines going forward.
The US vaccination effort has ramped up in meaningful ways in recent weeks. Nationwide, we've maintained a seven-day average of about 1.6 million doses per day.

They are outsourcing the entire tech division to a consulting company. They are making the argument that we didn't replace you. We just replaced the whole unit by hiring a company to do it instead. And that company that they're hiring is bringing their workers from abroad. It's a loophole they've figured out that we need to close so they can no longer continue to do it that way.

A federal appeals court ruled last year in favor of the political organizations, holding that the government-debt exception to the law violated the First Amendment because it banned some calls based on content, but allowed other types. The Justice Department, the court held, failed to provide a compelling reason for the law and it had other means to collect the government debt.
Adding insult to injury, he then went into an incredulous rant about Hillary's deleted emails. It was an entirely legitimate attack until he vowed that if elected, he would instruct his attorney general to appoint a special prosecutor to pursue her and that if he were President today, she would be in jail.

Facts First: That simply wasn't true. There were an : That simply wasn't true. There were an insufficient number of tests available , as Vice President Mike Pence acknowledged the day prior, and Americans could not get tested simply because they wanted to get tested. You may not get a test unless a doctor or public health official prescribes a test, Azar said the day after Trump's remark -- and even some of the people whose doctors wanted them to be tested were not able to obtain a test. (Azar claimed Trump was using shorthand for the fact that we as regulators, or as those shipping the test, are not restricting who can get tested.)
Trump told reporters: We want to terminate health care for-- under Obamacare because it's bad, and we're replacing it with a great health care at far less money and it includes preexisting conditions. All the while, his administration has not yet put forward an alternative to the ACA.
Nearly 11.8 million people selected coverage for this year on the federal and state-based exchanges during a shortened open enrollment period, according to official data released Tuesday by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. That's down only 3.8%, much less than some advocates of the health reform law initially feared.
They can also impose annual or lifetime limits, meaning they may only pay out a set amount – often $1 million or less – leaving the policyholder on the hook for the rest. And, unlike Obamacare policies, they don't have to cap consumers' cost-sharing burden at $7,350 for 2018.
Under (Cuban leader Fidel) Castro, enormous progress has been made in improving the lives of the poor people (and) of the working people, Sanders said. On the other hand, in terms of democratic rights, there are enormous deficiencies.
So Elie -- Flynn was one of the first people in Trump's inner circle to cooperate extensively as both his team and the Mueller have said at the highest level. He was cooperating. He was part of the campaign. He's part of the transition. He's part of the administration. Does it looks like this is a test case for other potential cooperators?
Hillary's team shouldn't yet measure the drapes in the Oval Office, but I bet their transition folks are now working with fresh energy. Victory -- and perhaps a big one -- seems almost within their grasp.
The EU was launched in 1993, on the shoulders of the European Communities, to promote peace and prosperity in the post-Cold War era, an era also of rapid globalization. American officials may have had their doubts about the feasibility of monetary union, and about the possibility of a Common (European) Security and Defense Policy, but the US Administration strongly supported further European integration in the 1990s, Dinan said.

Academic studies have associated Part D coverage with decreases in hospital admissions and over $2 billion in savings due to improved drug adherence among patients with congestive heart failure. The government doesn't directly negotiate drug prices in Part D of Medicare, nor does it set the cost of the benefit. Instead, health plans and PBMs negotiate prices with drug manufacturers and then compete with one another based on price and quality, for market share. As a result, Part D is the rare federal program that has come in under-budget. According to the Congressional Budget Office, total program costs between 2004-2013 were 45 percent less than original projections.
Governor Greg Abbott today held a press conference in Houston on the importance of election integrity legislation this session. The Governor named election integrity as an emergency legislative item during his State of the State address in February. Governor Abbott was joined for the press conference by Senator Paul Bettencourt and Representative Briscoe Cain, who have both filed several pieces of legislation to enhance election integrity in Texas
Support for Sanders' bill, which won 16 co-sponsors in 2017 after attracting none only a few years earlier, was framed by many on the left as a signal of the party's move left on healthcare and, in the context of a primary fight many have spent two years gaming out, his lead role in driving the debate. In speeches during the early phase of this second presidential campaign, Sanders has frequently reminded supporters that single-payer health care, an idea deemed too radical by the political establishment, has moved to the mainstream in the wake of his 2016 campaign.
Bloomberg takes on Trump's coronavirus response
So not only did we have a balanced budget in Washington, but when I went to Ohio, we were $8 billion in the hole and now we're $2 billion in the black. Our credit is strong. We're up 400,000 jobs. And I want to go back with the same formula to beat the Washington insiders again.
As Congressman Green said -- Al Green. He's a beauty. As Congressman Green said, 'We got to beat him by impeachment because we can't beat him in the election.' -- January 22 press conference in Davos, Switzerland
TRUMP: No, I think this should be settled. By the way, if the supreme court would do a great favor to this country and say the President should not have done that, we will settle this whole thing, including really a big immigration policy, not just border security, which is very important. Because we would do something with DACA. A lot of the Republicans, most Republicans are fine with some deal on DACA. DACA's OK. These are people that have been in the country a long time. In many cases they don't even speak the language of the country from which their parents came.
The next major priority for me, and for all of us, should be to lower the cost of healthcare and prescription drugs – and to protect patients with pre-existing conditions.

I think it's stupid. I'm being very declarative here. I think it's stupid, Scaramucci, whose short-lived tenure as White House communications director imploded due to his combative personality, said later. There's no strategy that you can tell – other than the fact that you're frustrated and you want to ventilate your frustrations into the international airwaves. OK. But I think it's stupid.
But it's certainly not clear how the numbers would add up. Sanders has proposed a menu of options to offset the costs of this program. They are not all outlined in this text. The dollars and cents of this are less important to Sanders than the moral imperative. Here's a look at Sanders' math.
Regardless, Trump's approval rating is not a record, Reagan is not in second place, and Reagan's peak was higher than 87%. Gallup's website features data on approval rating by party for every president since Harry Truman; George W. Bush hit 99% in Gallup polling after the 9/11 terrorist attacks of 2001. His father, George H.W. Bush, hit 97% at the end of the Gulf War in 1991. Reagan, Richard Nixon, and Dwight Eisenhower all went higher than 90%.
I'm still in shock. I'm still trying to deal with this, very emotional for me.
But while Trump exceeded expectations in terms of the vaccine production timeline, his administration struggled to fulfill his promises regarding vaccine distribution. In October, Trump promised 100 million doses of the vaccine delivered before the end of the year. Though Trump administration officials later reduced the goal to 20 million Americans vaccinated against coronavirus by the end of December 2020, neither promise was ultimately fulfilled. Several states have blamed the federal government for the failure to meet the vaccination goals, complaining that the Trump administration initially provided fewer doses than previously promised . And with no federal mandate for how to administer the vaccines, eligibility for receiving the vaccine varied from state to state, likely causing an uneven distribution. As of December 31, 2020, fewer than 13 million vaccines had been distributed.
LEMON: That was good. That was good. He was asked by the Hill today, thehill.com today, if Trump is going to answer more Mueller questions in writing. This is how he responded.
If this weekend marked a breakthrough, perhaps the best symbol was the increased militancy – in their speeches, on their signs, etc. – of the demonstrators. The NRA and its elected allies, of course, took their lumps, but in an encouraging shift for activists, so too did individuals who prioritize gun rights over the potential upside to tightening restrictions. It's easy to yell about the gun lobby; it's much more difficult to condemn your neighbor.

CUOMO: This is your opportunity to ask for more resources. Do you have what you need? We know that the FEMA budget is one of the footballs being tossed back and forth, and we asked politicians not to play politics, with storm aid or with the FEMA budget, or at least not now.

I'm looking for something that President Trump supports, he said. And he's not yet indicated what measure he's willing to sign. As soon as we figure out what he is for, then I would be convinced that we were not just spinning our wheels going to this issue on the floor, but actually dealing with a bill that has a chance to become law and therefore solve the problem.

Congressional committees began assembling the pieces last week with public attention riveted on the Senate impeachment trial of former President Donald Trump . As currently drafted, they would rapidly lift material circumstances for working-class Americans by expanding health insurance subsidies, sending child tax credit checks to parents , defraying child care costs so parents can return to work and further subsidizing employment for low-income Americans without children.
On two separate occasions, Trump claimed that the US used to have a trade deficit with China of $500 billion or more than $500 billion.

Despite his repeated calls for the US not to serve as the world's policemen, he also successfully sought increases to military spending. And when Trump signed the National Defense Authorization Act into law in 2019, he created the the newest military service and the first new service since the US Air Force came into being in 1947 -- the United States Space Force. His administration also repeatedly attempted to slash foreign aid.

The Trump administration has decided not to reopen enrollment for the uninsured in the 38 states that use the federal exchange, a senior administration official said Tuesday evening.
Facts First: The US had its first confirmed case of the coronavirus on January 21, more than six weeks before Trump spoke here, so it's not true that the US had not really seen even some possible effects until three weeks ago.
COOPER: In fact he promised during a debate with a Democratic opponent not to make any changes, quote, which would make it more difficult for a woman to make that choice herself. Once elected, though, Mr. Romney changed his position. In 2005 he vetoed a bill expanding access to emergency contraception. Two years later he was running for president on a staunch pro-life platform.
Trump withdrew from a nuclear deal with Iran in part because it was left over from the Obama administration. He has not yet been able to secure a new deal. His record of achieving nuclear deals with despots is not good. Two words that do not appear in this State of the Union: North Korea. Remember when he promised peace and a nuclear deal with North Korea? Distant memory.
report from the left-leaning Urban Institute Health Policy Center showed that the nation's overall health care spending would rise by roughly $7 trillion to $59 trillion over a decade if Medicare for All goes into effect. The increase would be $720 billion for 2020 alone if the policy were enacted.

That's why Wall Street could feel the Bern -- and not in a good way -- if Sanders wins big in the Iowa caucuses on Monday and continues that momentum through Super Tuesday. Investors would be forced to confront the reality that Sanders, once seen as a long-shot candidate, could win the 2020 election.
Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam, though running for an executive job, trumpeted his F rating by the NRA. In a Washington Post op-ed published after Northam's victory last year, pollsters for his campaign argued that it was time to rethink a long-held political axiom: Democrats lose when they campaign on stronger gun laws. This past weekend, Georgia Rep. John Lewis drew some headlines by declaring he was proud to wear that 'F.'
It was a rare moment of honesty in a press conference typically full of falsehoods . Trump has always been a cheerleader — a hype man, a master marketer of himself which he parlayed into hyperpartisan politics and the presidency.
Senate Republicans, led by Mitch McConnell, appeared to learn a lesson from that, and took a different approach, crafting their version of the bill almost entirely behind closed doors. As they did so, network coverage of health care legislation dropped off precipitously. From May 8, four days after the House's bill passed, through June 16, there were just 10 minutes of coverage on the three nightly newscasts combined, according to Tyndall.
Consumer advocates, health care industry associations and Democrats swiftly condemned the effort, even before it was formally announced. It will likely be challenged in court.
And we asked nothing in return. Compare that to the changes that were required in Burma. And by no means is Burma a perfect country. But at least when there was a democratic opening to Burma, they were required to make some democratic openings. When there was a diplomatic opening, it required democratic opening. And today, the former minority party is now the majority party in their legislative body.

And just weeks ago, both parties united for groundbreaking criminal justice reform. Last year, I heard through friends the story of Alice Johnson. I was deeply moved. In 1997, Alice was sentenced to life in prison as a first-time non-violent drug offender. Over the next two decades, she became a prison minister, inspiring others to choose a better path. She had a big impact on that prison population – and far beyond.
Trump claimed three times that the US is now the world's number one energy producer. On two of these occasions, he claimed the US had not previously held this status. (On one of these two, he said, We weren't even close.) And he claimed the achievement had happened because he ended the war on American energy.

And by American taxpayers frankly. So, you know, I think my relationship, I will tell you with the leaders of Europe is very good. A lot of them don't even understand how they got away with it for so many years. I'll say to Angela and many of the other leaders, I'm friends with all of them. I'll say how did this ever happen? And they sort of go like I can't believe it either. They can't believe it. You know why? Because they have Presidents and other people within the administration in the past to allow them to get away. Some of them will say no one ever asked us to pay. We have negotiations going on with a lot of countries to pay a lot of money to the United States. I wouldn't say they're thrilled. If that makes me unpopular in those countries, that's OK, but we're doing tremendous service to those countries and they should at least respect us. They didn't respect us.

So, that's big news. Now it doesn't mean that they could necessarily prove it beyond a reasonable doubt at trial. But what it does mean is that that is where the evidence points to. That is their conclusion. And that is not Mueller. That is the Trump Justice Department making that conclusion.
Trump told a story in his State of the Union address about Philadelphia fourth-grader Janiyah Davis, using Davis as an example of a child trapped in failing government schools. (He announced she would be receiving a scholarship to the school of her choice.) He repeated a version of the story at the North Carolina Opportunity Now Summit, suggesting Davis had been trapped in a poorly performing school.

Last weekend, Trump attacked McCain in several tweets that targeted his ties to the controversial Russia dossier and his vote against repealing Obamacare. He also referred to McCain as being last in his class at the US Naval Academy.
Another Friday the 13th is upon us, and this particular day/date combo is enough to make the superstitious barricade themselves indoors. There was even a full moon!
Trump's decision to support a ruling that would fully dismantle Obamacare, even as his administration has no viable alternative, is a risky gamble. If the ruling is upheld by higher courts, about 20 million Americans could lose healthcare coverage on Trump's watch.

Of the other 406 miles: 22 miles replaced previously existing dilapidated or outdated secondary barriers, 33 miles were new secondary barriers where there had previously been only primary barriers and 351 miles replaced previously existing primary barriers that the government considered dilapidated or outdated. While these replacement barriers are not insignificant, it's worth noting that Trump did not build a new wall.

And it's not just a matter of inconvenience -- it could actually change the results, Ball said.

All the while, a growing number Republican members of Congress have been publicly pushing back on Trump's comments, defending McCain.
Trump's continued support for a GOP lawsuit to dismantle Obamacare, with no replacement proposal in sight, is added fodder for Democrats making the case that current crisis is inextricably tied to pre-existing failures. Those holes in the system will be felt more acutely by millions of Americans over the coming weeks and months, as they lose jobs -- and the coverage attached to them.
On top of that, if Trump succeeds in November, there is a strong possibility that he would have another seat to fill particularly given Ginsburg's age and that of Justice Stephen Breyer, who is 81. Trump would likely choose a young nominee along the lines of his first two Supreme Court picks Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh.

The good news is more Americans say they will get the vaccine than ever before. A new Axios/Ipsos poll finds that 63% of adults say they have had or are likely to get a Covid-19 vaccination as soon as it's made available to them. That's the highest ever recorded by Ipsos.
Demand, at the moment, far exceeds supply.
Facts First: Experts said the US did not have the virus even close to under control. Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said at this same briefing after Trump left the room: The worst is, yes, ahead for us. It is how we respond to that challenge that's going to determine what the ultimate end point is going to be. We have a very, very critical point now.
While the latest relief package is more popular than either bill ever was, Republicans seized on the lengthy, complicated bills in the earliest days of the Obama administration. The results for Democrats were disastrous: Republicans took control of the House and narrowed the Democratic margin in the Senate, leading then-President Barack Obama to describe the midterms as a shellacking.
Also, many insurers fled the individual market. Those that remained hiked premiums amid the uncertainty in Washington, D.C. and President Donald Trump's elimination of funding for Obamacare's cost-sharing subsidies.

As tensions with Iran flare and foreign policy positions are more important than they've been all primary, Biden's answer worked. He won on foreign affairs, and avoided falling into a trap that could have threatened his still-strong frontrunner status.
In 2017, the Trump administration froze a federal database which had helped direct people to services and interventions to treat mental health disorders and substance abuse. The 2019 fiscal year budget requested $68.4 billion for the Department of Health and Human Services – a 21% decrease from the budget enacted in 2017.
The administration is promising aggressive efforts to pass a generational tax reform bill and a bipartisan infrastructure package, though the current Washington environment suggests neither effort will be simple.
And so the president and Secretary Price and other members of the administration, frankly all the members of the administration, understand that. And what he's saying like a good football coach, let's get off of the same offensive game plan, don't focus on the micro-nature of this today if you're a senator, but focus on the macro long-term effects that this bill is going to have on the society and the positive effects it's going to have on the economy.
Para la educación superior, Sanders ha impulsado un ambicioso programa de «universidad para todos» que eliminaría la deuda de préstamos estudiantiles de todos los estadounidenses y exige una matrícula gratuita en todos los colegios y universidades públicas de cuatro años, así como en los colegios comunitarios.
Democratic lawmakers asked administration officials to temporarily reopen the exchanges several weeks ago. Also, two leading health insurance industry groups wrote congressional leaders in mid-March asking for such a move.
Trump nonetheless claimed that they were saying nice things about the top Iranian general.
BASH: I want to talk about what a prominent Democrat who ran in Texas and lost, your former colleague Beto O'Rourke, said about the wall.
BARONE: (inaudible) actually serious sort of. Well...
In 2008, Obama ran as a pragmatic problem-solver and consensus-builder. But as president, he devoted little time and effort to developing and sustaining a coalition of centrists, which doomed hope for any real progress on illegal guns, immigration, tax reform, job creation and deficit reduction, Bloomberg wrote. And rather than uniting the country around a message of shared sacrifice, he engaged in partisan attacks and has embraced a divisive populist agenda focused more on redistributing income than creating it.

CUOMO: Welcome back. This was the scene of the big GOP debate. Donald Trump under attack from jump by both sides of him last night, senators Rubio and Cruz. They were seemingly united at points in their ambush of the Republican front-runner. The sparring grew loud and proud.
But favorability slumps when they are told it would eliminate private health insurance, raise taxes or threaten the current Medicare program. And it tanks when told it would lead to delays in receiving care.

COOPER: So when reporters are saying well, they found medication in her house for schizophrenia and bipolar, the sisters are saying she wasn't schizophrenic, she wasn't bipolar.
ROSA FLORES, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, Alisyn, good morning.
But we must do more. It is unacceptable that Americans pay vastly more than people in other countries for the exact same drugs, often made in the exact same place. This is wrong, unfair, and together we can stop it.
TRUMP: And I have many, many companies. I have, you know, tremendously, you know, I have a very complex system of taxes. And frankly, I get audited every single year. But we'll make a determination over the next couple of months. It's very complicated.
Facts First: We can't fact check Trump's prediction that household income gains under him will reach $10,000 a family, but his claim that the number has already hit $10,000 in less than three years is inaccurate. A firm called Sentier Research has : We can't fact check Trump's prediction that household income gains under him will reach $10,000 a family, but his claim that the number has already hit $10,000 in less than three years is inaccurate. A firm called Sentier Research has found pre-tax income gains of more than $5,00 between January 2017 and October 2019, but any gains from cuts to regulations or in reductions in energy prices would be included in this amount, not added on top of it. Also, it is entirely unclear what Trump is referring to when he talks about energy savings; household energy costs have increased since Trump took office, as have gasoline costs. (Gasoline costs are lower than they were for most of Obama's presidency, but higher than they were in 2016.)
Most of the questions on Monday will come from New Hampshire voters, an electorate which prizes its position as the first-in-the-nation primary and is often known for asking discerning and pointed questions.

Pennsylvania and other states challenged the federal government move in court, arguing in part that they would have to step in and provide coverage for women seeking coverage.
All right. So now to Mexico and the race against time. There are human chains of volunteers and workers, often digging by hand through rubble for survivors. The death toll from that magnitude 7.1 earthquake right now stands at well over 250 and continues to rise.
Look, it's a framework. Obviously, the Green New Deal, as we have seen it so far, is more of a plan than it is a fully articulated set of policies. But the idea that we need to race toward that goal and that we should do it in a way that enhances the economic justice and the level of economic opportunity in our country, I believe that's exactly the right direction to be going in.
While the Fed chief may not address her plan for interest rates, more clues could lie in a speech later in the day by regional Fed president Neel Kashkari, who raised eyebrows by voting against this month's rate hike.
SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R), SOUTH CAROLINA: There's not a smoking gun, there's a smoking saw.
Su fidelidad es impresionante dados los acontecimientos del mes pasado. Trump ha tenido que aceptar la renuncia de su consejero de seguridad nacional, le bloquearon su decreto de prohibición de viajes desde siete países de mayoría musulmana, y terminó la semana pasada con una extraña conferencia de prensa contra la periodistas que, a juicio de muchos de ellos, no sólo fue inapropiada sino aterradora.
TAPPER: OK. But just to clarify, the Common Core standards were developed by the states, states and localities voluntarily adopt them, and they come up with their own curricula to meet those standards. So when you say education by Washington, D.C., what do you mean?
Facts First: Trump does sometimes hold rallies at NBA arenas, or at least NBA-sized arenas, but many of his venues are much smaller than that. Even when he has spoken in actual NBA arenas, it is not true that he has set a record every time. And it's not true that the media never mentions his crowds. To the contrary, his crowds are a regular subject of media attention.

We leave it fairly open ended, one official said of the questionnaire, which was first reported by The Washington Post. We want to know how seriously these candidates are going to take these endeavors and these exercises. Are they responsive? Do they put time into it? Those are all important things, almost as important as how closely they align with the President.
LEMON: All right. Thank you, all. Happy New Year if I don't see you. Appreciate it.
The Affordable Care Act requires many group health plans and health insurers that offer health coverage to provide coverage for contraceptives, without cost sharing. Churches and houses of worship are exempted and other entities such as religious universities, hospitals or charities with religious objections get an accommodation. The accommodation means that plan participants will still receive the coverage, but indirectly through the employer's health insurance company.
The federal government gives tax breaks to employers for providing health insurance. With those benefits now outlawed, the savings in tax breaks would go into the trust fund.
Now, according to her boyfriend, back in December, he called police. He said that she was suffering from postpartum depression, that she was delusional. And one of the things that he told the police, according to one of our sources, is that he told police that she believed that president Obama was monitoring her home through electronic surveillance. Also that somehow he had put her city of Stamford on lockdown. So all of this behavior that actually wound up getting her into a mental evaluation back in December, and papers were found relating to that evaluation, Anderson.

Our bill now, with Senator Stabenow and others, is to bring Medicare, a voluntary buy-in at 50. I want to help people. Now, if we get enough people, we will see a lot of people get in -- in that plan, 58- year-olds and 62-year-olds that have lost their insurance, lost their jobs. We will see the success of that, and that will end up continuing to broaden and expand coverage for so many Americans.
Warren supports Medicare for All, which would eliminate premiums, deductibles and co-pays, though she would first implement a public option-type plan that would have premiums and co-pays for some Americans.
But the former vice president appears to have lost some benefit of the doubt: The powerful Culinary Union praised him, but didn't endorse him. Former Sen. Harry Reid said he thinks Biden could win, but didn't caucus for him. His fundraising, which has already lagged some of his rivals, faces the threat of donors frozen by Bloomberg's billions or eyeing moderate alternatives like Buttigieg or Klobuchar — right at the moment Biden needs to drastically scale up for Super Tuesday, when 14 states vote on March 3.

Back in February, President Trump gave a speech at a Boeing factory in South Carolina, promising to protect jobs. Now that same factory confirmed to CNNMoney that it's laying off 200 workers. Not a great look for Trump.
But acknowledging the difference, and pushing for sustained direct action, is only a start. Envisioning a finish is more difficult, especially when it comes to such a politically intractable issue. The question now for the movement: What does winning really look like?
Several Republicans on the committee focused on Becerra's lack of experience in the health care field and his support for abortion and other liberal policies.

Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders , the current front-runner after winning the Nevada caucus, faced attacks over his recent defense of some of the actions of Fidel Castro following the 1959 Cuban Revolution.

Can you verify the accuracy of the story? Do you know if that's correct?
Let me tell you who is going to pay the price of that? Americans are going to pay the price of that. The cost of doing that is going to be rammed down the throats of the American consumer, the single parent, the working families who are going to see increases in the cost of living.
Madam Speaker, Mr. Vice President, members of Congress, the first lady of the United States and my fellow citizens, three years ago we launched the great American comeback.
Biden's special Obamacare enrollment period opened today. Here's what you need to know.
We are running on generators. The power is out right now. And as of 11:00 p.m. when we last checked in with the power company, 30 percent of the power company's system had already been impacted. That was before we started to see what we saw, waking up to that ominous hum. The winds that are circulating, the debris, I watched as a Starbucks sign came down from the building as part of the metal sheeting that many put up to try to protect ripped right through and had flying debris in this area of San Juan.
This is the closest we will ever get to repealing and replacing Obamacare. The time is here. The time is now. This is the moment. And this is the closest this will ever happen.
If it seems like this entire movement is untethered to one leader, that's because it is. Members are having their own conversations with Trump. They are having one-off meetings with one another. But this isn't a centrally organized effort. You have Sens. Josh Hawley and Ted Cruz. You have the top Republican in the House, Kevin McCarthy, in an entirely different position than that of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.
David Gergen noted, His speech was for the most part well crafted, his ideas were reasonable, his words calm and reassuring, and he related well with working people and the vulnerable. In another contrast to the President, former vice president Joe Biden spoke on the coronavirus challenge.noted, His speech was for the most part well crafted, his ideas were reasonable, his words calm and reassuring, and he related well with working people and the vulnerable. In short, this was a classic presidential speech.
The administration, though, pointed out that unlike previous years, the total released Thursday already include consumers who canceled their plans during open enrollment. So officials expect there to be a smaller difference in enrollment between now and year's end.
I can also tell you if you go to any national cemetery, especially Arlington, you're going to see crescent moons there. If you go anywhere in the world you're going see American men and women serving us in uniform that are Muslims.
Soon after the Justice Department filed its suit, Anthem also tied its continued participation on the exchanges to its merger.

Average premium costs for single policyholders would then go down 10% by 2026 compared to Obamacare.

Becerra, who referenced his upbringing as a son of a Mexican immigrant, also brought up his father's recent passing and his mother's access to health insurance when she fell ill.
The US became the top producer of crude oil in particular during Trump's tenure. The United States has been the world's top producer of natural gas since 2009, when US natural gas production surpassed that of Russia, and it has been the world's top producer of petroleum hydrocarbons since 2013, when its production exceeded Saudi Arabia's, the Energy Information Administration says.
Here are some claims that were not flat false but were lacking some key context:
Trump claimed Hunter Biden, the son of Biden, didn't have a job until his father became vice president. -- February 21 campaign rally in Las Vegas, Nevada
Those are reflective of the stories we heard from Donald Trump Jr. saying we were there, pouring concrete, we were there when they were putting up sheet metal.
In 2030 -- 10 years from now, not immediately -- the target for water utilities will be 50 gallons per capita of indoor water use for their customers. Water suppliers can be fined if they do not meet the target, but no individual person, household or company will face fines or cut-offs for using too much water. (The target system will come into effect in 2023 at a target of 55 gallons, then get more stringent.)
And prosecutors in New York say that individual one, AKA, Donald Trump, directed his fixer Michael Cohen to take care of those payments. We now know that conversations about developing a Trump tower in Moscow continued much later into the 2016 election and that Trump signed a letter of intent for the project.
The North Carolina Republican stressed, this president was elected largely on an immigration issue that defined him differently than the other candidates and so it is the defining moment, more so than the budget or anything else that we've passed.
On Friday, it was announced that we added another 304,000 jobs last month alone – almost double what was expected. An economic miracle is taking place in the United States – and the only thing that can stop it are foolish wars, politics, or ridiculous partisan investigations.

Roberts worked in Republican President Ronald Reagan's Justice Department, first with Ken Starr, the attorney general's chief of staff, and then in the White House counsel's office, under Fred Fielding. Roberts was a loyal soldier in the Reagan conservative social agenda, against affirmative action and other racial remedies and in favor of school prayer and religious displays.
Trump isn't one for wonky policy details. He often makes vague pronouncements on issues like health care. In May, for example, he tweeted,​ Despite what you hear in the press, health care is coming along great. We are talking to many groups and it will end in a beautiful picture!
Biden's recovery plan, which the House is poised to pass Wednesday without a single Republican vote, is aimed squarely at helping poor and working class Americans emerge from the dire economic and health crises caused by the coronavirus pandemic.

There are various ways to slice and dice television ratings, so Trump might be able to point to some specific night, time slot, show category or viewer group in which The Apprentice was number one. But it certainly wasn't the top-rated show in all of TV, as he has long suggested.

Likewise, we are restoring our Nation's manufacturing might, even though predictions were that this could never be done. After losing 60,000 factories under the previous two administrations, America has now gained 12,000 new factories under my Administration with thousands upon thousands of plants and factories being planned or built. We have created over half a million new manufacturing jobs. Companies are not leaving; they are coming back. Everybody wants to be where the action is, and the United States of America is, indeed, where the action is.

This led to a 1.6% increase in sign ups, to 1.54 million people, on the state-run exchange for 2020. The boost was driven by a 41% jump in new customers, which offset an 8% decline in renewals.
Texas and 19 other states support the Trump administration and the Little Sisters, arguing that some employers believe sincerely that it is incompatible with their religious convictions to provide health insurance when it means contracting with a company that then, because of that relationship, becomes obligated to provide contraceptives that the employers regard as abortifacients.
QUESTION: I will follow up on that.
I've primarily been a critic of this place, Johnson told CNN. I don't envy the (House speaker) or any leader around here. You are literally trying to herd cats.

So how did these extras get added on and, perhaps more importantly, where do we go from here?
One issue before the justices immediately concerns the future of the Affordable Care Act, the signature legislative achievement of the Obama administration that has long been in Trump's crosshairs.
Facts First: This was another of Trump's : This was another of Trump's regular little exaggerations of an impressive accomplishment. It had been between 66 and 67 years, not 71 years, since the women's unemployment rate had been as low as it was in February, 3.4% ; it hit that level in late 1953. (It was also 3.4% during previous months of Trump's presidency, but we'll ignore those here for fairness to Trump.)
The substance of those communications can be very telling. It may go to what Roger Stone was trying to find out. It may go to whether he was communicating that information to people back in the White House. It could be very revealing. And we will just have to wait to find out.
Senior citizens, however, are not buying the Republican argument that Medicare-for-all would hurt the existing Medicare program. Only a quarter of Kaiser respondents 65 and older thought they'd be worse off if a national plan were implemented.

Days later, the criminal alien went on a gruesome spree of deadly violence. He viciously shot one man going about his daily work; he approached a woman sitting in her car and shot her in the arm and the chest. He walked into a convenience store and wildly fired his weapon. He hijacked a truck and smashed into vehicles, critically injuring innocent victims. One of the victims of his bloody rampage was a 51-year-old American named Rocky Jones. Rocky was at a gas station when this vile criminal fired eight bullets at him from close range, murdering him in cold blood. Rocky left behind a devoted family, including his brothers who loved him more than anything. One of his grieving brothers is here with us tonight. Jody, would you please stand? Jody, our hearts weep for your loss – and we will not rest until you have justice.
Biden also needs to learn that anger isn't the only emotion at his disposal. On the debate stage, it seemed like a binary choice for Biden: Anger on or anger off. From issues of Obamacare to stop and frisk and transparency, Biden got worked up a lot. He needs to find middle ground where he's not totally angry nor is he totally disengaged. At the height of Biden's sole emotion, he pointed at the camera, with a pen in his hand, as he animatedly talked about China. It's not a great look on a debate stage.
But that is hardly an argument for effectively walking away from the deal, which delays the Iranian nuclear weapons program from resuming for around a decade from its inception three years ago.
When you think about Make America Great Again, that time period was a time when a White guy could walk into a factory and walk out set for life, when college was paid for the government, when a great middle-class house was subsidized by the government, when the minimum wage was high and when taxes were high.
Your summer airfare is likely to get more expensive.

That puts the onus on House leaders, who have to find a way to convince both defense hawks and fiscal conservatives to go along with a short-term spending deal one more time. Republican leaders are expected to formally whip the proposal Wednesday, but the House Freedom Caucus' comments Tuesday cast doubt on the operation, after even some prominent conservatives seemed to be leaning toward supporting the continuing resolution Tuesday before the caucus met.

And they could request to add new conditions for eligibility for these recipients, change their benefits, require them to pay up to 5% of their income and limit their drug coverage by implementing a list of approved medications. States could also limit retroactive coverage, which could hurt hospitals and other providers, since they often sign up eligible patients when they seek care.
Biden claimed President Donald Trump weakened sanctions against Pyongyang in his pursuit of meetings with North Korea's Kim Jong Un.

The multi-prong effort is aimed at turning the bill into something Democrats can run on, not run away from, in the coming years, including in the politically critical 2022 midterms. The ad, which is set to run nationally, in battleground markets and digitally in the coming weeks, is the centerpiece of the broader effort, which aims to turn the job of touting the bill into an all of party effort.

Therefore, we recently imposed tariffs on $250 billion of Chinese goods – and now our Treasury is receiving billions of dollars a month from a country that never gave us a dime. But I don't blame China for taking advantage of us – I blame our leaders and representatives for allowing this travesty to happen. I have great respect for President Xi, and we are now working on a new trade deal with China. But it must include real, structural change to end unfair trade practices, reduce our chronic trade deficit, and protect American jobs.
Facts First: There was no sign The New York Times was going broke prior to Trump launching his presidential candidacy in mid-2015. (Trump didn't specify what he meant by until I came along, but that seems like the earliest reasonable starting point.) The New York Times Company was : There was no sign The New York Times was going broke prior to Trump launching his presidential candidacy in mid-2015. (Trump didn't specify what he meant by until I came along, but that seems like the earliest reasonable starting point.) The New York Times Company was profitable in 2013 and 2014. While the company reported a $14 million loss in the first quarter of 2015, it reported a $16 million gain in the second quarter of 2015, more than two thirds of which occurred before Trump began his campaign in mid-June.
White House officials' meticulous review of the language of a potential executive order on NAFTA followed the administration's early stumbles as it eagerly sought to implement another one of the Trump's biggest campaign promises: banning travel from Muslim-majority, terrorist-prone countries.
Sen. Amy Klobuchar will take to the national stage on Monday headlining a CNN town hall in New Hampshire to make her most public case yet for why she should be the next President of the United States.
Klobuchar, who announced her presidential campaign during a snowy outdoor event in Minneapolis earlier this month, is the third potential presidential hopeful to appear at a CNN town hall. Sen. Kamala Harris appeared at an event hosted by Jake Tapper and former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz, who is considering an independent bid for the presidency, headlined a town hall hosted by Poppy Harlow.
We'll soon learn how the Republican health care bill that passed the House last week will impact the number of uninsured and the deficit.
GRUBER: No, I'm not confident. Previous cases on the Affordable Care Act have all been clearly, by an objective standard, easy wins for the Affordable Care Act, and yet they've all passed by the skin of their teeth.
So, people come here, look at that list to see if their loved one has been rescued. If their loved one is not on that list, they wait. You probably see them behind me. There was a woman weeping loudly just moments ago that I talked to, and she says she has been trying to communicate with her daughter via text message, via WhatsApp, and she says that she doesn't get an answer.
The December 2019 unemployment rate for the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre/Hazleton area was 5.6% -- worse than various rates under Clinton and Bush and also worse than the rate in Obama's last full month in office, 5.4% in December 2016. It hit 4.0% in April 2019, which was the lowest for the area since at least 1990.)

In a generic ballot test, 52% of likely voters back the Democratic candidate for House of Representatives in their district while 42% back the Republican. Among all registered voters, Democrats hold a 12-point margin over the GOP, suggesting preferences have not shifted much since an August CNN Poll, which did not include an assessment of likely voters.

States would likely retain oversight of these policies and could impose their own rules, said Sabrina Corlette, research professor at Georgetown's Health Policy Institute. For instance, New York and New Jersey currently don't let insurers sell short-term plans that don't comply with Obamacare -- and no short-term plans are available in either of those states.
Facts First: There is no evidence Strzok and Page, the former FBI officials who exchanged anti-Trump text messages, illegally deleted texts or emails. While the Justice Department was There is no evidence Strzok and Page, the former FBI officials who exchanged anti-Trump text messages, illegally deleted texts or emails. While the Justice Department was initially unable to find some of their texts, an investigation by the department's inspector general later recovered everything that had been missing; the issue was an FBI technical problem with Samsung 5 phones, not anything Strzok or Page had done.
Speaking of people named Jason, Rep. Jason Chaffetz declared that he would continue the investigation into Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server.
Aetna's announcement that it would withdraw from 11 of 15 states next year amid $430 million in losses heightened concerns about Obamacare's financial viability. UnitedHealthcare (UNH) and Humana are also minimizing their presence on the exchanges after recording big losses.
As secretary, Azar has overseen several top administration priorities, including efforts to weaken the Affordable Care Act, combat the opioid crisis and reduce the cost of prescription drugs.
Facts First: By several : By several measures , US air was cleaner under Obama than it has been under Trump. Three of the six types of pollutants identified by the Clean Air Act as toxic to human health were more prevalent in the air as of 2018 than they were before Trump took office, according to Environmental Protection Agency data. There were more unhealthy air days for sensitive groups in 2018 than in 2016, and researchers from Carnegie Mellon University who studied Environmental Protection Agency data found that air pollution increased between 2016 and 2018.

Listen, he spends his weekend obsessing over great men because he knows it, and I know it, and all of you know it: he will never be a great man, McCain said on ABC's The View, where she is a co-host.
When the court is not in session she attends speaking events . Last month she told an audience in Washington that serving on the high court is the best job I've ever had and reiterated that she will stay on as long as I will be able to do it full steam. Asked about the current state of affairs in the US and abroad, Ginsburg said the country would emerge from anxious bumpy periods.
The strategy seems to be working. Now that Marco Rubio is out of the race and John Kasich struggles to win any state other than Ohio, where he is the governor, a number of prominent officials are turning to the Texas senator.
Do you want me to go on? Or, I mean, there are so -- I mean, I only have two hours tonight if there isn't more breaking news by the end of this. On and on and on. That tells you a lot about Donald Trump's judgment about people.
I'll be interested to see what the compromise looks like before I commit to voting for it or against it. The real tragedy here, Jake, is that we should be able to do a bigger comprehensive immigration reform bill and the president two years ago had the ability to take 25 billion dollars for border security in exchange for protection for the dreamers and didn't take it. I hope we can have that bigger conversation some time soon.
And, when President Obama did that, and he withdrew our forces from Iraq precipitously, you ended up with civil war in Syria. You ended up with the rise of ISIS. You ended up with the caliphate.
Walker called the mayor's decision stunning and unconstitutional.
MARQUARDT: So for more, let's bring in Elie Honig who is a former federal prosecutor and state prosecutor.
My father was his kryptonite in life, he was his kryptonite in death. On a personal level, I agree with you, all of us have love and families, and when my father was alive, up until adulthood, we would spend our time together cooking, hiking, fishing, really celebrating life, and I think it's because he almost died, she said. And I just thought, 'your life is spent on the weekend not with your family, not with your friends, but you're obsessing, obsessing over great men you could never live up to.' That tells you everything you need to know about his pathetic life right now.
These workers build a makeshift ladder to reach the top of the rubble before calling for silence to listen for any survivors. These scenes playing out across Mexico City and surrounding towns as thousands work together removing buckets of debris and piece of wood, one piece at a time. A painstaking task done carefully to avoid a further collapse.
El lanzamiento del presupuesto es una oportunidad fotográfica que permite que el presidente (o sus designados) señalen un libro que será empastado y que muestra cómo él está cumpliendo sus promesas de campaña.
Facts First: The Veterans Choice bill, a bipartisan initiative led by Sens. Bernie Sanders and the late John McCain, was : The Veterans Choice bill, a bipartisan initiative led by Sens. Bernie Sanders and the late John McCain, was signed into law by Obama in 2014. In 2018, Trump signed the VA Mission Act, which expanded and changed the program.
The Republicans have minor -- marginal advantage at redistricting, but it's basically demographics. The Democratic vote is clustered. The heavily Democratic groups blacks, Hispanics, gentry, liberals concentrated in many central cities. They dominate the electoral college by that because they make a lot of states safely democratic. And President Obama with 51 percent of the vote got 332 electoral's a big majority. George Bush with the same percentage and (inaudible) just got 286.
Trump said three times that he had ended the war on American energy, and the United States is now the number one producer of oil and natural gas. On a third occasion, he touted becoming the world's top energy producer as one of his accomplishments in office.
The case will continue even if the Justice Department under Biden withdraws, because it originated with Texas and other Republican-led states. But the President-elect could work with the new Democratic majority in Congress to short circuit the GOP states' legal argument -- by setting the penalty at a $1, for instance.
And we mustn't stop there. The national racial healing that many long for cannot be purchased on the cheap. This commission must endorse and devise strategies to pursue policies for a living wage, housing reform, mental health and education programs and a universal basic income.
A Klobuchar aide told CNN on Monday that the senator prepared for the town hall like she would for a major interview.
OPINIÓN: Esta nueva regla de inmigración no es estadounidense
Consistent with its past practices, [Koch] will be a silent and passive investor, he said. As far as the brothers themselves, Slusark said, no one from Meredith has ever met with, spoken to or communicated with the Koch brothers in any fashion.
I want to build on the momentum that we saw here in 2018, Klobuchar told reporters Saturday in Wisconsin. No one ever thought that the Democrats were going to be able (to defeat) Gov. Walker, but we did it, and we did it in a smart, Wisconsin way with a grassroots campaign with (Democratic Sen.) Tammy Baldwin at the top of the ticket, and we can do it in the presidential, as well.
Former Vice President Joe Biden was the only candidate on the debate stage who has been in a position of power to weigh in on the Afghan War issue—he was an important voice in President Barack Obama's war cabinet early in Obama's first term in 2009. At that time, Obama was considering whether to surge tens of thousands more US troops into Afghanistan.
Facts First: This is Trump's usual exaggerated figure. There were 104 court vacancies on January 1, 2017, 19 days before Trump took office, according to : This is Trump's usual exaggerated figure. There were 104 court vacancies on January 1, 2017, 19 days before Trump took office, according to Russell Wheeler , a visiting fellow at the Brookings Institution who tracks judicial appointments.
According to him, the budget also changes how these baseline assumptions are outlined in the text. Rather than explaining some of its assumptions about extending the tax cuts into the baseline at the bottom of the budget document, they're moved into a supplementary text.
A small tragedy went largely unnoticed Tuesday at the Department of Justice. Joel McElvain, a 20-year department veteran, and a real pro, resigned in response to Attorney General Jeff Sessions' lawless and rankly political decision not to defend essential parts of the Obamacare law. McElvain's principled exit should sound a loud alarm bell.
The bill was also designed to give Democrats a chance to be on the record supporting it.
CUOMO: I'll tell you what. It was real high political theater going on, on that debate stage last night. At times I felt like I didn't know if I was watching a debate or Saturday Night Live. But I'll tell you, it certainly had an impact.
This is New Hampshire, anything could happen, she said when asked about the town hall at an event earlier in the day.
And although we are winning, we have not won, and although we celebrate today, we cannot take for granted tomorrow or we will lose our courts and our country to critics who call us terrifying and who describe us as deplorable, he added.
But Biden was incorrect that the monitor was the reason the use of stop and frisk declined: the number of stops had already plummeted by the time Zimroth started in 2014. The 95% decline transpired between the first quarter of 2012 and the fourth quarter of 2013.
Mr. Trump, would you like to respond?
For what it's worth, the budget would allocate $1.6 billion for the wall and $782 million to bolster the ranks of the Customs and Border Protection and Immigration and Customs Enforcement agencies. These numbers are worth watching as Congress debates, but they're unlikely to factor heavily in the final deal, should one be reached.
Short has seen Trump through accomplishments – a tax cut law, a Supreme Court Justice confirmation – and disappointments, such as the failure to fully repeal the Affordable Care Act, as well as a wild roller coaster of relationships to members of his own party on Capitol Hill.
The Urban Institute estimated that the mandate's elimination, as well as the reduced federal support of open enrollment, would leave 6.4 million fewer people with coverage by 2019.
All the while, a growing number Republican members of Congress have been publicly pushing back on Trump's comments, defending McCain.
Según Silva, el discurso del Trump «fue divisivo y tiene como fin causar miedo y terror en comunidades alrededor del país».
Remember, Reince Priebus is the one had made sure there was that so- called autopsy after the 2012 electoral defeat of Mitt Romney running and the autopsy, if you read it, it said bunch of things Donald Trump clearly has not spent much time taking very seriously outreach to Latinos, being more inclusive in language, being warmer, being more positive and Donald Trump got here doing it his way, not the republican national committee way. Reince Priebus has been in a very tough spot.

Over the weekend, Trump revived his long-running feud against McCain – who died in August after a long battle with brain cancer – citing his ties to the controversial Russia dossier and his vote against repealing Obamacare. He said in the Oval Office on Tuesday that he was never a fan of John McCain and I never will be and complained on Wednesday that he wasn't thanked for giving McCain the kind of funeral that he wanted.
Mike said multiple times that the health care system as it existed before Obamacare was going to bankrupt us and was in urgent need of reform -- here he's saying that Obamacare did not fully solve that problem, she told CNN in an email.
Klobuchar, who announced her presidential campaign during a snowy outdoor event in Minneapolis earlier this month, is the third potential presidential hopeful to appear at a CNN town hall. Sen.

But, you know, we're going to continue to work with our allies, continue to work with our partners. And again, the goals are to stop the nuclear program, stop the missiles, stop the aggression. With North Korea, we're going to continue looking at the best options and ways to accomplish that.
(CNN) With the 10-year anniversary of the Affordable Care Act fast approaching, former President Barack Obama highlighted the landmark health reform law's benefits in a new video released Tuesday.
Why should voters trust that you will run the country differently from how you run your businesses? TRUMP: Because nobody knows the system better than me. I know the H1B. I know the H2B. Nobody knows it better than me. I'm a businessman. These are laws. These are regulations. These are rules. We're allowed to do it. And frankly, because of the devaluations that other countries - the monetary devaluations that other countries are constantly doing and brilliantly doing against us, it's very, very hard for our companies in this country, in our country, to compete.
Cruz and his wife wave to the crowd at Liberty University after he announced his presidential candidacy in Lynchburg, Virginia, on March 23, 2015.
KING: Right, and can he, to your point, if China said, we can get North Korea to the table. The table for what? Kim Jong-un has shown no indication he's willing to give up his missile program or his nuclear program because those are his tickets, in his view, to survival. The Trump administration has said the era of strategic patience is over. I assume they would only sit down if they had what they thought was a full commitment to dismantle the nuclear program. But the Clinton administration negotiated that deal. And the North Korean government immediately violated it. So is there -- is there a framework where you could conceivably at least test diplomacy?
Facts First: The Obama administration did respond to H1N1, and it's not true the administration did not even start thinking about testing until it was too late.
They say it can't happen, he says of his battle for a higher wage. But it can happen. The only way it won't happen if we don't try.
Trump has continued to rail against Iran, decrying the nuclear deal brokered under the previous administration as one of the worst deals just as he did during the campaign and arguing most recently that Iran was not living up to the spirit of the agreement.
No father would stand for such talk about his daughter. But for Trump, his family is especially important, because it's an extension of himself, and his brand.

You guys come to us with stories all day. I've taken meetings with the majority of the people in this room. I don't always know the nature of the story of which you're coming to talk to me about, but it's my job to talk to you, to listen. And I'm responding.
Obamacare remained popular with millions of Americans in 2018, despite the Trump administration's repeated attacks.
Still, the rate increase will hit some in the middle class since they don't qualify for premium subsidies. Several have written to CNNMoney to say that their premiums are skyrocketing for next year.
The minimum wage fight. Democratic Sen. Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona has made it clear that she will not vote for a Senate Covid relief bill that includes raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour.
The President has the support of millions of veterans in the United States. I don't think those veterans are in love with the fact that he's attacking John McCain, he said.
I feel like they've ostracized themselves like they haven't ever done before, the aide told CNN. I think this could be a breaking point for the membership of the Freedom Caucus.
That is a very, very bad idea, because we cannot turn our back on the most vulnerable, said Kasich, noting the program's importance in treating those with drug addiction and mental health issues.
But those remarks drew swift pushback from Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn.
Facts First: It is possible that someone or some group from San Diego told him they wanted a border wall, but there is no basis for Trump's suggestion that the city itself ever begged him for a wall, let alone begged him for a wall, changed its mind, and then reversed itself again and urged him to keep the wall. San Diego's city council voted 5-3 in 2017 to express opposition to a wall, and even the Republican mayor, Kevin Faulconer, has made clear that he is opposed.
Trump's total of 81 false claims the week of the rally was tied for the fifth-highest weekly total of the 25 weeks we have tracked at CNN since July 8.
At a diversity conference hosted by the Professional BusinessWomen of California last week, Clinton took on what she said were indignities, sexism and structural barriers that women confront today.
Now, Bernie Sanders has disavowed all of these comments. He told Jake Tapper on CNN yesterday that he does not condone any of that. That was Bill Clinton trying to draw attention to some of the negative attacks that they believe that they're up against. Then he did several negative attacks of his own. He said that Senator Sanders has not been as pure as he said on fundraising.
Before all that, something motivated Miriam Carey to do what she did. Tonight, we're learning she had been grape ling with mental illness. In a moment I will ask her sisters about that. But first, I want to bring in Deborah Feyerick.
It's important to note these numbers represent the non-elderly population, since most Americans get Medicare after they turn 65. The rate of uninsured would rise drastically, both because the law would do away with the requirement that people either obtain insurance or pay a fine and, in the later years, because of changes to Medicaid rules and spending is capped, according to CBO.
Sen. Debbie Stabenow said Wednesday Republicans should be worried about the effects repealing the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, will have on Americans who rely on it.
On Tuesday, Trump falsely accused McCain of misleading the White House over how he would vote.
CUOMO: But, Governor, giving -- governor -- Senator, not yet, Senator, giving people the ability to have coverage and it being affordable are very different things.
After a roughly 10-minute speech, Bloomberg left the Florida convention center, flying home to New York City to reassess his campaign. On Wednesday morning, he left his Upper East Side apartment without offering a hint of what was to come.
One of Obama's biggest mistakes as president, Sanders said in September 2011, was abandoning his grassroots supporters and not following through on his campaign promises.
Bloomberg answers questions from members of the media at the Metropolitan Room on January 3, 2020 in Fayetteville, North Carolina.
Sanders' immigration plan calls for a moratorium on deportations until a thorough audit of past practices and policies is complete. (His campaign manager said in late February that the moratorium would not apply to violent criminals. The plan also says he will use executive authority to allow undocumented immigrants who have resided in the United States for five or more years to remain free from threat of deportation.
So I think there is room for us in the debate to focus on both what needs to happen now and over the next couple years – which is, as you point out, there are a number of organizations that are well-suited for that and some of which I'm affiliated with and will continue to be affiliated with – but also for there to be a movement that's a little bit longer term that changes the equation. Think about big changes that have happened in the country, (like) marriage equality. That didn't start the year before laws were changed. That started decades before laws were changed. There needs to be a movement and effort to establish successful change that occurs beyond just the current year.
We're getting fire extinguishers thrown at us from the top ... in the upper level of the inaugural deck, an officer shouted in another clip.
When the vacancy came available, McConnell again pushed for Walker.
Former HHS officials and supporters of the law were angered by the Trump administration's move.

The move would reverse an Obama administration decision to limit the duration of short-term plans to no more than 90 days in order to make them less attractive. Insurers will soon be allowed to sell these policies for just under a year. They can be renewed for up to 36 months, though that renewal isn't guaranteed.
CNN's Brianna Keilar explains why many Republicans are hesitant to take the coronavirus vaccine.
Facts First: Not only are Americans bearing most of the cost of Trump's tariffs but the US has also had tariffs on China for more than two centuries, generating an average of $12 billion a year from 2007 to 2016, FactCheck.org reported. There has also never been a $500 billion trade deficit with China. (Trump describes trade deficits as losing, though many economists dispute that characterization.)
Just a day earlier, Marc Short, Vice President Mike Pence's chief of staff and the former White House legislative affairs director, claimed on CNN that the President will be putting forward plans this year to replace Obamacare through Congress.
As we support America's moms and dads, I was recently proud to sign the law providing new parents in the Federal workforce paid family leave, serving as a model for the rest of the country. Now, I call on the Congress to pass the bipartisan Advancing Support for Working Families Act, extending family leave to mothers and fathers all across the Nation.
TRUMP: OK, thank you very much, Wolf. An honor.
DENT: Pass them as is and then do a continuing resolution on the homeland security appropriations bill.
I just spoke to @realDonaldTrump and he fully supports my plan to replace Obamacare the same day we repeal it. The time to act is now. — Senator Rand Paul (@RandPaul) January 7, 2017
Este año, el Partido Republicano utilizará el proceso presupuestario para suavizar la aprobación de uno de sus principales objetivos políticos: la reestructuración del código tributario. Los republicanos planean utilizar la herramienta de procedimiento como una reconciliación presupuestaria que les permita aprobar una legislación importante en el Senado con una mayoría simple. Utilizaron la misma herramienta en la resolución del presupuesto del año pasado para abordar su primera prioridad con el gobierno republicano unificado, para derogar y reemplazar el Obamacare.
Nowhere was her performance more clear and cutting than in the extended colloquy about health care. After Senator Bernie Sanders described his Medicare-for-All plan, Klobuchar said she was offering something better: a plan, and not a pipe dream. She also told Senator Elizabeth Warren that Warren had supported a bill that would have kicked 149 million Americans off their existing insurance plans.
Through our Pledge to America's Workers -- spearheaded by a young woman that perhaps some of you may have heard of, Ivanka Trump -- over 415 companies have committed -- these are the big companies, for the most part -- have committed to providing new jobs and training opportunities to nearly 15 million Americans. You know, when she started, she said, 'Daddy, I want to help people get jobs.' This was at the beginning of the administration. She said, 'I'm working on 500,000 jobs.' So she'd call Walmart. She called all these great companies. So she had a goal of 500,000 -- half a million jobs. Sounds like a lot. I said, 'That's a lot.' She just broke 15 million jobs. Amazing. Fifteen million. -- February 7 speech at North Carolina Opportunity Now Summit
Trump added Wednesday that veterans were on his side during the dispute, because McCain didn't get the job done with the Veterans Administration.
Unfortunately, estimating what you'll pay for health insurance in the years ahead is a bit of a guessing game at the moment, what with the effort to repeal and replace Obamacare still a work in progress. But you can at least get a sense of what you might need to budget for coverage now by going to sites like eHealthInsurance.com and HealthPocket.com. You can then re-visit these sites as more details about health insurance costs emerge.
Here are a few representative Biden quotes. In a February 2003 speech in Delaware, he said , Let everyone here be absolutely clear: I supported the resolution to go to war. I am NOT opposed to war to remove weapons of mass destruction from Iraq. I am NOT opposed to war to remove Saddam from those weapons if it comes to that.
Still, the American Health Care Act goes a long way to fulfilling the Republicans' seven-year pledge to repeal former President Obama's landmark health reform law. And it would erase the coverage gains of the last few years and leave 24 million more people uninsured by 2026 than under Obamacare, according to a Congressional Budget Office analysis of an earlier version of the bill.
There are a lot of things that could explain why voters seem more open to Biden than Clinton. There are a lot of reasons it makes no sense at all.
Trump may have been basing his claim on a hacked 2015 email exchange released by WikiLeaks in 2016. Clinton adviser Neera Tanden asked Bloomberg adviser Howard Wolfson about a media report about some Democrats having approached Bloomberg to run against Clinton in the 2016 election.
American workers are hurting ... Wages have stagnated, while CEO pay has skyrocketed.
Obamacare requires many group health plans and health insurers that offer health coverage to provide coverage for contraceptives, without cost sharing. Churches and houses of worship are exempted and other entities (such as religious universities, hospitals or charities) with religious objections get an accommodation. The accommodation means that plan participants will still receive the coverage, but indirectly through the employer's health insurance company.
Trump said wages are rising for the first time in 21 years.
SCARAMUCCI: I don't know the answer.
So we have seen empirically that the law -- that it is severable. The law still works without it. Congress in its wisdom has declared that it's severable, has said, look, we're going to keep the law but remove the mandate penalty.

As we speak, large, organized caravans are on the march to the United States. We have just heard that Mexican cities, in order to remove the illegal immigrants from their communities, are getting trucks and buses to bring them up to our country in areas where there is little border protection. I have ordered another 3,750 troops to our southern border to prepare for the tremendous onslaught.
In a December 2009 appearance on NBC's Meet the Press, Bloomberg appeared to contradict his own support for the House bill by questioning if Congress had ever read the bill.
Tolerance for illegal immigration is not compassionate – it is cruel. One in three women is sexually assaulted on the long journey north. Smugglers use migrant children as human pawns to exploit our laws and gain access to our country.
When confronted with the claim that Sanders told Warren that a women could not win, Sanders denied it, arguing that he has always believed in women. But Warren rejected Sanders' denial, and grasped the electability matter with both hands, demanding to talk about the elephant in the Democratic primary living room, the claim that a woman can't win in 2020.
The reality is that our health care system is being frozen by outdated technology that prevents providers from seamlessly sharing patient and treatment data. If we are unwilling to roll up our sleeves and start devoting the money that's needed to build a powerful data infrastructure, there simply is no way we can get to a place where every care coordinator and every provider has an understanding of a patient's medical past and what treatments will be appropriate going forward.

Trump said he was going to start negotiating a trade deal with the president of the European Commission, then added, They haven't wanted to negotiate with past Presidents, but they're going to negotiate with me. He also said: ...Our country wanted to make a deal under President Obama. The EU refused to talk to him. -- January 22 press conference in Davos, Switzerland
MIAMI GARDENS, FLORIDA - MAY 06: Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis speaks during a press conference at the Hard Rock Stadium testing site on May 06, 2020 in Miami Gardens, Florida. Gov. DeSantis announced during the press conference that a COVID-19 antibodies test will be available. The test can show if a person has had the virus in the past without showing symptoms, and therefore may be immune to it. The test will be available to first responders and health care workers first, with the goal of being able to expand testing to the general public. (Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)
The more intense the support, the more advantage that you have in the event of extreme weather on caucus night, Ball said -- meaning a candidate with a bigger but less passionate base of support could lose out to one with fewer, but more engaged, supporters.
CRUZ: And I'll tell you, frankly one concern I have with Donald is that although his language is quite incendiary, when you look at his substantive policies on Iran, he has said he would not rip up this Iranian nuclear deal. I think that's a mistake.
The Trump administration slashed advertising by 90% and deeply cut funding for enrollment assistance -- two measures Biden is expected to reverse. Unspent revenue from exchange user fees appears to have accumulated to more than $1 billion over fiscal years 2018 to 2020, according to Kaiser.

Still, a few governors were supportive of block grants, saying the flexibility that comes with this funding can make it easier to transition able-bodied recipients to more independent living. Many Republican governors would like to be able to charge premiums or institute work requirements for the low-income adults in the program.

Democrats are smiling in D.C. that the Freedom Caucus, with the help of Club For Growth and Heritage, have saved Planned Parenthood & Ocare!, the President tweeted.
TRUMP: No, I'm not a whiner. I get things done. You know, I get things done. Look, Jeb is the kind of a guy if he weren't in government, nobody would give him a job. Couldn't get a job. You look at what he says, I mean, he lies so much. I'm very strong on second amendment. You know that. You've been at my speeches. I'm very strong on low taxes. I've got a huge tax cut for everybody. He says I want to raise taxes on everybody. I mean, you know, how do you do that? A guy goes out, he says he wants to raise taxes. The guy is -- you know, he's got a failed campaign. He's a nervous wreck. He's probably going to be the last of the governors, I would say. You know, certainly he's the least talented of the governors.
At this point, controversial riders may be scrapped rather than included in an effort to stave off any government shutdown. Republicans were still trying to find a way to correct some errors in their tax bill, but those negotiations were hitting headwinds as Democrats demanded concessions for the changes.
Intervening, for its part, is unnecessary (because California and other blue states have already intervened), unlawful (because one house of Congress almost certainly lacks standing to sue), and wasteful (because lawyers). — Nicholas Bagley (@nicholas_bagley) January 2, 2019
This time, individuals earning less than $75,000 and couples earning less than $150,000 would receive the full $1,400 payment, plus an additional $1,400 per dependent. But the third round of checks would phase out faster than earlier payments -- completely cutting off individuals who earn more than $80,000 a year and married couples earning more than $160,000, regardless of how many children they have.
LEMON: Steve, she was very open in her criticism of the President, who isn't very popular by all accounts. Do people respond to that, do you think?
CASSIDY: A couple of things. We do take money out because we eliminate the mandated penalties.
At her event in Goffstown, Klobuchar pitching herself as a candidate who can win independent and lean Republican voters. She pledged to go everywhere, not just where it is comfortable, but where it is uncomfortable and outlined a platform that included overturning Citizens United, reinstating the Voting Rights Act, rejoining the Paris Climate Accord and getting on the path toward a public option for health care.
Casey gave progressives a jolt – and his colleagues a lesson – on Monday by revealing plans to oppose the pick hours before it was made. He argued in a statement that Trump's decision to select from a list of 25 options dictated to him by the Heritage Foundation undermined the process from the start and that any judge on this list is fruit of a corrupt process straight from the D.C. swamp.
Sen. Amy Klobuchar will take to the national stage on Monday headlining a CNN town hall in New Hampshire to make her most public case yet for why she should be the next President of the United States.
It all underscores the message from the top -- the preferred route is a bipartisan one, and Biden still believes there is a pathway to at least 10 GOP votes for a relief proposal. What that proposal looks like, however, is obviously subject to negotiation, one official said. In other words, the $1.9 trillion proposal is an opening bid.
DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I didn't need to do this.
BASH: Mr. Trump, Senator Rubio says your numbers don't add up. What's your response? Senator Rubio says that your numbers don't add up. What's your response, Mr. Trump?
The proposal would allow association plans to be regulated the same way large employer plans are. That would free them from having to adhere to all of Obamacare's rules, particularly the one requiring insurers to offer comprehensive coverage. So these plans would likely have lower premiums, but also provide fewer benefits -- which could leave sicker and older workers out in the cold. Also, the offerings could be less attractive to young women if they don't cover maternity benefits.
I had a really nice conversation with him and Melania and I really was under the impression this sort of fight between our families and between him and my father, especially at this particular moment would end. I understand the argument is he's talking about policy, and that's the attack, but it's still particularly hurtful, especially after I've had this conversation with him on the phone, to have this moment of booing at CPAC … at this particular moment in time is incredibly hurtful and I feel, quite frankly, very naïve to have believed that this would be any different, she said.
Trump added Wednesday that veterans were on his side during the dispute, because McCain didn't get the job done with the Veterans Administration.
After his rally in Dallas in 2015 during the Republican primary, the Dallas News reported that up to 20,000 people were expected, but the upper levels of the arena were largely empty...arena personnel estimated attendance at about 15,000. The Texas Tribune reported that Trump's February 2016 rally in Fort Worth did not have a capacity crowd, either.
Defense Secretary Mark Esper said this past weekend he didn't see a specific threat against four embassies in the intelligence.
The president also took credit for creating thousands of jobs in the coal industry. But the numbers just don't add up. When you drill down, very few of the new jobs in the mining industry are in coal mining. Not too shocking when you consider the fact that many blue-collar workers don't even want their kids following in their footsteps.
Rose said there were 7,725 people inside the venue for the rally. He said Trump was correct that this was an all-time record for the Wildwoods Convention Center.
The Department of Health & Human Services declined to comment on the letter.
The executive branch can do a lot, until someone tries to stop them through the legal system, said Larry Levitt, senior vice president at the Kaiser Family Foundation.
The stress of seeking out evasive health care can have an impact over generations. Watching parents struggle with bills, drown in forms and sink into debt can put children off engaging with an unwelcoming system in their own adulthood, and exacerbate the effects of the original condition. When you have a mental illness, even the most perfunctory daily tasks can feel like mountains to climb, let alone making important phone calls or filling out complex paperwork.
Facts First: It's not true that Obama never pushed NATO members to increase their military spending. Obama and predecessor George W. Bush both did so, though their public language was less confrontational than Trump's has been.
Plus: On the campaign trail, a growing Democratic field floods the zone in early primary states.
Trump's budget is a request to Congress, not a law, so the cuts may not happen. And Republicans are free to note that the proposed cuts would reduce projected future spending, but not be reductions from the current level of spending. Still, Biden had a reasonable factual basis for saying what he did.
You may recall way back in, when was it,1961 they invaded Cuba and the, everybody was totally convinced the Castro was the worst guy in the world. All the Cuban people were going to rise up in rebellion against Fidel Castro, Sanders said, discussing the logic behind the Kennedy administration's failed Bay of Pigs coup. They had forgotten that he educated the kids, gave them health care, totally transformed the society.
Separately, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services recently granted Tennessee's request to turn its federal Medicaid funding arrangement into a so-called modified block grant. It is the first state to receive such permission to receive a lump sum of federal support in exchange for increased flexibility in administering its Medicaid program and an opportunity to share in any savings with the federal government.
Trump twice touted the Right to Try law he signed in 2018. In one case, he said people had been trying to pass such a law for 50 years. In the other case, he said it was 45 years.

Obama repeatedly urged NATO allies to spend more. If we've got a collective defense, it means that everybody's got to chip in, and I've had some concerns about a diminished level of defense spending among some of our partners in NATO, Obama said in 2014. The situation in Ukraine reminds us that our freedom isn't free and we've got to be willing to pay for the assets, the personnel, the training that's required to make sure that we have a credible NATO force and an effective deterrent force.
He had to pull out of it, see?
So. Let's take a step back here and think of what happened here in Washington on Tuesday. Sitting next to the leader of a foreign country, the President of the United States went after a former Republican senator (and former GOP presidential nominee) who not only served in the Vietnam War but spent years of his life being tortured in a North Vietnamese prison camp. And this is a President who received several deferments during Vietnam, including for bone spurs. In an interview with The New York Times in 2016, Trump called the condition temporary and minor.
He was honored by President Obama in 2013 for his serving this country with dignity. Overton apparently liked to have a cigar in one hand and a glass of whiskey in another. Though he credited God for his long life, Overton also said that his vices helped. Thank you for your service, Mr. Overton.
Paul, who has warned against big government and overspending, did tout the measure as a way to shrink the military.
Trump's tactics haven't been isolated to immigration, either. When Republicans couldn't muster the votes to repeal Obamacare on their own, he said that was Democrats' fault too, for not coming to the negotiating table and helping to unravel former President Barack Obama's signature legislative accomplishment.
For weeks, Democrats have been asking, of course, who is the best candidate to beat Trump? Watching the crosstalk among the candidates last night, it also became clear that Dems would be well advised to ask a related question: Who is the best candidate to beat Trump in televised debates?
(voice-over): Now if NECC is big then Ameridose is the 800-pound gorilla. NECC has 21 employees and generated $8 million in revenue and Ameridose, 400 employees and generated $100 million a year.
The two Republicans' attempts to damage Cruz reflect their campaigns' understanding that their best bet at a long-shot run depends on a strong finish in Iowa – and that Cruz's strength in Iowa makes that unlikely. Whether or not the attacks help Santorum or Huckabee, though, they could hurt Cruz enough to widen the lane for middle-tier candidates such as Rubio and Christie.
Freshman Louisiana Republican Sen. John Kennedy expressed frustration that McConnell hasn't made it possible for there to be more votes on amendments in the Senate. But he also praised McConnell for doing a tough job well.
LEMON: I always appreciate your time and your input. Thank you so much. I appreciate it, Congressman Heck.
But Trump and his White House did not come to learn the limitations of his presidency and the realities of governing until after the bruising first weeks of his presidency.
Klobuchar has admitted that she can be too tough on her staff in response to the stories.
Trump proudly embraces his smashing of political idols. Desecrating the old ways of doing things – and doing so gleefully – he believes is at the root of his political people. It says, he thinks, that he won't let the rules that past crappy politicians have lived by govern him.
Eric Orden -- thanks so much for breaking that down for us.
LEMON: You know that never works, right?
In fact, since 1944 the S&P 500 has averaged a gain of 11.1% per year under Democratic administrations, compared with 6.9% under Republicans, according to CFRA Research. That trend is even more pronounced immediately after an election. The S&P 500 has averaged a gain of 17% during the first year of a Democratic presidential cycle, compared with just 0.4% under Republicans.

Una promesa en particular de Price podría perseguir muy pronto a los republicanos.
What you're seeing there is the President simply reflecting the mood of the people, Mulvaney said. You promised folks you would do this for seven years.
Facts First: Japan does not export cars to the US for no tax; the US has a : Japan does not export cars to the US for no tax; the US has a 2.5% tariff on Japanese cars. It's obviously untrue that Japan never gave us anything, whatever Trump meant by that vague phrase; Japan purchased $120.4 billion in US exports in 2018, according to government data . And experts say that the 2019 deal between the US and Japan does not include a $40 billion payment from Japan.
Facts First: There is no evidence that Obama called Kim even once. This is a total fabrication, Susan Rice, who served as Obama's national security adviser, : There is no evidence that Obama called Kim even once. This is a total fabrication, Susan Rice, who served as Obama's national security adviser, said on Twitter in response to a previous version of this Trump claim. Obama never called Kim. Not once, Ben Rhodes, former deputy national security adviser to Obama, said on Twitter after this new claim on March 5. There's also no evidence for Trump's previous claim that Obama begged Kim for a meeting.
That puts the onus on House leaders, who have to find a way to convince both defense hawks and fiscal conservatives to go along with a short-term spending deal one more time. Republican leaders are expected to formally whip the proposal Wednesday, but the House Freedom Caucus' comments Tuesday cast doubt on the operation, after even some prominent conservatives seemed to be leaning toward supporting the continuing resolution Tuesday before the caucus met.
HARLOW: I think you just did.
Sanders repeated his claim that NAFTA and permanent normal trade relations with China have cost the US some 4 million jobs.
RUBIO: Well, I'm sorry I didn't answer that part. So the thing is that my - my generation, someone my age would retire at 68. We would continue to allow it to increase the retirement age for future generations until it hit 70. And so my children would retire at 70. I would retire at 68. It would be a graduating scale over a period of time.
He added that his returns would be out in a few weeks.
CUOMO: We always we know that that phrase does not have anything respectful.

And if the special counsel represents that he has investigated, and not been interfered with, and not been able to make a criminal case, then I will believe that he is operating in good faith.
It is perhaps possible that Trump was genuinely confused about the facility he visited in Texas, though he has made this claim before. Apple announced the same day of Trump's visit that it had broken ground on a new $1 billion campus in Austin. Trump accurately made reference to this campus in a tweet the morning after his visit.

The USMCA includes the US, Canada and Mexico. The Trans-Pacific Partnership, from which Trump withdrew the US, included all three of those countries but also nine others . Also, the USMCA is a modification to the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) rather than a deal created from scratch; many of its changes are small.
CUPP: Without a doubt it is. That's deeply disappointing. I hope Peter here changes some hearts and minds, right now.
In 2016, he dumped $12 million into the Pennsylvania senate race to help reelect an anti-choice, right-wing Republican senator, Warren added. And I just want to say, the woman challenger was terrific. She lost by a single point. In 2012, he scooped in to try to defend another Republican senator against a woman challenger. That was me. It didn't work, but he tried hard.

Sanders también revocaría la llamada regla de carga pública de Trump y se aseguraría de que los inmigrantes no sean discriminados en función de sus ingresos o discapacidad, al tiempo que extendería el estado de protección temporal hasta que existan resoluciones más permanentes.
Clearly, the editorial functions, the creative activities, are always sacred because that's where you generate the 25% of the revenue, from circulation, which we count on in good times and in bad, Lacy said. And it's the most sacred and the safest revenue stream of any media company. And unlike some of the newer digital players, we get paid for our content, which is what I like.
Mayor Buttigieg, there are four expenses that families pay, right, premiums, deductibles, co-pays, uncovered medical expenses. Mayor Buttigieg says he will put a cap only on the premiums. And that means families are going to pick up the rest of the costs. Amy, I looked online at your plan. It's two paragraphs, Warren said.
Trump has continued to rail against Iran, decrying the nuclear deal brokered under the previous administration as one of the worst deals just as he did during the campaign and arguing most recently that Iran was not living up to the spirit of the agreement.
But when it comes to issues, 36% of Democratic voters said health care was their priority in the presidential election this year, the poll found. Climate change came in second at 29%.
FRAN TOWNSEND, CNN NATIONAL SECURITY CONTRIBUTOR: Right. So there's actually an office in the Justice Department because this is now obviously a criminal investigation, that's responsible. The Office of Victim Witness Assistance. They are supposed to be the advocates inside the apparatus of the U.S. government to get updates, to make sure that the families are kept apprised. But you would -- you also expect and every department has this. If it's an employee that's lost, or it's a member of one of our law enforcement or intelligence services that agency takes ownership of making sure to shepherd the person through the system and around the system to get information.
(CNN) Andy Slavitt, the former acting chief of Medicare and Medicaid under the Obama administration, is expected to join President-elect Joe Biden's Covid-19 team in a senior advisory role, CNN has learned.
This time, the source of the problem is not a breakdown in the financial system. This is very different. We now face a major health assault. The pandemic is not only causing illnesses and straining health care resources, it is attacking the economy from a multitude of angles. Manufacturers are facing supply chain disruption, shortages are developing and demand is collapsing.
It's not just kids who are struggling. Last year the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that suicide among adults has risen in nearly every state over the last 20 years, in half by as much as 30%. Depression and prior suicide attempts represent significant risk factors for suicide.

For more on stimulus negotiations, CNN Political Director David Chalian breaks down the deliberations. Plus, it's looking more and more like there will be a Trump on the ballot in 2022.
Did Rubio discover a side of himself last night? It seemed that way. He was certainly different than he was when, you know, Christie put him on his back. But what does that mean in terms of the net positive on it? Does he wind up taking Trump voters? I don't know. Does he wind up strengthening a resolve of his own with all the skepticism around him? Probably so.
Why? Historians will likely be debating this question for years. After all the Iran deal is quite popular with Americans, a healthy majority of whom – 63% – want to stay in the deal, while only 29% want to leave it, according to a new CNN poll.

When you couple the regulatory leviathan with our broken appropriations process, where Congress gets cornered into take-it-or-leave-it omnibus spending bills that grotesquely limit its spending power, the legislative branch today exercises far less authority than the Constitution grants to it.
Wolfe's lawyers said in a statement upon the guilty plea: Jim was never charged with having compromised classified information, nor is such a charge part of today's plea.

Over the weekend, Trump revived his long-running feud against McCain – who died in August after a long battle with brain cancer – citing his ties to the controversial Russia dossier and his vote against repealing Obamacare. He said in the Oval Office on Tuesday that he was never a fan of John McCain and I never will be and complained on Wednesday that he wasn't thanked for giving McCain the kind of funeral that he wanted.
But how do we judge victory in this unpredictable climate? For Trump it will be warm words from senior Republicans and an end to GOP withdrawals from his campaign. That does not spell victory in November.
Still, more jobs gains could help the market. And ADP said that 263,000 jobs were added in March, well ahead of forecasts for about 175,000.

Last week, Trump's former personal attorney Michael Cohen pleaded guilty to lying to Congress. And prosecutors accuse former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort of lying to the special counsel and violating his cooperation agreement.
So Fiorina's claim that the bill has passed through Congress is false.
I do think that those of us who are from a younger generation have a very personal, very direct stake. And I think it's not an accident that the whole country right now, in terms of our policy debate, is responding to proposals put forward by a member of Congress who is even younger than I am.
Trump claimed to have caught the dirty cop on top of the FBI, former FBI director James Comey.
Most of the questions on Monday will come from New Hampshire voters, an electorate which prizes its position as the first-in-the-nation primary and is often known for asking discerning and pointed questions.
In recent months, we have seen proud Iranians raise their voices against their oppressive rulers. The Iranian regime must abandon its pursuit of nuclear weapons, stop spreading terror, death, and destruction, and start working for the good of its own people. Because of our powerful sanctions, the Iranian economy is doing very poorly. We can help them make it very good in a short period of time, but perhaps they are too proud or too foolish to ask for that help. We are here. Let's see which road they choose. It is totally up to them.
CUOMO: I hope not. I hope not. I hope that how much money he has isn't the best thing about him.
BALDWIN: The statement was true on adoption.
The talking filibuster that President Joe Biden said this week he could get behind would actually be more of a change in practice than Senate rules. It would force senators who oppose any given legislation to stand up and talk about it.
BUSH: I do when you compare him to governors that had to make tough decisions. That's the point. It's not that he's a bad person, to the contrary. Look, one of the -- one of the evidence in Florida of this is that every speaker before him and every speaker after him is supporting my campaign.
The conversations about reconciliation have been reinvigorated in recent days as Democrats have grown frustrated by the stalled negotiations to organize the Senate . Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell has dug in and insisted that Majority Leader Chuck Schumer agree to preserve the filibuster for the next two years. The filibuster protects the minority party in the Senate by requiring that legislation meet a 60-vote procedural threshold before passing. Schumer has argued that policy has never been part of an organizing resolution before, but the issue has delayed the process of setting up committees and passing Biden's nominees.
Let me play some sound, too. This is from one of President Trump's lawyers saying that the president had nothing to do with writing that statement.
Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, has repeatedly had to correct or dispute Trump's claims about medical matters -- though Fauci says he is fundamentally on the same page with Trump.
CRUZ: Well, we need to redefine our legal immigration system so that it meets the needs of the American economy. Right now, we're bringing in far too many low skilled workers. What that is doing is driving down the wages of hard-working Americans. Our system isn't working. And then on top of that, we've got a system that's allowing in millions of people to be here illegally.
QUESTION: ... nobody can wander into the White House on their own? Is he going to post somebody outside the Oval Office...
Lift contribution caps on flexible spending accounts. Obamacare put a cap on annual contributions to flexible spending accounts based on cost of living figures. For 2017, that cap was $2,600. The GOP bill would do away with that limit as of December 31, 2017.
Lifestyle planning, or thinking seriously about how you actually want to spend your time once you leave your job behind, is an important part of any retirement plan. It's especially crucial, however, if you're contemplating early retirement. After all, by retiring early you could easily be looking at a post-career life that will last as long, if not longer, than your career. Thus, if for no other reason than to avoid boredom or the feeling that you're just marking time, you'll want to do all you can to make this stage of your life rewarding and fulfilling.
Elliot Williams ( @elliotcwilliams ) is a CNN legal analyst. A principal at The Raben Group, a national public affairs and strategic communications firm, he was formerly a deputy assistant attorney general at the Justice Department and an assistant director at US Immigration and Customs Enforcement for the Obama administration.
Undecided and independent voters will have to decide if they respect her for taking the high ground, or judge her for failing to more aggressively call him out.
The judge, Shira Scheindlin, found New York City's use of the policy unconstitutional, in August 2013, and did appoint a monitor. But this was her decision, not the Obama administration's. The monitor , Peter Zimroth, was a lawyer at a private firm, not someone from the federal government who could have been sent by the President.
TAPPER: So, President Trump said he's probably going to make a formal announcement this week announcing that the U.S.-led coalition now controls 100 percent of ISIS territory in Syria.
And that is a disgrace. But the good news is, Jake, we've seen this before. We have seen a weak Democratic president undermine the military, weaken our readiness, weaken our respect in the world with Jimmy Carter. And in January 1981, Ronald Reagan came into office and that can change overnight.
None of this is to say that Hunter Biden's name was not a factor in the Burisma appointment; Hunter Biden has acknowledged that he would probably not have been asked to be on the board if he were not a Biden. But Trump's repeat portrayal of him as a pitiful unemployed man is inaccurate.
I have to be honest, Trump said, I never liked him much. Hasn't been for me.
'Those at the top are not doing their part:' WH looks to raise taxes on wealthy
BLITZER: Earlier Trump said the system was rigged. He has strong words against the RNC But now that by all accounts their relationship between Donald Trump and Reince Priebus who is about to speak right now is excellent. They speak several times a day.
The rule also eliminates the standardized simple choice plans that the Obama administration had introduced in 2017 to make it easier for consumers to shop. These plans got preferential display on healthcare.gov. Trump officials said that insurers complained the better billing on the federal exchange limited enrollment in other plans and removed the incentive to offer a greater variety of coverage options.
MORGAN: I saw Warren Buffet early today saying that he believe that it would probably run on to the debt ceiling which is still two weeks away and that that would be the extreme point of stupidity, I think was the phrase something like that. And at that point, they would finally not go over the catastrophic cliff of default.
SCARAMUCCI: Same here, but let me say this to you, OK? Whether it's CNN or any other news organization that is here at the White House, we are open for business. And I believe -- CUOMO: Good.
Scaramucci told Berman that he always got along with McCain, adding that he was a decorated Vietnam War veteran.
Trump's previous record for false claims in a rally speech was 36, in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania in 2018. His record for any kind of speech, 60 false claims, came in his longest address of any kind, an epic of two hours and two minutes at the Conservative Political Action Conference in March

You're going to need to get more help up here. We don't have enough people to hold the line, one officer said.
We have members of Congress who want to bring guns on the floor and have threatened violence on other members of Congress, Pelosi said.
What other option to we have? asked Rep. Mo Brooks, a Republican from Alabama, who said he was leaning yes.
This is a great thing. Trump also pulled the US out of the near-worldwide Paris Climate Agreement and has shown little interest in doing anything to restrict the emissions that create global warming. Side note: it was hovering around 59 degrees in Washington as he delivered the speech. In February. A couple of weeks ago, after it hit 70 — in January — the official White House account tweeted a somewhat misleading picture of snow falling earlier in the month.
MURPHY: Well, you know, the budget bill that we passed in the Senate through a committee last year provided for $1.6 billion in new border security money and, of course, members of the Senate have voted in the past for border security money, including barrier funding. I think the problem now is we've only got about seven months left on the fiscal year. So I don't think the president can actually spend much more than $2 billion, but, of course, we're willing to compromise. Of course we're willing to put more money into border security.
COOPER: You obviously, you know, you didn't see what happened earlier, but given what you saw in that moment of the motorcyclists, do you have any doubt that what they did was wrong in that moment?
At her event in Goffstown, Klobuchar pitching herself as a candidate who can win independent and lean Republican voters. She pledged to go everywhere, not just where it is comfortable, but where it is uncomfortable and outlined a platform that included overturning Citizens United, reinstating the Voting Rights Act, rejoining the Paris Climate Accord and getting on the path toward a public option for health care.
Si están mirando al CBO para encontrar exactitud, están buscando en el lugar equivocado, le aseguró Spicer a los periodistas la semana pasada. Los republicanos que apoyan el proyecto de ley también están destacando que la puntuación del CBO no consideró los efectos de otras reformas de salud que los republicanos esperan promulgar, como la legislación y los actos administrativos que vendrán del secretario de Salud Tom Price.

He was calling (President George W.) Bush, President Bush all the time, 'Get into the Middle East! Get in to the Middle East,'  Trump claimed, adding we've lost tremendous health and tremendous lives in that war.
TRUMP: I can forgive every once in a while there will be something that went too far and over the last few weeks and, you know things were said that were lies. I've got to be a good person today, at least for the next hour or so.
RICARDO ROSSELLO, GOVERNOR, PUERTO RICO: Hi, Alisyn. We are in the executive mansion. We have a center operations here to make sure that we have redundancy with the emergency management center. What we've been seeing, as we expected and as we anticipated for the people of Puerto Rico, this is the most devastating storm either in a century or quite frankly in modern history. So critical right now is for people to recognize that the brunt of the storm is still to come. There's a lot of flooding. There's a lot of infrastructure damage, but the only thing that should matter right now is that people stay safe, that we can lives, and they we will start the rebuilding process.
The Russian hackings, she said, appeared to be a more effective theft even than Watergate.
RYAN: What this is, is real relief for families who are living out their paycheck to paycheck, struggling to make ends meet. You know they hear about the economy getting better. They turn on the TV and they see the stock market going up, but now we need to make sure these people in our communities and our country who are struggling see their own personnel economy getting better. That's what this is all about.
But to keep Cruz, a Southern Baptist, from faring well, Trump has increasingly portrayed Cruz as fundamentally dishonest.
As Trump's senior staff in recent days mulled a potential executive order announcing the US' plans to withdraw from NAFTA, officials have had to consider tedious factors to ensure that they would maintain fast-track authority over a renegotiated deal and drafted several versions of a potential order to ensure it would pass muster. It's part of the reason the White House has yet to formally notify Congress of its plans to renegotiate the deal.
But Trump now seems to recognize the House Freedom Caucus's history as a rabble-rousing collection of leadership agitators, and being a part of a group the White House thinks brought down its first major legislative effort could be a politically vulnerable position.
Trump referred four times to former FBI director James Comey as a dirty cop.
KING: But let's give some kudos to Senator Cruz for understanding, especially on the Fourth of July, democracy is supposed to be a little feisty.
Biden toiled in the Senate after tragedy -- He has been in Washington since 1973, taking office after a personal tragedy and riding the train home to see his boys at night. He's the longtime senator from Delaware who chaired the Judiciary Committee and the Foreign Relations Committee and enacted major pieces of legislation. He made friends with Republican senators, some of whom he still praises even though maybe he shouldn't.
Loosening Obamacare's rules protecting those with pre-existing conditions also risks a backlash from the public since these protections are among the health reform law's most popular provisions. Three-quarters of respondents to a recent Kaiser Family Foundation poll said it is very important that Obamacare's rule prohibiting insurers from denying coverage due to a person's medical history remains law, while nearly that many feel the same way about banning insurers from charging sick people higher rates.
Facts First: Trump didn't precisely define losing your ass, and can't speak about every individual 401(k) retirement plan, but there is no evidence most people were suffering major losses in their 401(k)s before Trump came along.
But now we may be seeing that reflexive partisanship trickling down to the delivery of critical medical supplies at a time when body bags are building up around our hospitals.
Manifest destiny in the stars is a nice turn of phrase. (More on manifest destiny here.) The idea must be that the US is meant to expand and grow in space?

By replacing the entire health insurance industry, the government could displace 2 million workers, according to some estimates. Some of those would find jobs in the new government systems. Others could be eligible for up to five years of temporary assistance.

SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: During the last administration, small businesses found themselves under assault from a federal government that seemed determined to keep piling on regulations and compliance requirements until it became impossible to keep their doors open. Obamacare's mandates saddled many with health care costs they simply couldn't afford, and every year these business owners see new additions to the tax code that force them to spend additional time and money to file.

But somehow Massachusetts has only received 17% of what it requested — according to an analysis by the Washington Post — while Illinois Gov. J. B. Pritzker told CNN's Chris Cuomo that his state has only received 10% of what it requested, which could cause serious shortages as soon as next week.
And we know that Paul Manafort continued to lie to Mueller even after agreeing to cooperate. Trump also turned in his take-home test, giving written answers to questions from the special counsel.
The Trump administration did many things to weaken Obamacare -- including cutting the open enrollment period in half to six weeks, slashing the advertising budget by 90% and severely cutting funding for enrollment assistance. Also in 2017, the President eliminated federal payments that help reduce deductibles and out-of-pocket costs for low-income participants, prompting insurers to raise premiums to cover the loss of these cost-sharing subsidies.
The second ad slams Christie for his unpopularity in his home state, and describes his term as governor in five words: High taxes. Weak Economy. Scandals.

Whether one considered the pair successful on the merits is beside the point. Both had emerged from troubled but rich families to establish, it seemed, functioning businesses of their own. Ivanka's lifestyle brand was a mainstay online and in some large department stores, while Kushner had taken over his father's real estate business – the root of his most pressing current concerns – after the latter was jailed years ago. As President Trump himself might have put it, they looked the part.

Trump did amend one of his claims. After declaring at Saturday's briefing that people should use very good liquids to sanitize masks and re-use them -- though N95 masks are approved for a single use only -- he acknowledged Sunday that some aren't really set up for re-use; you throw them out.
The number of apprehensions and people deemed inadmissible at the southwest border, used as a proxy for the number of illegal crossings, was 144,116 in May. The number dropped every month through December, when it was 40,620 -- a decline of 72%. There was another decline in January, according to data obtained by CNN and not yet published by the government.
Also, states that opt to receive a set annual amount could keep a portion of any unused funds, though they must show that access to and quality of care has not declined and they must reinvest that money into state-funded health programs.
No coherent vision. Given the extent of Donald Trump's diplomatic malpractice, a huge opportunity opened up for any of the candidates to lay out a coherent vision and role for America in the world -- simply and clearly. And each candidate was offered at least two chances to do it. None did. What they did offer up -- using more diplomacy; working with allies; getting out of endless wars -- represented slogans and bumper stickers and offered not a single idea of substance on how they would approach these issues or the other serious challenges America confronts.
Sanders had the edge among Latinos nationally in a Pew Research Center poll of Democratic and Democratic-leaning voters last month: 30% favored the Vermont Senator, 22% supported Biden, 11% backed Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren. All of the other candidates were in low single digits.

BARRO: ... more and more people actually losing those benefits.
Trump's decision to support a ruling that would fully dismantle Obamacare, even as his administration has no viable alternative, is a risky gamble. If the ruling is upheld by higher courts, about 20 million Americans could lose healthcare coverage on Trump's watch.
So, I don't think it's going to happen. But this is the first of several names we're going to hear, and they're mostly for political positioning, and I think that's really what Sandoval trial balloon is.
A Kaiser Family Foundation survey found that some 84%of those polled say it is either very or somewhat important for any replacement plan to ensure that states that received federal funds to expand Medicaid continue to receive those funds. This includes majorities of Democrats (95%), independents (84%) and Republicans (69%).
This storm is massive in its size taking up a third of the country. And it's been a triple threat, really.
The main sticking point: the cost, which would be largely borne by taxpayers. Estimates of the 2017 plan run as high as $32 trillion over 10 years. Sanders' team argues that many people would still come out ahead because they wouldn't have to pay premiums, deductibles or co-pays.
Some argue that lower corporate taxes could bring a flood of cash back into the economy, creating an effect similar to Fed stimulus programs after the financial crisis.
Welch said other House Democrats are just starting to realize the size of Sanders' following and thinks that the gathering in Baltimore will be the first chance for members to huddle to hash out what it could mean for their own electoral prospects. Welch admitted, any talk about taxes makes politicians nervous. But he also emphasized Sanders is connecting with younger voters and that if the party is going to do well in November, it needs to bring those voters to the polls.
By the end of the night, Biden had won all five contests, swamping the billionaire.
Over the weekend, Trump revived his long-running feud against McCain – who died in August after a long battle with brain cancer – citing his ties to the controversial Russia dossier and his vote against repealing Obamacare. He said in the Oval Office on Tuesday that he was never a fan of John McCain and I never will be and complained on Wednesday that he wasn't thanked for giving McCain the kind of funeral that he wanted.

Not only is Trump the first president to have never served in government or the military, but he surged to the White House on far-flung campaign promises that even many in his own party dismissed as unrealistic.
Trump vs. the tape on Obama and the protester
Klobuchar spent the lead-up to the town hall with a trip through Wisconsin and Iowa, building on her campaign theme of retaking Midwest communities that have drifted away from Democrats in recent years. Klobuchar, a three-term senator from Minnesota, is pitching herself as a pragmatic lawmaker who is willing to work with those who oppose her to get things done.

And since then, this excimer laser that does this procedure has been revolutionized three times, and the price is lower. So, in this area of health care, quality went up and cost went down because I cared as a consumer what it was.
The uncertainty hasn't stopped Trump from tying himself and his party to the issue.

Facts First: Trump wrongly described how the Paris accord works. The accord does give China more time than the US before it kicks in; it came into effect for all participating countries : Trump wrongly described how the Paris accord works. The accord does give China more time than the US before it kicks in; it came into effect for all participating countries in November 2016 . The accord simply allows each nation to set its own targets for reducing carbon emissions. China picked 2030 as the year by which it planned to meet its primary targets, while the US picked 2025.

He added: I can't think of any solicitor general living or dead who would take that position, and yet they did.
Reducing drug costs: Like many presidents, including Trump, Biden has promised to lower drug costs. Among his preferred ways is to allow Medicare to negotiate prices, which is also favored by the Democratic-led House. But actually putting this into law would be a massive undertaking in Congress.
Instead, the Republicans want to issue refundable tax credits to help people afford coverage on the individual market, but these credits will be based mainly on a person's age.
CUOMO: And yet, what was that a crucible of last night, David Gregory, something you've talked about a lot. This crisis of confidence about who this party is, what that party is. You had that on fulsome, on full display last night. How do you think it mixed out?
CHAD MYERS, CNN METEOROLOGIST: Alisyn, I've seen the storm now going into the Turks and Caicos away from the Dominican Republic. Still 125 miles per hour. It did gain a lot of strength as it got back into the water, as we expected. But still traveling to the north and to the northwest.

They will be -- they will be the keepers of the evidence. But I must tell you ,you know, the answer on its face if we had adequate security kind of fails the common sense test. I mean, honestly, if you step back from the partisan politics of Washington, and you talk to average Americans who've got no dog in this fight, they sort of say, look, it's obvious we didn't have adequate security.

On April 26, 2009, less than two weeks after the first US cases of H1N1 were confirmed, the Obama administration declared a public health emergency. Two days later, the Obama administration made an initial $1.5 billion funding request to Congress. (Congress ultimately allocated $7.7 billion). That same day, April 28, a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention test was cleared for use. The CDC began shipping tests across the US and around the world on May 1. Between April 23 and May 31, the CDC says its influenza laboratory analyzed about 5,000 samples. In October, Obama declared a national emergency to allow hospitals more flexibility for a possible flood of H1N1 patients.

It was impossible to tune into this debate without thinking about the leaked tape of Trump's comments about women. So it's a good thing the moderators brought it up at the get-go, giving Trump a chance to reiterate his apology, let Clinton get a jab in, and move his campaign forward.
We will have to do something with Obamacare because it's failing, he said, gesturing to his 94-year-old guest. Henry Kissinger doesn't want to pay 116% increase and that's what's happening and it's getting worse by the minute.
Over the weekend, Trump attacked the late senator in several tweets that targeted McCain's ties to the controversial Russia dossier and his vote against repealing Obamacare. He also referred to McCain as being last in his class at the US Naval Academy.

Within 48 hours of his resounding win, money and endorsements poured into the Biden campaign. And the field suddenly cleared. Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar dropped out and threw their support his way in an Avengers-like pair of events in Dallas.
Some of Wolff's reporting has been corroborated. But several errors have been identified. Former campaign CEO and White House adviser Steve Bannon, who is widely quoted and is now estranged from Trump as a result, has not denied comments attributed to him, however.
Health care – and Trump's attempts to roll back Obamacare – became a galvanizing issue for Democrats in the 2018 midterms. Four in ten voters in 2018 said health care was the most important issue facing the country, according to a CNN exit poll, as they swept a wave of Democratic lawmakers into office to give Democrats the majority in the House of Representatives.
The House late Thursday voted in the rules package, which the majority party – now the Democrats – adopts at the start of a new Congress.
The Department of Health and Human Services is expected to take a very close look at the approvals involving work requirements, based on Thursday's executive order, the White House official said.

Unfortunately, the way he handled those allegations and revelations seems to have made things even worse. And I think that's why you see a pretty strong sense among leaders in Virginia. And, by the way, this is, of course, something for Virginians to figure out. But they seem to be pretty unified that they want a new governor and leadership that can carry that state forward.
The President said Thursday he had tasked a handful of Republican senators with cobbling together an Obamacare replacement. No such working group appears to exist, however.
Trump repeated his claim that he had reversed an Obama-era decision that had somehow impeded testing for the coronavirus, saying, They made some decisions which were not good decisions. We inherited decisions that they made, and that's fine ... We undid some of the regulations that were made that made it very difficult, but I'm not blaming anybody.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is poised to win yesterday's general election, but that doesn't mean the country's political deadlock is over . If vote projections stand, Netanyahu's Likud Party will still need to find partners to form a coalition government. And it appears from some projections that even the party's closest allies won't be able to fill enough of those seats, which means Netanyahu will need to recruit stranger bedfellows to secure a ruling majority. Almost all of the votes should be in by tomorrow , and this weekend, all party leaders who have achieved representation in parliament will consult with Israel's President over who should get first shot at building a coalition.

Trump, of course, did not save protections for people with pre-existing conditions, and nor did his party. The Republicans, backed by Trump, have repeatedly tried to pass bills that would have weakened these protections in Obamacare. They are currently fighting in court to get the entirety of Obamacare overturned.

CNN previously reported that the senator, who had been held as a prisoner of war in Vietnam, did not want the President at his funeral. McCain's daughter, Meghan McCain, also revealed earlier this year that she wished Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner, Trump's daughter and son-in-law and senior advisers, had not attended the funeral.
BARONE: That's not as -- That's not a serious ...
That overwhelming tilt in favor of helping struggling businesses instead of suffering individuals is, in my view, one of the reasons populism gained strength, as demonstrated by elections throughout western democracies in the 2010s.

Mis políticas conservadoras son inusuales dentro del periodismo. El creyente de Trump promedio pensaría que soy un rojo.

Si los medios mantienen enfocados a los políticos, los activistas políticos tienen la libertad de mantenernos enfocados a nosotros también.

TRUMP: No, I don't. Because actually I think I would do every well with, you know, one on one. I'd almost like that. It would really be a simplification. You know, when you get up to 46 and 47 percent and that's in a five-person field. So that's a very, very high position. And, you know, I laugh at the pundits when they say, well, you know, if you add on all of the rest, it's 53. Well, when people leave, I pick up a lot of votes.

But that schedule would also depend on whether the IRS could implement the changes that quickly, which might be a heavy lift considering its thin staffing and other responsibilities. The legislation gives the agency some leeway -- saying that the Treasury secretary could direct the payments to be issued as frequently as possible if a monthly timetable isn't feasible.

Average GDP growth did increase slightly under Trump, to 2.5% during his first three years. That's well below the 4% Trump had promised but a bit better than the 2.4% average growth rate during the last three years of Obama's time in office. But as of the 3rd quarter of his fourth year in office, the GDP growth under Trump was less than under the last five presidents before him at the same time in their presidencies, due in large part to the Covid-19 pandemic.

The obvious first order of business is clear: Everyone should have access to health care right now. It's not only the humane thing to do, it's the smartest way to slow the contagion. People who become infected should not fear bankruptcy if they go to the doctor. If they do, the epidemic will continue to spread.
TRUMP: I didn't need to do this, but I'd rather do it much faster. And I don't have to do it for the election. I've already done a lot of wall for the election, 2020.
Klobuchar's primary pitch to voters is likely to be electability. The Democrat has been notably successful in Minnesota, winning her three terms in the Senate by an average of 26 percentage points.

Due to problems with the VA database, some of those records include people who died before the VA had even started its health care enrollment system, or people who did not apply for health care benefits specifically. To say definitively that 307,000 people have died waiting for health care may be a stretch, so we rate her claim as it's complicated.
Facts First: Mexico has deployed around 27,000 troops, but Trump exaggerated how many are being stationed near the US border in particular. CNN : Mexico has deployed around 27,000 troops, but Trump exaggerated how many are being stationed near the US border in particular. CNN reported on November 2: Nearly 15,000 troops are deployed to Mexico's northern border, where they've set up 20 checkpoints, Mexican Defense Minister Luis Cresencio Sandoval said last week at a press briefing on the country's security strategy.

Michael R. Dreeben, who served in the Office of the Solicitor General for more than 30 years, including 24 years as the as the deputy solicitor general in charge of the government's criminal docket in the Supreme Court had a slightly less conservative take than Clement and Katyal when it comes to switching positions. Dreeben's tenure spanned 14 solicitors general and acting solicitors general, and he now works for O'Melveny. In a recent piece for the Yale Law Journal, he spoke up about the practice of changing positions, but never mentioned the Affordable Care Act directly.

As far as Putin is concerned, I think Putin has been a very strong leader for Russia. I think he has been a lot stronger than our leader, that I can tell you. I mean, for Russia, that doesn't mean I'm endorsing Putin.
They know they aren't going to get everything in their proposal, one Democratic official who has worked on the measure told CNN. That's the point here -- it's supposed to be a negotiation.
But these new examples are something else. They're Trump taking credit for the efforts of his own administration before his own policies can be enacted, which is why they feel so premature. He's trying to take credit for things where no credit is yet deserved.
Strzok and Page have testified that the insurance policy meant that they needed to probe Trump and his team over their dealings with Russia so that, if anything nefarious was occurring and Trump did become president, the country could be protected. Trump and his allies argue that Strzok meant something more biased. Regardless, there is no evidence he said go get him.
He said he probably never will like McCain, because John McCain received a fake and phony dossier.
CAREY-JONES: She was a great mom. She was very nurturing to her daughter. She's made sure that she got the care that she needed. She spent time with her. She was very happy to be a mother.
LEMON: Garrett, President Trump likes to say that Manafort didn't have a big role in the campaign. I'm not sure if he was exactly a coffee boy. But he only, he is saying, you know, he worked for just a very short time and you know, didn't really do that much. That is not true. He was campaign chairman, played a critical role at the convention. So when we learn that he is talking to the White House this year that is a big deal.

Quick story three years ago when I came to the House, the Speaker made comments to us at the very beginning to say, Previous Speakers of the House had run things in a real tight circle and a very few people had inputs. He wanted to open the House up and let the House be the House. The House is supposed to be boisterous. It is the area closest to the people.

(CNN) Welcome to CNN's fact check coverage of the last Democratic presidential debate before the voting begins with the Iowa caucuses on February 3. We will post fact checks as we complete them.
If you're retiring at 65 or older, you'll most likely be relying largely on Medicare to deal with the medical expenses you'll incur during retirement. If you're leaving your job before that age and don't receive health insurance through your, or your spouse's, former employer, then you'll have to get it on your own. Either way, you want to know ahead of time the terms and conditions of coverage and have a good sense of what you'll pay not just in annual premiums, deductibles and co-pays but other out-of-pocket costs as well.
Here is a note to all candidates at presidential debates: If you find yourself engaged in combative behavior with the moderators, you have lost the debate. At the combination town hall/presidential debate that Politico described as the most consequential forum in history, Donald Trump repeatedly clashed with the moderators and made himself look awfully small over the course of 90 minutes. Overall, Hillary Clinton's steady presence triumphed over Trump's typically uneven performance.
Facts First: The Trump administration has repeatedly supported The Trump administration has repeatedly supported bills that would weaken Obamacare's protections for people with pre-existing conditions.

In order to deliver on the conservative agenda we have promised the American people for eight years, we must come together to find solutions to move this country forward, the Texas Republican said in a statement.

It is time to lead.
Fine's head is just the latest to roll as the President has been systematically guillotining watchdogs across the federal government.

Wages are rising at the fastest pace in decades, and growing for blue collar workers, who I promised to fight for, faster than anyone else. Nearly 5 million Americans have been lifted off food stamps. The United States economy is growing almost twice as fast today as when I took office, and we are considered far and away the hottest economy anywhere in the world. Unemployment has reached the lowest rate in half a century. African-American, Hispanic-American and Asian-American unemployment have all reached their lowest levels ever recorded. Unemployment for Americans with disabilities has also reached an all-time low. More people are working now than at any time in our history — 157 million.

Among the issues you'll need to consider as you create an income plan: How much you'll receive from Social Security and whether you should you consider delaying claiming your Social Security to boost the size of your check; how much of your nest egg's value can you withdraw each year without incurring too big a risk of running out of money before you run out of time; and whether you should devote a portion of your savings to an immediate annuity or a longevity annuity, so you'll have a another source of guaranteed lifetime income in addition to Social Security.

We've gotten away from even talking about that, and we're going into his contempt for -- like (ph) his contempt people of color and then now we're going into the lieutenant governor. This is just it, which is actually a criminal accusation. So they really have got to just wipe everything clean, start all over so that we can govern and --
Now, we have to obey the laws. Have to obey the laws. But we have to expand those laws, because we have to be able to fight on at least somewhat of an equal footing or we will never ever knock out ISIS and all of the others that are so bad.

Additionally, a spate of negative headlines about Klobuchar's demanding management style have trickled out around her 2020 announcement.
John McCain campaigned for me on the streets of Brooklyn back in 2001, Bloomberg said. I don't know who set it up, but he did. And I wasn't going to go against him, but I quite honestly, I would've never voted for him because of Sarah Palin on the ticket. So I stayed out of that election.
These public pools, of course, were for Whites only. But when civil rights leaders successfully pushed for them to be integrated, many cities either sold the pools to private entities or, in the case of Fairground Park, eventually drained them and closed them down for good.
In the midst of an election campaign, we will surely hear complaints about socialism for businesses, but that would be misguided. America should have smart, humane capitalism.
There could be no greater contrast to the beautiful image of a mother holding her infant child than the chilling displays our Nation saw in recent days. Lawmakers in New York cheered with delight upon the passage of legislation that would allow a baby to be ripped from the mother's womb moments before birth. These are living, feeling, beautiful babies who will never get the chance to share their love and dreams with the world. And then, we had the case of the Governor of Virginia where he basically stated he would execute a baby after birth.

Governor Greg Abbott today held a press conference in Houston on the importance of election integrity legislation this session. The Governor named election integrity as an emergency legislative item during his State of the State address in February. Governor Abbott was joined for the press conference by Senator Paul Bettencourt and Representative Briscoe Cain, who have both filed several pieces of legislation to enhance election integrity in Texas
And Sanders' presidential rivals are looking to halt the senator's momentum following his win in New Hampshire and strong showing in Iowa.

Obamacare has extended coverage to millions of Americans, many of whom were uninsured beforehand. More than 10 million people were enrolled in Obamacare plans , as of mid-2019, while nearly 12.7 million low-income adults have gained coverage through Medicaid expansion , as of fiscal 2017.

Trump did well enough to keep his campaign alive and give hope to his supporters -- but his debate performance did little to counter Clinton's main angle of attack: that he's simply not qualified or prepared to serve as president.

It was a preview, aides said, of increased engagement with Americans outside the White House, where Biden has spent most of his term so far engaging lawmakers on the relief package. He has traveled outside of Washington on only a few occasions, to visit vaccine facilities and tour storm aftermath in Texas. But he has been itching to travel more, one official said, believing the case for his bill is best made out in the country, where polls show it widely popular.
This is perhaps the most direct character attack of the primary (well beyond the tame wine-cave drama) and Sanders just basically stood there and took it, which must have been demoralizing for his supporters. Warren has made up other things in the campaign and yet Sanders just didn't challenge her veracity on this one at all. Stunning.

The $350 billion in state and local government aid far exceeds estimates of their revenue loss from the pandemic.

Klobuchar's primary pitch to voters is likely to be electability. The Democrat has been notably successful in Minnesota, winning her three terms in the Senate by an average of 26 percentage points. Klobuchar won re-election in 2018 with 60% of the vote, two years after Trump came within two points of defeating Hillary Clinton in the state.

To date, 36 states, plus the District of Columbia, have expanded Medicaid to adults who have incomes up to 138% of the poverty guideline, or about $17,600 for an individual in 2020. Many Republican-led states continue to refuse to expand, although voters in several red states have forced their elected officials to broaden coverage through ballot measures. Consumer advocates are working to do the same in Missouri and Oklahoma this year.

So, it's something that's just unacceptable. I think I agree with what the president said. There were no winners in this. There were just a lot of losers, starting with the American people.
Here are some of the most significant ways Trump's policies and actions changed the country:
When we change the politics, or prevail over the politics, what it will mean to me, I think, to many of us on board, is when you show up every day as a lawmaker, who are you thinking about? Are you thinking about your next campaign or are you thinking about your constituents back home and their needs. As soon as we can flip that equation around, I think we will win.
This is not to say that Hunter Biden's name was not a major factor in his getting the role at Burisma. Hunter Biden has acknowledged that he would probably not have been asked to be on the board if he were not a Biden. But Trump's portrayal of him as a desperate unemployed man making no money without foreign income is inaccurate.
The late senator's widow, Cindy McCain, publicized hateful messages she's been receiving since Trump's tweets, and daughter Meghan McCain has continued to respond to the President online and on ABC's The View, where she's a co-host.

Esta fue la primera ocasión en 36 años que un presidente de Estados Unidos en funciones no acude ni participa en la cena de corresponsales de la Casa Blanca. El presidente Ronald Reagan faltó a la cena por estar en el hospital cuando se recuperaba de un atentado, pero dio declaraciones vía telefónica. Richard Nixon fue el último presidente en saltarse la cena completamente.
JACK QUINN, FORMER CLINTON WHITE HOUSE COUNSEL: That is a really important question. Why there were all these ongoing contacts and not just by Paul Manafort? But, you know, look. I think Paul Manafort was trying to have it both ways. I think, he was dancing with the Special Counsel at the same time that he was trying to keep his illicit affair with the President of the United States going.
Todd Harrison, director of defense budget analysis at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said he thinks Trump must have been including military funding for the 2020 fiscal year to get to the $2.5 trillion figure -- but the 2020 fiscal year just started on October 1, and Harrison noted that the defense appropriation has not yet been approved by Congress.
By the time Bloomberg took the stage in South Florida on Tuesday night, it was obvious the harrowing month had all but stalled the former New York mayor. Though the audience, lubricated by free wine and beer, and full of bite-sized burgers and flatbreads, gave Bloomberg a hero's welcome, his first lines acknowledged the disaster
They began by attacking Bloomberg and that paved the way for the feistiest debate yet. The candidates spent so much time throwing verbal punches at each other that none sufficiently explained why he or she would make the best president. Consequently, none received an A.
KAISCH: Well look, I believe in immigration, but it has to be controlled. The simple fact of the matter is I wouldn't be standing here. I'd be maybe running for president of Croatia if we didn't have immigration.
Trump referred to people standing in the crowd, then added, And I'm sorry we couldn't get you seats -- we didn't have any room. And by the way, 20,000 people outside had to leave. You know it's so cold outside we tell them, 'Don't worry about a screen. Go home, go home and watch.' -- December 18 campaign rally in Battle Creek, Michigan
KASICH: Hugh, I've said all along and laid out my foreign policy, I'm going to remind everybody that 55 percent of the foreign policy experts in this country said I was the best to be commander-in- chief.

The first bad sign came from Virginia. The state was seen favorably by Bloomberg's campaign. They had a sizable team on the ground, had spent nearly $18 million on TV and digital ads there, and the former mayor had a wealth of goodwill built up after spending millions to help flip the state legislature to Democrats in 2019.
MICHAEL D'ANTONIO, CNN CONTRIBUTOR: Well, right.
Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump made 56 false claims last week -- repeating one of his conspiracy theories about the 2016 election, promoting new fiction about impeachment witness Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, and inflating his accomplishments and his standing in the polls.
The President included a proposal to boost Affordable Care Act subsidies so that consumers don't pay more than 8.5% of their income for coverage in his $1.9 trillion relief package , which is already facing hurdles on Capitol Hill.
Bloomberg reported in an October 2018 fact check: In fact, U.S. steelmakers Nucor Corp. and Steel Dynamics Inc. were two of the healthiest commodity companies in the world before Trump took office. There is no doubt that the steel industry had declined from its heyday: the number of people working in iron and steel mills or in making steel products fell from more than 250,000 in 1990 to under 150,000 by 2016. Still, dead is a major exaggeration. In 2016, the US produced about as much raw steel as it did at various points in the 1980s.
Under my Administration, we will never apologize for advancing America's interests.
Advertising and outreach, however, are seen as critical to maintaining and boosting Obamacare enrollment. In fact, a bipartisan coalition of governors -- led by Republican Governor John Kasich of Ohio and Democratic Governor John Hickenlooper of Colorado -- on Wednesday urged the administration to continue to fund outreach and enrollment efforts.

DeSantis announced during the press conference that a COVID-19 antibodies test will be available. The test can show if a person has had the virus in the past without showing symptoms, and therefore may be immune to it. The test will be available to first responders and health care workers first, with the goal of being able to expand testing to the general public. (Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)
Insurers initially had a tough time setting premiums on the Obamacare exchanges since they didn't know how sick their new customers would be. Many miscalculated in the early years, racking up billions in losses.
ESCOBAR: So, there's a lot that I hope that she sees and I hope that she widens and broadens her view.
The move to intervene, however, is largely symbolic. Some Affordable Care Act supporters say that Democratic lawmakers would be better off passing legislation to address the lawsuit.
And CNN's Dan Merica reports that Pennsylvania's state GOP is planning to meet to discuss what to do about Sen. Pat Toomey, who also voted to convict and who is not seeking reelection in 2022. County parties have already censured him.
The consolidation of practices was already happening when Obamacare took effect, but it has accelerated because of the reduced payments to hospitals and provider systems the law has created. There is power in numbers, and consolidation gives providers better leverage in negotiating reimbursement rates and minimizing cost variances.
Rogers dijo sin referirse a esos programas que la Oficina de Gestión y Presupuesto (OMB, por sus siglas en inglés) «empaquetó muy bien lo que se debe cortar». Señaló que «la parte obligatoria del presupuesto, del gasto, está creciendo rápidamente, mientras que las cuentas discrecionales apropiadas están disminuyendo. No queda mucho dinero por recortar».
My Administration is also strongly defending our national security and combating radical Islamic terrorism. Last week, I announced a groundbreaking plan for peace between Israel and the Palestinians. Recognizing that all past attempts have failed, we must be determined and creative in order to stabilize the region and give millions of young people the change to realize a better future.
But even the most progressive members of Congress have come to support it.
BERMAN: Are you saying Gary Cohn faked a bad connection to get the president off the phone?
Meanwhile, Arizona Sen. John McCain vowed Tuesday to do everything he could to force lawmakers to increase military spending in the bill, setting up another fault line.
Becerra, who would be the first Latino HHS secretary if confirmed, defended his health care experience in his current job and in his long tenure in the House of Representatives.
Earlier on Tuesday, Whip Rep. Steny Hoyer, a Democrat from Maryland, said a deal on DACA needed to be part of a funding bill in order to get Democratic support.
Later in the debate, Sanders followed up another comment from Warren, where she said she was the only candidate who defeated a Republican incumbent in the past three decades. Sanders touted his 1990 campaign for US House, exactly 30 years ago, when he unseated Republican Rep. Peter Smith.
What would happen to premiums by age?
It's absolutely clear the penalty provided motivation to shop. So it made a big difference, said Peter Lee, Covered California's executive director. It's also clear that the federal and state subsidies helped people buy.
I doubt any Iowan leaning toward one of the top four candidates heard anything to make them question that choice.
These numbers are an encouraging sign — but we can't slow down until every American has the security and peace of mind that quality, affordable health coverage provides, Biden said.
Also, lawmakers have yet to confirm Xavier Becerra, Biden's pick for Health and Human Services Secretary, and the President has yet to name his administrator for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, who will play a central role in putting his agenda into place.
4. It brushes past some complicated Capitol Hill politics
BROWN: Well, this is the first kind of emergency we have seen like this that a president has done this.
After Bloomberg spoke, Biden argued that the reason stop and frisk actually declined was that President Barack Obama sent moderators to New York City to oversee the city's use of stop and frisk, appearing to mean monitors. He then added: Our administration sent in people to monitor it.
With this argument, Biden established himself as more credible as a potential commander in chief than his rivals on Tuesday's debate stage.
Biden has said he plans to have the US rejoin the Paris Climate Agreement on his first day in office. The US is about halfway toward achieving the accord's goal to cut emissions, but not on track to meet it, according to the New York Times.
It wasn't simply about politics, either. Yes, Ivanka was expected, for whatever reason, to act as some kind of check on her father's cruder instincts. And sure, Kushner is the son of a once prominent Democratic donor. But their underlying promise, like a boardroom pitch, was something harder to pin down. It was more of a look, that modicum of composure. It was something like … competence.
Cruz isn't the only candidate with whom Rubio is locking horns.
Arriving hours before the Senate enters into high-wire, public negotiations over a potential immigration deal, the administration's specific ask on new funding for the border is pretty much an afterthought. The White House has spelled out its four pillars for a deal, and border security will feature heavily in any agreement.
President Donald Trump has been adamant about one point this week: The Republican Party will soon be known as the party of health care.
These plans have also been around for a long time, but those who have them are not considered insured and are subject to the Obamacare penalty. Of course, that won't be a concern starting next year since Congress has effectively repealed the individual mandate requiring nearly all Americans to have coverage.

But if the Affordable Care Act eventually does fall apart, then you have a divided Congress that's not going to be able to agree on how to proceed with health care and that will leave millions of Americans who depended on the Affordable Care Act sort of in the lurch.
[14:25:00] Think of that, OK. That's another way. We spend in Afghanistan more money than most countries spend, except a few. They stepped up. I'm not holding Nancy to this but she said you'll never get the Republicans to vote for it. I never saw anything so beautiful in my life. That spired this many we don't need another Democrat. And I want the Democrats to join in, too. The 5.6 billion is such a small number. Literally it's one month in Afghanistan we're talking about national security. This isn't just a border. This is national security. This is health and wellness. This is everything.
But it also calls for making some larger structural changes, such as mandating a $15 hourly minimum wage, expanding Obamacare premium subsidies and broadening tax credits for low-income Americans for a year.
The woman in that car chase, once she peeled of, she was driving at high speed, she was running through lights and police acted as if this was an active threat from the White House over to Capitol Hill and they began firing. We're told by a law enforcement source, Piers, that in fact no shot were returned from that black vehicle that the woman was driving that all of the bullets were directed at that car. And when police were firing, they didn't even realize that the 18- month-old child was in that car with her mother. And it wasn't until the car came to a stop and the so called threat was neutralized that they realize that child was there, miraculously she was not hurt, she was taken to a local hospital and there she was checked out.
But Sanders didn't dive in fully.
In late May 2011, as the decision-writing season was heating up, Breyer fell from his bicycle while riding near his home in Cambridge, Massachusetts. He broke his right collarbone. In late April 2013 he fell off his bike in Washington as he was pedaling near the Lincoln Memorial. That fall required him to undergo shoulder replacement surgery.
He also blamed McCain for wars in the Middle East.
But that issue doesn't matter -- nor do the candidates' views on anything else, if Americans aren't allowed to vote. Our beautiful democracy only works when all eligible voters can fully participate. But even in 2020 the country continues to be plagued by sustained attacks on Americans' right to exercise one of the most fundamental rights of citizenship. Even still, in Tuesday's debate, there wasn't a single question asked about the candidates' views on how to combat voter suppression.
Facts First: It's not true that outgoing presidents usually leave no judicial vacancies to their successors. According to Wheeler, there were 53 vacancies on January 1, 2009, just before Obama took office; 80 vacancies on January 1, 2001, just before George W. Bush took office; 107 vacancies on January 1, 1993, just before Bill Clinton took office.
KEN CUCCINELLI, CNN LEGAL COMMENTATOR: Well, certainly, when you get a statement that they now say is basically accurate but has left things out, they invite more questions as time goes on. But I don't agree with Robbie that the Republicans -- the Republicans nominally control Congress but if you look at how the health care bill went, you can see the problem. The dysfunction isn't limited to any one part of Washington. It's on Capitol Hill, too. And the Senate Republican leadership and a lot of the Republicans who had promised for years to repeal Obamacare have demonstrated why they can't get things done. It's because they're breaking their promises.
President Donald Trump and House Speaker Paul Ryan are pushing legislation that would repeal key aspects of the Affordable Care Act.
Klobuchar's electability in Minnesota, which has largely come by taking more politically moderate positions, has some Democrats questioning whether the senator will be able to capture the imagination of a party that has drifted to the left nationally.
That is consistent that Donald Trump has consistently reached the bottom of his company and uplifted the people who hard a work to be at the top.
Klobuchar, who announced her presidential campaign during a snowy outdoor event in Minneapolis earlier this month, is the third potential presidential hopeful to appear at a CNN town hall. Sen. Kamala Harris appeared at an event hosted by Jake Tapper and former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz, who is considering an independent bid for the presidency, headlined a town hall hosted by Poppy Harlow.
Repeal the tax break for health insurance executives' pay. The legislation would roll back the Obamacare provision that placed a $500,000 limit on deductions for each executive's compensation. Top insurers pay their leaders millions in compensation every year so this provision could mean a nice tax savings for the companies. The provision would begin in 2017.

Facts First: Trump's rendition of the quote had Nunes using stronger language than Nunes actually did. Nunes did not say anything must happen by Friday; he said, Well, I think it's pertinent that the ICIG get these answers by Friday.
Trump's total of 81 false claims last week was above his average of about 61 per week. Trump is now up to 1,636 false claims since July 8, an average of about nine per day.
This is a moral issue. The lawless state of our southern border is a threat to the safety, security, and financial well‑being of all Americans. We have a moral duty to create an immigration system that protects the lives and jobs of our citizens. This includes our obligation to the millions of immigrants living here today, who followed the rules and respected our laws. Legal immigrants enrich our Nation and strengthen our society in countless ways. I want people to come into our country, but they have to come in legally.
Look, America is committed to democracy, and we're essentially a market-based economy. But you can't -- you can no longer simply kill off a line of discussion about a policy by saying that it's socialist.
Love him or hate him, there's no debate that Sanders is embracing policies that would rewrite broad swaths of the American economy. The US Senator from Vermont wants to break up Facebook, curb stock buybacks and provide Medicare for all. Whatever the wisdom of those moves, each would bring about enormous uncertainty for investors.

Y si todo lo anterior suena descabellado, o como algo que nunca sucederá realmente, no debería. Ya no debería sonar así.

Trump said nobody even knows what Roger Stone did to face the possibility of a nine-year prison sentence.

That plan, Meadows argued, didn't do enough to give assurance to the military. Meadows said Tuesday night that the House Freedom Caucus either wanted to see a one-year defense funding bill attached to the short-term continuing resolution – a nonstarter when the caucus pushed for it in December – or wanted to see Republican leaders include more funding of defense anomalies.
Cohen filings, you know, the Justice Department, whoever wrote this, the anonymous lawyer and author of this document has talked about how other Americans spend the lead up to the 2016 election volunteering in their community and helping to make democracy work, while Michael Cohen was working to subvert it and the basic principles of our campaign law.
Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney, chair of the DCCC, said he believes this bill gives Democrats the messaging advantage going into the next two years, and was blunt when asked about Republican attempts to attack the legislation.
Though the Trump administration rolled out a 44-page blueprint on how to lower drug prices in 2018, few of the President's proposals have gone into effect. A district court judge last year blocked the administration's effort to require drug companies to include list prices in TV ads.
Americans are not too enamored with the House GOP bill to repeal Obamacare.
Makes slight changes to the names of the Oversight and Education committees.
At the end of the day, the most important thing for the American people to know is whether the president is somehow compromised, whether there's leverage that the Russians could use over the president. And if the Russians are in a position to expose wrongdoing by the president or his campaign, that's compromising.
The plan's effects will become more clear when the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) releases its analysis of the bill early next week.
Maryland Democratic Sen. Chris Van Hollen called the speech disgraceful.

CARPER: Yes. Thanks. Happy Thanksgiving to you and to all your viewers.
The once great commodore hotel languished in a rundown neighborhood next to Grand Central Station. The hotel was sold to the one developer who showed that he had the kind of the drive packing an imagination that would be necessary. They chose Donald Trump.
As mayor, Bloomberg invited reporters every year from The Wall Street Journal and other outlets to review filings for hours and hours of time with the mayor's accountants, Stu Loeser, a Bloomberg campaign spokesman told CNN. The sessions offered journalists a chance to ask for explanations about every page, schedule and addendum in his taxes, Loeser said.
Coverage of the Republican Convention. Aired 9-10p ET.
Facts First: Trump had not set a record for total judges appointed as of this point in a first presidential term.
BASH: And what would your plan be in the short term to cover people under 50? BROWN: Well, you -- first of all, you go to Congress and you fix the
The significance shouldn't be minimized. When the actions of President Donald Trump are factored in, there is no precedent for this moment. Have there been objections in past years? Yes. Have there been objections of this nature, given the pressure from the clearly defeated leader of the country? Nope.
If being complicit is wanting to be a force for good and to make a positive impact, then I'm complicit, she told CBS News. I don't know that the critics who may say that of me, if they found themselves in this very unique and unprecedented situation that I am now in, would do any differently than I'm doing.
In another tweet, he said they should call him to fix the problem but he didn't mention he had made the decision to end the payments on his own.
Klobuchar's electability in Minnesota, which has largely come by taking more politically moderate positions, has some Democrats questioning whether the senator will be able to capture the imagination of a party that has drifted to the left nationally.
Lincoln Manor closed in September. Its owner could not be reached for comment, and his lawyer did not respond to an interview request.
So we had eight months to talk to them about Bernie when nobody else was talking to them, he said. It also helped us start reaching out to a new group of Latinos, which is the largest group who are newly registered, who nobody is talking to.
Klobuchar has admitted that she can be too tough on her staff in response to the stories.
Given the current fiscal situation, the administration is not proposing a budget at the new non-defense caps, reads an addendum letter to the budget, written by Mulvaney. Instead, the budget creates a new non-defense spending baseline, slightly lower than the amount Congress authorized Friday.
Collins didn't say that every administration from the beginning had committed abuse of power and abuse of Congress. He said : So they said, 'At the end of the day, we can't form any crimes. We're going to do a vague abuse of power. And while we're at it, let's just throw in abuse of -- obstruction of Congress, because we didn't get our way.'
But there are two more crucial pieces that continue to stand between the movement and a clearer path to achieving its aims.
He has a fresh start here, right. With some bad blood brewing between the President and General Kelly. The President didn't have confidence in Reince Priebus, his first chief of staff. So at a minimum, he's able to turn the page and say ok, where do we go from here, fresh start?
Some 12.7 million Americans signed up for Obamacare for 2016, according to new figures released Thursday.
Trump's budget doesn't ratchet down spending cuts any more slowly due to the changes in Congress – it just drops them down harder as if the budget increases never happened.
FEYERICK: She did. There was an envelope that was taped to the ground by her door and written his name. Initially they thought there was a letter inside. It was a sugary substance mixed with a corn substance. It was very bizarre and that's what stalled the speed of the investigation because they had to send a hazmat team into the apartment to make sure there was nothing that could potentially contaminate or make anyone ill inside that apartment. But there was that envelope addressed to him with a substance. They don't know why.
AMANDA CARPENTER, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: Well, if you think the dynamics of this race has to change in some manners. Something big has to happen before next Tuesday from shift the momentum that Donald Trump is building in building.
Biden on threat to US embassies
Trump said Rep. Jeff Van Drew had told him there were 175,000 people outside his rally venue in Wildwood, New Jersey, and he asked Van Drew if this was a fact. Van Drew, standing beside him on stage, responded that it was a fact. Trump soon added, We have tens of thousands of people outside. -- January 28 campaign rally in Wildwood, New Jersey
Michael Halle, a senior adviser to Buttigieg's campaign, said Bloomberg's spending devalued early states, where candidates have to rely on more than name ID and TV advertisements to create a media obsession that was in fact a fallacy.
I thought the reaction was pretty positive even though there were a lot of people saying – and rightfully so – 'God, here we go again,'  said Rep. Mike Simpson, a Republican from Idaho.
Klobuchar criticizes Sanders' 'Medicare for All' plan

CNN previously reported that the President promised to kill the deal on the campaign trail but was persuaded by cabinet members and allies several times to recertify Iran's compliance. Former Defense Secretary James Mattis told the Senate Armed Services committee in April 2018 that the verification provisions in the pact were pretty robust though he did not publicly back the deal. Despite his criticism of the deal, neither Trump nor his aides had been able to say that Iran was violating the terms of the agreement.
Kagan, a persuasive and pragmatic justice, admitted that every once in a while a justice changes his or her vote -- Not unfrequently -- and joked that it was a pretty good day if she were the one who swayed a colleague.

Planned Parenthood has said that money it accepts for fetal tissue is used to cover costs, not to generate profit. In October, the group announced that it would no longer accept any reimbursements for fetal tissue used for research.
I will do everything within my power not to touch Social Security, to leave it the way it is; to make this country rich again; to bring back our jobs; to get rid of deficits; to get rid of waste, fraud and abuse, which is rampant in this country, rampant, totally rampant.
Aparte del odio a la prensa, la otra cosa que he encontrado que une a los creyentes de Trump es un miedo a la decadencia. A menudo se observa que los partidarios de Trump son más ricos que la clase trabajadora que dicen representar, pero eso no tiene sentido. Se trata de ciudadanos preocupados que tienen una antipatía patriótica por el desempleo o el terrorismo islamista. Ellos votaron por Trump porque prometió restaurar la grandeza de la nación, construyendo un muro y reteniendo en Estados Unidos los puestos de trabajo.
February 7, 2013 - Gains national attention after he criticizes Democratic policies on taxes and healthcare during his keynote address at the National Prayer Breakfast.
Whatever chance Donald Trump still had of capturing the White House largely evaporated Sunday night in his second debate with Hillary Clinton.

Facts First: Murphy won the special election in North Carolina's 3rd District by : Murphy won the special election in North Carolina's 3rd District by 24.3 percentage points , not 28 points, and there was no sign the race had been pretty even. A late poll had Murphy leading by 11 points.
Republicans promised for years that they'd repeal Obamacare. Trump said he'd replace it with something better. But they couldn't peel off any Democrats and they didn't have enough Republicans. It was a major failure for Trump and he has lashed out in turns at Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Sen. John McCain and Democrats after several attempts failed.
Not one more American life should be lost because our Nation failed to control its very dangerous border.
SCARAMUCCI: And when the time is right, when the time is right and the president wants to do that or doesn't want to that, that will be up to him. What I want to do for all of these news outlets here is create the environment and create an exposure and relax some of the tension and anxiety. We're going to be open for business --
He's been a leader throughout the country for the past 12 years, Obama says in one of the ads, giving a glance to the former New York mayor. Mr. Michael Bloomberg is here.
So. Let's take a step back here and think of what happened here in Washington on Tuesday. Sitting next to the leader of a foreign country, the President of the United States went after a former Republican senator (and former GOP presidential nominee) who not only served in the Vietnam War but spent years of his life being tortured in a North Vietnamese prison camp. And this is a President who received several deferments during Vietnam, including for bone spurs. In an interview with The New York Times in 2016, Trump called the condition temporary and minor.
COOPER: You're gearing up obviously for the CNN Debate tomorrow night in Houston. What do you see as Senator Rubio's biggest vulnerability?
But Trump has been obstinate in the face of those political warning signs, instead concerned that repealing and replacing Obamacare remains the one signature 2016 campaign promise he has yet to make good on.
Most of the questions on Monday will come from New Hampshire voters, an electorate which prizes its position as the first-in-the-nation primary and is often known for asking discerning and pointed questions.
David Chalian, you're first at bat on this, our political director, because to hear Sarah Huckabee Sanders saying, no, unlike what the Washington Post is saying, no, the president didn't dictate the statement, did weigh in, as any father would, with limited information. It's not all adding up, though.
Tara Setmayer is former communications director for Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, R-California, and a CNN political commentator.
Republicans have vowed to press ahead with plans to repeal the Affordable Care Act, but since they don't have enough votes in the Senate to get a full repeal through, they are initially focusing on specific provisions that can be undone by a simple majority vote during the budget process. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office reported last week that under a Republican plan last year to partially repeal the law, 18 million people would become uninsured in the first year, rising to 32 million in 2026.
However, Marty Lederman, who worked in the Justice Department during President Barack Obama's administration, said the move was unprecedented.
QUESTION: He was pushing a story that was later retracted because it was false. He met with that reporter and he met with a campaign donor. Does it disturb you? Does it say anything about this White House that he would entertain that kind of story?
I mean, like David pointed out, next week on Tuesday, there's going to be proportional delegates allocated if Trump rolls and then goes into the next Tuesday where it's winner take all states.
LEMON: I want everybody to stick around. Michael Cohen isn't the only one in the spotlight today. The special counsel explaining in a filing why cooperation with former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort fell apart. We're going to break it down next.
Isn't it amazing how everybody is Barack's best friend now? Biden said last week in Nevada, delivering a sarcastic laugh. Man, look at all these ads, right? It's amazing.
Sen. Amy Klobuchar will take to the national stage on Monday headlining a CNN town hall in New Hampshire to make her most public case yet for why she should be the next President of the United States.

CUOMO: I'm never upset. I've got a big smile on my face.
That overwhelming tilt in favor of helping struggling businesses instead of suffering individuals is, in my view, one of the reasons populism gained strength, as demonstrated by elections throughout western democracies in the 2010s.
While a spokesman for Obama declined to comment on the Bloomberg ads, the spots have drawn the ire of several former Obama staffers, who have not forgotten Bloomberg's tepid endorsement of Obama, just five days before the 2012 election.
I only found out what it cost months after those procedures, when I got various bills from the ENT, the ear nose and throat doctor, from the anesthesiologist, from the hospital. And the variation of price between those three procedures from the same doctor and the same hospital within three years was huge.

Contrast this with other countries like the UK which have tested thousands and been proactive about identifying the full scope of their outbreak. On Sunday, data out of Washington state reinforced that we have been too conservative; genetic mapping of the virus in the community indicate that the Covid-19 has likely been circulating for weeks.
And we're going to have in some way or another a rapprochement with Turkey. And I frankly think the Europeans went in the wrong direction when they rejected Turkey from joining in to the economic sphere of Europe. The simple fact of the matter is, a lot of these Muslim countries, they are just - they can't believe the stuff they see out of people who have distorted their faith.

Pero esa propuesta es objeto de intensas negociaciones en el Senado, donde algunos republicanos nerviosos no están dispuestos a aceptar que diez millones de personas puedan perder cobertura bajo ese presupuesto. El último esfuerzo de Trump para recortar la financiación de los Institutos Nacionales de Salud fue bloqueado tanto por los demócratas como por los republicanos que defendieron a los científicos que trabajan en avances médicos.
Klobuchar's primary pitch to voters is likely to be electability. The Democrat has been notably successful in Minnesota, winning her three terms in the Senate by an average of 26 percentage points. Klobuchar won re-election in 2018 with 60% of the vote, two years after Trump came within two points of defeating Hillary Clinton in the state.

We're getting fire extinguishers thrown at us from the top ... in the upper level of the inaugural deck, an officer shouted in another clip.
Millions of our fellow citizens are watching us now, gathered in this great chamber, hoping that we will govern not as two parties but as one Nation.
TAPPER: All right. We're going to take a very quick break. When we come back, we'll have much more of this Republican presidential debate from the University of Miami right after this. Stay with us.
As of today, it's very predictable that Bernie is going to come in first. I would say that it's unsure who is going to come in second, Andres Ramirez, a Democratic strategist in Las Vegas, said in an interview with CNN on Friday.
CNN previously reported that the senator, who had been held as a prisoner of war in Vietnam, did not want the President at his funeral. McCain's daughter, Meghan McCain, also revealed earlier this year that she wished Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner, Trump's daughter and son-in-law and senior advisers, had not attended the funeral.

TRUMP: I feel a great. I mean, I think we're doing so well. I think the debate was really one of my best debates, considering the fact that I was being hit from all sides.
A proxy statement from McDonald's , a worldwide company, filed in 2018 with the Securities and Exchange Commission, shows that the company's median employee made $7,017 in 2017. What this number doesn't say is that McDonald's median employee is a part-time restaurant crew member in Poland, according to the proxy statement.
None of this happens, however, if Hillary Clinton is President. With Donald Trump, you have someone who has already pledged to sign transformative legislation to restore congressional oversight, has embraced tax reform and health care reform proposals similar to those in A Better Way and pledged to support conservative nominees to the Supreme Court.
MORGAN: It's not the language of civilized people in Washington, it's not the language of proper ...
TAPPER: Hmm. Democrats and responsible Republicans.
But I don't think you look at the border wall in a 12-mile area. I take a back seat to nobody in border security, and it's clear we have learned over time that we have the technology, helicopters, border agents, to make our country safe and to keep -- to keep illegal crossings at a minimum without building a long wall.

GRAFT: Which means that for months after he was indicted as part of a $65 million money laundering scheme, even as he was engaging in other witness tampering involving, again, Konstantin Kilimnik, which Jack rightly points out is an incredibly odd, but very consistent pattern of lies stemming from Paul Manafort through this entire enterprise, that he is still engaging in conversations with the administration.
Stressing that the nation's coronavirus response must be guided by science and by experts, he said backed Biden's Covid strategy and supported the President's plan to broaden health care access by building on the Affordable Care Act. And in largely amicable exchanges, he promised lawmakers on both sides of the aisle to work with them on health care issues in their states.
All the same, budget wonks' heads are spinning as they try to parse the dense document for political messages and accounting quirks.
To be sure, Biden is now at the center of conservative conspiracy theories, but it's also true that he's relatively new as a target. Trump's attempts to pressure Ukraine to investigate Biden his son Hunter were at the center of the President's impeachment trial. Trump and his allies have repeatedly made unfounded and false claims to allege that the Bidens acted corruptly in Ukraine.
We can do so much deregulation through the executive branch, by the secretary of health and human services. He actually just put one regulation out the other day which will go a long way toward lowering the cost of health insurance.

Facts First: Trump is inflating his administration's own estimate of job creation under the new trade deal -- which is even higher than an estimate from an independent agency.
Short-term plans don't have to adhere to Obamacare's regulations so consumers would have a wider array of options with lower monthly rates. But these policies can exclude those with pre-existing conditions or base rates on a person's medical history. They can also offer skimpier benefits so policyholders may have to pay more out of pocket if they actually need care.

This is expected to go much more quickly in the Senate than it will in the House. The House will have to vote in groups as they have throughout the pandemic. That could stretch to hours per vote.

Critics, however, say that widening access to these plans would likely draw younger, healthier consumers away from the Obamacare individual and small business exchanges, which would raise the rates of policies sold there.

Biden, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, and Trump-appointed Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell respond in unison: the risk of spending too little exceeds the risk of too much.

Decisions don't move forward and try to build coalitions unless the Speaker's leading us. So, the Speaker is in the lead.

Trump keeps simultaneously promising to protect people with pre-existing conditions and attempting to reduce protections for people with pre-existing conditions.

As the New York Times : Trump was exaggerating the increase in South Korea's military payments to the US. As the New York Times reported in February when debunking an earlier version of Trump's $500 million claim: Under the one-year deal, this year South Korea will pay 1.04 trillion won, or $925 million, an increase of $70 million from last year's $855 million.
In 2008, the government distributed hundreds of billions of dollars, mostly to bail out banks and large corporations. (General Motors was the main manufacturer rescued by the Obama administration.)
Meanwhile, he issued another executive order in late 2017 that would make it easier for Americans to buy alternatives to the Affordable Care Act that are cheaper, but offer fewer protections, such as short-term health plans . The law's defenders, however, fear that such plans could siphon off younger and healthier people, which could cause premiums to rise for those left buying policies in the Obamacare exchanges.
Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney said on CNN's State of the Union that it is officially the White House position that members stay in Washington until they've passed something.
Trump announced in his first year in office that he intended to exit the Paris Climate Agreement. He said during the announcement, which was aimed at curbing climate change, that the accord placed draconian financial burdens on the American people. It's one of many instances of Trump exiting an international agreement where he felt the US was treated unfairly.

There are a number people whose differences were not brought on board to be reconciled.

Trump correctly described Horowitz's findings about McCabe's actions, which Horowitz outlined in a 2018 report that was publicly released about a month after McCabe was fired. However, while Horowitz did refer his findings to federal prosecutor, Horowitz did not recommend McCabe's termination (or argue against it); the report simply said, The OIG (Office of the Inspector General) is issuing this report to the FBI for such action as it deems appropriate. It was a separate entity , the FBI's Office of Professional Responsibility, that recommended McCabe's firing after receiving Horowitz's report before its public release.

Facts First: We don't know when Trump was informed that Baghdadi's location in Syria had been identified, but it was clearly more than a month-and-a-half ago. He died on October 26, more than two-and-a-half months prior to this claim, so Trump would have been inaccurate even if he was talking about the raid itself.
What did stick was the impression that even a modulated Trump is entirely unfit for office. His fascistic vow to investigate and jail Clinton upon election; his throwing of his running mate Mike Pence under the runaway Trump Train; his inability to directly answer any of the moderators' questions -- none of these could've given comfort to members of his party that a Trump win would be anything but Pyrrhic.
JOHNS: Kim also referred to President Trump as a doddered or deranged and senile old man. That was in response to the president's latest executive order, indicating that financial institutions can participate in economics with the United States or North Korea but not both.

Sanders changed his plan in 2019 to include home- and community-based long-term care after lobbying by disability rights groups and to come more in line with a single-payer insurance plan put forward by progressives in the House. But this portion of his proposal, which stretches over multiple pages, would rely on a state plan to provide institutional long-term care services. Separately, he gives states the ability to set their own standards under Medicare for All as long as they are not less generous than the federal system.

It's not clear where Trump heard China would pass the US as the largest economy in 2019. Derek Scissors, a resident scholar at the conservative American Enterprise Institute and an expert on the Chinese economy, told CNN in 2019 that there were some predictions at the beginning of that decade that China would pass the US around 2019, but that experts were not saying this when Trump took office -- contrary to a Trump claim in October 2019.

Sign ups exceeded the Obama administration's initial projection that 10 million people would be enrolled by year's end, though that figure was widely seen as too modest. A large chunk of those who signed up during open enrollment will drop out over the course of the year, either because they'll find insurance elsewhere or they will stop paying their premiums.
And the effect of a 45 percent tariff would be when you go to the store, when you go to Walmart, when you are shopping for your kids, the prices you pay go up 45 percent.

I understand where the House members are coming from but the President's perspective was, If this is such a difficult issue and one that is demagogued easily, he said, asking, Why twist people's arms if the Senate is never going to pass it and it's never going to reach my desk?

The Iranians have repeatedly said they won't renegotiate the nuclear deal, which means they could restart their nuclear enrichment program.

As an example, I heard recently where the threat was made that they want reparations for years of abuse by the United States, and nobody's talking about it and they'll end up signing a deal and then we'll get sued for $400 billion or $1 trillion.
In some important ways, however, this bill repeals less of Obamacare than the legislation that passed the House and the version that was under consideration in the Senate until this week. It doesn't touch Obamacare's insurance provisions, including the immensely popular protections for those with pre-existing conditions. That will make it more likely to comply with Senate rules that will allow it to be passed with a simple majority.
Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming, the No. 3 Republican in the House of Representatives, was censured by the Wyoming Republican Party earlier this month after she voted along with nine other House Republicans to impeach Trump.
It's now clear that the January 6 mob attack on Capitol Hill, while failing in its bid to reverse Trump's election loss, has utterly fractured the basic level of trust needed to make a political system function — at a critical national moment.
TRUMP: Thank you very much, Anderson.

And you bring all the force you need. It has got to be shock and awe in the military-speak. Then once it gets done, and we will wipe them out, once it gets done, it settles down, we come home and let the regional powers redraw the map if that's what it takes.
If the proposed rule is finalized in coming weeks, premiums for Obamacare policies would rise 3.5% to an average of $15,000 a year, largely because healthier enrollees would opt for association plans, according to a new study by Avalere Health, a consulting firm. Those buying the new small business plans would pay $5,300, on average.
He conjured the kind of America First toughness, populist rhetoric and refusal to stand with elites against the heartland that powered his 2016 triumph and which he is ratcheting up ahead of November's election.
Klobuchar's electability in Minnesota, which has largely come by taking more politically moderate positions, has some Democrats questioning whether the senator will be able to capture the imagination of a party that has drifted to the left nationally.
If Republicans want to come along, great. Democrats are arguing Republicans can vote for budget reconciliation. If Republicans don't like the plan, they can keep talking to the White House, but the underlying takeaway from the meeting on Monday night -- and all the messages from the White House in the days before that -- is the President is only willing to negotiate so much. Republicans' $618 billion proposal with no state and local funding is not going to cut it . Period.
Mr. Trump a response and then we'll go to Governor Kasich.
Last year, McCain died of brain cancer, and as part of his services, lay in state in the Capitol building in Washington.
He was calling (President George W.) Bush, President Bush all the time, 'Get into the Middle East! Get in to the Middle East,'  Trump claimed, adding we've lost tremendous health and tremendous lives in that war.
Trump refused to take this step last year, despite heavy lobbying from elected officials of both parties and the health care industry. Eleven states that run their own Obamacare exchanges, along with the District of Columbia, allowed their uninsured residents to obtain coverage outside the usual time frame. Most, if not all, are also expected to reopen their enrollment, a White House official said.
[06:05:05] So that's essentially the landscape. And and we're still trying to see some of the hardest hit areas such as the southeastern part of the island. We still are lacking in communication there. But that's essentially a major disaster here in Puerto Rico, and what our focus is, again, is trying to save as many lives as we can.
On Tuesday, he continued his criticism, telling reporters at the White House that I was never a fan of John McCain and I never will be.

We are a big tent and that means that getting 50 votes on anything is not easy, Murphy said. It's not possible to have a majority leader who has a better sense of where all the pieces need to be than Schumer, but it is a challenge. Nobody should take it for granted.
RICK SANTORUM, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: Look, I think the president has the authority to do it. So it's hard for me as a senator to say, well, I disagree with him on the principle that he could exercise national emergency. He can. The Congress gave him broad authority to do it. Should he have done it in this interest (ph)? The answer is, no. I think he could have done in this interest (ph). I think he could have -- he could have done and in fact, most of the money if you look at his spending, he could have spent that without declaring a national emergency.
We're going to hear from Donald Trump in just a few minutes. But first, let's bring in our Chief Political Correspondent Dana Bash. She's joining us live from Nashua in New Hampshire.
BASH: Did you justice just compare Donald Trump to Hillary Clinton on this issue?
But when it comes to follow through, at least in his first 100 days in office Trump has come up short on the bite, failing to deliver on his toughest campaign promises.
I think that if we -- again, I go back, and I want to help people now, and helping people now is building on the Affordable Care Act, not -- not repealing Obamacare, which is what they suggest. It's making sure we fix the consumer protections for preexisting conditions.
For months, Nevada and North Dakota were among the biggest headaches facing President Donald Trump and Senate Republicans headed into November's midterm elections.
NUZZI: It's pretty incredible. And it's the type of thing that while on the campaign trail in 2016 Donald Trump liked to talk about his own ability to sell out large venues. He used that to say that he was going to inevitably be the winner of the election. And, of course, he was. And you have to wonder, you know, would she be garnering this much -- would she be getting this big of a crowd if she were on the campaign trail. And I think that she probably would be. She is universally it seems beloved.
CUOMO: I don't think they will.

Monday wasn't the first time McCain offered a strong rebuke of the President's character.
Congress doesn't have to wait for the president to fulfill his duty. We can just make a determination that Mohammed bin Salman ordered these murders and there should be some kind of penalty and repercussion for that.
We must move to universal health care. And I am so proud of the work we did as a party to protect the Affordable Car Act, Klobuchar said Sunday. We are to the point now where Obamacare is more popular than the President.

And secondly, we've got to make sure, as Speaker Boehner said today, not to go anywhere near defaulting our obligations. It would be the first time since 1789, we'd have a depression or recession for sure and I think we can get agreement on that. We get passage to a crisis then I think we can move forward and end the year on a positive note.

Lying Cruz put out a statement, 'Trump & Rubio are w/Obama on gay marriage.' Cruz is the worst liar, crazy or very dishonest. Perhaps all 3? Trump said.
JILL DOUGHERTY, CNN FOREIGN AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT: Well, there's three things they said to me. They're saying they, since the beginning, have made it a priority to be in touched with the families, maintain regular contact, as they say. They say that in the last 24 hours before the congressional hearing they've reached out by phone to at least one member of the family and told them what would be reported at that -- at that congressional hearing.
That is untrue, categorically untrue, Sanders responded.
Klobuchar spent the lead-up to the town hall with a trip through Wisconsin and Iowa, building on her campaign theme of retaking Midwest communities that have drifted away from Democrats in recent years. Klobuchar, a three-term senator from Minnesota, is pitching herself as a pragmatic lawmaker who is willing to work with those who oppose her to get things done.
The Trump administration slashed advertising by 90% and deeply cut funding for enrollment assistance -- two measures Biden is expected to reverse. Unspent revenue from exchange user fees appear to have accumulated to more than $1 billion over fiscal years 2018 to 2020, according to Kaiser.
The President has also announced on Twitter that Mick Mulvaney will become the acting chief of staff at the end of the year. Mulvaney will also somehow continue in his job as the director of the Office of Management and Budget, the OMB.

In one jaw-dropping moment, Trump threatened to put Hillary Clinton in prison if he becomes president, marking a new low for American democracy in an election season filled with new lows.
A major lesson of 2020 is that the past is not past. Relics and artifacts of White supremacy -- from Confederate monuments and flags to statues of generals who wanted racial slavery to continue forever -- still help shape the present, including policies that disenfranchise Black voters that were first promoted during the Reconstruction era.

But Sanders' biggest mistake, undoubtedly, was his failure to understand the mindset of middle-aged and older African Americans.
America's racial history remains, now more than ever, deeply contested. President Donald Trump's appointment of a 1776 Commission to teach patriotic education in our school systems attests to this. It is past time for national leadership that helps us clearly establish our past in all of its complexity. Understanding, for instance, racial slavery's expansive reach -- North and South -- into the creation of American capitalism gives students, citizens and leaders a more holistic appreciation of the stubborn afterlife of structural racism . The stickiness of America's current racial divide is rooted in a history that we continue to distort, gloss over or ignore at our very nation's peril.
I am particularly worried about what happened in the attacks on members of the Culinary Union, particularly on the women in leadership, Warren told NBC News. That is not how we build an inclusive Democratic Party. And it is not how we (beat) Donald Trump. We do not build on a foundation of hate.
But I would like to at least have the other side think I'm somewhat neutral as to them, so that we can maybe get a deal done. Maybe we can get a deal. I think it's probably the toughest negotiation of all time. But maybe we can get a deal done.
Before South Carolina, Bloomberg's internal polling had him in a three-way tie in Virginia with Biden and Sanders. But within a few minutes of the polls closing on Tuesday night, Biden was declared the winner, and ended up carrying Virginia by 30 points.
The ads seek to compare Trump's positions on taxes, Obamacare, firearm bans and North Carolina's law banning transgender people from using bathrooms that differ from their biological sex. The spots are virtually identical, with one referring to gun control and taxes and the other mentioning Planned Parenthood and Obamacare.
Facts First: Trump made at least five false or misleading claims about hydroxychloroquine in about two minutes.

It was a very stirring sentence to find in the middle of a legal document. So, I think that is something to take comfort in, but then you have this unfolding spectacle of the tweets and you know, even by the standards we've been living with of the last few years to have the President attacking his former Secretary of State, you know what that is like. He used the same epithet actually applied to Rex Tillerson that he is applied to you before.

They've offered 200 hours of community service. But given that Flynn has now clearly irked the Mueller folks, does that make it more likely that he could face some prison time?
Trump repeated three false claims regarding trade with China. He claimed we were losing $500 billion a year to China, for years, and that China never gave 10 cents to our country before he took office. Regarding his tariffs on China, Trump said the Chinese paid for that tax, it wasn't our people. They paid for that tax, they devalued their currency.

But Biden may not be as far out on a limb as he appears. His pandemic strategy has been noticeably un-Trumpian as he underpromises and over delivers. With more than two million jabs going into arms a day , he's easily going to blow past his call to inject 100 million doses in his first 100 days. At least 69 million Americans have already had one dose of vaccine and more than 37 million are fully vaccinated. Many states may have already expanded the eligibility for vaccines themselves by May 1.
Health care – and Trump's attempts to roll back Obamacare – became a galvanizing issue for Democrats in the 2018 midterms. Four in ten voters in 2018 said health care was the most important issue facing the country, according to a CNN exit poll, as they swept a wave of Democratic lawmakers into office to give Democrats the majority in the House of Representatives.

But there were times when Sanders faltered. He needs a better answer when it's argued that his health care plan would rob of countless people of their private insurance plans. On stage, his tone on the issue could be interpreted as condescension, which was likely not appreciated by viewers who disagree with his plan (and whose votes he may need to court come November). And while I appreciated Sanders' comparison of health care costs overall, he still needs depth in his explanation of how we can finance Medicare for All. That said, he was right to point at other nations who have successful nationalized health care systems as evidence that it can work -- and work well.
Now comes a massive bill. Boo.
For both Ivanka Trump and Kushner, what once made them appealing, at least to some, is only a few steps removed from what's turned so many potential allies against them now. The couple's inability, or refusal, to passably navigate the challenges implicit to their immense privilege has undermined any claim to some unique competency – even in a White House where the standards are so impossibly low.

Kim, for his part, promising the harshest countermeasures in history, indicating the United States would pay dearly for the speech. Let's listen to some of those incendiary words that set off this word conflict.
Trump initially pledged to eliminate the US debt in eight years. He later scaled down the promise to just reducing a portion of the then-$19 trillion dollar debt. Though he didn't specify the extent of the new goal, under Trump the debt and deficit only got worse. According to the latest report from the Government Accountability Office, the federal debt was at $26.9 trillion as of September 30, 2020. The GAO attributed the increase between 2019 and 2020 to the federal government's Covid-19 pandemic response, but the national debt was rising even before the pandemic. By the end of 2019, the federal debt was at $22.7 trillion , more than three trillion more than right before Trump took office.

On Tuesday, he continued his criticism, telling reporters at the White House that I was never a fan of John McCain and I never will be.
If the statement seemed rough, it was only because McConnell has been around long enough to know just how badly stung his GOP colleagues would be by their failure to reach an agreement by the end of the week. It's been nearly 40 years since a shutdown struck a Washington under one-party control. And back then, pre-1981, the meaning of shutdown was much different. Federal workers would usually work through a so-called spending gap, limiting the stakes and mostly shielding the public from any widespread pain.
When he won, Trump tried to do what he thought conventional wisdom said he should. He tried to make nice with the Washington establishment by hiring former Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus as his chief of staff. He trusted House Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell when they laid out an ambitious schedule to get rid of Obamacare and replace it with a conservative alternative.
During the 1970s and 1980s, Sanders waged several third-party and independent campaigns for governor and for US Senate. He also lost the Democratic presidential primary to Hillary Clinton in 2016.

Under expansion, states received additional federal funding to expand eligibility to everyone with annual incomes at or below 138% of the federal poverty level, or about $16,000.
For him, yes. Bad for the party, the adviser said, adding that it's in Trump's nature to continue to peddle his baseless election claims.
Let's be abundantly clear here: it is largely as traffic cop (as guided by the parliamentarians), ceremonial in nature as the person who announces tallies. Even the guiding resolution passed by the Senate to lay out the rules of the joint session make clear that's his role.

I endorsed him at his request, and I gave him the kind of funeral that he wanted, which as President I had to approve. I don't care about this. I didn't get thank you. That's OK. We sent him on the way. But I wasn't a fan of John McCain, Trump said during a speech Wednesday at a tank factory in Lima, Ohio.

But Abrams has another key quality for high office — when she sees injustice, she takes action. In the wake of allegations of rampant voter suppression plaguing the 2018 election and the silencing of Georgians across their state, Abrams flexed her executive repertoire by building an 18-state voter protection network, Fair Fight 2020 , that is wholly unprecedented in Democratic politics. Abrams has worked with federal, state and local leaders to build up the organization, raise millions of dollars to finance the efforts in Georgia and nationally, and anticipate GOP suppression tactics.

The American Nation was carved out of the vast frontier by the toughest, strongest, fiercest, and most determined men and women ever to walk the face of the Earth. Our ancestors braved the unknown; tamed the wilderness; settled the Wild West; lifted millions from poverty, disease, and hunger; vanquished tyranny and fascism; ushered the world to new heights of science and medicine; laid down the railroads, dug out canals, raised up the skyscrapers – and, ladies and gentlemen, our ancestors built the most exceptional Republic ever to exist in all of human history. And we are making it greater than ever before!

Trump's fitness for the presidency has now been openly questioned by some of the leading figures in his own party, including former secretary of state Condoleezza Rice (who asked him to withdraw) and Arizona Sen. John McCain (who rescinded his endorsement).
So perhaps the president was suggesting that the newest iteration of his tax reform proposal would offer a 0% bracket in place of a bigger standard deduction. Or maybe he was merely emphasizing the effect a larger standard deduction would have for those who don't earn much.

But Bloomberg's downturn began weeks earlier, as his lengthy record became a focal point at the February 19 debate in Las Vegas. His support for tough policing tactics as mayor of New York City, along with lewd remarks he'd allegedly made to employees at his company, gave Bloomberg's opponents ample fodder for attacks.

Facts First: This is likely an overestimate of the impact trade agreements can have on the country's employment.
Facts First: The individual mandate, which required Americans to obtain health insurance, was indeed a key part of Obamacare -- but Trump hasn't killed Obamacare, essentially or otherwise. While he did eliminate the mandate, he has not eliminated Obamacare's expansion of the Medicaid insurance program for low-income people, the federal and state marketplaces that allow people to shop for coverage, or the consumer subsidies that help many of them make the purchases.

The tension between the more aggressive approach favored by Sanders and fellow progressives, like Sen.

I am asking the Congress to pass legislation that finally takes on the problem of global freeloading and delivers fairness and price transparency for American patients.

It's time to attack it head-on, she said, brandishing a memorable and devastatingly effective fact. Look at the men on this stage: Collectively, they have lost 10 elections. The only people on this stage who have won every single election that they've been in are women.

My father was his kryptonite in life, he was his kryptonite in death. On a personal level, I agree with you, all of us have love and families, and when my father was alive, up until adulthood, we would spend our time together cooking, hiking, fishing, really celebrating life, and I think it's because he almost died, she said. And I just thought, 'your life is spent on the weekend not with your family, not with your friends, but you're obsessing, obsessing over great men you could never live up to.' That tells you everything you need to know about his pathetic life right now.
TAPPER: Welcome back to the CNN Republican presidential debate in Miami, Florida.
Clinton found her rhetorical footing answering questions about rising Islamophobia that Trump's calls for bans on Muslims have greatly contributed to. Clinton offered a nuanced vision of American society that included Muslim Americans and differentiated between religious extremists who advocate terror and ordinary Americans who happen to practice the Islamic faith.
Trump rattled through the night in a mood of huge self-confidence, taking political risks a more conventional politician would have spurned. It wasn't the performance of a President shamed and cowed by impeachment ahead of a vote in the GOP-led Senate expected to acquit him on Wednesday.

US Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump speaks during rally at the Atkinson Country Club in Atkinson, New Hampshire on November 4, 2016.
I mean, they can negotiate something. I agree there's no reason to build a 2,000-mile concrete barrier on the southern border. That literally makes no sense. I voted for the Secure Fence Act in 2006 that authorized 700 miles of fencing along the southern border. They can do a lot of things to enhance border security and maintain operational control. But what the president's talking about, he still hasn't really explained what it means, what wall means. How many miles?

Facts First: The aid : The aid did not arrive far ahead of schedule. While Trump did lift his freeze on the aid on September 11 , more than two weeks before a September 30 legal deadline, the delay caused by Trump's freeze meant that $35 million of the $391 million in aid could not make it out the door in time to meet the deadline, according to impeachment testimony from Mark Sandy, deputy associate director for national security in the Office of Management and Budget . To deal with this problem, Congress had to pass an extension of the deadline. Had that provision not been included, then any unobligated funds as of September 30th would have expired, Sandy testified.

For the past two days we invited that congressman from Texas to come on the program and explain why he's lashing out at some low-paid park worker when he is still earning a paycheck and making their money. They have health insurance. We got nowhere on that, by the way. It doesn't seem to want to talk. Neither does the CNN producer that caught up with him. Watch.
NETANYAHU: Yes, they'll work it out. You know, they'll work it out, been there down that but I'll tell you, you say we weren't there before, we actually worked. So, some of us introduced to change in Israeli system, which by the way, I think is not as good a political system as the one in the United States.
As rioters began to overrun the officers, creating an untenable situation, radio waves filled with desperate shouts and requests for backup:
SMERCONISH: I wonder if there was damage, though, to the brand long- term. Remember, they limited. They tried to reign in these debates in that Reince Priebus autopsy, because there were some incidents in the last debate that they thought harmed the brand, long-term, of the party. Regardless of who wins the nomination, do some of those perceptions linger and come back to harm whomever wins the nomination?
BASH: So, Piers, it doesn't sound like he's going to tone down the rhetoric that much. But with regard to actual discussions, you can sort of see there and you've heard all day the main reason why there isn't a lot of trust there. There really is just, frankly a lack of respect with regard to the discourse that is borne out of some really hard feelings that have gone on behind closed doors.

[08:15:04] I've experienced it myself personally. My family has experienced it. The American people, in Ohio, and the American people in West Virginia over the last two days, if it you saw those crowds, Chris, you would know how much the president is loved and how much the American people in general want the nonsense to end in Washington.

On the whole, Trump put on a performance that undoubtedly made his diehard fans feel reassured, but one that confirmed that he does not understand what is wrong with his attitude toward women, toward Muslims and toward Russia, and reminding us that he has a jumbled, dangerous foreign policy, and continues to undercut America's fundamental democratic traditions.

We did a little bit of a rally for two guys that are very special. One of them is Dan Bishop...He campaigned and he didn't choke. There was no choke.

When we hear these criticisms from Republicans, why would we expect something like that not to emerge in this case to make that bill OK, to pass, and get their votes?
SMITH: I don't even know if that's true or not. No, I don't. I don't know where. I look at TV and I see bloody hand prints on walls, thinking, my god, is that my son's? I don't know if he was shot.

Still, Washington has a habit of writing off presidencies early on if administrations fail to get a fast start.

What they're basically doing is they are insourcing and outsourcing. They are bringing in workers from abroad that are not direct employees of a Disney or someone else, they're employees of this consulting business. And what I argue is that no consulting business such as that should be allowed to hoard up all of these visas, that the visas should only be available for companies to use to directly hire workers and that we should be stricter in how he enforce it.

Reality Check: Paul on bulk data intelligence program not stopping terrorism
The White House has yet to decide whether it will take the lead on crafting an Obamacare replacement, they said, or whether the President will punt to Republican lawmakers.
House leaders pulled the GOP health care bill from consideration Friday after it became clear Republicans did not have enough votes to pass the legislation, in part because of near-unified opposition from the Freedom Caucus.
Ryan admitted himself in the wreckage of the health care battle that the GOP House caucus had proven itself so far unsuited to government and retained many of the characteristics of an opposition party.
The President seemed to acknowledge that his trade war hurt farmers, and that to offset their struggles, he celebrated the implementation of subsidizing tactics that ran counter to the anti-socialist principles he said he believes in.

ROMNEY: I don't know how many times I could tell it, I was wrong. All right? I was effectively pro-choice when I ran for office. If people in this country are looking for someone who has never made a mistake at a policy issue and is not willing to admit they're ever wrong, well, then they're going to have to find somebody else. Because on abortion, I was wrong. And I changed my mind as the governor. This didn't just happen in the last couple of weeks or the last year.
Bernie's prescriptions would be disastrous for the markets. He would be viewed with tremendous anxiety by the markets, said Valliere.

TRUMP: Well, because by return they're extremely complex and I'll make a determination at the right time. I mean no rush to do it. Nobody is bringing it up except to Mitt Romney and the reason he brings it up is that he lost in the last election and lost very badly. That many, many companies.
Flash forward to 2017, Congress acts to get rid of the tax penalty. So this judge last night says, look, you got rid of the tax penalty. That's the legal underpinning of this Supreme Court opinion. So now, not only is the individual mandate unconstitutional, but everything else must fall. That is a huge win for critics of Obamacare.
BROWN: You don't wipe it off, wipe it away and then come up with something new that will take time and will cause people angst and anguish to move to a different plan.
Give most New York counties relief from Medicaid payments. Lawmakers added a provision that would ban the federal government from reimbursing New York State for Medicaid funds raised by counties outside of New York City. The upstate counties and Long Island send $2.3 billion to the state to help pay for Medicaid. The amendment would give the state the incentive to stop passing down Medicaid costs to the counties, though state officials say it would mean fewer people would be covered and benefits would have to be curtailed.
KING: And we'll see if the president can make that case. Again, he's on his way to Europe for this big summit. And, also, a United Nations Security Council meeting this afternoon.
President Donald Trump complained Wednesday that he didn't receive a thank you for approving the funeral the late Sen. John McCain wanted, marking his latest grievance in his recent onslaught against the Arizona Republican.

The estimates vary widely. According to Macroeconomic Advisers, our economy took a $12 billion hit. The estimate from Standard & Poor's is twice as high, $24 billion. The Atlantic suggests we split the difference at $18 billion. To wrap our heads around it, that is more than $1 billion higher than the 2014 budget for NASA, so give or take a space program. That's how much we lost in productivity, temporary layoffs, interest payments and so on.
On separate occasions, Trump claimed that overdose deaths have declined for the first time in 31 years or in nearly 31 years.

Krieg: To be clear, though, you were speaking to Modern Healthcare about this, and you're quoted as saying, We believe every single American should have access to basic, affordable care. But we avoid using language like universal coverage that is polarizing. We want to bring people together, and certain words are used by one party or another to create divides. So, asking as directly possible: Do you support or oppose single-payer health care?
It was just one of several comments from Bloomberg identified by CNN's KFile criticizing the landmark Affordable Care Act in the years following its passage, including saying the bill was really dysfunctional and did nothing to solve rising health care costs.

Rep. Jayapal on Sen. Johnson: Stunning that a senator would say these things
In a statement Saturday night, deputy White House secretary Judd Deere said, The Department of Health and Human Services, under the leadership of Secretary Azar, continues to lead on a number of the President's priorities. Any speculation about personnel is irresponsible and a distraction from our whole-of-government response to COVID-19.
That is false. Just as it was false when he said they had all stopped referring to Christmas in the first place.
Obama has also used executive power to make changes to the law. One example: In November 2013, he announced an administrative fix to address the outcry over insurers canceling people's pre-Obamacare plans just as the exchanges initial open enrollment began. He opened the door for enrollees to temporarily keep their pre-Obamacare plans by signaling to insurers that they could renew these policies if state insurance commissioners agreed. The move raised questions, but ultimately wasn't successfully challenged.
After all, while plenty of Republicans didn't agree with McCain's much-touted renegade nature – and his willingness to buck party leadership – no one ever questioned the man's service to the country (in the military and in elected office). And doing so was seen as the easiest way to destroy your political future.
It's not too early to start thinking about your New Year's resolutions. Might we suggest pledging to getting your finances in order in 2018?
Senator, I want to ask you a little bit about what's going on right now in Alabama. Senator Roy Moore, Judge Roy Moore running for Senate there. The president all but backed him yesterday. I want to get your reaction to that.
But using that notion of cooling what the House passes to outright kill a bill by filibuster is not in the US Constitution, and likely not what Washington had in mind.

CUOMO: The waiting, as we know, Rosa, is the worst part in a situation like this. Prayers go to the point that miracles happen when it comes to recovery. Certainly, nothing is a guarantee. This is a horrible situation. But time may wind up being a friend as much as a foe for them, because they have to wait, but hopefully, more people may come out of that building alive.
Florida and Ohio each have a large number of delegates at stake and they award all of them to the candidate who wins. They're a winner-take-all state. So that's the first time that will happen in this primary season and this is the last debate before that critical round of voting.
Facts First: It was simply not true that testing had been going smoothly or that, as Trump suggested, it was simple to get a test by contacting the proper authorities.
Editor's Note: Watch CNN's town hall with Sen. Amy Klobuchar hosted by Don Lemon at St. Anselm College in Manchester, New Hampshire, Monday at 10 p.m. ET on CNN.
TRUMP: Well, I hope it didn't do too much. I mean I just can't answer the question. I was standing there when it happened and I sort of heard it once, and that was fine. And then I heard it twice, and that was sort of OK because, you know, some people repeat themselves. And then I heard it at least two more times, maybe three more times, and I said, that's a little bit strange. I didn't know what was going on because I'm standing right next to him and I keep hearing the same language. So I really don't know if it hurt him. Maybe it didn't hurt him at all. Maybe it hurt him a lot. You will see that probably tomorrow.

The Russian government, at Putin's direction, undertook an extensive campaign in 2016 to boost Sanders' primary campaign against former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, and to help Trump defeat Clinton in the general election.

The reason the tape had such an impact was because of who Trump has been and the kind of campaign that he has run since entering the race. It is hard to see how this debate enables Trump to broaden his electoral base, which is essential if he wants to win.

For example, at one point he talks about getting information from Mr. Cohen regarding matters core to the investigation. Core to the investigation must mean Russia/Trump campaign connections obtained from company executives, Trump company executives during the campaign. What Trump company executives were deeply involved in the campaign? That can only mean, I believe, the Trump family.
In fact, Obamacare has affected nearly all Americans , many of whom aren't aware of the law's impact. It saves senior citizens money on their Medicare coverage and prescription drugs. It lets many people obtain free birth control, annual physicals, mammograms and cholesterol tests. It requires many chain restaurants to post the calorie counts of their menu items.
Klobuchar spent the lead-up to the town hall with a trip through Wisconsin and Iowa, building on her campaign theme of retaking Midwest communities that have drifted away from Democrats in recent years.

Just hours after House Republican leaders planned to press ahead on a plan to try to keep the government open without their Democratic colleagues in the House, conservatives in their own ranks told reporters they believed the votes weren't there to pass a bill with just Republicans.
The obvious first order of business is clear: Everyone should have access to health care right now. It's not only the humane thing to do, it's the smartest way to slow the contagion. People who become infected should not fear bankruptcy if they go to the doctor. If they do, the epidemic will continue to spread.
Trump has also struggled to make good on his core campaign promise of repealing and replacing Obamacare with something much better amid disagreements between warring factions of the Republican Party. And amid his quest to get a bill passed as soon as possible, Trump failed to help bridge those differences and was forced to accept a loss, canceling a scheduled vote on the House floor.
There's a need here to figure out where we all can come together and rally around achieving – achieving – a real change to our health care system, Delgado said in an interview with CNN.

I am appalled that House and Senate leadership removed provisions from the omnibus bill at the last minute that would have finally brought accountability and transparency to Congress's sexual harassment reporting process, Gillibrand said. It begs the question: Who are they trying to protect?
And what the president is trying to do is make the health care system freer. However, because it's Washington, and there's a lot of webs here in Washington that have to be broken up like the cobwebs in your attic, we have to get out there and start with incrementalism. All good entrepreneurs have to start somewhere with a dedicated plan to finish in a great place.
The town hall format is familiar for Klobuchar, who has found success in her home state – which almost went for President Donald Trump in 2016 – by consciously visiting each of Minnesota's 87 counties, often to hold town-hall style events.

GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS, ABC NEWS ANCHOR: The special counsel did say that you were doing your best to tell the truth about everything related to their investigation, everything related to Russia. Do you think President Trump is telling the truth about that?
LEMON: They're not in the Oval Office, Chris. That's not disrespecting the office. Disrespecting the office is what this president does on a daily basis. It is not trying to make someone who has abused you, to make them comfortable.
At least that plan will likely include at least some tax increases to offset its costs. Aides say Biden has made clear that, unlike with emergency relief, he doesn't intend to add permanent changes in benefit programs onto America's structural budget deficit.

Now I think Michael is right that the President hasn't been very good in those sort of negotiations in the past then I think both Republicans and Democrats in Congress express frustration with his ability to smooch with Congress and advocate for his agenda on Capitol Hill.
This bill, unveiled Wednesday afternoon, is meant to be a wake-up call for Republican senators, to serve as a reminder that most of them voted for it just two years ago.

Biden se ha apegado a la Ley del Cuidado de Salud a Bajo Precio, el plan de salud característico de Obama, pero ha ofrecido propuestas de enormes subsidios nuevos para hacer que la cobertura a través de los intercambios de Obamacare sea menos costosa. Su plan incluye una nueva «opción pública» que permitiría a las personas comprar un programa que, según su campaña, sería similar a Medicare.
As we go to break, perhaps this is a sign of Nikki Haley, the U.S. ambassador, her sense of humor tweeting out yesterday, spending my Fourth in meetings all day. Thanks, North Korea. I guess that's a little bit of humor there. More on the global challenges ahead.
BOOKER: Thank you so much. Thanks for having me on.
Requires the text of a bill to be public for 72 hours before the House votes on it.
Large health systems deliver 'personalized' care in the same way that GM can sell you a car with the desired options. Yet personal relationships of the kind often found in smaller practices are the key to the practice of medicine.
So game this out for us. It will go through an appeals process but it could make its way to the Supreme Court. And the Supreme Court has now shifted dramatically since the last ruling. So how does this all play out?
So now let's welcome the candidates.
Trump claimed that The Apprentice, his reality television show, steadily climbed in ratings all the way to the very top: And then the show goes -- started at 10, went to eight, went to seven, went to five, went to four, went to two, it went to one. I had the number one show in all of television. Number one. -- February 21 campaign rally in Las Vegas, Nevada
Judging effectiveness by the amount of money spent and not the results achieved is irresponsible and unhelpful to the American people, said Caitlin Oakley, press secretary for the Department of Health and Human Services. A health care system that has caused premiums to double and left nearly half of our counties with only one coverage option is not working. The Trump administration is determined to serve the American people instead of trying to sell them a bad deal.
RUBIO: The businesses who are going to leave America because it's more expensive to do business here than anywhere else.

Governor Greg Abbott today held a press conference in Houston on the importance of election integrity legislation this session. The Governor named election integrity as an emergency legislative item during his State of the State address in February. Governor Abbott was joined for the press conference by Senator Paul Bettencourt and Representative Briscoe Cain, who have both filed several pieces of legislation to enhance election integrity in Texas
CUCCINELLI: I appreciate those comments as well, but -- and I'm not speaking to you, but they're new on the Democrat side. Ralph Northam got universal calls for resignation when this became the whole Democrat power structure. It got really quiet.
CAREY-JONES: I'm not going to feed into things that he reported to the press. I just know that my sister did experience postpartum depression with psychosis they labeled it, which came along with treatment of medication and counseling, which she did. And she had her challenges with that. And that's what she was being treated for.

Klobuchar spent the lead-up to the town hall with a trip through Wisconsin and Iowa, building on her campaign theme of retaking Midwest communities that have drifted away from Democrats in recent years. Klobuchar, a three-term senator from Minnesota, is pitching herself as a pragmatic lawmaker who is willing to work with those who oppose her to get things done.
Pelosi, it seems, doesn't quite buy that account.
NEWMAN: Well, I think that she did break boundaries in a lot of ways. And I think comediennes can like Amy Schumer and Sarah Silverman, I think she would have loved them because they really embody that kind of brashness and bravado and anything for a laugh no matter how personal it might be. That was really something that I know appealed to her. So I think she would have loved that.

Still, the governor's move sent consumer and patient advocates into a panic, with many fearing that other states would follow. They decried it as illegal, or even crazypants illegal, as Nicholas Bagley, a law professor at the University of Michigan, labeled it.
And yet, Trump treated Ryan, according to Sims' book, like a sub-human. Can you imagine someone – in a meeting – simply wandering off to watch TV in another room while you were talking? No, right? And, if they did, you would think a) is something wrong with them or b) that dude is the rudest person I have ever met.

End enhanced federal funding for Medicaid expansion. It would also end the enhanced match rate for Medicaid expansion for new enrollees starting in 2020. Those already in the program could stay as long as they remain continuously insured. States that have not already expanded would not be allowed to do so, starting immediately.
You praise the Fight for $15 campaign to raise the minimum wage. What did that campaign do right to avoid zero-sum politics, to avoid people using race to divide White and Black and brown workers?
And just weeks ago, both parties united for groundbreaking criminal justice reform. Last year, I heard through friends the story of Alice Johnson. I was deeply moved. In 1997, Alice was sentenced to life in prison as a first-time non-violent drug offender. Over the next two decades, she became a prison minister, inspiring others to choose a better path. She had a big impact on that prison population – and far beyond.
And we went right to talking about the unfinished business of America and the fact that there are still a lot of disadvantaged communities that we as a country need to focus on, because the truth is, when everyone just does well in America, everyone does well in America. So, I appreciate a guy like the president who seems to be concerned in many ways with those people still struggling in our nation, trying to fight to be in the middle class, who might be facing difficulties now, and I hope that we can partner on expanding this economy, growing our GDP, and making our nation more of a nation of abundance for everyone.
The seat ultimately went to Judge Neomi Rao. Walker was later nominated and confirmed for the lower court seat.
Trump said he thought Sen. Mitt Romney should have beaten President Barack Obama in the 2012 election, then said of 2008 Republican nominee John McCain: I don't -- I'm not a McCain fan, never was. But I didn't think he could have possibly won that one because, you know, he was handed over sort of a rough time in terms of many different things. And first African American -- I said that the whole thing was really stacked against McCain. And again, I'm not a fan, but I never said he should have won. -- February 13 radio interview with Geraldo Rivera
But one moment of dysfunction for the Republican Party was an exception: The GOP's failure to take a vote on a bill to repeal and replace Obamacare.
Not one more American life should be lost because our Nation failed to control its very dangerous border.
With your help, it's the closest we've ever come to universal coverage in America, Obama said in the 90-second clip released by Protect Our Care, a liberal advocacy group. There are people alive today because of what you did. There are 135 million Americans whose pre-existing conditions are now protected because of what you did.
Former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar each attracted about 1 in 5 of these voters, while former Vice President Joe Biden and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who have also campaigned on health care, landed in the single digits.

UNIDENTIFIED CONGRESSMAN: The chair knows this contravention of law and against the rules of the House, the sergeant at arms will identify the person or persons responsible and have them escorted from the House chamber before proceedings will resume.
And despite Johnson's suggestion that the health law will be repealed and reformed step-by-step over an extended time frame, President-elect Donald Trump has turned up the pressure on the GOP, saying at a news conference Wednesday that repeal and replace will happen essentially simultaneously.
Tuesday's filing continues most core elements of the Healthy Indiana Plan, but also expands beneficiaries access to substance abuse treatment and adds incentives for members to quit smoking, use chronic disease management programs and take part in voluntary job referral and training programs.
And I would contrast it with the way she greeted the President with the way that Hillary Clinton did not. Hillary Clinton has been similarly obviously very, very critical of the current President. And it's Michelle Obama who is the most admired person. It's Michelle Obama who's selling out 19,000-seat stadiums. So I don't think that it's as simple as, you know, she provides a sharp contrast to the person currently occupying the Oval Office. I think it's something more than that.
But Warren has an opportunity, perhaps a final one, on Wednesday night to change the conversation. And if there's any doubt it's still possible at this stage, she only needs to look over at Klobuchar, who used her performance at the Granite State debate as a launching pad for a surprisingly strong finish there a few days later.

TRUMP: I used to think Merkel was a great leader until she did what she did to Germany. Germany is a disaster right now. So I used to think that.
There's parts of the bill that I can read and understand, Duffy said. Tax code is very, very complicated. As we are dealing with international companies. On some of those more complicated parts I read summaries so I make sure I understand it. Unless you're a tax expert, some of it gets to be very deep. That's why I've chosen to deal with the legislation as I have.
Throughout his presidency, Trump acted as if this was one accomplishment he had successfully crossed off the list, continuing to tout the hundreds of miles of wall his administration had built.
I'm very unhappy that he didn't repeal and replace Obamacare, as you know. He campaigned on repealing and replacing Obamacare for years and then he got to a vote and he said thumbs down. And our country would've saved a trillion dollars and we would've had great healthcare. So he campaigned, he told us hours before that he was going to repeal and replace, and then for some reason, I think I understand the reason, he ended up going thumbs up, and frankly, had we even known that, I think we would've gotten the vote cause we could've gotten somebody else. So I think that's disgraceful, plus there are other things.
A Congressional Budget Office report found that 24 million fewer people would be insured in 2026, including 14 million who would have had Medicaid, if the GOP bill becomes law.
I am running because I see that sense of community is getting fractured, Klobuchar said on Sunday in Iowa. It's getting fractured by someone in the White House who gets up every morning and tweets whatever he wants but doesn't respect the amendment that allows him to do it.

And personally, I feel that, you know, as professionals, there has to be another way instead of shooting and killing an individual. I do feel that there could have been something else that could have been done.

Facts First: There is : There is no regulation from President Barack Obama that impeded coronavirus testing. The Obama administration did put forward a draft proposal related to lab testing, but it was never implemented. When asked what Obama administration decision Trump might be referring to, Peter Kyriacopoulos, chief policy officer at the Association of Public Health Laboratories, said: We aren't sure what rule is being referenced.
Those numbers are quite similar to these who opposed President Trump's decision to withdraw from the Paris climate agreement last year: 59% opposed that decision, while 28% supported it, according to a Washington Post-ABC News poll:

All the while, the public at large has seen more of Roberts on camera during the Senate impeachment trial than it has during his entire 15-year tenure on the court.
Our job is to tell people the good news of what is becoming law and to make sure they hear it and feel it and see it in their daily lives, Maloney said. The Republicans' job is to lie about what's going on and hope they can fool everybody. I think we have the better task.

Nonetheless, China is still nowhere near the total size of the US economy in terms of raw output. China says its 2019 GDP was about $14.4 trillion. The US says its 2019 GDP was about $21.4 trillion.
Facts First: This is an obvious exaggeration. It is clearly not true that everybody says Trump's phone calls with Zelensky were perfect or even good. Democratic members of the Congress continue to cite the July call as key evidence supporting Trump's impeachment.
The Senate is where a multitude of hurdles lie. Democratic Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York will soon take over as majority leader from Republican Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, but the chamber will be split 50-50, with Vice President-elect Kamala Harris available to break any tie votes.

Trump vs. the tape on Obama and the protester
Trump repeatedly promised that he would cover all Americans when given the chance to repeal and replace Obamacare. He stated that coverage for everyone was ​just human decency back in February of 2016.
You can't assume that every project that gets an EA is ultimately approved, but the vast majority are. And beyond that, most of the 250 or so (per year) that get full-scale EISs also go through, albeit sometimes with modifications to mitigate environmental harms and/or to quell political opposition, Karkkainen said.
In order to deliver on the conservative agenda we have promised the American people for eight years, we must come together to find solutions to move this country forward, the Texas Republican said in a statement. Saying no is easy, leading is hard, but that is what we were elected to do. Leaving this caucus will allow me to be a more effective member of Congress and advocate for the people of Texas. It is time to lead.

The buildings of downtown Los Angeles are partially obscured at midday on November 5, 2019.
Trump's administration is also allowing states to make major changes to their Obamacare markets, which could also leave low-income, older or sicker residents with few choices and higher costs. Few states have taken the federal government up on this offer so far.
Hillary Clinton and Vermont senator Bernie Sanders, they're out on the campaign trail. Sanders tempering expectations with a big lead in the polls.
If that happens, consumer protections could be even more important. Before the health law passed in 2010, some states passed hospital fair pricing laws that generally restricted how much hospitals could charge uninsured patients for care to no more than what is paid by public and private insurers. The law typically also required hospitals to provide free care to low-income uninsured patients.

Facts First: Mexico has deployed around 27,000 troops, but Trump exaggerated how many are being stationed near the US border in particular. CNN : Mexico has deployed around 27,000 troops, but Trump exaggerated how many are being stationed near the US border in particular. CNN reported on November 2: Nearly 15,000 troops are deployed to Mexico's northern border, where they've set up 20 checkpoints, Mexican Defense Minister Luis Cresencio Sandoval said last week at a press briefing on the country's security strategy. At the southern border, 12,000 troops are deployed and have set up 21 checkpoints.

To date, Republicans have not been able to do that with either the Biden administration or this Covid relief bill. A CNN poll released on Wednesday found that 61% of Americans supported the nearly $2 trillion economic relief package, with only 37% opposing the package, with several key provisions in the bill -- including providing larger tax credits for families, providing funding for student K-12 to return to the classroom, and sending stimulus checks worth up to $1,400 per person to most families and individuals -- polling better than the bill as a whole and with a majority of Republicans surveyed supporting the provisions.

The World Health Organization, fresh off criticism over adding gaming disorders to its list of mental health disorders, also added sex addiction to the list – and that's now stirring more controversy.

They're not convinced that sex is truly addictive and view the label as potentially shaming.

Sullivan wrote Wednesday that TV news is particularly culpable for the fact that, according to one recent poll, 76% of Americans say they haven't heard enough about the Senate GOP's health care plans. The first and largest share of blame goes to Senate leadership, Sullivan said. But too much of the mainstream news media comes in a regrettable second.
DENT: Right. By the way, deficits were projected to go up anyway. I'll just say that. Sooner or later this president and the Congress, whether it's Democrat or Republican, are going to have to get involved in a very serious fiscal reform, something along the lines of Simpson- Bowles, and get serious about it. The day is coming. And these deficits are only going to get worse. You're right, Don. You're making a point. It's money that's going to be deficit financed.

In other words, the first $X you earn would be taxed at 0%. And that 0% is possibly the fourth bracket to which Trump alluded.

As part of a bold new diplomacy, we continue our historic push for peace on the Korean Peninsula.

If I had not been elected President of the United States, we would right now, in my opinion, be in a major war with North Korea with potentially millions of people killed. Much work remains to be done, but my relationship with Kim Jong Un is a good one. And Chairman Kim and I will meet again on February 27 and 28 in Vietnam.
Here's the problem. No Democrat fought Obama. Everyone said oh, he's doing what we want so we're all for it. And that's the dishonesty that we're seeing out of the Democratic Party. It was clear there was no authority whatsoever to do it. They didn't oppose it.

While the Supreme Court has upheld the law in the past, it also made a major change to a key provision that has left millions of Americans uninsured, experts say. In 2012, the justices ruled the federal government could not threaten to remove existing Medicaid funding from states that don't agree to broaden Medicaid to low-income adults, essentially making expansion optional.

Removing financial barriers or subsequent punishment for those seeking screening or care will be essential to encouraging engagement with formal public health and health delivery systems, which must be on the front lines of containing Covid-19.
From the instant I took office, I moved rapidly to revive the United States economy – slashing a record number of job-killing regulations, enacting historic and record-setting tax cuts, and fighting for fair and reciprocal trade agreements. Our agenda is relentlessly pro-worker, pro-family, pro-growth, and, most of all, pro-American. We are advancing with unbridled optimism and lifting high our citizens of every race, color, religion, and creed.
The plan's effects will become more clear when the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) releases its analysis of the bill early next week.
So where did the reporter get his premise? Possibly from a controversial FAQ page posted by a leading Green New Deal proponent, Rep.

Relaxing the hardship exemption, for example, may lead to fewer healthy people enrolling, which could cause insurers to raise their premiums.

Funding is now open-ended. Conservatives complain that the financing formula encourages states to spend more so they can secure more federal money, while a block grant would prompt them to better control costs. Medicaid is typically one of the top two expenditures for states, and governors and lawmakers often complain that the state contribution eats up money that could be spent on education, infrastructure and other needs.
Here is a look at the life of US Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Ben Carson, a retired neurosurgeon and a former presidential candidate.
Trump is serially reluctant to admit error, even trivial slips he makes while reading prepared speeches. Instead of correcting himself, he usually pretends that he has not slipped at all.
Some have suggested that government needs to play a bigger role in negotiating prices for health care services and goods, such as pharmaceuticals. Such action would only stifle innovation, limit choices, and ultimately hurt patients and consumers here in America. Many Americans don't realize that, with respect to prescription drugs, they already benefit from aggressive negotiations between pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs), employers, and health plans to secure the best deal. This preserves choice for consumers while reaping the benefits of scale – namely, lower prices.

This time, the source of the problem is not a breakdown in the financial system. This is very different. We now face a major health assault. The pandemic is not only causing illnesses and straining health care resources, it is attacking the economy from a multitude of angles. Manufacturers are facing supply chain disruption, shortages are developing and demand is collapsing.
TRUMP: Well, I don't really agree with President Obama. I think I'm somewhere in the middle. What I want is I want a much better deal to be made because right now, Cuba is making - as usual with our country, we don't make good deal. We don't have our right people negotiating, we have people that don't have a clue.
I just made a deal with Japan where they're paying $40 billion. They never gave us anything. All they do is sell us cars for no tax coming into the -- to the country. -- March 5 Fox News town hall in Scranton, Pennsylvania
Facts first: Bloomberg supported Obama in 2012, not 2008. At a private event in 2016 he called his 2012 endorsement backhanded, saying he thought Romney could have done a better job as president. During his speech at the Democratic National Committee in 2016, Bloomberg four times said he was there as an independent, and not there to endorse the party's platform. Bloomberg did make comments in support of healthcare reform in 2009, but he later sharply criticized Obamacare, calling the final bill a disgrace.
Esta legislación reducirá sustancialmente los subsidios, millones de personas perderán su seguro de salud», dijo Elmendorf. «Ciertamente la gente estará peor.
Association health plans: These plans are usually sponsored by trade organizations or interest groups. Small businesses, and possibly individuals, could find it easier to obtain health insurance through association health plans, which would let them leverage their greater numbers to secure less expensive policies.
The president left his first meeting with President Xi down in Mar-a- Lago quite optimistic that they had developed some sort of a personal understanding that China would help when it comes to North Korea. After that launch yesterday, the president -- he's not saying he's giving up on that approach, but he seems more than exasperated.
Bloomberg did speak in favor of health care reform in March 2009 , as he mentioned at the town hall.
On Tuesday, he continued his criticism, telling reporters at the White House that I was never a fan of John McCain and I never will be.

The uninsured rate for non-elderly Americans plummeted from 18.2% at the time of the law's passage in 2010 to a low of 10.4% in 2016, according to the most recent data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Health Interview Survey. The overall share of uninsured Americans ticked up in 2018 for the first time in nearly a decade, according to Census Bureau data.
She said that failing to release the women from the nondisclosure agreements would be disqualifying for Bloomberg. But, when pressed by CNN's Erin Burnett, Warren said she'd still vote for him over President Donald Trump.

By passing the American Rescue Plan, we'll have heeded the voice of the American people, not ignored their voices, Biden says in the spot, before going through some of the specific planks of the bill, including money to increase vaccine manufacturing, establish more vaccination sites, send stimulus checks to millions of Americans and curb childhood poverty.
The governor of your state, Gavin Newsom, endorsed California Senator Kamala Harris in the Democratic primary for 2020. He joined four of your fellow California representatives in Congress.
New police radio dispatches and security footage from the January 6 US Capitol riot paint an even sharper picture of how the insurrectionists at times showed little fear of the police as they launched a large and coordinated attack.
A better tomorrow for all Americans also requires us to keep America safe. That means supporting the men and women of law enforcement at every level, including our Nation's heroic ICE officers.
Top Donald Trump aide Kellyanne Conway – who is set to become a senior White House adviser – wouldn't commit to a time line for replacing Obamacare, despite a claim by a top Republican senator about Trump's position.

Trejo-Ibarra, after going into remission, decided to get more politically involved and will serve as a precinct captain for Sanders in Saturday's Nevada caucuses . It fills a dual purpose for him: He wants to fight for people who can't afford insurance, which covered his own cancer treatments. And he wants to help those who can't speak English participate in the upcoming caucuses.
(CNN) Republicans in the House of Representatives left a meeting on Capitol Hill Monday evening with few answers on what will be included in a massive spending bill to keep the government funded ahead of a looming Friday deadline.
Supporters of reform are far outnumbering opponents, he said. And unfortunately, some of the 24-hour cable news echo chamber has focused on the small minority of folks who have tried to disrupt it.
The savage gang, MS-13, now operates in 20 different American States, and they almost all come through our southern border. Just yesterday, an MS-13 gang member was taken into custody for a fatal shooting on a subway platform in New York City. We are removing these gang members by the thousands, but until we secure our border they're going to keep streaming back in.
The immediate obstacles. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has a five-vote margin on this bill, and scrutiny on the package -- even by some Democrats -- is more intense than last spring's stimulus.
On the night that United States Special Forces Operators ended Al‑Baghdadi's miserable life, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Mark Milley, received a call in the Situation Room. He was told that the brave men of the elite Special Forces team, that so perfectly carried out the operation, had given their mission a name – Task Force 8-14. It was a reference to a special day: August 14th – Kayla's birthday. Carl and Marsha, America's warriors never forgot Kayla – and neither will we.
I believed and still believe we had a strong case to make for being able to deliver better outcomes, Patrick said. But the vote in New Hampshire last night was not enough for us to create the practical wind at the campaign's back to go on to the next round of voting. So I have decided to suspend the campaign, effective immediately.
Klobuchar spent the lead-up to the town hall with a trip through Wisconsin and Iowa, building on her campaign theme of retaking Midwest communities that have drifted away from Democrats in recent years. Klobuchar, a three-term senator from Minnesota, is pitching herself as a pragmatic lawmaker who is willing to work with those who oppose her to get things done.

I mean, there are people writing columns about this, about -- because that's what it is, they don't believe in government that's why they want the government closed.

'Those at the top are not doing their part:' WH looks to raise taxes on wealthy
Pero los periodistas tenemos que recordar que no todo el mundo es periodista. Fuera de la burbuja de los medios de comunicación, la opinión de estos está filtrada por el prejuicio partidista y a menudo es de un nivel bastante bajo. Trump ha identificado a un enemigo que, según muchos conservadores, necesita ser desafiado.
The White House also took a swipe at another Obama-era legacy last week: the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.
One of the ex-President's former advisers questioned CPAC's decision to welcome Trump back into the spotlight. It may be helpful for Trump to return to the stage as he attempts to solidify the Republican Party and eyes a comeback run for the White House in 2024. Still, the adviser argued, Trump's return is a setback for the GOP.
But the mayor's debate performance was also defined by attacks leveled against him from across the stage, primarily by Klobuchar -- who mockingly quipped she wished everyone was as perfect as you, Pete.
And you can just sense the members of Congress, Senators, Senator Lindsey Graham, others are already saying, Brooke, that their patience is wearing a bit thin on this. And if you don't believe the president on this, it is leaking into other things in terms of their credibility.
STEVEN BREWER, EL PASO REPUBLICAN VOTER: I believe that he's tough enough. I believe he's fair. I believe that Donald Trump is over the top. He really is. What he wants to do with immigration, especially in this area on the border it's just its going to breed ill will between the two countries.

The current system is riddled with endless regulations that are driving up costs and limiting choices for consumers. And you see how the collapse is occurring.
MORGAN: ... damage the global economy?
President Trump is calling for global isolation and voicing his exasperation that China won't do more to help. And the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, hardly shy about testing Mr. Trump's patience. Listen to this. He calls that ICBM test proof of his nuclear powers and a Fourth of July gift launched to, quote, slap the American bastards in their face. North Korea will top the president's crowded agenda when he lands in Europe and as the urgent focus right now at the Pentagon as well.
3. It pulls out the stops for Trump's tax cuts
The Freedom Caucus continued to push to repeal popular pieces of Obamacare, such as the requirement that insurers cover people with preexisting conditions, something President Donald Trump had publicly said he wanted to keep in place.
CUOMO: Well, the counter-argument will be pre-existing conditions will be up to the pricing of the particular state and market. It's not what it is now where you can't allow insurance companies to cherry-pick and punish people for pre-existing conditions. So, the protection is not the same, Senator, on that one point.
Comedian's surprise reaction to Grammy win while working on set is priceless
So -- but I don't even think about that now. I only think about New Hampshire. We want to have a great victory in New Hampshire. And we're going to lower taxes and we're going do all of the thanks that I know that I can do that these politicians can't do. Because the politicians, they're all talk, no action. Nobody knows them better than I do, Wolf. And, you know, I deal with them. I was on the other side of the ledger from them, don't forget, Wolf, my whole life until seven months ago. And many of these people I contributed to. Many of the people I'm running against I contributed to.
KUCINICH: Yes, that is rather far from that line. And so we just -- we don't know -- it's one of the reasons that the meeting between President Trump and President Xi at this conference this week is very important, and worth watching. It was going to be worth watching anyway because of the tariffs, because of lots of other reasons. But now, because of North Korea, China doesn't have the same objectives in North Korea as the United States and can he -- can President Trump get them there, any closer to where the United States is on North Korea. We don't know the answer to that question yet. We just don't.
Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren said former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg previously supported Republican candidates.
NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg explained during a meeting with Trump on December 3 that non-US NATO members have added a total of $130 billion to their defense budgets since 2016. By 2024, Stoltenberg said, this number will increase to $400 billion.
BORGER: Well, I think Harry Reid knows that it would make them squirm and that's why he's talking about it.
Klobuchar's electability in Minnesota, which has largely come by taking more politically moderate positions, has some Democrats questioning whether the senator will be able to capture the imagination of a party that has drifted to the left nationally.
Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah appears to have escaped the fate of other GOP lawmakers who faced fierce backlash from their respective state parties for reprimanding former President Donald Trump.
Klobuchar, who announced her presidential campaign during a snowy outdoor event in Minneapolis earlier this month, is the third potential presidential hopeful to appear at a CNN town hall. Sen. Kamala Harris appeared at an event hosted by Jake Tapper and former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz, who is considering an independent bid for the presidency, headlined a town hall hosted by Poppy Harlow.
Meanwhile, the budget offers a a fully paid-for proposal of its own, one that would provide six weeks of paid family leave to new mothers and fathers, including adoptive parents. … Unlike the Rubio-Ivanka parameters, the White House proposal suggests using not Social Security but the unemployment insurance system as a base of funding.
The bill does not contain everything Democrats wanted, namely an increase in the federal minimum wage to $15 per hour. Last-minute bargaining also led to a reduction in unemployment benefits.

In California, the state-run exchange spends heavily on marketing annually, allocating $89 million for fiscal 2020. It spent $9 million during last year's special enrollment period, which attracted 289,000 residents, more than twice the number that signed up during the same time frame a year earlier.
At oral arguments, the liberals suggested the court should dismiss the case and leave the fight for another day.

Tonight, I am also asking you to pass the United States Reciprocal Trade Act, so that if another country places an unfair tariff on an American product, we can charge them the exact same tariff on the same product that they sell to us.
Congress owes struggling Americans who buy their insurance in the individual market a breakthrough in the health care stalemate, said Alexander, who heads the Senate health committee. Congress should act before the end of September to keep insurance available at a reasonable cost during 2018.
SCARAMUCCI: No, you won't let me finish.
ERICA ORDEN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: That's right. So, as you pointed out, one of the important things to keep in mind is that both sides have asked for little to no prison time for Michael Flynn. However the prosecutors had been pushing back against some of Flynn's claims.
While experts have mixed views on how effective the mandate has been, many feel that removing it would cause the Obamacare market to tilt even more towards sicker and older consumers.
Hardly any would offer a categorical endorsement of the President.
From the start, Trump seemed exhausted and low energy as he faced off with Clinton. The first question of the night, about whether each candidate was modeling appropriate behavior for young people, was one that was certainly expected. But Trump blew it. He missed his chance to show genuine contrition for his recently revealed behavior. Instead his explanation for his lewd remarks about the Access Hollywood host and a soap opera actress was that it was locker room talk. This was a weak rationalization that will not improve his standing with women -- or anyone who has ever been in a locker room in their life.
Trump claimed three times that Mexico has deployed 27,000 soldiers to the US border.
KING: Senator Cruz, sadly, was more the exception than the rule. More and more lawmakers are skipping holiday parades and town halls back home because they don't want to face questions and protests. Minnesota Republican Congressman Erik Paulsen, for example, skipped the Fourth of July parade in Edina, so protesters stepped in.
GREGORY: Can I just say on Kasich, a positive and a negative? The positive answer on Apple where he challenged President Obama and said you've got a lead on this. Bring the government and Apple together and force a solution that balances these two concerns. A big negative for him: someone who wants to have more moderate
A record number of young Americans are now employed.
Everything about Bloomberg's campaign was unprecedented. No one had ever spent that much or gotten in so late. His whole strategy hinged on Super Tuesday. The 14-state contest would either prove Bloomberg's audacious plan could work, or it would end up as one of the most expensive failures in modern political history.
GRUBER: Well look, I think when the law passed we all thought the mandate was a very important part of the law. We have now basically been proven that it's important but not as important as we thought because look, we now have experience of the law without it, they removed the mandate. And we are seeing it weakens the law, it raises premiums, but the law still remains quite strong, albeit not as strong as it would have been.
Trump said previous presidents had not demanded military spending increases from NATO members: President Obama would go down to make a speech. 'I'd like to thank everybody for being here, thanks a lot, great job, sayonara, bye.' Bush, they all did. Nobody ever asked for money. -- December 18 campaign rally in Battle Creek, Michigan
I want to build on the momentum that we saw here in 2018, Klobuchar told reporters Saturday in Wisconsin. No one ever thought that the Democrats were going to be able (to defeat) Gov. Walker, but we did it, and we did it in a smart, Wisconsin way with a grassroots campaign with (Democratic Sen.) Tammy Baldwin at the top of the ticket, and we can do it in the presidential, as well.
Trump claimed three times that the women's unemployment rate is the lowest in 71 years.
The Trump administration is also readying the final rule for short-term health plans, which would serve as another alternative to Obamacare. Officials are expected to allow these plans to be sold for up to a year, as opposed to the current 90-day limit.

Under Medicare for All, everyone would be insured by a plan run by the federal government. It would cover all medically necessary care, including vision and dental. Private insurers could remain in business, but could only provide benefits – such as elective surgery – not covered by the federal plan.
Sen. John Barrasso of Wyoming, the third senator Trump name-checked, spoke with Trump about health care on Wednesday morning, but his staff said they did not have anything to share at the moment when asked about the specific working group.
SANDERS: I don't know that I would say approval is the correct word. But I certainly don't think it's like we're getting permission slips signed.
Facts First: Bloomberg was misleading by omission, as he has been Bloomberg was misleading by omission, as he has been before , when he cited a 95% decline in stop and frisk. While there was such a reduction , it happened only during the last two years of his 12-year mayoralty, from the first quarter of 2012 to the last quarter of 2013, following a 605% increase in his first 10 years. Looking at his entire mayoralty, from 2002 through 2013, there was a 97% increase , not a decrease.
(CNN) No wonder congressional Democrats remain so united behind President Joe Biden's new administration: Quietly but quickly, they are taking major strides toward their shared goal of curbing economic inequality.

KING: In this particular -- this is one of the cases for people out there who are fans or not fans of the United Nations. This is one of those things where there have been meetings, there have been condemnation, there have been statements, there have been sanctions. Again, we go back to -- I covered the White House in the Bill Clinton administration into the George W. Bush administration. We've had these conversations now for a very long time.
Facts First: Bloomberg accurately pointed to a US intelligence community belief that Russia is trying to help Sanders' campaign. Russia also backed Sanders in the 2016 primary, but Sanders has publicly denounced Russian interference in US politics.
TRUMP: We won with highly educated, we won with poorly educated. I really love the poorly educated. And you know what I really, I'm happy about because I've been saying it for a long time, 46 percent with the Hispanics, 46 percent, number one with Hispanics.
The question now is whether Biden can use South Carolina as a launchpad, two days ahead of this week's Super Tuesday contests in 15 states and territories in which Sanders, who finished in second, is hoping to build up an unassailable lead in the delegate count.
They love this country. They don't like seeing bad trade deals, they don't like seeing higher taxes, they don't like seeing a loss of their jobs where our jobs have just been devastated. And I know - I mean, I see it. There is some anger. There's also great love for the country. It's a beautiful thing in many respects. But I certainly do not condone that at all, Jake.

Dr. David Gifford, the American Health Care Association's senior vice president for quality, said daily fines were intended to prompt quick remedies but were pointless when applied to past errors that had already been fixed by the time inspectors discovered them.
The silence could mean the justices are struggling, searching for narrow areas of agreement. Or the chief might be purposely working to keep the court out of the current political glare. He could simply be distracted by the hours and hours of work he's had to put in across the street, where his attention to detail and legendary preparation have been on full display.
CARY: Thank you for having us on your show.
When Trump initially attacked McCain as something less than a war hero in 2015, it was covered as the end of a campaign that never really got started. Trump has been in the race for all of a month. He was still an asterisk in most polling. And everyone who knew anything assumed that attacking McCain's five years spent as a prisoner of war in Vietnam – a time that left the Arizona Republican with lifelong wounds – was a death sentence of Trump's political ambitions.
Trump reinstated and expanded the so-called Mexico City Policy , a ban on funding for foreign nonprofits that perform or promote abortions, during his tenure.
But you know, that's just an inkling of the ways that the people surrounding Donald Trump were in contact with the Russians. And of course, what we saw from candidate Trump and then President Trump was, no, nothing to see here. I have no ties to the Russians. No one in my campaign was in touch with the Russians. I have no business deals with the Russians. Not entirely truthful or accurate there, Don.
You can't do both. ... His legacy will be judged on what he gets done. If (Republicans) are going to stop him from getting anything done, his legacy will not be a good one, Reid said, before he put a finer point on it: Joe Biden will be recognized for what he's accomplished. And won't be recognized for 'I got along with everybody. We didn't get everything done, but I was sure nice to everybody.' 
CUOMO: That's like having economists give us an assessment. These are the experts on that subject.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: They continue to hear people's cries.
Facts First: Both figures are correct, though it's worth noting that the numbers include both large traditional factories and tiny facilities that produce goods with fewer than five employees.
COOPER: That point blank, is does that mean you absolutely will release them? Just a question of when?
Increase flexibility and issue more administrative fixes: Following Trump's lead, the Health & Human Services Department could be more flexible in granting waivers. So states that want to institute additional rules -- such as work requirements -- in their Medicaid expansion programs would likely get the go-ahead, whereas they were denied permission under the Obama administration.
Trump claimed I opened up LNG plants in Louisiana where companies had been unable to get permits for for 10, 12, 14 years and longer. He said, I got them built, a $10 billion plant in Louisiana.
Knock it off. Pass a budget. And move on.
Neither Newman nor Lipinski endorsed a presidential candidate, but several of them had backed Newman as they looked to solidify their progressive bona fides last year.

The party has long pushed to lift the $7.25 an hour federal minimum wage, which has eroded in value since Congress last voted to raise it in 2007. Today's soft labor market makes this a less than ideal moment to hike it. But unified control of government gives Democrats their best chance in years.

You can't rewrite the law, but there are a lot of gray areas where you can change the emphasis, said Tom Miller, resident fellow at the American Enterprise Institute. Where Obama stretched the law to be tighter and more all-encompassing, Trump will make it more flexible and less rigorous.

Trump has worked to undermine the Affordable Care Act from his first day in office, when he issued an executive order directing agencies to interpret its regulations as loosely as possible. He championed congressional Republicans' bills in 2017 that would have weakened the law's protections.
I am running because I see that sense of community is getting fractured, Klobuchar said on Sunday in Iowa. It's getting fractured by someone in the White House who gets up every morning and tweets whatever he wants but doesn't respect the amendment that allows him to do it.
So, this all has to be resolved. I think it's very fair analysis, but the difference between the Tea Party and Occupy or a group on the left, those groups don't have leverage within the Democratic Party right now. The Tea Party does. And that's the fundamental problem for the party.
Facts First: By several measures, US air was cleaner under Obama than it has been : By several measures, US air was cleaner under Obama than it has been under Trump . Three of the six types of pollutants identified by the Clean Air Act as toxic to human health were more prevalent in the air as of 2018 than they were before Trump took office, according to Environmental Protection Agency data.

In a rare bout of truthfulness by President Trump, he acknowledged what a superb rollout she's had. And I think we can already compare her favorably with some of the other candidates this early. But I'm not ready to make a decision.
At his departure, Short was praised for his work on Capitol Hill by congressional leaders, including by House Speaker Paul Ryan.
Speaking about immigration, Trump said that it has now been nine or 10 months where the numbers are way down.
At two rallies, Trump referred to CNN as fake news, then claimed that CNN turned off its camera at the rally immediately upon him doing so.
In Sanders' proposal, everyone who is a US resident, including undocumented immigrants, gets coverage. That would be a likely point of contention with this plan. There is a prohibition on traveling to the US for free medical care.
Supporting the Affordable Care Act, including its popular provisions that protect those with less-than-perfect health histories, helped Democrats retake the House in the midterm elections in November. Since then, the party's leaders have repeatedly said they will swiftly work to uphold the law.
Klobuchar's electability in Minnesota, which has largely come by taking more politically moderate positions, has some Democrats questioning whether the senator will be able to capture the imagination of a party that has drifted to the left nationally.

Our new U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement – or USMCA – will replace NAFTA and deliver for American workers: bringing back our manufacturing jobs, expanding American agriculture, protecting intellectual property, and ensuring that more cars are proudly stamped with four beautiful words: made in the USA.
Facts First: There has never been a $500 billion trade deficit with China. (Trump describes trade deficits as losing, though many economists dispute that characterization.) The 2018 deficit was : There has never been a $500 billion trade deficit with China. (Trump describes trade deficits as losing, though many economists dispute that characterization.)

What then, of the Presidential election? The simple fact is that only one of the candidates will sign our proposals. Indeed, Donald Trump has committed to signing the REINS Act, which requires congressional approval before major rules and regulations become effective. Significantly, the REINS Act represents the most far-reaching restoration of congressional constitutional authority in history.
When Trump initially attacked McCain as something less than a war hero in 2015, it was covered as the end of a campaign that never really got started. Trump has been in the race for all of a month. He was still an asterisk in most polling. And everyone who knew anything assumed that attacking McCain's five years spent as a prisoner of war in Vietnam – a time that left the Arizona Republican with lifelong wounds – was a death sentence of Trump's political ambitions.
COLVIN: I think I've seen no evidence of that. I don't know about you, but at this point, not.

Most of the questions on Monday will come from New Hampshire voters, an electorate which prizes its position as the first-in-the-nation primary and is often known for asking discerning and pointed questions.
Spending by consumers has sustained Trump-era growth. And economists see their confidence as fragile.
This is New Hampshire, anything could happen, she said when asked about the town hall at an event earlier in the day.
The last time that Europe saw a deal of its size was Rosneft's 2006 listing in London and Moscow, and Glencore's (GLCNF) 2011 debut in London and Hong Kong.
The two have had a tortured relationship and McCain, who was diagnosed with glioblastoma, an aggressive form of brain cancer, in July 2017, has been one of the administration's most outspoken Republican critics.
So the insurers are telling us, if we don't know what's going on come late spring, we're going to have massive premium increases and pull- outs and it will collapse the individual market. What they also tell us, though, is if you only appeal the law, just gut and repeal the law, as some folks are suggesting, then you'll have triple-digit premium increases and you'll collapse the individual market.
It's also important to remember that some lifestyle decisions have both social and financial dimensions. For example, choosing to work part-time can not only be a good way to earn a few extra bucks and reduce withdrawals from your nest egg, but an effective strategy for remaining socially engaged.
Viral is the most common. But George is absolutely right, I mean, neck pain is one of the symptoms. People can often develop significant what's called photophobia, so just not wanting to be out in the light at all, headache as well, sometimes fever. What George is describing is where they are actually now taking some of the fluid and examining it to see if they can see evidence of fungus actually within the fluid.

Facts First: There is no regulation from President Barack Obama that impeded coronavirus testing. The Obama administration did put forward a draft proposal related to lab testing, but it was never implemented. When asked what Obama administration decision Trump might be referring to, Peter Kyriacopolous, chief policy officer at the Association of Public Health Laboratories, said: We aren't sure what rule is being referenced. Dr. Joshua Sharfstein, who was principal deputy commissioner of the FDA under Obama and is now professor of the practice at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, said, There wasn't a policy that was put into place that inhibited them. There was no Obama policy they were reversing.
The Trump administration has once again pointed to health insurers' robust stock market performance as proof that they are profiting from Obamacare.

The legislation would also end the enhanced match rate for Medicaid expansion for new enrollees starting in 2020. Those already in the program could stay as long as they remain continuously insured. States that have not already expanded would not be allowed to do so, starting immediately.
This is one of the times to take a step back. Let's take a minute, collect ourselves, and step away from the noise. We talk a lot in these jobs about turning points. There is no doubt that we are at one of those turning points right now. And this one will determine the kind of country we'll have this century. But too often, we have seen before how doubt creeps in, how the tyranny of short term thinking takes over and history fails to turn. There is, after all, a reason this has not been done in 31 years. This really is a generational- defining moment. And let's let this generational defining moment be defined by optimism, not fear. Not the doom and gloom we have become so familiar with.
What I am worried about is … that if we don't do this then he will just go work with Democrats to try and change Obamacare – that's hardly a conservative thing, Ryan told CBS's This Morning Thursday.
Here tonight, we have legislators from across this magnificent republic. You have come from the rocky shores of Maine and the volcanic peaks of Hawaii; from the snowy woods of Wisconsin and the red deserts of Arizona; from the green farms of Kentucky and the golden beaches of California. Together, we represent the most extraordinary Nation in all of history.
To build on our incredible economic success, one priority is paramount – reversing decades of calamitous trade policies.

While the Senate bill's passage could help fulfill Trump's promise to repeal and replace Obamacare and cut taxes, it would also break a host of promises he made to Americans on health care.
He has already begun to personally speak with prospective candidates, officials say.
TRUMP: And (INAUDIBLE) like this -- I just told you -- Wolf, excuse me.
Klobuchar is markedly more centrist than many of the other Democrats running for President, including some of her colleagues in the Senate. Klobuchar has a liberal voting record, but she does not support abolishing the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency or Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders' Medicare-for-all bill – instead pushing to lower the age when people are allowed to buy into the government health care program.
One problem, though, is that the costs to consumers are rising dramatically. The insurance companies have been seeking severe increases in their rates, and the mergers of some insurers and the announcements that others were seeking to merge, even before Aetna's announcement on Monday, are limiting the number of policy options, which further raises rates. All of this might be happening today even if Obamacare didn't exist. But the law's financial construct clearly served as an accelerant for insurers attempting to mitigate losses.
Conway: Repeal and replace may not be together
[11:24:54] MARQUARDT: And Kelsey -- with Mulvaney coming in as acting, that is kind of plugging one hole in the boat but at the same time, you've got John Kelly widely respected, leaving. You now have Ryan Zinke leaving under this cloud of ethics investigations. That, of course, follows Scott Pruitt and Tom Price.
He said he probably never will like McCain, because John McCain received a fake and phony dossier.
The Vermont senator faced familiar lines of attack -- that his democratic socialism makes him unelectable and that his Medicare for All plan is unpractical -- but Bloomberg's presence altered the dynamics of the debate enough that Sanders was able to stick to his message and avoid being dragged into deeper waters by his rivals.
This is a great start to open enrollment and is further evidence that people want health insurance and that they're finding coverage they can afford, said Lori Lodes, a former Obama official and co-founder of Get America Covered, which is aiming to boost sign ups.

So he acted unilaterally and did everything he could to strangle the law he couldn't kill, like zeroing out the penalty for not having insurance and also ending government cost-sharing reduction payments to insurance companies. It was a move designed to make premium prices go up. To inflict pain and force Democrats to the negotiating table. We know this is true because he said at the time it'd be Democrats fault when his action had its intended effect.

Today, I think a word like that is the beginning of a debate, not the end of the debate.
Trump has touted chloroquine, a medication used to treat malaria and other illnesses, as likely effective against the coronavirus -- claiming that there is very strong evidence. Fauci has noted that the evidence is anecdotal. Trump has claimed we already know that if things don't go as planned with the use of chloroquine, it's not going to kill anybody. Fauci has said , There are no proven safe and effective therapies for the coronavirus.
The days before the debate featured supporters of Bernie Sanders attacking Elizabeth Warren, with Warren countering that Sanders made a sexist statement in a private meeting over a year ago. But when the red light came on in Des Moines, they were both on their best behavior.
Working for Obama -- Both of them went to work for Obama, Biden as vice president and Clinton as secretary of state. Biden was Obama's sidekick. He cornered Obama into backing same-sex marriage. He said Obamacare was a big effing deal. Clinton was the focus of conspiracy theories throughout her time in the Obama administration, perhaps because she had been drawing the enmity of Republicans for decades and perhaps because she was seen, from the outset, as Obama's natural heir even if Biden was his vice president.
Now, as for Flynn, he was a fixture with Trump on the 2016 campaign trail, even leading a lock her up Hillary Clinton chant at the Republican National Convention. His stint as a national security adviser in the White House, though, that was brief. He was fired more than two weeks after then Acting Attorney General Sally Yates told the White House that Flynn lied about his communications with the Russian ambassador and could be blackmailed by the Russians.

We are joined this evening by Carl and Marsha Mueller. After graduating from college, their beautiful daughter Kayla became a humanitarian aid worker. Kayla once wrote, Some people find God in church. Some people find God in nature. Some people find God in love; I find God in suffering. I've known for some time what my life's work is, using my hands as tools to relieve suffering. In 2013, while caring for suffering civilians in Syria, Kayla was kidnapped, tortured, and enslaved by ISIS, and kept as a prisoner of Al-Baghdadi himself. After more than 500 horrifying days of captivity, Al-Baghdadi murdered young Kayla. She was just 26 years old.

La necesidad de humillar a los demás provoca que Trump insista en que acepten su versión de la realidad aunque se contraponga a lo que ven con sus propios ojos y entienden con su propia mente. Sus abogados y asesores tal vez le insisten en que evite arriesgarse hablando demasiado, pero esto le impediría establecer su estilo de dominio.

One main reason: Nearly half of consumers say that their cost of health care will be worse under the House GOP's American Health Care Act, according to the poll.
we're going through four different committees. That's how legislation works in the regulator order. We just did the Ways and Means Committee last night. We're in the middle of the Commerce Committee. Next week, it goes to the Budget Committee. And then it goes to the Rules Committee before it goes to the House floor. The bill will be out there for three weeks to be looked at. Go to readthebill.GOP. It's a 123-page bill. It's not 2,000 pages of something that they just whipped together and flipped to the floor like they did. They didn't -- we didn't write it in Harry Reid's office on Christmas Eve. This was written by our committees.

These plans would likely have lower premiums, but they would also provide fewer benefits – which could leave sicker and older workers out in the cold. Also, the offerings could be less attractive to young women if they don't cover maternity benefits.
Their dueling votes showcase a diversity of thought, the statement said.
The Trump administration had offered the Freedom Caucus a repeal of Obamacare's essential health benefits, regulatory changes that would mean insurers no longer would have to include benefits such as maternity care or mental health coverage in their plans. But the caucus rejected the olive branch, arguing that it alone would not be enough to drive down premiums.

Whenever the decision comes, it's hard to remember another time that a parliamentarian's decision was being watched so closely. Of course whatever MacDonough decides could impact the political dynamics of Biden's package going forward.

Without it, they could be facing a barrage of criticism from their progressive base that won them back the White House to begin with.

They also use more medical services -- including emergency rooms, in-patient hospital care, doctors and prescriptions than patients in employer-sponsored plans. Their cost of care was 22% higher than those in work-based health plans in 2015, or $559 a month, on average, for Obamacare enrollees versus $457 for those in employer plans.
Let's talk about what we just saw. First and foremost, as I said, that's classic Paul Ryan. The fact that they're doing this on Capitol Hill, he's the guy explaining the policy, he's the guy selling in that way, not Donald Trump, what does that tell you?

Once you have a figure you're reasonably confident about, you can plug that number, as well as such information as your age, your retirement account balances, the amount you'll receive from Social Security, pension income, if any, and how long you expect to live in retirement (I'd say into your mid-90s is a decent estimate given today's longer lifespans) into a tool like T.

It's unlikely that Joe Biden, who most needed to win over voters to re-cement his first place standing in Iowa, accomplished that goal. It's not that he made any major gaffes but he lacked any major breakout moments. He seemed vulnerable when asked about his family's role in a Ukrainian business deal involving his son -- which President Donald Trump allegedly tried to get Ukraine's president to investigate in exchange for the release of funds to Ukraine. Biden also couldn't effectively defend his vote for the Iraq War, other than to argue that President Barack Obama picked him as his running mate anyway.

Suddenly the train screeched to a halt. A soldier appeared. Judah's family braced for the worst. Then, his father cried out with joy: It's the Americans.
SCARAMUCCI: I didn't say I don't agree. I was going to say that everybody's got a personality differences and everybody has different style affects for their personality. One of the things that I like about the president that some people in Washington perhaps don't like about the president is the upfront-ness. If he's unhappy with my job and he tweets out about me that he's unhappy with my job and 113 million people hear that, I'm a pretty secure guy. I'm OK with that. I would go and talk to him and say, OK, can I improve this, can I make it better for you?
Facts First: It's not true that Obama and Bush never asked NATO members to increase their military spending. Obama and Bush both did so, though their public language was less confrontational than Trump's has been.
I want to build on the momentum that we saw here in 2018, Klobuchar told reporters Saturday in Wisconsin. No one ever thought that the Democrats were going to be able (to defeat) Gov. Walker, but we did it, and we did it in a smart, Wisconsin way with a grassroots campaign with (Democratic Sen.) Tammy Baldwin at the top of the ticket, and we can do it in the presidential, as well.
Patrick campaigned as a moderate, calling for a public option to be added to Obamacare rather than supporting Medicare for All, a government-run single-payer health program.
When Trump initially attacked McCain as something less than a war hero in 2015, it was covered as the end of a campaign that never really got started. Trump has been in the race for all of a month. He was still an asterisk in most polling. And everyone who knew anything assumed that attacking McCain's five years spent as a prisoner of war in Vietnam – a time that left the Arizona Republican with lifelong wounds – was a death sentence of Trump's political ambitions.
TRUMP: They devalue their currency to such an extent that our businesses cannot compete with them. Our workers lose their jobs. You don't know anything about it, because you're...
While the White House is being accused of trying to knock the House investigation, led by under fire intelligence committee Chairman Devin Nunes, off-track, it faces a greater challenge with a parallel Senate probe.
As we continue to battle Covid-19, it's even more critical that Americans have meaningful access to health care, Biden said.
Together, we can break decades of political stalemate. We can bridge old divisions, heal old wounds, build new coalitions, forge new solutions, and unlock the extraordinary promise of America's future. The decision is ours to make.
Debating skills are not always among the criteria that parties have applied in choosing a nominee. But given the aggressive, brutal style of the man who will be waiting in the ring, the Dems ought to be thinking hard about them now.
Well my friends, there's nothing terrifying about the original meaning of our Constitution and there is nothing deplorable about defending it, Walker said.
(CNN) President Joe Biden has promised to make health care more affordable and available. His executive order Thursday takes one immediate step in that direction.
Facts First: Trump was mixing up two separate issues. While the Trump administration does have new agreements with all three of Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador, those agreements are related to the handling of people who come to the US seeking asylum, not criminals the US is seeking to deport. In 2016, just prior to Trump's presidency, none of the three countries was on the list of countries that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) considered recalcitrant (uncooperative) in accepting the return of their citizens from the US.
CNN documented the case of Maria Villatoro, a Guatemalan mother who said she fled deadly violence in Guatemala only to land in detention in Texas and has four children in detention, ranging in age from 2-20 and spread between California and New York. Read this story.
Former Republican candidate Mitt Romney, who has decried what Donald Trump would do to the legacy of his party, campaigned for Cruz in Utah and said that he will vote for him. Jeb Bush, the scion of the so-called establishment, formally announced that he was endorsing Cruz.
Any senator in the Rust Belt, which Trump won, narrowly, in 2016, has to be cognizant of the political battles in their states.
As the hearing unfolded, both McConnell and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer addressed it in statements on the Senate floor, with the majority leader calling Walker an impressive individual and urging the committee to approve his nomination.
The Trump administration's decision in March to back a lawsuit that would strike down Obamacare triggered a unified round of backlash from Democrats, but it also highlighted the party's internal divisions, with moderates preferring to shore up the landmark health reform law and reverse many of the steps Trump and congressional Republicans have taken to undermine it.
The individual mandate cannot be severed from the remainder of the Affordable Care Act, Trump's DOJ said in court briefs.
The numbers that are estimated are, if anything, underestimating the growth, Cruz said Friday.
And beyond that, it's ongoing litigation that doesn't involve anybody in the building, and so I'd refer you to the parties that it does.
Trump, who said he does not take any responsibility at all for the slow pace of coronavirus testing, has used the briefings to cast fault on multiple people and entities.
I watched Ted – and I respected it, but he gets nowhere – stand on the Senate floor for a day or two days, and talk and talk and talk, Trump said. I watched the other senators laughing and smiling. And when Ted was totally exhausted, he left the Senate floor, and they went back to work. We have to have somebody that's going to make deals.
GOP Rep. Tom Cole said Friday that he did not expect any real push by House Republicans to restart any Obamacare repeal efforts, particularly because the House has such a full calendar in September.
And the response from the campaign was, we would love to have the help.

Opponents of the law say that the exemption is unconstitutional, and because of that, the rest of the law should fall.
The expectation is that changes to the House bill will happen in the Senate, but not in a formal committee markup like last week in the House. Instead, the current plan for Democrats is to take their bill -- with some potential changes that have been ironed out privately -- directly to the Senate floor.
On July 18, 2015, then-candidate Donald Trump said this about John McCain: He's not a war hero. He was a war hero because he was captured. I like people who weren't captured.

Trump has continued to rail against Iran, decrying the nuclear deal brokered under the previous administration as one of the worst deals just as he did during the campaign and arguing most recently that Iran was not living up to the spirit of the agreement.
The numbers for Biden alone are staggering. By the time Bloomberg endorsed the former vice president on Wednesday, Biden had spent just 2% of the more than half a billion dollars Bloomberg spent on ads.

We can't be sure why Republicans are now significantly less willing to get the vaccine, but remember Democrats have pretty much always said they were more concerned about Covid-19 than Republicans. It wasn't until mid-November, just after Trump's defeat in the presidential election, that the partisan gap began to really emerge in the Axios/Ipsos polling on vaccines. The bottom line is that there's still a lot of work to be done on vaccine hesitancy. Lives literally depend on it.
Biden was correct that Bloomberg argued against the appointment of a monitor. Because the Bloomberg administration in New York City appealed the ruling and won a freeze in October 2013, Zimroth's work was put on hold until November 2014 , under Bloomberg's successor Bill de Blasio, who dropped the Bloomberg-era appeal.

Bloomberg's first debate appearance comes amid a barrage of damaging headlines, largely focused on his previous comments about and support for policies widely seen as discriminatory -- including stop-and-frisk policing and redlining . He will also likely face questions over allegations that he made crude remarks and fostered a culture of discrimination against women at Bloomberg L.P. during the late 1980s and 1990s.

KING: And it matters, a, if you care about the health care debate, whatever side you're on. Number two, it matters because we're two weeks away from the six month mark of the Trump presidency and this health care debate has sort of held Congress hostage to getting around to some of the other parts of the agenda. We'll keep an eye on that as members of the Senate lead the parades or leave hiding, come back to Washington.

Vermont Sen.

In our state, we've reduced emissions by 30 percent. But let me tell you also what we're trying to do. We want all the sources of energy. We want to dig coal, but we want to clean it when we burn it. We believe in natural gas. We believe in nuclear power.
Unemployment rates are expected to rise substantially in March as a result of the coronavirus crisis
The switch could also allow association plans to deny coverage or set rates based on the medical history of those in the group, so plans with younger, healthier members could offer lower premiums.

Facts First: Trump didn't specify when precisely he was alleging Hunter Biden was unemployed and without income, but it's not true that Hunter Biden did not have a job or income either in the years before Joe Biden ran for vice president or before Hunter Biden was appointed to the board of directors of Ukrainian natural gas company Burisma Holdings.
Asked whether the well-connected, such as NBA players, should be able to jump to the front of the line for coronavirus tests, Trump said no, but perhaps that's been the story of life.
Push provision for bigger tax credits for older Americans to Senate. The House is setting aside roughly $85 billion in funding to provide additional tax credits to help older people buy policies on the individual market. But representatives are letting the Senate handle the crafting of the legislation. Many older consumers would face huge premium hikes under the GOP bill because its tax credits are not as generous as Obamacare's subsidies for lower-income enrollees in their 50s and early 60s.

Now that the field of presidential candidates is shrinking, the dynamics of the race are coming into clearer focus. And one thing was clear from debate in Des Moines: diversity matters. With Cory Booker, Julian Castro and Kamala Harris out of the race -- and Andrew Yang off the debate stage -- there was little to no substantive discussion on issues like immigration, voting rights, the Trump administration's neglect of Puerto Rico and criminal justice reform. Instead, we had perfunctory mentions of black and brown people throughout the evening.
Last weekend, Trump attacked McCain in several tweets that targeted his ties to the controversial Russia dossier and his vote against repealing Obamacare. He also referred to McCain as being last in his class at the US Naval Academy.

The idea unexpectedly resurfaced earlier this week after Republicans' effort to repeal and replace Obamacare ran aground in the Senate on Monday night. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said he would call a vote on a repeal bill modeled on 2015 legislation that was passed by both chambers before being vetoed by then-President Obama.
And now, so closely removed to those two massive developments, which everyone – me included – expected to fundamentally alter Trump's presidency and the course of the 2020 race, it appears as though most people have, well, moved on.
CONWAY: Well, here's my answer. What President Obama did in that debate was thank Mitt Romney for essentially providing inspirational blue print and the political cover in his own advisers to the White House to help construct Obamacare, the Affordable Care Act --
Officials said the move is a response to fears that terrorist groups may target commercial aircraft by smuggling explosive devices in electronic devices.
Republican aides and members opposed to this effort are watching this play out and hoping that voters will have moved on from Trump in the next several years. The hope is that this vote does not become a litmus test for whether outside groups wage primary challenges against those who were not loyal to the President in his last days in office. Only time will tell how consequential this vote will really be. Still, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has warned members that for him, it is one of the most important of his career.
Es un hecho bien documentado que Trump ocupó innumerables puestos gubernamentales con personas completamente descalificadas para sus trabajos. No es sorprendente, entonces, que la implementación de los programas de emergencia esté resultando menos que impresionante. Millones de estadounidenses ya han perdido sus empleos apenas unas semanas después de la pandemia, por lo que el Congreso aprobó rápidamente billones de dólares en programas de ayuda.
If Medicaid expansion remains, the real fight could be over funding. President Trump's senior adviser Kellyanne Conway has said part of the new administration's plans for repealing and replacing Obamacare would include converting federal funds for Medicaid into block grants.
I want to start with this Washington Post report. Business groups stand by Boehner, plot against Tea Party.

The bill would also shrink federal support of Medicaid by sending states a set amount of funds per enrollee or a lump sum -- again, leaving it up to governors and legislators to decide how to use the money. A per enrollee cap would cut federal spending by $53 billion between 2020 and 2026, compared to current law, Kaiser found.

Between February 2017, Trump's first full month in office, and December 2019, the economy added 6.7 million jobs, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Jobs added in January 2020 and the early days of this month likely took the total under Trump even closer to 7 million. The jobs report for January is due on Friday. But pre-election, Trump said he would create 25 million jobs. Regarding the projection it was not immediately clear what Trump was referring to.

One person walked into a room when he was supposed to go this way, and he said he was going this way, and he walked in and he went this way, and everyone said, 'What happened, what was that all about?' Boy oh boy, who was that, I don't know. I don't know. I don't want to be controversial, so I won't use his name, OK? Trump said during a wide-ranging remarks Friday, prompting boos from a fired-up crowd.
My father was his kryptonite in life, he was his kryptonite in death. On a personal level, I agree with you, all of us have love and families, and when my father was alive, up until adulthood, we would spend our time together cooking, hiking, fishing, really celebrating life, and I think it's because he almost died, she said. And I just thought, 'your life is spent on the weekend not with your family, not with your friends, but you're obsessing, obsessing over great men you could never live up to.' That tells you everything you need to know about his pathetic life right now.
The two celebrated with a fist bump.
The proposed regulation unveiled by the Department of Labor earlier this month would open up association health plans so that small firms in the same industry could join regardless of their location. Also, small employers in different industries could establish an association as long as they are in the same state or metro area. The plans would also be exempt from certain Obamacare provisions, allowing them to sell cheaper policies with fewer benefits.
The Senate GOP plan would certainly break Trump's promise to lay off Medicaid. It makes make deep cuts to the program, ending its expansion under Obamacare and capping future payments.

But the Affordable Care Act, which is approaching its 10-year anniversary later this month, has done far more than reduce the uninsured rate.

And now that they have lost the majority, Republicans have virtually no chance of passing any legislation that would repeal and replace President Barack Obama's signature health care law.
In addition, it's not true that the decline was this year or in last year's numbers that just came in. Consumer Price Index data for the period between December 2018 and December 2019 shows an increase of about 3% , not another decrease.

Pamela Brown to Biden: Why not carve out time to answer tough questions?
BARRO: There been lots of shutdowns and most of them have been quite different from this one. For example, we had shutdowns over and over again in the Reagan Administration but they were almost off three days, two days, one day. And when you do that it doesn't matter that much. Like for example, right now, federal workers who are going without pay, they're actually not due to receive a paycheck until October 11th.
Quote: We will allow House managers to make their case, the President's lawyers to make their defense, and senators to pose questions. At the conclusion of these presentations, the Senate can then decide what, if any, further steps are necessary.
While Clinton's closest associates are inclined to reject speculation of the former candidate's interest in pursuing public office again, rumors have continued to swirl nonetheless. Local media have floated her name as a possible New York City mayoral candidate.

Medicare Advantage (MA) plans offer a second example of markets at work to lower costs and drive innovation. These plans offer seniors a holistic solution to their care, combining medical and drug coverage into an integrated private health care plan. And they often include benefits that traditional Medicare does not, such as wellness programs, as well as routine vision and dental care. As a result, an increasing number of seniors are choosing MA over traditional Medicare and have a variety of choices of competing private plans within MA to choose from.
SEN. KIRSTEN GILLIBRAND (D), NEW YORK: The second allegation has been corroborated. That added to the first allegation, which I personally found credible, leads me to call for his resignation.

Some of his attacks on Clinton landed forcefully, such as on her emails and speeches. Clinton could have defended herself more forcefully and attacked more frequently. But the overwhelming tone of the debate was one of Trump making harsh personal attacks against his rival, pleasing Hillary-haters and turning off voters trying to make up their minds.
But Democrats have been divided about how far to push reforms. The party's left flank, led by Sen. Bernie Sanders, is pushing for Medicare for All, a program that would guarantee coverage to every American -- a promise, as Sanders' campaign has reminded voters over the last few weeks, that could have helped slow the initial spread of the coronavirus.

Theirs are politically unenviable positions, to be sure. But if the logic guiding their votes doesn't factor in a legacy that stretches beyond the coming elections, they could end up confirming not only a justice, but also a more damaging suspicion about the Democratic Party.

He came across as a rude, overbearing and nasty man. She has tremendous hate in her heart, he said, looming over Hillary Clinton and pacing while she spoke. When he spoke, she sat listening, almost never interrupting him, even when he lied; a painful sacrifice Clinton has decided she must make in order not to be seen as pushy, or unlikable, or some other unfeminine trait.

BASH: So you -- you just talked about your corporate tax plan.
It's unclear from Pence's comments whether Trump plans to take executive action or, more authoritatively, issue executive orders. The vice president-elect used both terms at a GOP press conference last Wednesday, noting that the White House staff is currently working on a series of executive orders that will enable that orderly transition to take place even as the Congress appropriately debates alternatives.
Facts First: Trump was exaggerating. Ben Rose, director of marketing and public relations for the Greater Wildwoods Tourism Improvement and Development Authority, told CNN that the authority estimates there were between 3,000 and 3,500 people in the parking lot outside Trump's rally venue and between 2,000 and 2,500 people at a park across the street. Trump was given an inflated number during the rally by Rep. Jeff Van Drew, but nonetheless, it was wrong.

Facts First: Klobuchar is right about herself. She did rank among the most effective members of the Senate and first among Democrats, according to that study. She's also right that Warren ranked among the bottom half of Democrats. Her characterization of Sanders' ineffectiveness within the Democratic Party, though, requires clarification.
As he hands the reins over to Shahira Knight, who has been serving as the deputy director of the National Economic Council at the White House, Short has confidence that transition should be rather seamless for her and the team.

Rep. Jayapal on Sen. Johnson: Stunning that a senator would say these things
Even as Trump tweets out conflicting views on what an acceptable deal might look like – this, after previously saying he'd sign whatever came to his desk – a small group of senators remain hard at work trying to hammer out some kind of agreement to break the deadlock.
TRUMP: If I become president of the United States, one of the things that will be an absolute priority is number one, protection of Israel, but also seeing if a deal can be made, the toughest deal, the toughest negotiation there probably is of any kind no matter where you look, no matter how hard you look.

The data provides the first look at how Obamacare will fare under an administration determined to dismantle the health reform law.

This Southern hostility to workers isn't a coincidence. It's tradition.

Either option would limit federal responsibility, shifting that burden to the states. However, since states don't have the money to make up the difference, they would likely either reduce eligibility, curtail benefits or cut provider payments. The block grant would be more restrictive since the funding level would not adjust for increases in enrollment, which often happens in bad economic times.

In front of factory workers at the Ohio plant on Wednesday, Trump dedicated a considerable amount of time in his speech to disparaging McCain.

Yes, I think so. I think it's going to be over fairly quickly, and I don't think there's going to be a convention.
Investors will be keeping a particularly close eye on oil giant ExxonMobil -- whose former CEO Rex Tillerson has been nominated as Trump's secretary of state.
Except that in this instance the dude in question is the President of the United States – which is all the more revealing, and concerning.
Immigration is something that brings youth and vibrance and energy to our country. But we clearly have to control our borders. We can't have people just walking in. Look, we lock our doors at night in our homes. The country has to be able to lock its doors as well. So, we - I have a comprehensive plan to deal with this problem of immigration.
The nomination of Neera Tanden , Biden's pick to lead the Office of Management and Budget, is in deep peril after Manchin jumped ship and a string of Republicans signaled they couldn't support her.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I don't think I've ever seen quite such a mobilization of volunteers as I've seen here.
COOPER: So what does -- I mean, did Candy, David talk about compromise. What does a compromise look like exactly?
To maintain an acceptable lifestyle throughout a retirement that could last upwards of 40 years, you're going to need a sizable savings stash to support you. For example, let's say that in addition to the income you'll eventually receive from Social Security and any other sources, you'll need an inflation-adjusted $50,000 a year from savings in order to maintain your standard of living in retirement.
The decision to make their teleconference arguments public brings some immediate transparency to an insular institution that has long prided itself on resisting technology and live broadcasts of any kind.
LEMON: She's on that list as well. Bill Clinton is on the list, was he? No. He's not on there? Yes, he is. He's on the list as well. Bush is on the list.
Why he's important: Portman is a fan of bipartisanship and he's projected that he has an open mind. But he rarely votes with Democrats.
Related: What's inside the Republican health care bill?
MICHELLE KOSINSKI, CNN SENIOR DIPLOMATIC CORRESPONDENT: Yes. A very strong statement, the strongest one yet from the State Department. But you could also see this as a way of saying something very strong in the nicest way possible. I mean, calling it ethnic cleansing doesn't carry any implications under either international or domestic law.
THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.
(Trump also told Fox News earlier in March that we'll be cutting entitlement programs, though he did not say which ones. His press secretary claimed he was talking about cutting deficits, NOT entitlements when he said we'll be cutting, though he had been asked, But if you don't cut something in entitlements, you'll never really deal with the debt.)
Will she flip? Not on this.
MIAMI GARDENS, FLORIDA - MAY 06: Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis speaks during a press conference at the Hard Rock Stadium testing site on May 06, 2020 in Miami Gardens, Florida. Gov. DeSantis announced during the press conference that a COVID-19 antibodies test will be available. The test can show if a person has had the virus in the past without showing symptoms, and therefore may be immune to it. The test will be available to first responders and health care workers first, with the goal of being able to expand testing to the general public. (Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)
Rep. Jayapal on Sen. Johnson: Stunning that a senator would say these things
immigration, auto emissions, Bolstering the Affordable Care Act has been a priority of several blue states, as well as moderate presidential candidates, after the Trump administration and Republicans in Congress moved to weaken it. Defending the landmark health reform law has also allowed Democratic governors, particularly California's Gavin Newsom, to draw contrasts between themselves and President Donald Trump. The two have tangled in recent years over abortion homelessness and presidential tax returns
On Tuesday, he continued his criticism, telling reporters at the White House that I was never a fan of John McCain and I never will be.
Joining Melania in the gallery this evening is a very brave 10-year-old girl, Grace Eline. Every birthday since she was 4, Grace asked her friends to donate to St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. She did not know that one day she might be a patient herself. Last year, Grace was diagnosed with brain cancer. Immediately, she began radiation treatment. At the same time, she rallied her community and raised more than $40,000 for the fight against cancer. When Grace completed treatment last fall, her doctors and nurses cheered with tears in their eyes as she hung up a poster that read: Last Day of Chemo. Grace – you are an inspiration to us all.
Trump, center, wears a baseball uniform at the New York Military Academy in 1964. After he graduated from the boarding school, he went to college. He started at Fordham University before transferring and later graduating from the Wharton School, the University of Pennsylvania's business school.
But there are ways to combat it, he added. The press can keep health care in the news by covering the debate in the states, talking to people who are lobbying on the Hill, and pushing hard to cover substantial issues that are playing out away from Congress.
Trump claimed twice that, before his presidency, Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador and Mexico would not accept the return of criminals the US wanted to deport. He said on one of these occasions: You couldn't bring them back. They wouldn't take them. We could catch a murderer from Honduras, Guatemala, El Salvador. We bring them back and they say, 'Don't land your plane. Your bus can't come in. Your van can't come in. We don't want them. We don't want them back.'
The Dow Jones industrial average closed 0.1% down on Monday, while the S&P 500 added 0.2% and the Nasdaq advanced 0.7%.
HEWITT: Mr. Trump, I want to follow-up on the quote that Senator Cruz used. You said you would want to be, quote, sort of a neutral guy. He did mention Taylor Force. He was a West Point graduate, he was a war hero. He was a Vanderbilt graduate student.
Speaking at the House Democratic Caucus' annual retreat here, Pelosi sidestepped a question about the growing concerns of fellow Democrats over the impact Sanders could have on 2016 House and Senate races, saying, I'm very proud of all three of our candidates.

Facts First: Vindman did not run to Congress generally or to Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff specifically with his concerns about Trump's phone call. Vindman : Vindman did not run to Congress generally or to Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff specifically with his concerns about Trump's phone call. Vindman testified in the impeachment inquiry that he reported his concerns to National Security Council lawyer John Eisenberg, who had previously advised him to get in touch with such issues.
What seems increasingly evident, however, is that tax reform will not be completed this summer as originally promised and possibly not even this year. True tax reform is always harder than it seems. Plus, the process of repealing and replacing Obamacare is taking longer than expected and will push aside tax reform until lawmakers can come to some agreement.
Facts First: While Stone's legal team has also accused the foreperson of bias -- Judge Amy Berman Jackson held a hearing on Stone's request for a new trial and will issue a : While Stone's legal team has also accused the foreperson of bias -- Judge Amy Berman Jackson held a hearing on Stone's request for a new trial and will issue a decision -- it is not true that the foreperson jumped up and down screaming upon Stone's conviction or at any other point in the proceedings.
After the initial failure of an Obamacare repeal effort last March, a senior congressional source told CNN that staff was for details, Trump was for closing, adding that when it came to the intricacies of the bill, the President didn't know, didn't care or both.
Facts First: There is no mention of anyone saying the words go get him in this 2019 report. Nor do those words appear in Horowitz's 2018 : There is no mention of anyone saying the words go get him in this 2019 report. Nor do those words appear in Horowitz's 2018 report on actions taken by the FBI and Justice Department in advance of the 2016 election or Horowitz's 2019 report on aspects of the FBI's investigation into the Trump campaign and Russia.

At her event in Goffstown, Klobuchar pitching herself as a candidate who can win independent and lean Republican voters. She pledged to go everywhere, not just where it is comfortable, but where it is uncomfortable and outlined a platform that included overturning Citizens United, reinstating the Voting Rights Act, rejoining the Paris Climate Accord and getting on the path toward a public option for health care.
In front of factory workers at the Ohio plant on Wednesday, Trump dedicated a considerable amount of time in his speech to disparaging McCain.
Trump vs. the tape on Obama and the protester
The organizing resolution hasn't been passed yet.
[07:20:02] So we grabbed Donald Trump right after the debate. That's a really important time frame before they get polished up by their advisers about what he thought took place on that stage, how he fared, and what was the real deal on his taxes. Here's what he said.

Trump announced his run in June 2015; Stone either resigned or was fired -- there is a dispute about what happened -- in August 2015, more than a month and a half into the campaign.
TAPPER: House Speaker John Boehner, meanwhile, decided this was a good time to cut out of town. Olivier Knox of Yahoo! News, a frequent guest on THE LEAD, snapped a photo showing the speaker boarding a plane for Denver earlier today. And, as you can see, he decided to make this a casual Thursday, mom jeans of a sort.
Holding a President Trump accountable includes ensuring he keeps the commitments he has made to conservatives, especially regarding nominations to the Supreme Court. Who knows, as we conduct such oversight, it is possible our Democratic colleagues may finally understand that a large part of the past six years of GOP House control has not been about like or dislike of President Obama, but about his failed policies and the protection of institutional, constitutional prerogatives of the United States Congress.
COOPER: An honor to meet you.
There is a generous list of covered health, vision and dental benefits, and some long-term care benefits including:
COOPER: Do you know if when she had episodes in the past, what they centered around or what she would talk about in those cases?
The last time she saw her daughter, she was in that building that you see behind me that is now collapsed.
We need a real Democrat with a real plan, Newman said Friday. She paints herself as the true ally of congressional Democrats, thanking my friends in Congress for their work on a coronavirus stimulus package . Over the weekend, she knocked Lipinski -- who was back in the district early Saturday -- for not voting on the legislation.
The interesting thing is I've never worked with John Boehner, I don't know the man, Cruz said. Indeed, during the government shut down, I reached out to John Boehner, to work with him to get something meaningful done. He said, 'I have no interest in talking to you.' 
The song was written by Oscar Brown Jr. in 1963; Brown's daughters have complained about Trump's appropriation of their father's words, saying Brown, who died in 2005, would have opposed Trump's agenda and message.
On Monday, McCain said she genuinely feel(s) bad for (the Trump) family and that she can't imagine having a father who does this on the weekends.
That leaves Michigan, Nevada and Wisconsin still potentially on the table. Senators have been less inclined to go down the route of the latter three, even as their House colleagues have pressed them repeatedly to do just that.
The former aide also speculated about why only a few Republicans have criticized Trump's comments, saying that it's likely because they don't want to get in the Twitter crosshairs.
As you explain, White support for government programs that built up the White middle class actually fell as the civil rights movement blossomed because of a zero-sum approach to politics -- whatever helps Black people must hurt Whites. When President Reagan said in his first inaugural address that government was the problem, was he invoking the zero-sum perspective that you talk about?
The most egregious false claim: Smearing Democrats
A Klobuchar aide told CNN on Monday that the senator prepared for the town hall like she would for a major interview.
Sen. John Barrasso of Wyoming, the third senator Trump name-checked, spoke with Trump about health care on Wednesday morning, but his staff said they did not have anything to share at the moment when asked about the specific working group.
It is possible Trump was taking an actual poll result and adding 10 points to his approval rating because of what he called the Trump 'thing' -- what he claims is a phenomenon in which his supporters decline to tell pollsters that they support him. But even if there are some shy Trump supporters, this is just not how approval ratings work; you can't take the findings of a poll and give yourself a guessed number of additional approval points.
Trump claimed to have rebuilt a military that was depleted, saying: Now, it has all brand-new jets. -- February 10 campaign rally in Manchester, New Hampshire
I don't know what it says about other candidates, the aide said, but I think that it plays to his strengths as a candidate because he has a very clear message about health care and about the need to guarantee health care to every American as a right, not a privilege.
The President senses good angles when on camera, and he's obsessed with polls, the size of his crowds and the flattery dished out by foreign leaders.
CUOMO: But this is disruptive activity. This is a perversion of the normal process for political expedience.
La realidad ineludible es que algunos desafíos son tan desalentadores que solo el gobierno puede organizar una respuesta efectiva; algunos tan catastróficos, que solo el gobierno federal tiene la fuerza para hacerlo.
I think it's stupid. I'm being very declarative here. I think it's stupid, Scaramucci, whose short-lived tenure as White House communications director imploded due to his combative personality, said later. There's no strategy that you can tell – other than the fact that you're frustrated and you want to ventilate your frustrations into the international airwaves. OK. But I think it's stupid.
I also believe in the process of redemption. So, if somebody does something wrong on a job, and then go find another job and try to do that right. I wrote that in my book. So, people are fallible people, myself included. I have a whole phone book of fallibility about myself.
In fact, exit polling shows that white voters favored Biden to Sanders by a margin of 33% to 23% and that those with advanced degrees preferred Biden over Sanders 51% to 15%.
The memo appears to show that Flynn help the Justice Department with at least three ongoing investigations. References to two of the investigations are almost completely redacted.
The proportion of families that said they were having trouble paying their medical bills declined between September 2013, before the health law's insurance marketplaces opened in 2014, and March 2015, according to an analysis by the Urban Institute. The study found that the percentage of families that had problems paying medical bills declined from 22% in 2013 to 17.3% in 2015. Being uninsured, having a low income and enrolling in a high-deductible plan each increased the odds of having trouble paying medical bills, the study found.
The suit also says the Constitution was designed to concentrate power at the state level and prevent black people in cities from exercising control over their communities.
Protecting Americans' health also means fighting infectious diseases. We are coordinating with the Chinese government and working closely together on the Coronavirus outbreak in China. My Administration will take all necessary steps to safeguard our citizens from this threat.
Facts First: In fact, Army Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, the National Security Council's top Ukraine expert, testified in the House impeachment inquiry that two substantive changes he suggested to the rough transcript of Trump's call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky were not made. As we have noted : In fact, Army Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, the National Security Council's top Ukraine expert, testified in the House impeachment inquiry that two substantive changes he suggested to the rough transcript of Trump's call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky were not made. As we have noted before , the document Trump released explicitly says on its first page that it is not a verbatim transcript.

Still, the largely symbolic exercise in the Senate this week masks the fact that congressional Republicans still haven't made significant progress on drawing up an Obamacare replacement plan.
In Trump's fiscal year 2019 budget plan, released Monday, numbers typically highlighted upfront are shuffled or stuffed away into back sections. The changes from Friday's bargain in Congress were baked in as an afterthought to the core document, creating even steeper, more implausible cuts. Many of the underlying economic assumptions arrive at odds with past Congressional Budget Office reports and the analysis of nonpartisan outsiders.
Tim Kaine, the Virginia senator, has a resolution to essentially force the President to come back to Congress before going ahead with any further military action in Iran, Davis said. So it may be that they may vote to essentially rein in the President's war powers at the very same time they are weighing whether to remove him from office.
In prepared remarks in October, Trump himself said the deal sets standards on the $40 billion in digital trade between the United States and Japan. In other words, he suggested himself that it contained provisions addressing $40 billion in trade, not that it was a $40 billion payment.

He's hitting something that is socially unnatural. And so what is that? You're attacking somebody that died seven months ago, Scaramucci told CNN's John Berman on New Day. Now, I understand the point and I understand the grievance that the President's bringing up, but you're not scoring any points with anybody.
During his Oval Office address to the nation about the coronavirus on March 11, Trump, speaking from a script, announced that he was imposing restrictions on travel from Europe -- and then added that these prohibitions will not only apply to the tremendous amount of trade and cargo, but various other things as we get approval. Anything coming from Europe to the United States is what we are discussing.
Eleven states that run their own Obamacare exchanges, along with the District of Columbia, have launched temporary special enrollment periods so their uninsured residents can obtain coverage outside the usual time frame. And while those who lose their job-based coverage are able to sign up for Obamacare policies, the President's action would have eliminated some paperwork requirements for those already facing major life changes amid the pandemic.
PINSKY: Correct. And in my experience with postpartum psychosis, it's wild. They're wildly psychotic. The last woman I saw with that was throwing water on people because she believed they were on fire.
It has driven unemployment to its lowest rate in a half-century and boosted wages for average workers. The Dow Jones Industrial Average has risen 43% since his inauguration.
Our brave troops have now been fighting in the Middle East for almost 19 years. In Afghanistan and Iraq, nearly 7,000 American heroes have given their lives. More than 52,000 Americans have been badly wounded. We have spent more than $7 trillion in the Middle East.

In October, all eyes were on Gorsuch in a case that could impact millions of LGBTQ Americans. At issue was whether federal employment law that bars discrimination based on sex includes claims of sexual orientation and gender identity.
Biden is likely to walk away with the lion's share of 54 pledged delegates on offer on Saturday — which represent more than half of the 101 delegates previously doled out in the contest.
The American education system is a puzzle that generations of politicians have not been able to solve. States actually control public schools — or government schools, as Trump derisively calls them. It will be interesting to see how this issue of school choice — which used to mean vouchers for religious education or home schooling but today usually means charter schools — progresses in the Democratic primary. Someone like Mike Bloomberg might not be that far off from Trump on choice. Other candidates want to insure every kid is guaranteed a good education in every public school. There are no easy answers.
When Sen. John McCain's family announced Friday that he was ending medical treatment for aggressive brain cancer, the news shook Capitol Hill and prompted support from his Republican and Democratic colleagues alike. But one prominent voice was missing: President Donald Trump's.
And Trump was acquitted on charges of abusing power and obstructing Congress after a Senate trial on February 5.
BADE: And Senate Republicans, just to be clear, on that first option, the reason Senate Democrats think they actually have the upper hand on this is the Senate Republicans just voice voted that same bill to continue funding the government through February. So, they think they have the upper hand on that.

I know I can be too tough sometimes and I can push too hard, she told MSNBC earlier this month. That is obvious. But a lot of it is I have high expectations for myself and I have high expectations for people who work with me.
Monday wasn't the first time McCain offered a strong rebuke of the President's character.
Some Republican governors agree with their Democratic peers that block grants could reduce the effectiveness and reach of the safety net. And leaders of non-expansion states are concerned that funding might be frozen at current levels, which would leave them at a disadvantage since they did not broaden their programs.

On Tuesday, Trump falsely accused McCain of misleading the White House over how he would vote.
Pamela Brown to Biden: Why not carve out time to answer tough questions?
Klobuchar's primary pitch to voters is likely to be electability. The Democrat has been notably successful in Minnesota, winning her three terms in the Senate by an average of 26 percentage points. Klobuchar won re-election in 2018 with 60% of the vote, two years after Trump came within two points of defeating Hillary Clinton in the state.
Utah's Republican Party is the exception, so far.
While we don't yet have an analysis of the Senate's plan, it is clear that if signed into law, the bill would fall well short of Trump's broad promises to insure everyone. According to the CBO, under the House bill that passed in May – which is similar to the Senate bill – 23 million Americans who already have insurance would lose their coverage within a decade.
Let's discuss. We have CNN political analysts Maggie Haberman and David Sanger, both also correspondents from The New York Times.
Facts First: The US economy remains much bigger than China's economy in terms of total output, but China has continued to close the gap even though its own growth has slowed. In other words, it's not true the US is only now so far ahead because of growth during Trump's time in office. In fact, the US lead has continued to shrink under Trump.
And these are the types of medication that you really do want to have confirmed infection before you start using because it is a long course. Sometimes it involves being in the hospital for a few days. So I think there's really not a preventative sort of course here, but really just a real vigilance about any of these symptoms.
The Medicare for All plan would leave intact the current infrastructure of doctors, hospitals and other health care providers, but nationalize the health insurance industry. Nearly all the money individuals and employers currently pay into the system as well as much of the money states pay would, under Sanders' plan, instead go through the federal government.
– After being detained for nearly two weeks, three UCLA basketball players were released by China. President Trump asked for praise on Twitter.
The initial salvo on that ban came within days of Trump's inauguration and with little consultation with government agencies that would typically be consulted. The result was chaos at airports worldwide and the detention of Muslims at US airports who had valid visas and even green cards to travel to and stay in the US.
Going into Saturday, Sanders led the delegate count, with Buttigieg, Biden, Warren and Klobuchar following. Biden's win quickly shot him into second place after 14, just a portion, of South Carolina's delegates were projected.
Facts First: It's true that Hillary Clinton outspent Trump in the 2016 campaign, but not by three or four times. : It's true that Hillary Clinton outspent Trump in the 2016 campaign, but not by three or four times. According to the Center for Responsive Politics, a money-in-politics watchdog, Clinton's campaign spent $563.4 million and Trump's campaign $325.5 million, which means the Clinton total is less than double what Trump spent.
Trump's remark about the funeral came as the President has continued to denigrate the dead senator's legacy.
Huckabee's supporters, meanwhile, have adopted a sharper tone, with his super PAC, Pursuing America's Greatness, releasing an ad titled Two Teds. The attack attempts to paint Cruz as two-faced about his conservative values, using audio of Cruz at a New York City fundraiser saying that fighting gay marriage would not be a top priority of his administration.
KING: And that -- and that for years has tried to ignore sanctions and just not -- and not show any great impact from sanctions, perhaps because there's a backdoor, because there are black market around those sanctions. But if you think about, yes, he's asked the Pentagon, the president has, for a list of military options, you could conceivably launch a strike on a missile facility or on a nuclear facility in North Korea, but you don't know what the North Koreans would do to react to that. Just to remind you, North Korea has an estimated million-man army. The proximity to Seoul is like that. There are U.S. troops there, 230,000 Americans, including nearly 30,000 servicemen and women, 10 million people live in Seoul. And so when people say it's a small hermit regime, you know, the United States is a world's greatest superpower, there's something that can be done, that's not necessarily the case because of the risks involved. YANG: The risks are different. I mean on the United States' side, they
The Trump administration is not defending Obamacare, prompting a coalition of Democratic states to step in. California Attorney General Xavier Becerra, who is leading the coalition, plans to appeal O'Connor's ruling.
On Tuesday, he continued his criticism, telling reporters at the White House that I was never a fan of John McCain and I never will be.
Senator Thom Tillis has introduced legislation to allow Americans like Jody to sue Sanctuary Cities and States when a loved one is hurt or killed as a result of these deadly policies. I ask the Congress to pass the Justice for Victims of Sanctuary Cities Act immediately. The United States of America should be a sanctuary for law-abiding Americans – not criminal aliens!
Sanders has surged in the polls throughout January and is now viewed as the odds-on favorite to win the nomination by users on prediction market PredictIt. Sanders now has a 46% chance of winning the nomination, up from 18% in early December. The next closest Democrat is Joe Biden, with 27%, according to PredictIt.
CNN previously reported that the senator, who had been held as a prisoner of war in Vietnam, did not want the President at his funeral. McCain's daughter, Meghan McCain, also revealed earlier this year that she wished Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner, Trump's daughter and son-in-law and senior advisers, had not attended the funeral.
Blue Cross expects to start selling the Freedom Blue plans next month, with coverage beginning April 1.
A key element to the Trump narrative is that America was bad before he came along. And it's great now.
And Bloomberg has a $60 billion personal fortune to use to get that message out, something neither Buttigieg nor Klobuchar can come close to touching.

The timing of Rep. Adam Schiff's comments
The President, they said, wants to telegraph to his political base that he is standing firm on his promise to repeal the entire law despite failing to wrangle Republicans to do just that during a drawn out legislative battle in 2017, when the party held both chambers of Congress. And he is now pinning his hopes on the courts accomplishing what he and a Republican majority in the House and Senate could not.
At the same time, it is cutting funding for so-called navigators -- who help people sign up for coverage -- by 41%. The 98 navigator groups will receive a total of $37 million for the coming enrollment season.

President Donald Trump walks out after speaking at the Operation Warp Speed Vaccine Summit on December 8, 2020 in Washington, DC.
Trump claimed that pre-existing conditions, 100%, we take care of.
Trump did not specify who he was talking about when he repeatedly referred to an unnamed they and somebody; it is certainly plausible that somebody somewhere thought that a mere 70,000, 80,000 or 90,000 jobs would be added. (His last number, 110,000, wasn't too far off from reality.) But Trump created the impression that he was talking about the expectations of economic experts.
I have to be honest, Trump said, I never liked him much. Hasn't been for me.
You know, if you remember, it goes all the way back -- for years, I heard that China will take over as the largest economy in the world in 2019. I kept hearing that. I hated it because I said, 'If I run, 2019 is not so far away.' We are so far ahead. We are so far ahead now. We became a rocket ship... -- February 7 speech at North Carolina Opportunity Now Summit

The Constitution leaves it up to Congress to determine what qualifies.

Trump has signaled his eagerness by getting personally involved in the vetting and candidate recruitment phase of his administration's 2018 plans.
He also blamed McCain for wars in the Middle East.
SCARAMUCCI: Chris, that's a free market principle. Do you see that? They'd rather pay the least. So why not disrupt and decentralize the system, make it more price competitive, increase competition for the insurance companies, reevaluate the way we're entering the primary care market the way Secretary Price wants to do it, and trust the process of the free market like in telecom, like in airlines. You will get a better product, better quality service, at a lower price. That's what America has been about.
By contrast, Sanders's chief rival Biden has advocated less dramatic policies. For instance, Biden supports a carbon tax, but does not want to ban fracking or fossil fuel exports.

The average age of those evaluated was 13, and 43% of the children visiting were aged between 5 and 11. While previously suicidal behavior made up 2% of pediatric emergency room visits, it now accounts for 3.5%.
But let's check our numbers again. There are 209.3 million Americans aged 25 and older, according to the 2014 Census, and 142.4 million of them have not attained a bachelor's degree or higher. That's 68% of Americans, not 74%.

TRUMP: Well, I think I'll save that for tomorrow night. So we have to keep some good action for tomorrow night. But, we'll, you know, we'll be totally prepared. And, you know, people have not done very well against me. So far everybody that's attacked me has gone down.
We are preparing it, he said. The number of pages will probably be thousands of pages. I can't go to Turbo Tax.
That's why Republicans should build on America's exceptional health care legacy.

But that's not all. That's the individual side of the coronavirus emergency package.

Facts First: Trump is wrong that Fauci publicly said the virus was not going to be a big deal and would pass. While it is true that Fauci said in late February that Americans did not need to change their behavior patterns at that time, he also clarified that these conditions could change and coronavirus could develop into a major outbreak.

And so while things may not be perfect right now, whether it's repeal and replace or repeal and delay, you are moving the process towards a freer system where you will get the technological S-curves that you've experienced in Silicon Valley, you've experienced in our areas of our economy.

When Alabama voters go to the polls Tuesday to choose between Roy Moore and Doug Jones, they are, ostensibly, picking one out of 100 senators – not to mention someone who will only serve until 2020 before having to run again.
But in hitting hardball notes on abortion, immigration, religion and awarding a Medal of Freedom to talk show king Rush Limbaugh on live TV , the President made his most brazen political base play yet.
I have to be honest, Trump said, I never liked him much. Hasn't been for me.
I think that has some promise to it. I do think there is going to be some turn of negotiation before this is over, but it's got to be done within the context of the president not breaking his vow he would not negotiation over the debt ceiling but have a four-week period of six-week period before the shutdown again.
Paul Ryan, the speaker of the House, he will be the final speaker before the actual rollcall begins. We will watch that closely.

Warren is misleading in her description of Buttigieg's plan and wrong on Klobuchar's policy, which Warren also compared to a Post-it note. Buttigieg's plan would help lower deductibles and co-pays, in addition to premiums. And Klobuchar's proposal is more than two paragraphs.
The timing of the Biden campaign's statement
In an interview on MSNBC this week, he lambasted Bloomberg over stop-and-frisk policing policies, his failure to endorse then-Sen. Obama in 2008 and his position on Obamacare.
MIAMI GARDENS, FLORIDA - MAY 06: Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis speaks during a press conference at the Hard Rock Stadium testing site on May 06, 2020 in Miami Gardens, Florida. Gov. DeSantis announced during the press conference that a COVID-19 antibodies test will be available. The test can show if a person has had the virus in the past without showing symptoms, and therefore may be immune to it. The test will be available to first responders and health care workers first, with the goal of being able to expand testing to the general public. (Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)
Buttigieg came into the debate focused on denting the front-runner, Sanders, while offering himself as a cogent moderate alternative to Bloomberg. And in moments, he was able to do that -- calling on Sanders to accept some responsibility for the virulent comments his supporters have made online and calling the Vermont senator a socialist who thinks that capitalism is the root of all evil.
Trump might have meant to refer to independents or even registered Democrats who are supportive of Republicans, but what he actually said was inaccurate.
Vindman testified that the transcript was substantively correct even without the changes he had proposed. When I first saw the transcript without the two substantive items that I had attempted to include, I didn't see that as nefarious. I just saw it as, OK, no big deal. You know, these might be meaningful, but it's not that big a deal, he told the House Intelligence Committee in November.
Regardless of what Congress does, the Trump administration has taken several steps that critics say will dampen enrollment for 2018. While it is maintaining the federal exchange, healthcare.gov, it has slashed funding for open enrollment advertising and support. Also, consumers will have only six weeks to sign up for coverage on the federal exchange, rather than the three months or more they had in previous years.
On another culture war front, the administration also withdrew Obama-era protections for transgender students in public schools. And in his final year in office, as Black Americans protested police brutality in widespread protests, Trump issued a salvo against attempts to more accurately portray racism and slavery in school history including creating the 1776 Commission to promote patriotic education. But with Trump's presidency coming to an end, it's unlikely to have an impact on future US curriculums.
He also went over the heads of military commanders to institute controversial policies, blindsiding the US Joint Chiefs when he announced via Twitter that he would institute a blanket ban prohibiting transgender people from serving in the military. The ban went into effect in 2019, prohibiting transgender people from joining the military. It's likely to be reversed by the Biden administration.
BLITZER: But he says -- he says specifically that --
But growing increasingly antsy about prospects for a bipartisan deal, Senate Democrats have been laying the groundwork to use a rare procedural tactic known as reconciliation to pass major parts of the Covid-19 relief package if Republicans stand in the way, according to multiple Democratic aides.
The ACA made great strides in helping people who don't get health insurance through an employer afford coverage in the individual market, reads his health care plan . Mike would reverse the Trump administration's attempts at sabotage: He would expand enrollment efforts, restrict the sale of health plans that don't meet ACA standards, and defend the law against politically motivated lawsuits. He would expand subsidies to cap premiums at 8.5% of a household's income.

Trump, as is now his habit, flew to South Carolina on Friday night to goad the candidates and to underline his dominance in the state. He urged his supporters to vote for Sanders in the state's open primary. The President wants to create as much chaos in the Democratic race as possible and his campaign team sees Sanders as their preferred opponent in November.

But despite the focus on Iowa, for the first time in the 2020 primary, foreign policy took center stage. Each candidate criticized President Donald Trump for not having authorization to attack Iran and outlined their general plans for withdrawing troops from Iran. Former South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg touted his military experience, compared to President Trumps draft deferments, to make the case he is prepared to take on the president on the issue.
He hired Michael Flynn, his former national security adviser, who pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his contacts with the Russian ambassador. He hired Michael Cohen who pleaded guilty to making false statements to Congress in his testimony about the Russia investigation.
Biden may also want to institute a special enrollment period for Obamacare to allow the uninsured to sign up, which Trump refused to do last year.
It was damning with faint praise to say the least, said Dan Pfeiffer, a longtime Obama adviser. At the time, a lot of us though, like, not endorsing would have been more constructive.
The Trump administration is not defending Obamacare from the lawsuit, which was filed by a coalition of Republican-led states.
But let me ask you about potentially going a step further, because that would be hard to get a veto-proof majority on in both chambers. Do you think that Congress should actually change the law, so that the president can no longer declare a national emergency without the support of Congress?
Though Davis did transfer out of the private school because tuition was too expensive for her family even with a partial scholarship, according to the Inquirer, her mother, Stephanie Davis, said they do not view the charter school (an independently run school paid for by the public) as a failing entity they want to flee: I don't view MaST as a school you want to get out of at all.

Republicans, including President Donald Trump, have lined up to dismiss Medicare for All as socialism and have already laid out a series of attacks they plan to deploy throughout the 2020 election cycle.
For Hillary Clinton, the Oval Office is just another cash cow. Well, I have one word for all of this hypocrisy and corruption. Enough. Americans have had enough of a government that plays favorites to the well-connected. They have had enough of the Clintons' excuses, cronyism and cover-ups. They have had enough of the corrupt deals Americans have had enough.

But they're the right goals, especially if you come at this from a generational perspective. You know, for me, the question of what the world is going to look like in 2054, which is when I'm going to reach the current age of the current president, that's not a theoretical question. That's a personal question.

Ohio Gov. John Kasich proposed a budget Monday that maintains expansion coverage for 700,000 individuals.
People hated the Affordable Care Act until it was threatened, she said. And in Virginia on Tuesday, the No. 1 issue that people cited for coming out to vote was health care. So all of a sudden, because it was in the spotlight with the debate on how to get rid of it, people said, 'Oh my god my cousin has that, or my daughter just aged out of our policy.'
Because the days of grand bipartisan debates in which lawmakers hash things out on the Senate or House floor are something of a myth at the moment.

This is a general nondiscrimination statement except it includes the language including termination of pregnancy. The issue of how the federal government should (or should not) provide access to abortion nearly sank passage of the Affordable Care Act in 2009 and 2010. Here Sanders appears to go in the opposite direction and enshrine abortion rights in the language.
Over the weekend, Trump urged the Senate to try again.
Some 17 million fewer people would be insured next year, leaving only an estimated 84% of Americans covered, compared to 90% under current law, the CBO found. Premiums would be roughly 25% higher mainly because many younger and healthier people would drop their coverage since they would no longer be penalized for being uninsured.
I know I can be too tough sometimes and I can push too hard, she told MSNBC earlier this month. That is obvious. But a lot of it is I have high expectations for myself and I have high expectations for people who work with me.

During the debate on Tuesday, Biden also offered a confusing timeline of his positions on the war, saying, I said 13 years ago it was a mistake to give the president the authority to go to war if, in fact, he couldn't get inspectors into Iraq to stop -- what thought to be -- the attempt to get a nuclear weapon. It was a mistake. And I acknowledged that.
The Trump administration had offered the Freedom Caucus a repeal of Obamacare's essential health benefits, regulatory changes that would mean insurers no longer would have to include benefits such as maternity care or mental health coverage in their plans. But the caucus rejected the olive branch, arguing that it alone would not be enough to drive down premiums.
Fear of economic fallout led White House advisers to dissuade Trump from new tariffs on imports from China late last year. But an unpredictable president governed by impulse often bucks attempts to control him -- on the economy, national security and everything else.

RUBIO: Well, I would love the relationship between Cuba and the United States to change. But it will require Cuba to change, at least its government. Today, it has not.

Right now China's had the worst year they've had in 67 years. And: Last year was the worst they had. In 67 -- was 57, now it's 67 years, and they wanted to make a deal and we made a deal, and it's a great deal. -- January 10 interview with Fox News' Laura Ingraham
No winner emerged largely because the conversations were redundant, a parroting of the same talking points -- we must stomp out corporate corruption, we should build upon Obamacare, not scrap it -- and the same issues -- health care, political experience, corporate responsibility, etc. that dominate each debate.

Klobuchar spent the lead-up to the town hall with a trip through Wisconsin and Iowa, building on her campaign theme of retaking Midwest communities that have drifted away from Democrats in recent years.

Global markets lower after the Dow lost nearly 800 points Tuesday. In Asia, the Nikkei down just about half a percent. The Shanghai fell a little, about half a percent as well, and the Hang Seng is down 1.6 percent.
A reminder: Obamacare is still around, although the fine for not buying insurance will soon be gone. So was the 2013 shutdown worth it? It certainly didn't encourage Congress to take a wide turn to avoid another one. It also wasn't the last time food stories made their way into political news leading up to a shutdown. Never change, Washington. Or do. Just for the better.
The House ended up passing the bill early in the morning of Saturday, March 14.
Trump proudly embraces his smashing of political idols. Desecrating the old ways of doing things – and doing so gleefully – he believes is at the root of his political people. It says, he thinks, that he won't let the rules that past crappy politicians have lived by govern him.

But the reality of Ivanka Trump's current position, nebulous though it may be, has been more complicated. She helped Sen. Marco Rubio make the case for adding a modest child tax credit to the GOP's 2017 tax plan. But when came time decide the future of the Paris agreement, she was sidelined. Alas, she has emerged as a walking, talking reminder of why nepotism is generally considered a bad thing. More to the point, her efforts to parry questions that get at the underlying problem have fallen consistently flat.

Obama had a bigger margin in both of the two previous elections.

I think it's stupid. I'm being very declarative here. I think it's stupid, Scaramucci, whose short-lived tenure as White House communications director imploded due to his combative personality, said later. There's no strategy that you can tell – other than the fact that you're frustrated and you want to ventilate your frustrations into the international airwaves. OK. But I think it's stupid.
CONSUEGRA: Yes, she started screaming, and then we saw the baby. That's when we started seeing the baby inside the car with her, you know, and everybody started screaming no, no, not the lady, not with the baby, please don't do that. I scream, too.
The moderates: Biden, Klobuchar and Pete Buttiegieg -- always polished and impressive -- came across as much more reasonable, knowledgeable and able to make things happen in Washington and on the global stage. Their responses on foreign policy -- Iran, troop deployments, North Korea -- and trade sounded like the kind that win elections.

On Sunday morning, Trump wasted little time publicly rebuking the conservative group.
Facts First: Trump is half-right, half-wrong. He's correct, even conservative, when he says net farm income was 20% lower in 2016 than it was eight years prior: in inflation-adjusted 2020 dollars, net farm income : Trump is half-right, half-wrong.

At the time he announced the end of DACA, he made the decision to do that rather than fight Republican governors who were threatening to sue to stop it.

Dr. Kate Goodrich, director of clinical standards and quality at the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), said in a statement that unnecessary regulation was the main concern that health care providers raised with officials.

Ban excess tax credits from going into Health Savings Accounts. Enrollees whose tax credits exceed the cost of their premiums would not be able to put the additional funds in Health Savings Accounts. Some conservatives are concerned these funds could be used to pay for abortions.
I have neither. But then again, the same is true of the dozens of commentators who have been quick to pile on in the wake of the opinion, pillorying the Justice Department's decision to bring the case in the first place.

Democrats are divided on the future of health care, according to a March poll by the nonprofit health care think tank Kaiser Family Foundation, which showed 44% of those surveyed said Congress should focus on improving and protecting Obamacare, while 46% said Congress should move forward on Medicare for All.
His grasp of the issues, too, has come under tons of scrutiny, most recently and notably when he openly agreed – on live TV – to Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein's suggestion that Congress pass a bill to protect DACA recipients before and separately from the GOP's other immigration concerns. House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy jumped in to quash the prospect seconds later, but the incident further undermined Trump's claims to being a top-level negotiator.
SANDERS: The president had no knowledge of the story. And it's completely untrue that here the White House involvement in the story.
In Afghanistan, the determination and valor of our warfighters has allowed us to make tremendous progress, and peace talks are underway. I am not looking to kill hundreds of thousands of people in Afghanistan, many of them innocent. It is also not our function to serve other nations as a law enforcement agency. These are warfighters, the best in the world, and they either want to fight to win or not fight at all. We are working to finally end America's longest war and bring our troops back home!
Here's the other thing. The federal deficit rose to $779 billion in fiscal year 2018. That's up 17 percent from last year. Where's the money coming from to build a wall, the wall that Mexico was supposed to pay for?

In reality, Americans needed authorization from a doctor to get tested -- and even many people who did have a doctor's order could not get access.

While Sanders frequently praised many aspects of Obama-era policies and defended the then-President's agenda from what he said was an obstructionist Republican Party, a CNN KFile review of Sanders' comments during Obama's years in office shows the Vermont senator was also sharply critical of the President.
The Coast Guard commandant (inaudible) he won't turn his back on transgender troops, which would seem to preclude (inaudible) the president's directive on Twitter. Does the White House consider that he's refusing to follow an order?
DOUGHERTY: Right. And that's the essential thing. But I think what -- and not to explain away what the State Department is doing, but their view would be based on the information that they had at that particular point which -- was coming from intelligence agencies and others on the ground.

CUOMO: The special counsel said Cohen has been helpful to them.

It's only been more recently that the administration began promoting the plan as a major win for progressive ideas, including the notion that it could cut childhood poverty in half and provide a major expansion of Obamacare.
There's no single correct stocks-bonds mix that's right for all retirees (although many tend to keep between 30% and 60% of their assets in stocks). But the idea is that you want to invest enough of your savings in stocks to provide the returns you'll need to maintain your purchasing power over the course of a long retirement, but also enough in bonds to provide some ballast during the market's inevitable periodic setbacks.
But experts like former Senate Parliamentarian Alan Frumin say the talking filibuster probably wouldn't do much to stop obstruction.

So how can you determine whether you've got the financial wherewithal to live a comfortable life once the paychecks stop? Start by getting an accurate sense of how much income you'll need to cover your living expenses after you retire. The best way to do that is by going to an online budgeting tool like BlackRock's Retirement Expense Worksheet. Be as accurate as possible, but remember that you can, and should, refine your estimates as you get a better handle on your expenses and spending.
But if the analysis of the Senate bill is similar the House bill's, this promise might also be broken. The CBO found that while the House bill would decrease health care premiums for healthier, younger Americans, it could drastically increases costs for sicker, older citizens.
The poll shows Democrats with a huge advantage among women likely voters, 60% say they back the Democrat in their district compared with 36% for the Republican. Among men, Republicans hold a slim 5-point edge. And as in 2016, education is a sharp divider among white voters. Those without college degrees broadly back the Republican (57% for the Republican to 38% for the Democrat) while those who hold four-year degrees favor the Democrat by a similar margin (59% to 37%).
For candidates like Buttigieg and Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar , Bloomberg's entry represents the greatest threat to any momentum they still have from Iowa and New Hampshire.

Klobuchar's primary pitch to voters is likely to be electability. The Democrat has been notably successful in Minnesota, winning her three terms in the Senate by an average of 26 percentage points.

While it's true that Obamacare insurers are finally becoming profitable, they aren't exactly rolling in the dough because of their involvement in the individual market, experts say. And carriers' stock prices are a poor measure of their performance on the exchanges given how many other factors contribute to their bottom line.

I thought it was good that they were able to go after each other, because this is their debate, their chance to take each other on in the way that they see fit. Whether the country thinks it's very palatable or not. The question is how do we gauge what impact it has? Especially when it was this kind of two-on-one. And for me it's hard to gauge whether Cruz benefits more than Rubio.
Meanwhile, he issued another executive order in late 2017 that would make it easier for Americans to buy alternatives to the Affordable Care Act that are cheaper, but offer fewer protections, such as short-term health plans. The law's defenders, however, fear that such plans could siphon off younger and healthier people, which could cause premiums to rise for those left buying policies in the Obamacare exchanges.

As rioters began to overrun the officers, creating an untenable situation, radio waves filled with desperate shouts and requests for backup:
There is no love lost between Buttigieg and Klobuchar -- a reality that was clear headed into the debate. And Klobuchar showed she believes Warren's style of leadership is divisive. But her fiery performance in Las Vegas was a divergence from the approach that had worked so well for her in New Hampshire -- and highlighted how desperately she needs a memorable moment to keep her campaign going as the pace of primaries ramps up.

If you've had wealth throughout your lifetime, when the time comes to be on Social Security, you'll still get it. It will just simply be less. And for those people who depend on that Social Security, they'll get their full benefit. That's the way it will work. And we don't have to monkey around with the retirement age. And how do I know that? I've done all this before.
I have to be honest, Trump said, I never liked him much. Hasn't been for me.

Ivanka Trump's troubles have been less serious and less public, but perhaps more surprising. Throughout the 2016 campaign, and for years before that, she presented as the conscience and class of the Trump family brand. Not everyone bought in. The New Yorker's Emily Nussbaum was among those spotted out the cracks early on, during the Republican National Convention in Cleveland that summer, when she wrote about the future first daughter's weaponized graciousness.
Told that doctors were saying they were unable to obtain critical supplies, Trump said , Many doctors -- and I've read many, many doctors -- they can't believe the great job that we've done. He said governors are loving what we're doing.

Americans now have two additional ways to get out of paying Obamacare's individual mandate penalty.
The Supreme Court clearly does not represent the constitutional expertise of the broad Senate constitutional experts, who for example in 2012 by about an 80 percent to 90 percent margin said the mandate was constitutional. Yet the Supreme Court found it wasn't.
One example: Employers who provide contributions to workers to buy their own individual health insurance can be slapped with a penalty of $100 per day, per person. Trump could suggest to his new IRS commissioner that enforcing the rule is counterproductive and a waste of resources, especially when Congress plans to replace Obamacare.

UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER: Do you intend to pursue any legislation specifically regarding abortion?
Trump did not mention that he was exempting a variety of non-US citizens, including permanent US residents and certain family members of both citizens and permanent residents. And by referring to Americans who have undergone appropriate screenings, he did not make clear that US citizens can return from Europe even if they have not been screened before they take off for the US. The screening comes after they land in the US.

But even though the Trump administration put Iran on notice in the first weeks of Trump's presidency, there's been little follow-through.
While we don't yet have an analysis of the Senate's plan, it is clear that if signed into law, the bill would fall well short of Trump's broad promises to insure everyone. According to the CBO, under the House bill that passed in May – which is similar to the Senate bill – 23 million Americans who already have insurance would lose their coverage within a decade.
Klobuchar is markedly more centrist than many of the other Democrats running for President, including some of her colleagues in the Senate. Klobuchar has a liberal voting record, but she does not support abolishing the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency or Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders' Medicare-for-all bill – instead pushing to lower the age when people are allowed to buy into the government health care program.
Over the weekend, Trump revived his long-running feud against McCain – who died in August after a long battle with brain cancer – citing his ties to the controversial Russia dossier and his vote against repealing Obamacare. He said in the Oval Office on Tuesday that he was never a fan of John McCain and I never will be and complained on Wednesday that he wasn't thanked for giving McCain the kind of funeral that he wanted.

The question is straightforward, but coming up with an accurate answer can be more difficult than you think. For example, a recent study by the Boston College Center for Retirement Research found that more than 40% of working-age Americans had an unrealistic sense of whether they were on track to maintain their standard of living in retirement, with close to half of that group being overconfident about their prospects.

Among the most vocal post-Parkland gun control activists, many of them teens and young millennials, there is an intrinsic understanding that public opinion alone is not a driver of legislative change.

The Obama administration said it expected initial enrollees to be sicker because they were previously denied policies due to preexisting conditions.
The bill would also end the Obamacare prohibition on paying for over-the-counter medications with funds from tax-advantaged accounts, such as HSAs and flexible spending accounts. And it reduces the penalty from 20% to 10% if funds from an HSA are used for non-medical purposes. These provisions begin in 2018.

Perhaps it's a rhetorical point. Who knows. His repeated failures to fully and accurately fill out a security clearance form couldn't have helped his cause. His lawyer says he's gone above and beyond at this point. Nor did Kushner's initial explanation – that a trigger-happy assistant accidentally submitted unfinished documents – inspire a ton of confidence in his management skills. Nor has the administration's decision to move the US embassy in Israel to Jerusalem done much to advance his big Middle East peace project.

Here's how it would work: The legislation would eliminate Obamacare's Medicaid expansion, as well as federal premium and cost-sharing subsidies to buy policies on the exchanges. Instead, states would get a pot of money through 2026, and it would be up to them to figure out how to spend it on health care.

So naturally in the legislative process, people are saying, well, I'd love to have this in there; I'd love to have that in there. That's the legislative process. That's what we're going through. And what people are sort of learning is this reconciliation tool is pretty tight. There's a lot of stuff we would love to put in the bill, but unfortunately the Senate rules don't allow us to do that.

Nonetheless, China is still nowhere near the total size of the US economy in terms of raw output. China says its 2019 GDP was about $14.4 trillion. The US says its 2019 GDP was about $21.4 trillion.

He's hitting something that is socially unnatural. And so what is that? You're attacking somebody that died seven months ago, Scaramucci told CNN's John Berman on New Day.

That brand will likely help the newly inaugurated President as he attempts to convince the public that pursuing his biggest campaign promise -- uniting a severely divided country -- and passing a massive Covid relief bill are not in conflict.
DANA BASH, CNN SENIOR CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT: No, that's the short and honest answer. There is nothing going on. The only discussions that are going on are within each party's leadership walls, trying to figure out what their next move is, mostly rhetorically but in some cases, especially looking ahead to the debt ceiling inside Republican House Speaker John Boehner's office trying to figure out how they are going to craft something that maybe could make Democrats move off the in negotiation pledge.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on Thursday sought to distance his caucus from Trump's latest venture, saying he looks forward to seeing what the President is proposing and what he can work out with the (House) speaker.

That sentence is one that this Court never expected to see outside the pages of a dystopian novel, or perhaps the pages of The Onion, he continued.
The executive order would also expand employers' ability to give workers cash to buy coverage elsewhere under a system known as health reimbursement arrangements. The agencies were given 120 days to propose these regulations.
Mr. Trump, I want to ask you about something else you've said during the course of this campaign. You said that the U.S. has to, quote, take out the families of terrorists. When it was pointed out that targeting civilians is against the Geneva Conventions, you said, quote, So they can kill us, but we can't kill them?

Independent stores want to attract good employees and retain them, said Neil Trautwein, vice president for health policy at the National Retail Federation. If the larger store down the block offers coverage and they can't, they are at a disadvantage.
While longer-term spending negotiations were still ongoing, Democrats have dug in their heels and demanded that no spending caps be agreed to until there is a deal on the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which expires on March 5. Democrats have said they want assurances that DACA recipients are protected before agreeing to an omnibus spending bill, the best leverage they believe they have. And even on the short-term continuing budget resolution, many Democrats say they want an answer on DACA before they vote again to fund the government.
LEMON: Well, that's my question to Garrett.
Three years ago we launched the great American comeback, Trump said.
Zelensky acknowledged European help during his meeting with Trump at the United Nations in September, though he said the world's efforts had been inadequate so far: And, I'm sorry, but we don't need help; we need support. Real support. And we thank -- thank everybody, thank all of the European countries; they each help us. But we also want to have more -- more.
My Administration has cut more regulations in a short time than any other administration during its entire tenure. Companies are coming back to our country in large numbers thanks to historic reductions in taxes and regulations.
The Republican and Democratic leaders of that effort, Sens. Richard Burr and Mark Warner, appeared together on Wednesday to pledge a complete and organized investigation – implicitly drawing a contrast with the chaotic effort that has been rocked by mistrust and partisan wrangling in the House.
When the federal government takes over trillions of dollars in spending, there is a real danger of waste, fraud and abuse. Sanders envisions applying existing protections that govern Medicaid funding to protect this Medicare for All investment. There are also sections that mandate the creation of an annual health care budget and a focus on cost containment.
STODDARD: The tax reform is different. It's a signature policy prerogative going back decades and they waited to get a Republican president to do this. On health care the debate shifted. The Trump voter who helped him get into office and Medicate expansion and they have shown this as popular. They couldn't repeal it. The moment this is signed, they will start fighting about cost cutting and DACA and they will fight against. Not one of the Senators wanted to be the one to invoke the vote. It was too much of a Republican goal.

It will be Biden's first move toward delivering on his campaign promise to bolster the landmark health reform law that he championed as vice president. And it comes as more Americans could be facing the loss of coverage because of the pandemic-fueled economic downturn.
First, the Trump administration losing yet another cabinet member. Just moments ago, the President announced on Twitter that Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke has resigned and will leave the administration at the end of the year. Zinke departs amid growing scrutiny over a number of ethics investigations during his time heading up the Interior Department. We will have much more on Zinke's resignation in a few moments.
His loss came through a series of bizarre moments. The first was his surprise pre-debate appearance with four female accusers of Bill Clinton. While a case can be made for re-hearing their claims of long ago, the event seemed like a stunt and Trump never made real use of it in the debate.

The understandable impulse to protect the economy from total free fall has led the Trump administration to embrace multitrillion-dollar bailouts and stimulus of the kind that many on the right attacked during the Bush and Obama response to the financial crisis. According to an administration official cited by the Wall Street Journal , Trump wants to further politicize the bailout by putting his name on all the checks that will be sent out. But political self-interest seems to have trumped any alleged fiscal conservative principles in the Republican Party long ago. Deficits and debt won't be discussed until there is a Democratic president.
Health insurers are waiting for critical details, including when the changes will go live, said Kelley Schultz, executive director of the commercial product policy group at America's Health Insurance Plans, one of the industry's main trade associations.
The Trump administration could amend the rules governing these plans so they are no longer subject to state regulation, said health policy experts. Instead, the nationwide plans may come under the same federal oversight as large-employer policies, which are not subject to all of Obamacare's mandates. For instance, large-employer plans don't have to provide comprehensive coverage that includes prescription drug, substance abuse and maternity benefits. Eliminating these would make plans less expensive, but could leave policyholders who need these benefits out in the cold.
On Monday, McCain said she genuinely feel(s) bad for (the Trump) family and that she can't imagine having a father who does this on the weekends.
The administration released its final rule governing association health plans, which allow small businesses and the self-employed to band together based on their industry or location and buy health insurance. The rule stems from an executive order that Trump signed in October aimed at providing alternatives to the Affordable Care Act, which it is bent on dismantling.

And that brings us to Thursday, nearly a quarter of the way into 2018. Republican leaders on Wednesday released the massive omnibus – which is thousands of pages long.
BROWN: Two other points on this also with the DACA and Dream Act, Congress refused to act. The House wouldn't take it up. But I think important is that the American people overwhelmingly supported a fix for DACA, just as today Americans overwhelmingly reject the idea of a wall and a national emergency to build the wall. So there are plenty of distinctions and differences between DACA and the wall.
It will now allow them to become set permanent and in stone. They will now be able to carry out a transition where the military continues to run the country there. They'll put a puppet figure forward as their new president. And nothing will change for the Cuban people.

Slavitt: Because we need to use the grassroots and the will of the people to change the politics and to use the politics and to translate what people really want and believe into political change. The reality is that right now we don't have the political make-up where people have the incentive to compromise. We have people in a world where their incentive is to get more polarized. So when we say health care over politics is a top priority, it (means) that we want to have an impact on constituents first in making care accessible to all Americans.
My father was his kryptonite in life, he was his kryptonite in death. On a personal level, I agree with you, all of us have love and families, and when my father was alive, up until adulthood, we would spend our time together cooking, hiking, fishing, really celebrating life, and I think it's because he almost died, she said. And I just thought, 'your life is spent on the weekend not with your family, not with your friends, but you're obsessing, obsessing over great men you could never live up to.' That tells you everything you need to know about his pathetic life right now.
The federal government began funding 100% of the cost of the expanded enrollment nationwide, but it will be stepping down to 90% by 2020. But, with the Trump administration and Republicans in Congress on course to repeal, and potentially replace, Obamacare, all of that funding for Medicaid expansion could go out the window.
Trump said of John Bolton, his former national security adviser: And I gave him a big break because, you know, that's not a Senate-approved job.

The fact of the matter is we have to have an expedited process. When people cheat, when countries cheat and they take advantage of us, we need to blow the whistle. And as president of the United States, I absolutely will blow the whistle and begin to stand up for the American worker.
Eliminate support for CDC Prevention and Public Health Fund. The bill would eliminate nearly $1 billion in funding for this program, which Republicans call a slush fund. The Centers for Disease Control says the money supports heart disease and stroke prevention, immunization, lead poisoning prevention and diabetes prevention, mostly through grants to states and local programs.
The proposed regulation would allow associations to base an employer's rates on the gender, age and industry of its workers, which could leave firms with many younger men paying less, but those with older workers and women saddled with higher premiums. Currently, the Affordable Care Act bans insurers from basing premiums on gender or industry and limits the amount that can be based on age.

We're going to continue on that track, and we're going to do that under General Kelly. And we're very excited to work alongside him in that process.

On Easter Sunday of 2008, Chris was out on patrol in Baghdad when his Bradley Fighting Vehicle was hit by a roadside bomb. That night, he made the ultimate sacrifice for our country. Sergeant Hake now rests in eternal glory in Arlington, and his wife Kelli is in the gallery tonight, joined by their son, who is now 13 years old.

Klobuchar's primary pitch to voters is likely to be electability. The Democrat has been notably successful in Minnesota, winning her three terms in the Senate by an average of 26 percentage points. Klobuchar won re-election in 2018 with 60% of the vote, two years after Trump came within two points of defeating Hillary Clinton in the state.
Trump himself has not issued any attack ads on TV, though he's gone after candidates in short video clips on Instagram. But the brash billionaire has vowed to return fire with a flurry of negative ads if he comes under attack.
Such a decision could turn out to be one of the most fateful moments of the US response to the pandemic. The indications of how Trump handled the approaching storm will fuel claims by Democrats that he cost lives by not acting more quickly.

A firm called Sentier Research says real median household income, pre-tax, was $65,666 in December 2019, the last month for which Sentier has figures -- up from $61,496 in the month Trump was inaugurated, January 2017, a difference of $4,170. Trump is adding an additional $5,000-plus for reasons that do not make sense mathematically -- and $10,000 a year is simple nonsense.

These are not national security nominations . These are domestic policy nominees that strike at the heart of the differences between the two parties. It's harder to win some Republican votes on a nominee whose job it is to strengthen Obamacare at HHS. It's harder to win GOP support for an interior secretary whose job in the Biden administration will likely be to cut back on fossil fuel extraction on federal lands. That means Democrats have to stay united. Manchin isn't the only member with power here. On Tuesday, Sen. Bernie Sanders, an independent from Vermont, voted against Biden's nominee for Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack . It didn't make a difference in terms of outcome because Vilsak has broad bipartisan support, but it shows that Manchin isn't the only Democratic member willing to vote against Biden's agenda or nominations in the Democratic caucus.

Lower courts have ruled against the President so far, and the Court will have to wrestle with Trump's broad claims of immunity and separation of powers claims.

DIAZ BARRAGAN: I thought you were referencing the lieutenant governor. And we do need people in Virginia who can lead. We don't want to be distracted.
But Christopher Isham, vice president and Washington bureau chief for CBS News, believes his network, for one, has covered the health care proceedings. In an interview with CNN, he noted that CBS News has run more than 40 pieces on health care this year on the evening and morning newscasts, and characterized the issue as an ongoing debate.
In 2016 , the US produced more than 728 million tons of coal, according to the annual report from the Energy Information Administration. While the Trump administration made some policy moves to try to help the coal industry, production levels have not increased under the Trump administration. The most recent available report indicates the US produced 706 million tons of coal in 2019, its lowest level since 1978, when there was a major strike.
Many African Americans applaud the high achievement and success of billionaires like Oprah Winfrey, Jay-Z and Michael Jordan.
Rick, Patrick and Michael recently commented on Covered California's Facebook page, urging others to ditch health insurance because:
On Tuesday, Trump falsely accused McCain of misleading the White House over how he would vote.
You're going to need to get more help up here. We don't have enough people to hold the line, one officer said.
And his Justice Department is siding with a coalition of Republican states that are fighting in federal court to invalidate the Affordable Care Act. An appellate panel in December upheld a lower court ruling that found Obamacare's individual mandate unconstitutional but sent the case back to the lower court to decide whether the entire law must fall.
Without Sinema, the Senate cannot pass the relief bill, even using the budget process that allows them to pass it with just 51 votes.
In 2000, I got Lasik surgery. The reason I can see you all so well, is because in 2000, I got this Lasik surgery, which was elective; insurance didn't cover it. And so I knew exactly what the procedure was going to cost up front.
La presencia translúcida de Kushner, su afecto, sin el más mínimo indicio de empatía, en perfecta sincronía con sus insensibles palabras, fue un espectáculo apropiado para nuestros tiempos de pesadilla.
The filing was expected as party's leaders have repeatedly said they would swiftly work to uphold the health care law.
GRANHOLM: Yes. We got to come back on that point.
Facts First: The constitutional rights of criminal defendants do not apply to public officials in a House of Representatives impeachment process, though Trump is free to argue that they should. Trump's counsel was denied the opportunity to participate in House Intelligence Committee impeachment hearings but was invited to participate in House Judiciary Committee hearings; Trump's counsel declined that opportunity. House Republicans were allowed to have their lawyer question witnesses at the House Intelligence Committee.
But if the analysis of the Senate bill is similar the House bill's, this promise might also be broken. The CBO found that while the House bill would decrease health care premiums for healthier, younger Americans, it could drastically increases costs for sicker, older citizens.
CUOMO: And if you don't respect it--
And some believe it's possible. It may not be, in which case we'll find out. But it would be a priority if I become president to see what I could do.
A year ago, 1 million people had chosen policies in the first 12 days of the season.
If these and other companies use that overseas cash to build plants in the United States and hire more American workers, it could substantially boost consumer spending and the broader economy.
A total of about 15 million uninsured people could shop for coverage on the exchanges, Kaiser said.
Battle Creek city spokesperson Jessica VanderKolk said in an email that the city's best guess was that there were about 1,000 people who were not allowed inside once the arena reached capacity. Eric Greene, a former journalist and managing editor of the Battle Creek Enquirer newspaper who now works in public relations, wrote on Twitter: Trump just said there were 20,000 people who had to leave because they couldn't fit in the arena. This is blatantly FALSE. I know because I was outside the arena at the moment they closed the doors at approximately 5:45 p.m. At that time, a few hundred people quietly walked away.
The original map of the Hundred Acre Wood is worth a lot more than a hundred bucks. It sold for almost $600,000 at auction.
Speaking at CPAC, Trump referenced the Arizona Republican's July vote against a skinny repeal of the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare.
Something this big, something this generational, something this profound, could not have been done without exquisite presidential leadership, House Speaker Paul Ryan said at the White House event. Mr. President, thank you for getting us over the finish line.
Shahira played an important policy role during the crafting of our tax reform plan and I look forward to working with her on our larger legislative agenda, Ryan said in his statement to CNN.
But that is hardly an argument for effectively walking away from the deal, which delays the Iranian nuclear weapons program from resuming for around a decade from its inception three years ago.
If any other candidate in this race had his record, there would be non-stop reporting on it. But unfortunately, he's being pumped up because many in the media with a bias know that he'll be easy to beat in the general election. So we're going to put a stop to it now.
​I am going to take care of everybody. I don't care if it costs me votes or not, Trump said. He added: ​The government's gonna pay for it.
Trump fired acting Attorney General Sally Yates Monday night for refusing to enforce the order.
TAPPER: I want you to take a look at something the president tweeted last night.

The Federal Open Market Committee begins its two-day meeting on Tuesday. The group will make a decision on interest rates on Wednesday.
Clinton was in a tough position, after Trump's groping video was released. She did well to avoid wading too deep into Trump's gutter. The win goes to Clinton for staying on course. (And Martha Raddatz, the best moderator thus far.)
At other points his assertions were downright shocking, such as his blunt threat to, as president, have a special investigator look into Hillary Clinton's emails and potentially jail her. He also admitted not having paid federal income tax for decades, implying that other wealthy Americans do the same and blaming Clinton for not reforming the tax code during her years in the Senate.
I think the President fails to understand this, but more importantly, in my own – from my own feeling, we need more compassion, we need more empathy, we need more togetherness in terms of working together. We don't need more bullying and I'm tired of it, she said.
A month before he was sworn into office, according to Jeffrey Toobin, he urged his colleagues to stand firm against a U.N. treaty supporting the rights of the disabled. On foreign policy, Cruz has repeatedly called for carpet-bombing ISIS, an idea most experts agree would be ineffective and dangerous, likely building support for the organization as a result of the civilians who would be killed.
SENATOR-ELECT CORY BOOKER (D), NEW JERSEY: Thank you very much. It's great to be here.
KING: And they also don't want the regime -- they don't -- they don't want a unified Korea.
The Fairground Park pool in St. Louis was the largest public pool in the US when it was built in 1919. It featured sand from a beach, a fancy diving board and enough room for up to 10,000 swimmers. It was dug during a pool-building boom when cities and towns competed to provide their citizens with public amenities that promoted civic pride and symbolized a perk of the American dream.
Mueller, who served as FBI director between 2001 and 2013, testified that he was not acting as a candidate for the job during the conversation with Trump. He said that my understanding (was) I was not applying for that job. I was asked to give my input on what it would take to do the job.
President Donald Trump is all about the bark – bold, aggressive promises.
Hillary Clinton allowed one-fifth of America's uranium to -- reserve to be sold to a Russian firm whose investors were Clinton Foundation donors. And the Clinton campaign chairman's brother lobbied against sanctions on Russia's largest bank and failed to report it.
Keep a close eye on Rep. Deb Haaland's nomination for interior secretary. She has another session for her confirmation hearing Wednesday , and seemed to walk away with some compliments from Energy Chairman Manchin on Tuesday. But, she's not winning much Republican support so far with Sen. Mitt Romney, a Republican from Utah saying he had some concerns about her past positions. Haaland was a vocal supporter of the Green New Deal and it's something that multiple senators focused their questions on Tuesday.
SANDERS: No. I said I would have to, in order to answer that question.
Trump claimed the unemployment rate for disabled Americans has reached an all-time low under his presidency.
There has not been a single democratic opening; not a single change on the island in human rights. In fact, things are worse than they were before this opening. The only thing that's changed as a result of this opening is that now the Cuban government has more sources of money from which to build out their repressive apparatus and maintain themselves there permanently.
Currently, just based on the number of 'nos' and 'undecideds' in the Freedom Caucus, there's not enough support to pass this with GOP-only votes, House Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows told reporters.
Anyway, I recommend that viewing to a very lively encounter with one of most powerful man in the world.

When we took office ... I promised the American people that help was on the way, Biden says in the close of the spot. Today, I can say we've taken one more giant step forward in delivering on that promise.
CUOMO: It's actually not what the surveys show.
I believe the market can live with Joe Biden because he's accepted as more of a centrist, said David Kotok, chairman and chief investment officer of Cumberland Advisors.
Both figures are correct, though it's worth noting that the numbers include both large traditional factories and tiny facilities that produce goods with fewer than five employees. Read more
The Oakley clinic also serves patients who lack insurance, because they are undocumented immigrants or because they make too much money to qualify for Medi-Cal -- or subsidized coverage under Obamacare -- and can't afford it on their own.

As shared with the DOJ, our acquisition of Cigna will help stabilize pricing in this volatile market, enabling Anthem to continue its commitment to the public exchanges, and provide the opportunity to expand our participation to nine additional states, where neither Anthem nor Cigna currently participate, Anthem CEO Joseph Swedish said last month.
If what many Democrats consider a doomsday scenario occurs, and none of the hopefuls secure enough support to win the nomination on a first ballot, the contest could hinge on the preferences of nearly 800 superdelegates. And that, as anyone who remembers the controversy surrounding their impact in 2016 will recall, could be a recipe for an intra-party meltdown that would make the tough primary of four years ago look like tame.
Most of the questions on Monday will come from New Hampshire voters, an electorate which prizes its position as the first-in-the-nation primary and is often known for asking discerning and pointed questions.

In the last fiscal year, Border Patrol arrested more than 851,000 people trying to cross the southern border, leading to overcrowding in border facilities and straining the administration's resources. Since then, border arrests have declined , but they remain high. Last December, for example, Border Patrol arrested 32,858 people.

Facts First: It's not clear whether Bloomberg ever said these specific words, but they have been attributed to him. The quote Warren is referencing is from a booklet of alleged Bloomberg quotes given to him by an employee as a gift for his birthday in 1990. While the introduction of the book says these are all actual quotes, Bloomberg has denied that he actually said any of them.
SANDERS: I think what's hurting the legislative agenda is Congress' inability to get things passed.

Watch members' comments over the next several days while they are home on recess to get clues to how much of a lift this is going to be for the House speaker.
2020 is also clearly on President Trump's mind. Saturday, he lashed out at Senator Warren on Twitter, alluding to her past claims of Native American status, for which she has apologized. The president appeared to make a joking reference to the tragic Trail of Tears relocation and genocide of Native Americans.
We must move to universal health care. And I am so proud of the work we did as a party to protect the Affordable Car Act, Klobuchar said Sunday. We are to the point now where Obamacare is more popular than the President.
CNN's Maegan Vazquez and Ted Barrett contributed to this report.
But we must do more. It is unacceptable that Americans pay vastly more than people in other countries for the exact same drugs, often made in the exact same place. This is wrong, unfair, and together we can stop it.
Their dueling votes showcase a diversity of thought, the statement said.
Instead, travelers are funneled to specific airports and put through an inspection known as enhanced screening, which cannot prove whether someone has the virus. Previous US airport screening for the coronavirus has involved temperature checks, questions about travelers' health and travel history, and an inspection for symptoms like a cough or breathing trouble. The administration's statements about the enhanced screening for travelers from Europe made no mention of coronavirus tests being conducted.
Rubio's claim that the 2013 vote is the only budget Cruz has supported also begs scrutiny. When Rubio made a similar claim in a Fox Business debate, Cruz fired back that he supported one of Rubio's own budget amendments that increased military spending to $697 billion.
This is deadly serious, warned Eli Pariser. Since older people are more susceptible to serious complications — and worse -- from the virus, members of the Boomer generation had better pay attention, he wrote.
Senior executives should be held accountable if the V.A. outreach isn't working. The problem is no one's being held accountable. Even after we passed that law, no one's been fired for no outreach. No one's been fired for calls going to the voicemail. No one's been disciplined. No one's been demoted.
So we should pay - we should truly give our police. They're incredible people, we should give them a great deal more respect than they receive.
It's a massive undertaking, but Democrats aren't working from scratch here. They are going to be taking Biden's $1.9 trillion plan and making it a bill. A lot of the work has already been done on the front end to make sure every committee has the amount of money they need to make this plan a reality. The House and Senate budgets gave 12 and 11 committees respectively reconciliation instructions. That is a lot. It's going to be messy. Aides say they are very clear about what they have to do here, and they are confident this can be done swiftly.
She later added, We live in an era where we knock down old American heroes for all their imperfections when no leader wants to admit to fault or failure.
ISFAHAN, IRAN - MARCH 30: A worker walks inside of an uranium conversion facility March 30, 2005 just outside the city of Isfahan, about 254 miles (410 kilometers), south of capital Tehran, Iran. The cities of Isfahan and Natanz in central Iran are home to the heart of Iran's nuclear program. The facility in Isfahan makes hexaflouride gas, which is then enriched by feeding it into centrifuges at a facility in Natanz, Iran. Iran's President Mohammad Khatami and the head of Iran's Atomic Energy Organisation Gholamreza Aghazadeh is scheduled to visit the facilities. (Photo by Getty Images)
There are signs that Democrats are ready to negotiate. Instead of gloating after the Republican loss, Democratic leaders in the House and Senate had both reached out to House Speaker Paul Ryan by Friday morning. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer had gone as far as silencing collective Democratic cheers on the Senate floor during the 2 a.m. vote when Arizona Republican Sen. John McCain voted down the bill.

The Utah Republican Party signaled support in a statement Monday for both Romney, who voted to convict Trump, and Utah's Sen. Mike Lee, who voted to acquit.
In order to deliver on the conservative agenda we have promised the American people for eight years, we must come together to find solutions to move this country forward, the Texas Republican said in a statement. Saying no is easy, leading is hard, but that is what we were elected to do. Leaving this caucus will allow me to be a more effective member of Congress and advocate for the people of Texas. It is time to lead.
If the moderators had been bolder, they'd have asked Donald Trump if the violence by radical white supremacists permits us to infringe on the rights of white Americans generally.

Trump claimed twice that the whistleblower who filed a complaint about his dealings with Ukraine was fake, saying both times that the whistleblower's account of his July call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was shown to be highly inaccurate when he released a (rough) transcript of the call.
The problem here is that the shutdown is likely to go on for a couple more weeks. And be really disruptive to the US economy. You also have other programs like the WIC Program which helps indigent women get baby formula. That's run in individual states and they have a little bit of money to extend that program for a couple of weeks.
A vote to confirm Mr. Readler is very simply an endorsement of the law suit to eliminate pre-existing conditions, he said.

The special counsel is recommending up to 24 years in prison for former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort for financial crimes, as prosecutors revealed for the first time that they uncovered direct communications between Roger Stone and WikiLeaks, an allegation that raises more questions about how involved the former Trump associate was in getting information about hacked Russian e-mails.
Republican leaders and committee chairs who gave presentations Monday in the closed-door conference meeting pitched the $1.3 trillion bill as a big win to a skeptical conference, according to one lawmaker in the room.
This is New Hampshire, anything could happen, she said when asked about the town hall at an event earlier in the day.
Trump mocked journalists for calling it unsubstantiated when he says Joe Biden had told Ukrainian officials he would refuse to give $1 billion of taxpayer money to Ukraine unless they get the prosecutor to stop looking at your son and your son's company. Trump said, He's on tape. He's -- if that were me, it's the electric chair. They would bring the electric chair back. No, the guy's on tape and they always say it's unsubstantiated. -- December 18 campaign rally in Battle Creek, Michigan
I want to build on the momentum that we saw here in 2018, Klobuchar told reporters Saturday in Wisconsin. No one ever thought that the Democrats were going to be able (to defeat) Gov. Walker, but we did it, and we did it in a smart, Wisconsin way with a grassroots campaign with (Democratic Sen.) Tammy Baldwin at the top of the ticket, and we can do it in the presidential, as well.
Biden also benefited, in some quarters, from the view that almost anything he supported, because of his long record of taking moderate positions in the Senate and as vice president, was definitionally the moderate approach -- even when he stakes out ground to the left of where the Obama administration landed.

CONSUEGRA: Yes, when he stopped, he took his helmet and started hitting the window of the passenger car. Also, there was another guy hitting the other window, and there was another one hitting the back of the USV. I didn't know what was going on, and when I started seeing this, then I saw another one approaching the other door. He opened the door -- I mean, he started breaking the glass. He finally opened the door, and he grabbed the lady in front of the USV -- SUV, and he grabbed her by her arms, and he was pulling her out of the car.
While the Biden administration's first goal is to pass its nearly $2 trillion plan with bipartisan support through the regular Senate process, the odds are long for winning over enough Republicans to pass another massive stimulus bill just months after a more than $900 billion package passed the Senate in December. Already, many Republicans have signaled they think the package is too expensive or even unnecessary at this point.
However, that doesn't mean GOP senators are not under pressure. In particular, they are facing a choice on the issue of whether witnesses should be called during the trial. Democrats need four Republicans to vote in favor of subpoenas for witnesses or new evidence in order to extend the trial and gather new information. Getting that many will be difficult.
Research shows that retirees who have a wide circle of friends tend to be happier in retirement. So in the years leading up your planned exit date, you'll want to consider a variety of ways to remain socially connected, such as reconnecting with old friends, making an effort to stay in touch with colleagues from work and even cultivating a new network of friends and acquaintances, say, by volunteering at a local charity or enrolling in adult-education classes. Starting a new hobby or throwing yourself into a new project --writing a book, launching a blog, learning a new language or musical instrument, etc.-- can also help engender a sense of purpose during a lengthy retirement.
I know I can be too tough sometimes and I can push too hard, she told MSNBC earlier this month. That is obvious. But a lot of it is I have high expectations for myself and I have high expectations for people who work with me.

In addition, the legislation would bolster subsidies for lower-income enrollees, eliminating their premiums completely. And it would create subsidies for unemployed workers who are ineligible to continue their job-based coverage through COBRA.

However, Tom Steyer stood out on the stage for the wrong reasons. Addressing the camera directly was a mistake, as it made it seem as if he were ignoring the moderators, audience, and fellow candidates. Though he repeatedly touted his business experience, he did not make a strong case for himself as a presidential candidate. A billionaire talking about income inequality is a hard sell, and Steyer certainly did not close the deal.

(CNN) – Catorce millones más de estadounidenses se quedarían sin seguro médico para 2018 con el proyecto de ley de salud que impulsan los republicanos. La comparación es frente al denominado Obamacare, que sigue funcionando actualmente. Y esta cifra aumentaría a 24 millones de personas para 2026. Así lo informó este lunes la Oficina de Presupuesto del Congreso (CBO, por sus siglas en inglés), una organización que no pertenece a ningún partido.

Suburbs in the United States, often perceived as enclaves of the affluent, are home to nearly 17 million Americans who live in poverty -- more than in cities or rural areas -- and growing demand for care strains the capacity of suburban health services to provide for them, according to a recent study in Health Affairs. Suburban areas have historically received a fraction of health funding that cities have, leaving them with inadequate infrastructure and forcing people like Castaneda to scramble for the medical attention they need.

Trump touted how the strong economy has lifted people out of poverty, noting that fewer people are enrolled in food stamps.
Over the last 2 years, we have begun to fully rebuild the United States Military – with $700 billion last year and $716 billion this year. We are also getting other nations to pay their fair share. For years, the United States was being treated very unfairly by NATO – but now we have secured a $100 billion increase in defense spending from NATO allies.
One specific thing Trump has been clear on, however, is Medicaid. He has been consistent in voicing his opposition to any cuts to the program, which helps to provide coverage to low-income Americans. On the campaign trail, he often touted his promise to not touch Medicaid.
Supporters of broader gun rights want the newly solidified majority to broaden those rights. But looming over the case is the fact that after the prospect of a precedent-setting ruling became evident, New York changed the law.
No sorprende que ahora Comey esté dispuesto a declarar ante una comisión del Senado estadounidense respecto a una controversia que conlleva la posibilidad de que el presidente haya querido obstruir a la justicia, lo que para muchos es una falta que podría castigarse con la destitución. Como su partido controla el Congreso, es poco probable que lo destituyan, pero dos republicanos de la Cámara de Representantes ya han estado hablando del tema.

Meredith is best known for non-political magazines aimed at women such as Better Homes & Gardens and Family Circle. Lacy insisted to investors that he's not looking to make big changes in the editorial policies at Time or other publications. He said that while he does plan to eliminate $400 million to $500 million in costs from the combined companies, he doesn't expect to cut newsroom budgets.
A second term of Trump is more low taxation, more deregulation and an indifference about trillion-dollar deficits, said Kotok. Markets like that. Whether the country likes it, once it's fully digested, is another matter.

Not only is Trump the first president to have never served in government or the military, but he surged to the White House on far-flung campaign promises that even many in his own party dismissed as unrealistic.

So they're set at such a level that that wouldn't occur. But they're set at such a level so that really is for a middle-income family, or even an upper-middle income family -- so that we never tell a person, Don't take that raise, don't get that job, don't take that promotion. We don't want federal tax law or tax credits to ever encourage a person not to advance, not to take a job, not to get a raise. That's why.
Facts First: CNN's photojournalists at Trump's rallies do not turn off their cameras when Trump criticizes CNN. Also, no CNN light suddenly went off as Trump criticized CNN in either of these cases: CNN's photojournalists at Trump rallies have the tally lights on their cameras set permanently to off.

Coronavirus? Hurricane? Earthquake. The government should be prepared.
(Sanders) is at that age, he could have just retired and relaxed and enjoy life, but no, he's fighting for the people. And he's trying to unite us, not divide us, Chavez, a retired casino worker who lives in Las Vegas, told CNN at a Sanders rally.
Hearing of Rehnquist's death, Bush immediately decided to elevate Roberts, who had received initial praise from senators, and wait to fill the O'Connor position. At age 50, Roberts would be the youngest chief justice in more than two centuries.
D'ANTONIO: This is -- this is a collision of reality represented by the Southern District of New York and Robert Mueller and abject lying in the part of Donald Trump, but also all the people around him, and this is one of the shocking things that you alluded to at the start of this segment is that, we now have five major associates of the President of the United States, who have been found guilty or pled guilty to serious crimes.
In June, I commuted Alice's sentence – and she is here with us tonight. Alice, thank you for reminding us that we always have the power to shape our own destiny.

On January 26, Schumer, the top Senate Democrat, called on the administration to declare a public health emergency over coronavirus to free up funding.
And here's the key: You buy what you want to buy. If you don't want to use your tax credit to go buy health insurance, you don't have to. If you don't want to buy this plan, you want to buy that plan, go for it.
BORGER: But he was talking about the Republican Party I think when he said that fake culture wars distract us from the -- our economy decline.
And beyond the diplomatic implications, Trump has also had to confront the reality that China long ago stopped artificially devaluing its currency – instead working to prop it up, which benefits US exports.
Rep. Tom Rice of South Carolina was censured by the state's Republican Party late last month for his vote to impeach Trump as well.
It helped that moderator Wolf Blitzer opened the debate on the biggest question of all: Why are you best prepared — the best prepared person on this stage to be commander in chief? Joe Biden owned his disastrous 2002 vote for the Bush war in Iraq. Bernie Sanders chided him for it, but didn't draw blood, allowing Biden to deftly shift attention to his partnership with President Barack Obama. Pete Buttigieg noted that some of the enlisted troops he served with in Afghanistan are so young they cannot remember when the war began.
Is the jig up on the gig economy?
In September 2016, for instance, health inspectors faulted Lincoln Manor, a nursing home in Decatur, Illinois, for failing to monitor and treat the wound of a patient whose implanted pain-medication pump gradually slipped over eight days through a ruptured suture and protruded from her abdomen. The patient died.

Klobuchar on the ineffectiveness of Warren and Sanders
MANU RAJU, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL REPORTER: Hey Anderson, Reid and Brian Sandoval have a long and sometimes complicated history together, Reid had proposed Sandoval to a federal judgeship during the George W. Bush era.
2) In the wake of Iowa, there was a rising sentiment within the Democratic Party -- and among odds-makers -- that Sanders was the most likely nominee against Trump. While most hypothetical general election polls show Sanders leading Trump nationally, the White House -- and many non-Bernie-backing Democrats, believe that the democratic socialist senator would be the party's weakest opponent against the incumbent.
So, Rubio's claim at the debate that he never supported cap-and-trade is false. He might not support the idea now, but he helped pave the way for Florida to create a cap-and-trade system when he was a state lawmaker.
Fortunately, policymakers in America have examples of successful programs in the health care sector that have been premised on competition and choice to drive value and innovation. Two, in particular, are of special note – the Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit (Part D) and Medicare Advantage plans.
S. 1129 To establish a Medicare-for-all national health insurance program.

SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY), MINORITY LEADER: I'm pleased to get this kind of firsthand briefing of a project that I and others have been working on providing the funds for.
Now, that's an offer of help. That's an acceptance of help. There's an overt act in the Trump Tower in furtherance of that. And, of course, that's not even contemplating the discussions with George Papadopoulos or the information about the efforts that Mike Flynn made to work with the Russian ambassador secretly to undermine sanctions and then lie about that.
Trump announced his travel restrictions against China at the end of January. At Sunday's town hall, Trump claimed that a month later even Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's top infectious disease expert, said the coronavirus was going to pass, not going to be a big deal.
Trump said of Bloomberg: Michael's doing very poorly. You look at his poll numbers, he's spending a lot of money. And what can I say? He's doing poorly. I think they're all doing poorly because according to every poll, I'm leading every one of them by a lot. -- January 30 interview with Fox News' Peter Doocy
When you go to a country where they have very, very stringent — unbelievably stringent, like probably we can't do in our country — they have no drug problem. You go into China, you say, 'How's your drug problem?' They don't even know — President Xi doesn't even know what you're talking about. 'We have no drug problem.' They have quick trials. Right? Quick trials. And I won't even tell you what the punishment is, but let me just say it's very swift. -- March 3 speech to the National Association of Counties Legislative Conference
Rather than spending quality time with their patients, the providers are spending time complying with regulations that get in the way of caring for their patients and doesn't increase the quality of care they provide, Goodrich said.
So they haven't even seen yet what our secretary of HHS can do in -- in number two, in -- in -- in phase two here, where they actually can dramatically lower the price of health insurance. So those companies haven't seen that yet.
LEMON: I know that I'm right. I just didn't want to -- I just didn't -- look, I didn't want to get too heavy about performative grace, right? Taking, putting the onus on the victim to be cordial to the oppressor or the abuser. That was my bigger point. It is not incumbent upon the Obamas to be cordial to the people who have oppressed them over racism.
There are now two women accusing Lieutenant Governor Justin Fairfax of sexual assault. And late Saturday, both women announced they would be willing to testify in any impeachment hearings. Fairfax maintains the encounters were consensual and says he should be given due process.

As of February 21, 2020, eight days after Trump spoke here, the federal government's relief tracking : Puerto Rico has not gotten $93 billion in disaster relief funding under Trump, and the relief funding for Puerto Rico is not a record. As of February 21, 2020, eight days after Trump spoke here, the federal government's relief tracking website said $44.1 billion had been allocated to Puerto Rico since 2017, when Hurricane Maria and Hurricane Irma occurred, and $15.2 billion actually spent. By contrast, Congress appropriated approximately $120 billion in relief money after Hurricane Katrina in 2005, the vast majority of which went to Louisiana.

Plus day 3 of America held hostage by politics.
He's going to go to the G-20. I want to get to -- Secretary Tillerson has called -- a, there's an emergency United Nations session this afternoon. Secretary Tillerson says in a statement, global action is required to stop a global threat. Any country that hosts North Korean guest workers, provides any economic or military benefits, or fails to fully implement U.N. Security Council resolutions is aiding and abetting a dangerous regime. He goes on to say, all nations should publically demonstrate there are consequences.
If Donald Trump is a blend of George Wallace and P.T. Barnum put together, Senator Cruz is much closer to Barry Goldwater in 1964, though without the interest in legislating. The only thing that has allowed him to position himself as a safer choice for the party has been Donald Trump's success.
We've learned over the last eight years that promotions matters, said Peter Lee, the exchange's executive director. It matters in many ways on the margins, but the margins are what make the most difference.

Last month, the President once again called upon Congress to vote on his resolution.
Washington (CNN) A federal appeals court on Wednesday rejected a request to reconsider last month's ruling that declared the individual mandate of the Affordable Care Act unconstitutional.
Will he flip? Maybe. Maybe not.
SCARAMUCCI: So I want to respectfully disagree with you. A good decentralized management and leadership structure, he would turn to the members of the House and Senate who had seven-and-a-half years to come up with a plan, and he would say, OK, what's your plan. And then he would look at the plan and say OK, I now understand why this is so complicated and why we're not going to get everything done overnight just the same way you can't build a building overnight. But let's start the process, Chris, let's get the ball rolling towards a patient-centered, freer, decentralized system.
JONES: They carry the ones that weren't important and not to make him the President of the United States.
This story has been updated to include additional developments.
Given the timing of the Biden remarks, it's not unreasonable for the Trump campaign to infer that Biden was talking about the travel restrictions. But Biden never took an explicit position on the restrictions until his April declaration of support -- and whether or not you accept his campaign's argument that the xenophobia claim was not about the restrictions, he certainly hasn't apologized.
DIAZ BARRAGAN: I'm saying he has divided this country --
And I'm -- let's be real and you know this probably better than I do. I will be the 100th senator in seniority. I have a great senior senator in my state, Menendez. My first months down there, if not more, I look forward to learning as much as I can, trying to find ways to gain my knowledge base so that I can be a great senator in the long term.
Americans would be automatically enrolled for benefits at birth or when they move to the US. A subsequent section describes a Universal Medicare Card.
So I think there is important messages to be sent which is if you cooperate and you do it right and you do it fully and you do it truthfully you will get a benefit. But if you come in here and play games it's going to back fire.
Let me come to you James you're 24 years old. You signed up for ObamaCare and began chemo three weeks ago. What is your concern about what is going on right now?
It's not just that people may be reluctant to go for care because of the debt they might incur, said Mark Rukavina, a Boston-based health care consultant whose work has focused on affordability and medical debt. It might also ruin their credit. Having a medical bill in collection can substantially reduce consumers' credit scores, Rukavina said.
SCARAMUCCI: When I hear the nonsense that the president is one-sided loyalty, that's a bunch of nonsense. I've experienced it myself personally.
MARQUARDT: This week we saw a new controversial push to put guns in classrooms to try to avoid tragedies like the Parkland massacre. It's been ten months since 17 people, 14 of them children, were gunned down at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida.
Trump's claim also ignores China's hundreds of billions of dollars in purchases of US goods -- more than $300 billion during Trump's presidency alone.
On Tuesday, Trump falsely accused McCain of misleading the White House over how he would vote.
The most revealing false claim: Ethiopia and the Nobel Peace Prize
He's very committed to repealing and replacing it. Mr. Trump has been very up-front about what some of those particulars are, she said. And we also know that you have popular provisions like coverage for pre-existing conditions. We also know there are Americans relying upon it now.
About one-third of individual market enrollees said the mandate was a major reason why they chose to buy insurance, according to a new Kaiser Family Foundation poll. But nine in 10 said they intend to continue their coverage.
To ensure this corrupt dictatorship never acquires nuclear weapons, I withdrew the United States from the disastrous Iran nuclear deal. And last fall, we put in place the toughest sanctions ever imposed on a country.
It needs a jeweler to take each of those jewels one by one, starting with America its own diamond and polish. Then slowly, find seamless strength -- them all back together.
The realities of governing have hit Trump harder than most presidents.
Biden led the Vermont Senator in two January polls from Suffolk University and Fox News, with Sanders coming in second. But polling has been consistently off the mark in Nevada, not only because it's difficult to predict who will participate in a caucus, but because many casino workers work unusual hours and the state has a constantly changing population with movement in and out of the state.
And then, lastly, as to the Tea Party, keep in mind, you know, it's one slice of a broader coalition. They overplayed their hand here. One of the adages you have to keep in mind is when you negotiate, the person with the leverage wins.
When I saw Alice's beautiful family greet her at the prison gates, hugging and kissing and crying and laughing, I knew I did the right thing.
Sanders compounded that mistake by canceling a rally in Mississippi . Perhaps unknown to him is that many African Americans from my hometown of St. Louis hail from the South and have deep ties to blacks in Alabama, Mississippi, and Georgia. Sanders' actions were an affront not just to those southerners, but to blacks in Missouri.
MARQUARDT: And he's a true partisan and true supporter of the President so it's unlikely that he's going to be that middle ground, that moderating diplomat with Democrats on Capitol Hill.
So joining me now is one of the architects of Obamacare, Jonathan Gruber. Jonathan -- thanks so much for joining us this morning.
DINAN: Mr. Trump, I do want to come to you. Will you also in your answer, address how long you think that pause would be and what that pause would look like.

Biden advisers argue nothing about current economic conditions prevents Washington from spending as much as circumstances of the pandemic warrant.
MICHAEL BARONE, SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST, WASHINGTON EXAMINER: No. I'm not. I'm happy with what I'm hearing but I think in some ways, this problem was caused by James Madison and 39 other men. I'm sorry there were no women then that signed the constitution in 1787.
By the end of June, with the presidential election in high gear, the court will reach a defining moment. The chief -- the man who sits at the middle -- will likely have cast the key swing vote in some cases. The public will learn more about the jurisprudence of Trump's nominees. The liberals will have chosen a path forward -- maybe even attracting a conservative vote on one or two hot-button cases.
In the ad, Obama praised Sanders for having the virtue of saying exactly what he believes. Great authenticity, great passion, and is fearless, though a transcript of the comments shows the ad omits Obama's admission that he didn't know Sanders as well since he didn't serve in his administration.
But even as Trump is learning the lessons of governing and confronting the headwinds – diplomatic, economic and political – he faces as he tries to implement his hard-charging agenda, he is showing no signs of letting up.
My father was his kryptonite in life, he was his kryptonite in death. On a personal level, I agree with you, all of us have love and families, and when my father was alive, up until adulthood, we would spend our time together cooking, hiking, fishing, really celebrating life, and I think it's because he almost died, she said. And I just thought, 'your life is spent on the weekend not with your family, not with your friends, but you're obsessing, obsessing over great men you could never live up to.' That tells you everything you need to know about his pathetic life right now.

The December 2019 unemployment rate for the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre/Hazleton area was 5.6% -- worse than various rates under Clinton and Bush and also worse than the rate in Obama's last full month in office, 5.4% in December 2016. It hit 4.0% in April 2019, which was the lowest for the area since at least 1990.)
TAPPER: Right. Let's talk about that. President Obama today said that he is ready to move on to some real issues. Let's play some of that sound.

I am running because I see that sense of community is getting fractured, Klobuchar said on Sunday in Iowa. It's getting fractured by someone in the White House who gets up every morning and tweets whatever he wants but doesn't respect the amendment that allows him to do it.
President Donald Trump complained Wednesday that he didn't receive a thank you for approving the funeral the late Sen. John McCain wanted, marking his latest grievance in his recent onslaught against the Arizona Republican.
As to whether there will be a battle over his confirmation, well, if you thought the bipartisan slap fight in Washington might finally be over, then you obviously didn't hear the president say this today.

The coronavirus crisis reveals how stupid and self-defeating, hyperpartisan politics is when it comes to actually governing. If ever there was a time for nonideological problem solving and empathetic leadership, this is it. But we're in a crisis, stuck with the president we've got — and the costs will soon be clear to all of us.
First, here's what President Obama said about Cuba in March 2016.
Certainly I think the new administration would give the waiver a friendly reception, said Joan Alker, executive director of the Center for Children and Families at Georgetown University. But again that doesn't answer the question about whether the money is going away, if Congress repeals the health law and the Medicaid expansion.
I don't pretend to agree with every plank in our party's platform, but fake culture wars only distract us from our economic decline, and nobody in this race is being honest about it except Donald Trump.

Last year, McCain died of brain cancer, and as part of his services, lay in state in the Capitol building in Washington.
Washington (CNN) The Supreme Court's announcement on Monday that it would livestream oral arguments in 10 cases next month, including three centered on President Donald Trump's financial records, is a historic breakthrough in public access to America's highest court.
Meanwhile, the super PAC backing Jeb Bush, who has tried to position himself as an experienced alternative to Trump, called the real-estate mogul reckless and impulsive in a 30-second spot last month. But Bush's efforts have had little effect, leading Trump to taunt him last week by saying he wasted $40 million.
The US currently boasts more coronavirus cases and deaths than any other country.
This is a smart, strategic, see-through steel barrier – not just a simple concrete wall. It will be deployed in the areas identified by border agents as having the greatest need, and as these agents will tell you, where walls go up, illegal crossings go way down.
In 2017, the year before the trade war began, China spent $19.5 billion. In 2016, it was $21.4 billion. Chinese purchases plummeted to $9.1 billion in 2018.

What Mini Mike is doing is nothing less than a large scale illegal campaign contribution.

SANDERS: Look, like I just said a few minutes ago, the big priorities here, which we've laid out -- I think this is the third or fourth time I've done it just today -- is to stop the nuclear program, stop the missiles, stop the aggression. That's what we're focused on, in regards to North Korea, and we're going to continue pushing on that, continue working with our allies and partners to accomplish that...
Trump added Wednesday that veterans were on his side during the dispute, because McCain didn't get the job done with the Veterans Administration.
Sanders will have to contend with the powerful Culinary Union, which fought for and negotiated excellent health benefits, because of its opposition to Medicare for All. The organization says it represents 60,000 hotel and casino workers in Nevada and provides health insurance coverage for more than 130,000 people. It is unclear how much the union's opposition to Medicare for All will hurt Sanders, as the union decided to not endorse any 2020 candidate before the caucuses.

Critics have ranged from conservative Republicans to insurers to the AARP. Conservatives complain that the bill does not fully repeal Obamacare and that many provisions are too similar to the health reform law. Insurers worry that Republicans would cut federal support for Medicaid and tax credits, leaving many of their customers without coverage. And the AARP fears that Americans in their 50s and early 60s would see their premiums skyrocket and federal assistance reduced, though lawmakers are now promising to provide this group extra assistance.
Earlier Friday, Trump questioned the sincerity of Cruz's faith, accusing his opponent of being so dishonest.
Our regulatory, administrative superstate, however, has replaced the sovereignty of the American people with the sovereignty of unelected and unaccountable Washington bureaucrats. While the American people can replace the members of Congress, they cannot replace the unelected bureaucrats who have promulgated 600 major rules over the last seven years that will have an estimated cost of billions to implement. Those rules are among the man-made headwinds that are strangling economic growth, keeping wages stagnant and forcing jobs overseas.
Of the people who have selected Obamacare plans for 2018, about 346,000 were new to the exchanges while 1.1. million were renewing their coverage.
Plus, rather than act as a deterrent, the filibustering senators may see it as politically advantageous to make a show of their opposition to a bill. So, the process would change, but the result -- legislation getting bogged down in the Senate with no end in sight -- may not.
Since the Affordable Care Act passed, there hasn't been much new activity at the state level on these laws, but that could change.
If he's so good and you preach bipartisanship, why not endorse him? He's already up 24 points in the polls. He's going to win anyway, probably.
Baker Hughes will release its oil rig count report at 1 p.m.
We have a chance of killing Obamacare. We almost did it but somebody unfortunately surprised us with thumbs down, but we'll do it a different way. You know what? We'll do it a different way, Trump told his supporters at a rally in Grand Rapids, Michigan on Thursday night. So we're going to get rid of Obamacare and I said it the other day: The Republican Party will become the party of great health care. It's good. It's important.
My Administration has undertaken an unprecedented effort to secure the southern border of the United States.
Biden has to give McConnell some chance to see if he's going to play ball, but I think there's a time limit with that. I don't think that Biden has the luxury of waiting forever. I think three months, four months at the most, said former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, who worked closely with both Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, and Biden during his time in the Senate. There's going to come a time that the filibuster is going to have to go. It's not a question of if, it's a question of when it's going to go.
He also gave a rousing speech outlining the judicial philosophy he shares with his mentor.
But Trump and his White House did not come to learn the limitations of his presidency and the realities of governing until after the bruising first weeks of his presidency.
MARQUARDT: Right. That was the defense recommendation. That was Mueller's recommendation. It was a done deal.
Listen, we have to talk about some serious stuff here.
So on the issue of flooding in Miami, it's caused by two things. Number one, south Florida is largely built on land that was once a swamp. And number two, because if there is higher sea levels or whatever it may be happening, we do need to deal with that through mitigation.
The notion that we're somehow going to have a negotiated deal with the Taliban, that we can take their word that they won't allow al Qaeda to have safe havens again, is, in my view, irresponsible.
And why are Hillary Clinton's surrogates calling out young women for not supporting her? We have the Clinton campaign as well. They will explain.
Joining us now on the phone is the governor of Puerto Rico, Ricardo Rossello. Governor, thank you very much for taking the time to talk to us. I understand that they're -- the death toll is rising in Puerto Rico. Can you give us the latest numbers?

Bernie said he'll never do a deportation. Right? Remember what he said? I better save this stuff. Maybe he won't get the nomination. -- February 29 speech at Conservative Political Action Conference
All that stuff has to be agreed to now. We don't want to get sued after the deal is made. So I don't agree with President Obama, I do agree something should be - should take place. After 50 years, it's enough time, folks. But we have to make a good deal and we have to get rid of all the litigation that's going to happen.
Providing a detailed financing plan for Medicare for All may have contributed to the decline of Warren's popularity. Her poll numbers took a nose dive after she laid out a proposal in November that called for states, employers, corporations and the wealthy to pay for the single-payer system, which she also supports.
The populist part of Trump's presidency, as it turned out, has been more evident in his culture warrior tweeting than any meaningful policy initiatives. Not quite the stuff that feeds and sustains a multi-generational movement.
I received calls from the President of Mexico and the Prime Minister of Canada asking to renegotiate NAFTA rather than terminate, Trump tweeted Thursday morning. I agreed subject to the fact that if we do not reach a fair deal for all, we will then terminate NAFTA.
– This explains how we got here in the country.
Facts First: Trump was exaggerating. The : Trump was exaggerating. The Consumer Price Index for prescription drugs showed a 0.6% decline between December 2017 and December 2018, which was the first calendar-year decline since 1972 -- the first decline in 46 years, not the first one in more than 50 years. (As the Washington Post pointed out in its own fact check, some experts say the Consumer Price Index is a flawed measure of trends in drug prices, since it doesn't include rebates that drug companies pay to insurers. The IQVIA Institute for Human Data Science, which studies drug prices, found that net drug prices in the United States increased at an estimated 1.5% in 2018.
President Donald Trump's budget takes this art form to another level – really, to another universe. Some of the issues and questions stem from the surprise budget resolution last week in Congress, which delivered more money but – so far – no clear plan for precisely how it would be spent.
John McCain was tortured for more than five years in Vietnam and survived for more than a year after being diagnosed with brain cancer in 2017.
The guidance would like encourage states to undermine coverage, said Aviva Aron-Dine, vice president for health policy at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.
I know he says that I called John McCain all sorts of names. I call everybody names. Actually, the person I called the names is Jeb because Jeb isn't in favor of common core. In other words, your children have to be taken care of from Washington. He's weak on immigration. I mean, just look at these things. Remember, he said -- it was on your show, I saw it. They come as an act of love, immigration, on -- you remember the thing on -- let's see, I just wrote down one other thing here. The Texas stadium, when he talks about the taking of land. Well, they used -- the Bush family used the taking of land privately, eminent domain, on Texas stadium. So, you look at this guy and this stuff, it's absolutely amazing.
President Donald Trump complained Wednesday that he didn't receive a thank you for approving the funeral the late Sen. John McCain wanted, marking his latest grievance in his recent onslaught against the Arizona Republican.

As the number of cases kept climbing, the virus continued to drive uncertainty in the stock market, which fell steeply following the start of an oil price war. Trump flailed desperately on Twitter, and his Health and Human Services Secretary, of all people, raved in support of his boss that the economic fundamentals are  unbelievable .
That puts the onus on House leaders, who have to find a way to convince both defense hawks and fiscal conservatives to go along with a short-term spending deal one more time. Republican leaders are expected to formally whip the proposal Wednesday, but the House Freedom Caucus' comments Tuesday cast doubt on the operation, after even some prominent conservatives seemed to be leaning toward supporting the continuing resolution Tuesday before the caucus met.
TUCHMAN: There are registered Republicans on the Texas border who don't much like Trump. Steven Brewer likes the immigration stance of Ben Carson whom he will vote for Tuesday.
There were beautiful moments in Tuesday's first Democratic debate of 2020. Bernie Sanders shined a light on America's moral failures. Joe Biden talked about restoring the soul of the nation. Pete Buttigieg told powerful stories about troops deploying for combat. And Amy Klobuchar put a human face on job losses from decades of failed, top-down economic policy.
The realities of governing have hit Trump harder than most presidents.
Last year, McCain died of brain cancer, and as part of his services, lay in state in the Capitol building in Washington.
The bill would repeal Obamacare's individual mandate, drastically cut back federal support of Medicaid, and eliminate Obamacare's taxes on the wealthy, insurers and others – which would be one promise kept.
The Kasich campaign and his super PAC, New Day for America, stepped up their attacks against Trump, releasing a TV spot last month mocking Trump's days peddling a name-brand steak line. In November, the group released a spot effectively comparing Trump to Hitler and the Nazis, and the PAC is spending $2.5 million in attack ads against the real estate mogul in New Hampshire.
Another interruption, this time from a protestor who began yelling while Trump spoke about protecting the Second Amendment. He was ejected from the House chamber.
In Trump's fiscal year 2019 budget plan, released Monday, numbers typically highlighted upfront are shuffled or stuffed away into back sections. The changes from Friday's bargain in Congress were baked in as an afterthought to the core document, creating even steeper, more implausible cuts. Many of the underlying economic assumptions arrive at odds with past Congressional Budget Office reports and the analysis of nonpartisan outsiders.
But let me go back for a moment. The policy Donald has outlined, I don't know if he realizes, is an anti-Israeli policy. Maybe that's not your intent but here's why it is an anti-Israeli policy. There is no peace deal possible with the Palestinians at this moment. There just isn't.
Almost 3 in 5 Iowa Democratic caucusgoers supported replacing private health insurance with a government plan, with the rest opposing it.
While it is fitting to talk about who we are, today it's even more important to remember where we came from. For me, that is Cleveland and the bright future it promised.
When President Obama came out last night before the House vote had finished, there were a lot of House Republicans who were very worried that he just was misreading House Republicans all over again.
The most revealing false claim: Military planes
After being sworn in, Walker, who had removed the face mask he was wearing, delivered a brief opening statement thanking McConnell and Paul for their support as well as members of his family and President Donald Trump for the nomination.
In front of factory workers at the Ohio plant on Wednesday, Trump dedicated a considerable amount of time in his speech to disparaging McCain.
The most egregious false claim: The availability of coronavirus tests
ANNOUNCER: This is NEW DAY with Chris Cuomo and Alisyn Camerota.
In recent years senators used the filibuster so much that the expectation is that most legislation will need 60 votes to pass, rather than a simple majority of 51 out of 100 senators.
TAPPER: Other additions to the bill to reopen the government include $175,000 which will be paid to the widow of Senator Frank Lautenberg, who died last year. Such a payment is standard practice, but it might be worth noting Lautenberg was one of the wealthiest members of Congress. Roll Call reported he was worth more than $50 million in 2011.
At different times throughout the 2016 campaign, Trump said he was going to bring back coal and put the miners back to work.
A Klobuchar aide told CNN on Monday that the senator prepared for the town hall like she would for a major interview.
The courtroom is a very special place, Chief Justice John Roberts has asserted. Maybe part of what makes it special is that you don't see it on television.
Data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows that 474,993 people died because of a firearm injury between 2005 and 2018, the latest data available. That it includes intentional and unintentional deaths.
Senators talk on the floor of the US Senate before the vote on the skinny repeal on July 28.
Speaking at CPAC, Trump referenced the Arizona Republican's July vote against a skinny repeal of the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare.
Ameridose does drug manufacturing, which is regulated by the FDA, but they also do add mixing, that's a form of compounding and that's regulated by the State Pharmacy Board.
So when I came in, as you know, NATO was virtually a dead organization. It had no money. Nobody was paying except us. Practically nobody was paying. -- January 10 interview with Fox News' Laura Ingraham
I just spoke to the sheriff moments ago, and he tells me that they are still processing the scene. If you look closely behind me, you'll see some crime scene tape is still up. Again, they're still processing. They have to interview between 150 and 200 people to try to figure out what the motive is.

Sanders responded to Trump's claim with his own tweet : Let's be clear about who is rigging what: it is Donald Trump's action to use the power of the federal government for his own political benefit that is the cause of the impeachment trial. Democrats are going to unite to sweep him out of the White House in November.
Robin Mead had a brain tumor, but no health insurance. And when doctors discovered it, she was defiant.
I think it's stupid. I'm being very declarative here. I think it's stupid, Scaramucci, whose short-lived tenure as White House communications director imploded due to his combative personality, said later. There's no strategy that you can tell – other than the fact that you're frustrated and you want to ventilate your frustrations into the international airwaves. OK. But I think it's stupid.
The good news is more Americans say they will get the vaccine than ever before. A new Axios/Ipsos poll finds that 63% of adults say they have had or are likely to get a Covid-19 vaccination as soon as it's made available to them. That's the highest ever recorded by Ipsos.
And while he has continued to decry the US trade deficit with China and recently tied widespread loss of manufacturing jobs to the Asian powerhouse, Trump has confronted the reality of the US's complicated and delicate relationship with China in the last month as he's sought to enlist China in efforts to tame an increasingly belligerent North Korea.
MIAMI GARDENS, FLORIDA - MAY 06: Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis speaks during a press conference at the Hard Rock Stadium testing site on May 06, 2020 in Miami Gardens, Florida. Gov. DeSantis announced during the press conference that a COVID-19 antibodies test will be available. The test can show if a person has had the virus in the past without showing symptoms, and therefore may be immune to it. The test will be available to first responders and health care workers first, with the goal of being able to expand testing to the general public. (Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)
In November, the Trump administration exempted nursing homes that violate eight new safety rules from penalties for 18 months. Homes must still follow the rules, which are intended, among other things, to reduce the overuse of psychotropic drugs and to ensure that every home has adequate resources to assist residents with major psychological problems.

Facts First: Biden did make a gaffe -- but Trump was inaccurately describing what Biden inaccurately said. Biden : Biden did make a gaffe -- but Trump was inaccurately describing what Biden inaccurately said. Biden said at the Democratic debate in Charleston, South Carolina, that 150 million people had been killed by guns since 2007, not that this many people had been killed last year. (Biden's campaign said he had meant to say 150,000, which is roughly accurate.)
Facts First: Military spending by NATO members had increased for two years prior to Trump's presidency. According to the latest NATO : Military spending by NATO members had increased for two years prior to Trump's presidency. According to the latest NATO figures released in November, spending increased by 1.7% in 2015 and 3.0% in 2016.

Reality Check: Bush on authorization of force against ISIS
LEMON: As I said, the Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen is going to be traveling to the border in El Paso tomorrow. What is she going to see when she gets down there?
The best way to do that is to create a detailed retirement budget. There are a number of free online interactive budgeting tools out there, but I like BlackRock's Retirement Expense Worksheet because it easily allows you to enter some 50 different expenses in eight broad categories. The worksheet also separates essential living expenses (housing, food, etc.) from discretionary ones (travel, entertainment, hobbies) so you can easily see how much room you'll have to cut expenses if necessary in the future without eliminating necessary expenditures.
RAJU: Well, not very well Anderson. Leading the party lunch today, I talked to a number of Republican Senators. And up and down they're saying they will refuse to consider a nominee no matter who it is. They think it let should be left to the next president and as Deb Fisher, a Republican of Nebraska told me, it's not about the person, she said.
Sen. Rand Paul claimed the President-elect supports the Kentucky Republican's calls to approve an Obamacare replacement on the same day Congress repeals the health care law.
But what we're talking about is something that's very practical. Where it's necessary, where it's needed, where our Border Patrol agents say that it will help us control and stop the flood of illegal immigrants across the border, we need to have a border wall.
They're going to have to pull her, one senior Democratic senator told CNN's Manu Raju. Tanden's thin hopes late Monday probably relied on Murkowski, who has yet to say how she will vote.
Unlike other types of debt, people with medical debt were prevalent across a range of income levels, credit scores and ages. The survey sample was drawn from the CFPB's consumer credit panel, a random sample of credit records from one of the three major credit reporting agencies.
Speaking of your former boss, you're now our CNN political commentator, former Clinton campaign manager. Listening to it and talking to David, I mean, she can point out, you know, Russia and the Clintons and talk about Democrats all she wants, but that's not what's being investigated right now. David says it's a sin of omission. How do you see it?
The long process of passing Obamacare allowed Republicans to marshal opposition and positioned them to use the law -- which was still mostly an abstraction after its passage in early 2010 -- as a cudgel during that year's midterm elections, when Democrats got shellacked, as Obama then put it. A similar delay, Sebelius added, threatened to hamstring Democratic efforts to keep, or potentially expand, their congressional majorities in the 2022 election.
It's probably going to be struck down. What will happen in the Supreme Court will be interesting. It will be interesting to see whether conservatives on that court, you know, look at the constitution and say Article I says that Congress has the right to appropriate money and he's been turned down on this.
In 2012, Bloomberg supported Brown over Warren, saying on his radio program as mayor he supported Brown because of Brown's stance against requiring states to recognize concealed carry laws from other states.
SCARAMUCCI: And again, I mean this with all due respect because you're obviously wicked smart.
'Those at the top are not doing their part:' WH looks to raise taxes on wealthy
Earlier this week, the Utah legislature passed a measure that would restrict the state's ability to accept Medicaid expansion money from the federal government under the Affordable Care Act – a move that essentially undid a ballot initiative – Proposition 3 – approved by voters last November.
Now, the one silver lining of Obama abusing executive power is that everything done with executive power can be undone with executive power, and I intend to do that.
That is, your adjusted gross income is automatically reduced by $6,300 if you're single, or by $12,600 if you're married filing jointly. So it removes that amount from your federal taxable income.

Facts First: This is true. Bloomberg supported Republican Pennsylvania Sen. Pat Toomey's re-election in 2016. He supported Scott Brown in his losing effort against Warren in 2012. In 2014, Bloomberg gave money to a super-PAC supporting Lindsey Graham.
But he -- he really -- we can't have a choke artist. You know, one thing I've learned from sports, I was actually a very good athlete. When you're a choker, you're always a choker. We can't have that. We can't take any chances in this country.
Tax reform is also going to take time – and is not therefore the kind of issue that is likely to produce a quick win to turn around a White House rough patch.
Will she flip? We shall see. Her frustrations with the impeachment process are already clear.
Immigration was the most frequent subject of Trump's false claims, with 10, followed by the economy and Democrats at six each. He made five false claims apiece about the Mueller investigation, health care and impeachment.
But even as Trump is learning the lessons of governing and confronting the headwinds – diplomatic, economic and political – he faces as he tries to implement his hard-charging agenda, he is showing no signs of letting up.
Never in American history has the Senate met the threshold to remove a president from office.
Next week is the inauguration of Trump, and with so much to do with so little time before the new administration takes over, it's going to be another long week. And we all know that sequels to horror movies are always so much better than their predecessors. Right?
Klobuchar's electability in Minnesota, which has largely come by taking more politically moderate positions, has some Democrats questioning whether the senator will be able to capture the imagination of a party that has drifted to the left nationally.
Mike Huckabee and Rick Santorum are hoping that strong showings in Iowa – where they won the 2008 and 2012 caucuses, respectively – will help sustain their campaigns.
The current package includes $1,400-per-person relief checks -- a residual effect of former President Donald Trump's scorn for Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell last December. After McConnell shepherded through a $900 billion relief proposal providing $600 per person, Trump said the checks should have been $2,000. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, then-President-elect Biden and the candidates in two crucial Georgia Senate runoffs swiftly embraced Trump's idea -- fattening the cost of the current bill, which will top recipients up to that $2,000 level, by hundreds of billions.
The town hall format is familiar for Klobuchar, who has found success in her home state – which almost went for President Donald Trump in 2016 – by consciously visiting each of Minnesota's 87 counties, often to hold town-hall style events.
Trump said Vindman, the top Ukraine expert on the National Security Council before he was ousted earlier this month, ran and said he didn't like the call. First of all, that's very insubordinate. Why wouldn't he go to his, his immediate -- you know, he went to Congress or he went to Schiff or he went to somebody. -- February 13 radio interview with Geraldo Rivera
Editor's Note: Watch CNN's town hall with Sen. Amy Klobuchar hosted by Don Lemon at St. Anselm College in Manchester, New Hampshire, Monday at 10 p.m. ET on CNN.
CUOMO: We have the CBO score. And I'm just saying what came out of the house that they're working off of right now was called mean by this president, and with good reason based on the CBO. The facts matter.

I believed Roberts would be a natural leader, Bush later wrote. I didn't worry about him drifting away from his principles over time. Roberts' famed metaphor of judge-as-umpire, merely calling balls and strikes, also resonated with Bush.
SEC. 203. EXCLUSIONS AND LIMITATIONS. (a) IN GENERAL.—Benefits for services are not available under this Act unless the services meet the standards specified in section 201(a), as defined by the Secretary.

From page 14
CNN previously reported that the senator, who had been held as a prisoner of war in Vietnam, did not want the President at his funeral. McCain's daughter, Meghan McCain, also revealed earlier this year that she wished Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner, Trump's daughter and son-in-law and senior advisers, had not attended the funeral.
During his Senate confirmation hearing, Roberts skillfully parried questions and was confirmed 78-22. Tapes of his hearings have since been circulated among judicial nominees as a model. With a smooth manner and a dry wit, Robert expressed general principles, avoiding any legal stand.
Top Donald Trump aide Kellyanne Conway – who is set to become a senior White House adviser – wouldn't commit to a time line for replacing Obamacare, despite a claim by a top Republican senator about Trump's position.
He's hitting something that is socially unnatural. And so what is that? You're attacking somebody that died seven months ago, Scaramucci told CNN's John Berman on New Day. Now, I understand the point and I understand the grievance that the President's bringing up, but you're not scoring any points with anybody.
Facts First: Warren has the facts right. She and Klobuchar are undefeated, and their male opponents have lost a total of 10 elections during their political careers. But Warren's talking point ignores the fact that Sanders, Biden and Buttigieg have also prevailed in more than two dozen elections since 1970.
The Trump administration has signaled that it will allow states to impose work requirements on working-age, non-disabled adults. The Obama administration repeatedly rejected states' requests to do so, saying it wasn't consistent with Medicaid's purpose to provide access to medical care.
Klobuchar, who announced her presidential campaign during a snowy outdoor event in Minneapolis earlier this month, is the third potential presidential hopeful to appear at a CNN town hall. Sen. Kamala Harris appeared at an event hosted by Jake Tapper and former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz, who is considering an independent bid for the presidency, headlined a town hall hosted by Poppy Harlow.
I have a 10-year-old and 7-year-old. Global warming is an existential threat to the planet. And so if we don't command this country to think big about saving our nation and our world from destruction, then I don't think we're going to get close to meeting the mark.
Political prognosticators, White House aides and even Trump's outgoing predecessor would weigh in with a mix of predictions, promises and old truisms, the kinds of assessments that greet every new president. But Trump quickly made clear, through words and deeds, that the old standards no longer applied.
Throughout the negotiations, the caucus' chairman, Mark Meadows, said he was trying to get to yes and bring his members along. But in the end, the North Carolina Republican couldn't deliver the votes even after it appeared there might be a breakthrough Wednesday.
In the most fiery and contentious Democratic primary debate yet , Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren led a non-stop barrage against the former New York City mayor who was appearing on stage for the first time. She kicked it off by calling him an arrogant billionaire who calls women fat broads and horse faced lesbians.
Just ahead you may not recognize this man. Not a household name, at least it's not nationwide. His name is being floated as a potential nominee for the Supreme Court Justice. And he's a Republican.
In this case, Congress passed a law called the National Emergencies Act which gives the president broad authority to do it. This is not a constitutional issue. This is unlike what Obama did. Obama was blatant and unconstitutional.
In the last 24 hours we've sensed a real shift from Republicans not believing Democrats are going to be resolute, to, 'Oh my god, Democrats are resolute and Republicans are joining in and we won't be able to pass the CR without negotiation,' Frank Sharry, an immigration advocate and founder of America's Voice Education Fund, told CNN's Tal Kopan on Thursday.

Tanden then forwarded the exchange to Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta, but the emails do not show any kind of deal. Bloomberg's campaign did not respond this week to a request for comment; Tanden told CNN this week: There was absolutely no deal. Period. It was a random email from me to a good friend, who works for him.
Even if a progressive wins the White House and the Senate turns blue, there will be enough moderates to bottle up the most aggressive policy changes, Cowen analyst Jaret Seiberg wrote in a note to clients Monday.
this. Here is what it speaks to in what I truly believe is a generational defining moment for this nation. Our tax code is so broken, that it undermines the very thing that makes our nation exceptional in the first place. It punishes hard work and discouraging our entrepreneurial spirit, limits our own people. When Americans see good jobs go away, when Americans wake up and see companies going away, they wonder if we have lost something bigger.
On Friday night, President Obama signed the Sexual Assault Survivors' Rights Act. By contrast Trump spent the next 72 hours defending locker room talk and rape culture. Expect the narrative and evidence of Trump being harmful to women to dominate this coming week.
Once that is presented, Pence will ask each chamber to go and deliberate separately. Then the real fight begins.
And a top Trump adviser called President Obama imperial for trying to get around the will of Congress, but what about now that President Trump is doing the same thing?
Tanden said she has never even heard any discussions about McAuliffe as Secretary of State, like ever. At CNN's request, Chris Bolling, executive director of McAuliffe political action committee Common Good VA, put Trump's claim to McAuliffe, then quickly called back laughing. He said McAuliffe had said, I would love to be Secretary of State, but I had no deal to be Secretary of Sate.
Biden first won the 1972 election to be senator from Delaware and was repeatedly re-elected to serve in that position by considerable margins until he became vice president in 2009. During that time, Delaware's sole congressional district was held by Republicans from 1973 to 1983, and from 1993 to 2011.
Unlike Trump, Whitmer also touched on impeachment.
I believe it's just a ploy, to me, to use President Barack Obama -- his legacy and his history -- to try and win votes, said Hughes, who intends to vote for Biden. It's not a good thing at all to do, because we can see right through it.
Reality Check: Bush says you can buy his book for $2.99 on Amazon
Though it is exceptional, America's health care system is not perfect. But its shortcomings are not a function of too much choice and competition but, perhaps, of too little. Obamacare's premise was that more money and more federal government involvement could address whatever problems our health care system has. This approach has largely been unsuccessful at dealing with rising health costs.
Proponents of the bill say it would save the individual health market from collapse. The legislation would create a patient-centered health care system that provides Americans more choice, greater control and lower costs, they argue.

We focused on funding those barriers that resemble the designs that are currently deployed. So that's what we ought to do. There's no nation in the world that doesn't protect its borders. I reject the idea that we should take down walls.
I would be remiss if I did not mention a former president who was counted out and dismissed because he only had a short stint in the Senate on his side — and minimal management history — but his dramatic success shows that sometimes titles and lines on a resume are not the most predictive metric. Former President Barack Obama changed the calculation of what it means to be day-one ready, and a Vice President Abrams would do just the same. Abrams may not look like the traditional candidate, but to accomplish what she has in the South and across the country, she had to buck tradition.
I would also note practically, that the Affordable Care Act right now is 10 points more popular than the president of the United States, the Minnesota Democrat said at CNN's debate on Tuesday night.

Paul Ryan Explains Health Care Bill; Ryan Defends Health Care Bill. Aired 12-12:30p ET
QUESTION: On health care, you said earlier that (inaudible) keeping the president's agenda from (inaudible) Congress and their votes. The president has said he wants to see health care done before anything else and yet, that's not the message we've seen from the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, in the last few days.
You know, and I am not sure what it is here. And by the way, I don't -- I am not one who thinks that Robert Mueller is close to finishing his work.
I think I've got to understand it better. And I would rather tell you with great truth that I'm not up to speed on the issue rather than make something up.
Just when you thought it was safe ...
Drug companies are going to fight this with all their might (and they have a lot of money). Instead of setting a price in the market for a drug, they'd have fewer people to negotiate with and may have to accept what the government gives them. It's no coincidence that Americans pay a lot more for the same prescription drugs than people in countries with single-payer systems. So, yes, this would remove some of the profit motive of the pharmaceutical industry. On the other hand, it's not at all an agreed-upon fact that drug companies should be able to charge exorbitant prices for lifesaving drugs.
But Biden and fellow Democrats don't intend them to be temporary. Nor did President Donald Trump intend his 2017 personal income tax cuts to expire after 10 years. To conform with the budget rules that apply to Biden's Covid relief package now, those tax cuts are set to expire after a decade to avoid an impermissible increase in budget deficits.
Facts First: While the European Union does have non-tariff barriers that make it costly or difficult for US businesses to export products there -- you can read : While the European Union does have non-tariff barriers that make it costly or difficult for US businesses to export products there -- you can read here , for example, about some of the requirements the EU imposes on pork products -- it is a major exaggeration to say EU countries simply don't take US farm products, cars or medical devices.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) CORKER: I have zero question in my mind that the crown prince, MBS, ordered the killing, monitored the killing, knew exactly what was happening, planned it in advance. If he was in front of a jury, he would be convicted in 30 minutes.
But in addition to the many similarities, there's a lot that's not in the '99 video clip, including that Trump was talking about running on the Reform Party ticket, not the Republican one. There also was no talk of immigration, which was arguably his top issue in 2016.
TAPPER: The money will continue to pay for this massive Army Corps of Engineers project on the Ohio River along Kentucky's border. The Senate Conservatives Fund, a political action committee, dubbed it the Kentucky kickback, blaming the addition on Kentucky's own Senate minority leader, Mitch McConnell.
BASH: Senator Rubio, you argue Americans your age must have an honest conversation about making Social Security sustainable.

One of those senators is Joe Manchin, a moderate Democrat from West Virginia. He has recently expressed doubts over providing $2,000 in stimulus payments, preferring a more targeted approach.
The Trump administration also separated thousands of families at the US-Mexico border under the controversial zero-tolerance policy and built hundreds of new barriers on the border. Refugee admissions to the US plummeted. And in a pair of White House immigration moves this past spring, the administration suspended much of family-based immigration and a number of guest worker visas through the end of the year, with some exceptions, citing high unemployment caused by the coronavirus pandemic.
And CNN's Dan Merica reports that Pennsylvania's state GOP is planning to meet to discuss what to do about Sen. Pat Toomey, who also voted to convict and who is not seeking reelection in 2022. County parties have already censured him.
Thursday's notice comes four months after Tennessee unveiled a plan to shift most of its Medicaid program into a block grant-type model. The state, which did not expand Medicaid, is seeking to exclude certain costly expenses from the block grant and to allow federal funding to increase if enrollment rises.
But the other is, as you said, to convince everybody here who is undecided, and there's still a lot of undecided voters that we're talking to, that he is the best alternative in the so-called establishment or mainstream Republican lane.

REP. NANCY PELOSI, (D-CA), HOUSE MINORITY LEADER: -- on 86 million middle class families and they have tried to present the delusion that it's a middle-class tax cut. Is there justice in the bill that has a breathtaking 83 percent of its benefits to the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans? Eight-three percent of its benefits to the top 1 percent. Is there justice in a bill that explodes the national debt to give the wealthy and well connected a break and sticks the debt with our children? Is that justice? I didn't think you thought so. I wish our Republican colleagues would join us. This GOP tax scam is simply theft. Monumental brazen theft from the American middle class and from every person who aspires to reach it. The GOP tax scam is not a vote for jobs. It is to install a nation. It does violence to our founders and disrespects our men and women in uniform who are a big part of our middle class. It betrays the future and betrays the aspirations of our children. It demands, it morally demands a no vote from every member of this House of the people.
Schumer's challenge mirrors the one Minority Leader Mitch McConnell had in 2017. While Senate Republicans quickly passed a budget resolution that gave the committees instructions to repeal and replace Obamacare, McConnell never could get his members on the same page for a bill that could actually pass.
So my suggestion is, I think one of the reasons the president has been able to move so far to the right is that there is no primary opposition to him, and I think it would do this country a good deal of service if people started thinking about candidates out there to begin contrasting what is a progressive agenda as opposed to what Obama is doing, Sanders said on the Thom Hartmann Show in July 2011.
While there is undoubtedly value in seeing a beloved celebrity handle mental health issues as judiciously as Britney Spears has in recent weeks, the real lesson we should take is that against all sense and justice, mental health care in America remains for too many (and even more if the Trump administration has its way on healthcare policy) the domain of the privileged. Until that is addressed, for many, urges to seek help will remain a hollow echo.
Bank stocks rallied early Wednesday as well, after Trump reiterated plans Tuesday to try to undo parts of the Dodd-Frank financial reform law.
The federal Obamacare exchange, healthcare.gov, reopened Monday for a special enrollment period that runs until May 15. Most states that operate their own marketplaces are also doing the same or are extending their sign-up season for several more weeks.

Sen. Elizabeth Warren observed that she sits on the Senate Armed Services Committee and that American generals had repeatedly come before the committee to assert that the United States had turned a corner in Afghanistan. Warren wryly observed that in Afghanistan, we have turned a corner so often we are turning in circles.
Trump has consistently exaggerated manufacturing job growth -- and as the actual number of jobs created has continued to grow, he has continually increased the inaccurate figure he uses. When the actual number was around 350,000, he said it was almost 500,000. When it was just over 400,000, he said it was 600,000.
House Republicans have finally passed a bill to repeal and replace Obamacare.

LEMON: Wait, wait, wait. Before you go on, why would you for an office, for something that is inanimate, why for an office for a person who has denigrated the office invited someone in who said the M.F. the person who's done the same -- the things about. You know, this president, another president who was accused of having an affair in the office? Why do we put so much, you know, clout into, everyone has held this office to a certain standard? No.
If Trump resists these measures, those around him who can still seek to persuade him can explain that after enacting these policies, when this is all over, Trump can claim it was his brilliance that made it stop.
Clinton also had sharp words on the situation in Syria, where a chemical attack – believed to be perpetrated by Bashar al-Assad – killed more than 70 people earlier this week.

SCARAMUCCI: The way the founders put the system together, you have a lot of disruptive activity inside the system.
Facts First: Trump did not win any House of Representatives vote related to impeachment, let alone win 197 to nothing or 196 to nothing. In fact, he had decisively lost a key process vote and then the two votes to actually impeach him. He appeared to be referring to the fact that no Republican voted against him on these three occasions, but he wasn't clear at all that this is what he meant.

For example, Biden calls for restoring refugee admissions in line with our historic practice under both Democratic and Republican Administrations; his website says , He will set the annual global refugee admissions cap to 125,000, and seek to raise it over time commensurate with our responsibility, our values, and the unprecedented global need.

CARPER: Believe it or not, this is one -- it's up to the people in Alabama to make the decision of who they're going to choose like it is in Delaware and other places. But on matter of sexual harassment, whether it's Alabama or whether it's state fair or whether it's Capitol Hill, whether it's Hollywood, sexual harassment has no place.
CARY: Well, I think that the lobbyist and corporations have always been a part of the political process regarding important issues. And I think this is an example of how the process works.
On the Republican side, Donald Trump relishing his front-runner's status, saying he wouldn't be happy with anything but a win in the granite state.

Those of us who are married or have a partner understand that the best reflection on us is our wives. In my case, for sure it's my wife, Rochelle. And in Donald's case for sure it's his wife Melania.
Klobuchar is markedly more centrist than many of the other Democrats running for President, including some of her colleagues in the Senate.

After many legal battles, including some instances where the ban was blocked by courts, the Supreme Court upheld an iteration of the ban in 2018.
This is a moral issue. The lawless state of our southern border is a threat to the safety, security, and financial well‑being of all Americans. We have a moral duty to create an immigration system that protects the lives and jobs of our citizens. This includes our obligation to the millions of immigrants living here today, who followed the rules and respected our laws. Legal immigrants enrich our Nation and strengthen our society in countless ways. I want people to come into our country, but they have to come in legally.
The prime minister is heading off to the U.N. G.A. today. He's going to go there and make a plaintive cry for help. They're worried here they're going to get forgotten. This was the first-place hit by Maria. Category 5. Full-on hit. They're worried they're going to get forgotten because of other places that have been hit by Irma and Maria. Further down the line, of course, the devastation in Puerto Rico and other places like that.
The Sanders campaign noted he was far from Obama's only left wing critic, flagging that progressive groups like MoveOn and the Progressive Campaign Change Committee also challenged Obama from the left on issues. Mike Casca, a Sanders campaign spokesman, said the senator was proud to work with President Barack Obama.
It's with that in mind that Trump backed his White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney's arguments that the administration should support a federal judge's ruling in Texas invalidating Obamacare in its entirety, a senior White House official and Republican close to the campaign told CNN.

My colleagues, this is a day I have been looking forward to for a long time. We are about to achieve really big things. Things that the cynics have scoffed at for years, decades even. Ideas that have been worked on so long to help hardworking Americans who have been left behind for too long. Today, today, we are giving the people of this country their money back.
The uncertainty hasn't stopped Trump from tying himself and his party to the issue.

TAPPER: You know, that's right and as you say that the video will be narrated by the actor Jon Voight, not the dentist Jon Voight, the anchor Jon Voight who has been acted the Republican presidential politics for few years. I remember him campaigning for Rudy Giuliani, and this will be a narrative that they want the American people to see especially the American people who are considering voting for Donald Trump and those who are undecided.
If the question is should we stay on health care until we get it done, I think it's time to move on to something else, Sen. Roy Blunt of Missouri said as he walked into a leadership meeting. Come back to health care when we have more time to get beyond the moment we are in. See if we can put some wins on the board.
Even though the Obamacare exchanges opened in 2014, many Americans remain unfamiliar with the coverage. Just under two-thirds of uninsured adults said they had heard nothing or only a little about financial assistance for policies, according to an Urban Institute study conducted in September.

Retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson had a lot to say about the far-flung reach of the federal government.
Over the weekend, Trump revived his long-running feud against McCain – who died in August after a long battle with brain cancer – citing his ties to the controversial Russia dossier and his vote against repealing Obamacare. He said in the Oval Office on Tuesday that he was never a fan of John McCain and I never will be and complained on Wednesday that he wasn't thanked for giving McCain the kind of funeral that he wanted.
The end result is that you will have two markets, said Sabrina Corlette, research professor at Georgetown University's Health Policy Institute. One that's for young and healthy individuals who don't need a lot of health care, and another that will provide comprehensive coverage for people with pre-existing conditions, but will be much more expensive.
It's just words, folks, was Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump's refrain during this debate. And yet words served him well in his strategies of denial, obfuscation, and direct attack.
Lawmakers last week approved a rules package for 116th Congress that gave the House the ability to intervene in a lawsuit that threatens to bring down the landmark health care law. The new rule directs the House's Office of General Counsel to represent lawmakers in any litigation involving the act and authorizes hiring of outside counsel.
Cindy and Meghan McCain spoke out Wednesday against President Donald Trump's remarks at the Conservative Political Action Conference last week, calling his remarks about Sen. John McCain incredibly hurtful.

Aetna's Bertolini, meanwhile, wrote the letter in response to the Justice Department's query into what the likely consequences would be if it blocked the merger. He noted that the acquisition of Humana puts Aetna in a significantly better position to continue and expand its support.
Utah's Republican Party is the exception, so far.
Their incentives, though, are quickly moving in favor of Democrats' demands, as Democratic members' backs are being stiffened by favorable winds – and a belief that Republicans would be the ones to suffer politically if nothing is agreed.
2. Fed meets to discuss rates: The U.S. Federal Reserve will kick off a two-day meeting to discuss interest rates and monetary policy.
Clearly lawmakers, despite the fact that this is, you know, a total disaster and people, federal workers are going to feel the brunt of this, they're not here. And you know, my sources on the hill are saying maybe January 11th becomes the new soft deadline. That is the day of the first furloughed paycheck for a bunch of government workers who are either working without pay right now or not working at all.
BASH: Speaking of that, Christ Christie, just moments ago, said of Marco Rubio, he said the lights are bright on you. And when that happens, you either shine or you melt. And you can't afford to have somebody melting who's president of the United States. Do you think that that is possible? That -- I mean, what he's saying is that Marco Rubio isn't ready for primetime. Do you agree?
TAPPER: It might have been a real estate agent on the phone calling.
Scaramucci told Berman that he always got along with McCain, adding that he was a decorated Vietnam War veteran.

JONES: And what we -- women can get to and I don't know what Kathleen is a working mom also but in addition to completely shutting down the kids, their nutrition, that she pointed out the learning that they're getting it also throws the monkey wrench in working mom's lives.
Human traffickers and sex traffickers take advantage of the wide open areas between our ports of entry to smuggle thousands of young girls and women into the United States and to sell them into prostitution and modern-day slavery.
And as General McMaster, who you had on yesterday, who was the one who has talked the most about taking some kind of preventive step, whether this is a holistic approach, as you suggest, I'm not convinced yet. Because the effort to suggest that they may pull back from the Iran treaty, I think, would make it much harder to the sign any kind of agreement with North Korea.
BROWN: I don't -- there will be a lot of individual questions on when a senator or a campaign offers a tax plan or a congresswoman or a congressman does the same.
There's no way we're going to allow a con artist to take over the conservative movement, and Donald Trump is a con artist.

Also on tap, China's president, Xi Jinping and sit-downs with two European allies, with whom Mr. Trump has big disagreements at the moment, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and Prime Minister Theresa May of the U.K.
We still don't know how many official objections there will be. Sen. Josh Hawley, a Republican of Missouri, has made it clear he will object to at least Pennsylvania's results, but a source familiar with his thinking has said he is still reviewing whether he will object to other states as well. There is a long list of House members willing to sign onto objections from senators, but a senator has to sign on to make it a viable debate.
The likely reason why tax writers have decided to leave Obamacare tax cuts off the agenda is cost, plain and simple. It would make their efforts to reform the tax code that much more expensive and therefore harder to pay for. And they will need to pay for it as a condition for passing it with a simple majority in the Senate.
We don't need to go anyplace else, so what I want to do is spend a little time talking to you about the messenger, the man. Without his armor, without his weaponry, walking down the tunnel into the arena, who is he? What is he made out of?
Cruz holds up the hand of Carly Fiorina at a campaign rally in Indianapolis on Wednesday, April 27. Cruz named Fiorina, a former presidential candidate, as his running mate.
Somewhat more involved would be reversing various measures the Trump administration put in place to chip away at the Affordable Care Act. These include broadening the duration of short-term health plans to a year, and, more recently, allowing Georgia to stop using the federal exchange , healthcare.gov, and shift to a private sector model instead. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services went a step further in recent weeks, establishing a pathway for all states to do this for 2023.

We know, given the opportunity, there are no limits to what our people, our fellow citizens, our brothers and sisters can do. Yet, for years now, this tax code has been skewed to the well connected, full of special loop holes. Meanwhile, the hardworking family in America has to jump through all the hoops that the IRS can muster. We clean out the loopholes so people can keep more of what they earned in the first place because it's their money in the first place.
We gather here to mourn the passing of American greatness, the real thing, not cheap rhetoric from men who will never come near the sacrifice he gave so willingly, nor the opportunistic appropriation of those who live lives of comfort and privilege while he suffered and served, McCain said at the time.

Does it trouble you that he talks about sending everyone back who is undocumented in this country?
So I called him up and I said, uncle, you got to help me. I'm speaking right before Ivanka and Donald at the Republican National Convention and I'm a little bit nervous. So can you give me some advice? He said why would they have you? I said no, that's not exactly what I need. I need to be pumped up. I'm nervous, and I need some confidence. Don't do this to me. So he said OK, OK, give me two minutes and let me think. He says I've got it. I've got it. You're just like a deceased in an Irish wake. I said you mean I'm that good? He said no, you need to be there to get things started but nobody really expects you to say very much.

But just down to earth truth-telling, a real -- you know, she wasn't afraid to let that mama-ness in her come out, that strength that comes out, the love and affection she has for her family, and also this country, and then also her courage and her ability to be vulnerable too. It made people be able to see a side of her that ordinarily might not get an opportunity to see in first ladies, just a stellar, stellar First Lady.

Listen, he spends his weekend obsessing over great men because he knows it, and I know it, and all of you know it: he will never be a great man, McCain said on ABC's The View, where she is a co-host.
We shouldn't have invaded Iraq, Donald Trump now says. But he also says we should've taken their oil. Guarding immobile, sometimes flammable infrastructure, while plundering and pillaging a sovereign nation is colonialism. Had more Republicans actually paid attention to take their oil, at least they wouldn't have been surprised by grab them by the p---y.
Biden's health care officials are also expected to focus on Medicaid.
However, those with very low incomes don't qualify for Obamacare subsidies, though they may be eligible for Medicaid in many states.

'Realest thing I've ever seen' on 'Bachelor:' Lemon reacts to finale twist
Tonight's Democratic debate showed leadership as opposite from Donald Trump as those two fictionalized worlds. Where Trump is corrupt, the Democrats spoke of reform. Where Trump is self-centered, Democrats dared to care for kids and the poor and the working class. Where Trump is a bully, Democrats were empathetic. Where Trump is a serial liar, the Democrats stuck to the facts.
Another key promise Trump repeatedly has made is that his health plan will lower costs. In January, for example, President-elect Trump told the Post that his plan would include lower numbers, much lower deductibles.
Trump made apparent political calculations that put optics ahead of the health of Americans. He held large rallies in the final months of the election filled with throngs of unmasked crowds as the pandemic was hitting a new peak, he declined to wear a mask or social distance in front of cameras and he publicly downplayed the seriousness of the virus while privately knowing its deadliness

State executives are descending on Washington this weekend for the annual National Governors Association meeting and the Affordable Care Act is at the top of the discussion list. Governors will debate repealing and replacing the health reform law on Saturday, and then they will meet with President Trump and Congressional lawmakers to talk health care on Monday.
A Klobuchar aide told CNN on Monday that the senator prepared for the town hall like she would for a major interview.
Another wild card is how the administration will handle open enrollment, which this year will run from November 1 through December 15 -- half the length that it did under Obama, who actively promoted the sign-up period. Trump officials had been largely silent about their plans until now, though they have repeatedly said the law is failing Americans.
This is so contagious. Nobody's ever seen anything like this, where large groups of people all of a sudden, just by being in the presence of somebody, have it, he said in the briefing.

That would disrupt the entire system and it would cost 32 trillion dollars, he said. The price tag is about right, but his argument didn't take into account the money Americans would, under the plan, save by having expenses like co-pays and deductibles wiped out.
MORGAN: They do. Remember when Barack Obama that we elected it was John Boehner who said ObamaCare is now the law of the land, we just lost the election. We've got to deal with it.
The President has the support of millions of veterans in the United States. I don't think those veterans are in love with the fact that he's attacking John McCain, he said.
[22:00:02] We'll see you again at 12:00 a.m. Eastern for another edition of 360.
Over the weekend, Trump attacked the late senator in several tweets that targeted McCain's ties to the controversial Russia dossier and his vote against repealing Obamacare. He also referred to McCain as being last in his class at the US Naval Academy.
Breakfast get-togethers before NATO meetings are usually photo ops: world leaders smiling and making nice. Not while Donald Trump is President. During his breakfast today with NATO's Secretary General, Trump immediately laid into Jens Stoltenberg while the press was in the room, telling him that NATO allies still don't pay enough toward defense spending and that Germany is a captive of Russia because it buys energy from the country.
And the reason may be that he's seen those redacted documents, and he's furious, I think, in part over the leniency that he thinks Michael Flynn was given. And that's why he's saying to Robert Mueller you better squeeze this orange till we get more juice out of him.
Speaking of those hearings, Sessions sat through eight hours of testimony on Tuesday. He was questioned on his record on race, religious minorities and enhanced interrogation techniques.
SEN. TED CRUZ (R), TEXAS: You know, one of the great things about freedom in America is even people who disagree can speak out. And there's a small group of people on the left who, right now, are very angry and they're expressing their views.
But there are Democrats who could, feasibly, break with their party — giving Republicans a bigger cushion to work with. And even if Democrats can get four GOP votes to approve witnesses broadly, there will be a separate fight over which specific witnesses get called and it could be that they never get enough votes to compel anyone to testify in the end.
I would say we have to absolutely finish the wall and guard the border. And if anybody were to come in after that, they are going to have to go back. No excuses because we can't continue this problem. I think we ought to have a guest worker program, where people come in, work and go home.
No issue better illustrates the divide between America's working class and America's political class than illegal immigration. Wealthy politicians and donors push for open borders while living their lives behind walls and gates and guards.
It also sets Delgado, who deliberately didn't back Medicare for All during the campaign and instead advocated for a Medicare buy-in proposal, apart from his more aggressive colleagues who may hail from districts considered more politically safe than his.
Other states are also looking to change how their Medicaid programs are funded. Alaska has commissioned a study of block grants.
As the continuing inadequacy of the federal government effort becomes clear, a coordinated effort by the White House and Republican allies to redirect blame is under way.

Frank Sesno is director of the School of Media and Public Affairs at The George Washington University. He is a former anchor and Washington Bureau Chief for CNN.
Medicaid block grants necessitate cost-cutting measures like restricting enrollment, decreasing provider reimbursement and limiting eligibility and benefits through managed care, the letter said. The actions endanger the lives of the most vulnerable patients, the population Medicaid was created to protect.

Speaking at her father's funeral last year, McCain, who didn't mention Trump by name, made several unmistakable and pointed references to him throughout her emotional remarks.
Facts First: Trump is correct. Between November 2016, the month of his election, and December 2019, the last month for which we have data, the economy added 7.3 million jobs.
One of the things Collins got in exchange for her vote, she said at the time, was the assurance of the Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell that he would allow a vote on her plan along with Florida Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson to give insurance companies money to help pay for the most expensive patients. Separately, there was to be a vote on a plan by Sens. Lamar Alexander, a Tennessee Republican, and Patty Murray, a Washington Democrat, to temporarily shield insurance companies from President Donald Trump's unilateral decision to end Obamacare cost-sharing subsidies that helped them provide coverage to 6 million lower-income Americans.
BOOKER: That was my phone. I apologize.
For the record, 3.4% of the current US population is 11.2 million. That's almost twice the population of Wisconsin. Luckily, it does appear that the fatality rate for coronavirus is far less than 3.4% — but that doesn't mean we should dismiss the deaths that are coming as acceptable collateral damage.
Additionally, a spate of negative headlines about Klobuchar's demanding management style have trickled out around her 2020 announcement.
RUBIO: A con artist is about to take over the Republican Party and the conservative movement. And we have to put a stop to it.
Legislatures in at least 24 states, including Alabama, have responded by passing pre-emption bills that either abolish or roll back those increases. What's different in Birmingham is the racial dimension of its minimum wage battle – and the massive implications of a workers' movement gaining a victory in a Southern city.
Facts First: The good news about the record low cancer death rate -- in 2017 -- was not news coming out of this Administration. The American Cancer Society wrote the report to which Trump was referring; its chief executive officer, Gary M. Reedy, told CNN that the data in the report reflects prevention, early detection, and treatment advances that occurred in prior years, before Trump's presidency.
President-elect Donald Trump walks from a meeting with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell at the U.S. Capitol November 10, 2016 in Washington, DC. Earlier in the day president-elect Trump met with U.S. President Barack Obama at the White House.
And -- but we're losing contact, and I think we're going to lose you now, so good-bye. And that's what he did and he hung up. And we went back to having the kind of conversation that we needed to, where they ask a question, looking for consensus, looking for common ground, and we -- I think we've identified a little bit. BERMAN: Sir, are you saying that Gary Cohn faked a bad connection to
So it doesn't seem likely that Trump will try to upend Obamacare as soon as he takes office on January 20. Regardless, a president doesn't have the power to summarily overturn a law or nullify a regulation. For instance, he could not immediately dismantle the federal exchange, healthcare.gov, or stop paying premium subsidies -- at least not without being sued, experts said. Only Congress writes laws, and altering a regulation requires an agency to publish the proposed changes, allow the public to comment and then write the final rule, a process which usually takes two years, said David Super, a law professor at Georgetown University Law Center.

The opposite is true: The Trump administration and congressional Republicans have repeatedly put forward : Trump is not the person who saved protections for people with pre-existing conditions. The opposite is true: The Trump administration and congressional Republicans have repeatedly put forward bills and filed lawsuits that would weaken Obamacare's protections for people with pre-existing conditions. Trump is currently supporting a Republican lawsuit that is seeking to declare all of Obamacare void. He has not issued a plan to reinstate the law's protections for people with pre-existing conditions if the suit succeeds.

Now Jerry Jones explained why perhaps with everything going on in the world, President Trump is commenting on the NFL.
Put in place a continuous coverage requirement instead. The Republican plan seeks to allow insurers to impose a 30% surcharge on the premiums of those who let their coverage lapse for at least 63 days. The plan would enable insurers to levy this surcharge for one year, but it would only apply to policies bought in the individual or small group markets.
POLO SANDOVAL, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, you know, first off, Alex -- that commission is certainly still remembering those 17 people whose lives were cut short, their families continue to grieve today and they likely will the rest of their lives.
Cruz has taken a staunch stand against gay rights, emerging as one of the loudest opponents to the drive for same-sex marriage. He called a Supreme Court ruling that was sympathetic to same-sex marriage, tragic and indefensible. He has also opposed the passage of non-discrimination protection for LGBT Americans.

Roberts is also a devotee of Bob Dylan , an avid reader of history, and the father of two children, etched in a public tableau from his 2005 confirmation, who will turn 20 this year. He and his wife, Jane, a lawyer and legal recruiter, spend their summers on an island in Maine, a fitting refuge for a man who holds the nation's highest judicial post and covets a low personal profile.
CHAVEZ: He went beyond that and gave work permits. But he has the authority not to --
Besides OCR's new Conscience division, we've seen the Republican government allow Medicaid work requirements, and implicate Medicaid access in the opioid crisis. We've seen the President appoint unqualified people to key jobs in drug policy and health care agencies, and propose slashing the budget of the Office of National Drug Control Policy. The Trump administration even appointed a contraception opponent to lead an HHS program involving contraception.
Facts First: European countries, including France and Germany, have provided hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of assistance to Ukraine since Russia's invasion in 2014.
Given her always-questionable prospects, there was not much incentive for a senator such as Manchin to support her. The West Virginian has backed the President's nominees who have come up for full votes so far. And he voted to convict former President Donald Trump in his Senate impeachment trial -- in what was an unpleasant choice since his home state overwhelmingly supports the ex-President.
Biden highlighted some of the provisions in his statement.
I had a really nice conversation with him and Melania and I really was under the impression this sort of fight between our families and between him and my father, especially at this particular moment would end. I understand the argument is he's talking about policy, and that's the attack, but it's still particularly hurtful, especially after I've had this conversation with him on the phone, to have this moment of booing at CPAC … at this particular moment in time is incredibly hurtful and I feel, quite frankly, very naïve to have believed that this would be any different, she said.
Two, the business community, of course, is more pragmatic than, say, the Tea Party in terms of their politics and desired outcomes. But the idea that they are going to come in and take out Tea Party members is probably misunderstood. The Tea Party members for the most part are in districts or states that lean pretty substantially in their direction and the idea that they're mostly politically vulnerable is probably not going to materialize. There will be some groups that will try that but I suggest to you, Jake, it won't be successful.

The administration had a few small-term successes on school choice, including the increase in annual fund for charter expansion and allowing 529 savings plans to be used for K-12 education. Adding to those victories, Trump also signed legislation passed in Congress that secured Historically Black Colleges and Universities with permanent funding.
For many reasons, 2020 was not like 2018 -- not the least of which was the pandemic, which may have shaped turnout in ways that were detrimental to the congressman, whose supporters in this Chicago-area district have tended to skew older.

So that's what I mean when I say this is the closest we've been to repealing and replacing Obamacare. And let me just say it again. This is the closest we will ever get to repealing and replacing Obamacare.
MORGAN: Dana just stay with me for a moment and I'll turn this on to Bob Casey his walking outside the Capitol when he heard gunfire, Democrat from Pennsylvania (inaudible), obviously very -- a scary time for everybody at the Capitol Hill and not at least because with all the drama surrounding the shutdown, this could've been anything happening, a terror attack, who knew.
TRUMP: No, I'd never say it's over. It's never over till it's over as our friend would say, right, yogi? But I think we're doing really well. I love that Bloomberg poll. It did many of the southern states. And we're just leading by tremendous numbers.
But I'm going to be -- you know, I'm a joyful warrior. There's a difference between just sitting back and watching someone try to hijack a party that I believe will allow people to rise up again.
A similar measure already passed in the House . Davis said there appear to be enough votes for it to pass in the Senate too, although likely not enough to override a presidential veto.

Republican presidential candidate Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) speaks with the media before participating in a taping of Fox News Channel's The Sean Hannity Show at the Indiana War Memorial on April 29, 2016 in Indianapolis, Indiana.
The race is extremely fluid. All four of the top candidates: Biden, Warren, Sanders and Buttigieg, have at one point led in the Iowa polls. I did not see anyone break out in the debate. The candidates will have to win the old-fashioned way: door to door, farm to farm, town hall to town hall. That is a far better strategy than seeking a knockout in a debate.
An agreement between OPEC and other major market players to slash production came into effect in January. Ministers from some of the nations are scheduled to meet on Sunday to discuss compliance with the deal.

After 24 months of rapid progress, our economy is the envy of the world, our military is the most powerful on earth, and America is winning each and every day. Members of Congress: the State of our Union is strong. Our country is vibrant and our economy is thriving like never before.
And many of the people when we went to the emergency evacuation procedure, instead of going to the government shelter would go to family housing. So we don't know how many, what's the extent, but our hope is really that a lot of these people are not tabulated at this moment or have gone to seek shelter at a friend or family member's place.
At her event in Goffstown, Klobuchar pitching herself as a candidate who can win independent and lean Republican voters. She pledged to go everywhere, not just where it is comfortable, but where it is uncomfortable and outlined a platform that included overturning Citizens United, reinstating the Voting Rights Act, rejoining the Paris Climate Accord and getting on the path toward a public option for health care.
Those are big one-day moves. And 799 points, that sounds really scary. In point terms, it was the fourth largest drop in history. In percentage terms, that's 3.1 percent. I mean, certainly, a bad day but ranks as the 329th worst day ever percentage-wise.

But Lieutenant Colonel Vindman and his twin brother -- right? -- we had some people that -- really amazing. But we did everything. We said, 'What's wrong with it?'

I was actually surprised by that.

BASH: In the White House and on Capitol Hill, powerful women are smashing expectations.
He never wore an Afro or a black beret but one scholar says Donald Trump's presidential campaign has been shaped by the Black Panther Party in some surprising areas.
I would say that one of the biggest changes of the last 18 months is that members used to call and say, Can the President stop tweeting? Short said. And those same members call today and say, 'Can the President tweet this for me?' So where we were 18 months ago with the social media is very different than today that the members now call and specifically ask for tweets.
Families could receive half their total credit as a periodic payment starting in July and running through the rest of the year, according to the legislation. They could then claim the remaining half on their 2021 tax returns.

'Those at the top are not doing their part:' WH looks to raise taxes on wealthy
It wasn't until 1917 that a frustrated President Woodrow Wilson convinced the Senate to adopt a rule -- known as RULE 22 -- that allowed senators to vote to break a filibuster. It was, and still is, known as invoking cloture. (Fun fact: The first time the new rule was used was to try to overcome a filibuster of the Treaty of Versailles in 1919).

And he made clear in 2002 and 2003, both before and after the war started, that he had known he was voting to authorize a possible war, not only to try to get inspectors into Iraq.
Trump claimed that, at the event he held in 2017 to sign an executive order rolling back the Waters of the United States rule, I had a lot of people -- a lot of farmers and construction workers and a lot of people behind me. And these are people that didn't cry when they were babies. They would -- never cried in their life, and they were crying.
I have no idea what 'they've been trying to get' for 44 years, Alison Bateman-House, assistant professor of medical ethics at New York University's Langone Health, said in response to a previous version of Trump's claim. The Right to Try law was a creation of the Goldwater Institute, and it first became state law in 2014 (in Colorado), relatively soon after it was first conceived of.
BASH: Let's start with the president's national emergency declaration.
Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump made 115 false claims over the last two weeks of February, during which he faced a growing crisis over the coronavirus pandemic , visited India, held four campaign rallies and addressed the Conservative Political Action Conference.
Some (many?) argue that until the full Mueller report is released, there can be no definitive conclusion about what Trump did (or didn't do). And there are those, such as Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), who insist evidence of collusion already exists.
The administration is also not expected to pursue Trump-era federal regulations that have been blocked by the courts, including measures that would have required insurers on the Obamacare exchanges that cover abortions to issue separate bills for that coverage , and the so-called conscience rule, which would have let health care workers who cite moral or religious reasons opt out of providing certain medical procedures , such as abortion, sterilization and assisted suicide.
Over the weekend, Trump attacked the late senator in several tweets that targeted McCain's ties to the controversial Russia dossier and his vote against repealing Obamacare. He also referred to McCain as being last in his class at the US Naval Academy.
SPARKS: I like that he stands for the constitution.
DAVID MCKENZIE, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, that's right. Hello, John.
A person close to Trump vowed Trump will only ramp up his actions on trade – still searching to make good in bold fashion on Trump's campaign rhetoric.
It's hard to compare exactly why one candidate can win and another will lose in two different elections, but it's perhaps worth noting what sets Clinton and Biden apart and guess about whether that would make Biden stronger against President Donald Trump in November than Clinton turned out to be.
But what I'm going to do is something different and you're going to hate me for it because you're not going to hear one negative thing out of my mouth. I have nothing negative to say about Hillary. I have only amazing things to tell you about Donald, because this man is good enough, he's tough enough, he's smart enough and he's well-versed enough to do it on his own merits.
The late senator's widow, Cindy McCain, publicized hateful messages she's been receiving since Trump's tweets, and daughter Meghan McCain has continued to respond to the President online and on ABC's The View, where she's a co-host.
Tinkering with Obamacare, however, could be at odds with Pence's stated interest in a smooth transition, experts said. Many of the law's provisions are intertwined, so changing one might have a more widespread effect.
You want the sanctions lifted, stop your nuclear program. Why do you need underground bunkers? Why do you need ICBMs, the sole purpose of ICBMs, Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles is to carry nuclear payloads.
In the 2016 fiscal year, the last full year before Trump took office, ICE reported that Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador ranked first, second, third and fourth for the country of citizenship of people being removed from the US. The same was true in the 2017 fiscal year , which encompassed the end of Barack Obama's presidency and the beginning of Trump's. ICE did not identify any widespread problems with deportations to these countries.
I think we would make a mistake to go too far below the mark that Biden has set, Sen. Chris Murphy, a Democrat from Connecticut, told CNN. It's a big number, but I think it is a big moment and I think we need to assume that this is our one chance to make the investments on Covid and economic relief in 2021.
COOPER: Right along the border. Just ahead, how Ted Cruz is faring in his home state we know he's a polarizing figure in Washington certainly and Capitol Hill. But can he win the hearts and minds of the Texas voters? We'll take you to a diner in Dallas to find out what people there are thinking and saying.
RYAN: No special favors, just basic fairness.
Create more generous Health Savings Accounts. Seeking to get more people to save money for health care expenses, the Republican bill includes several provisions aimed at making Health Savings Accounts more attractive. It raises the annual contribution limits to equal the maximum sum of the deductible and out-of-pocket expenses one would pay in a high-deductible insurance plan. So the limit would be at least $6,550 for an individual and $13,100 for a family in 2018.
In one dispatch played at the trial, an officer exclaims that the rioters have breached the scaffolding. They are behind our lines! he said.
After Trump made this accusation on January 15, Schumer responded the same day: I know what's in the deal. I'm not sure the President does. If he knows what's in the deal -- he should throw it away and take China back to the negotiating table. I will cheer him on if he does.
TRUMP: We better solve the problem before it's too late.
Explain exactly what Bill Clinton was talking about then, what he's saying today.
CRUZ: And, you know, the point on the Iran deal, his answer to everything is if only if someone smarter were in government, things would be better. No. We don't just need smarter people in government. We need leaders that are protecting American interests.
But even though the Trump administration put Iran on notice in the first weeks of Trump's presidency, there's been little follow-through.
We have unleashed a revolution in American energy – the United States is now the number one producer of oil and natural gas in the world. And now, for the first time in 65 years, we are a net exporter of energy.
Sanders repeated a previous claim about the amount of money the US spends on health care.
HONIG: It could be. Look, I always approach cooperators from the point of view that the other potential cooperators are watching. And that's why I think Mueller has been smart.
Facts First: Biggest can be defined in different ways, but trade experts say neither the USMCA or Trump's trade deal with China is the biggest trade deal in US history. Since 'biggest trade deal' has no standard meaning, it may be possible to justify his statements by constructing a measure that fits it and by limiting the number of trade agreements that one compares to. But by any sensible interpretation, he's wrong, said Alan Deardorff, a University of Michigan professor of international economics who focuses on trade. Deardorff said: Both deals, measured in terms of the volume of trade that they cover, are smaller than the Trans-Pacific Partnership that Obama negotiated, and much smaller than the Uruguay Round that created the World Trade Organization.

SCARAMUCCI: -- for unexplicable reasons that are leaking on each other, I would tell my colleagues to stop doing that. It doesn't help the president.

We must move to universal health care. And I am so proud of the work we did as a party to protect the Affordable Car Act, Klobuchar said Sunday. We are to the point now where Obamacare is more popular than the President.
Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming, the No. 3 Republican in the House of Representatives, was censured by the Wyoming Republican Party earlier this month after she voted along with nine other House Republicans to impeach Trump.
Since 2013, nearly 6,500 nursing homes — 4 out of every 10 — have been cited at least once for a serious violation, federal records show. Medicare has fined two-thirds of those homes. Common citations include failing to protect residents from avoidable accidents, neglect, mistreatment and bedsores.
So a great deal of debate and a lot of finger-pointing as to how all of this could have happened -- Alex.
Trump's remark about the funeral came as the President has continued to denigrate the dead senator's legacy.
Severino pretended that the law could compel a surgeon to perform a gender reassignment surgery he or she felt unable to do. That's not a realistic concern. It's fundamental to the medical profession that doctors only perform medicine where they are personally convinced they are doing no harm, meaning they have the adequate skills and expertise to deliver the relevant service. A surgeon who doesn't want to perform a technique doesn't get trained in that technique, and doesn't seek clearance to perform it. Medical practice is rather different than decorating a cake.

CNN previously reported that the senator, who had been held as a prisoner of war in Vietnam, did not want the President at his funeral. McCain's daughter, Meghan McCain, also revealed earlier this year that she wished Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner, Trump's daughter and son-in-law and senior advisers, had not attended the funeral.

While the Senate bill's passage could help fulfill Trump's promise to repeal and replace Obamacare and cut taxes, it would also break a host of promises he made to Americans on health care.

Let's stipulate first that the Iran nuclear deal is working surprisingly well. That's according to the congressional testimony of Trump's own secretary of defense, James Mattis, who testified in October that the Iran deal was in American national security interests.
Cruz can no longer mathematically capture the 1,237 delegates necessary to clinch the Republican nomination ahead of the party's convention in July. But he hopes a strong showing in the Hoosier State on Tuesday could help block Trump's ability to gain the necessary delegates and force the party into a contested convention.
The Haaland nomination differs from the Tanden case since the House member from New Mexico is highly popular among most Democrats. Her nomination is historic since she would be the first Native American Cabinet member. She would also lead the Interior Department, an agency with a long record of discrimination against her community.
When Kennedy, who wrote the majority opinion in Obergefell v. Hodges , retired in 2018, Roberts moved to the center of the ideological spectrum. That was simply by virtue of Kennedy's replacement, Brett Kavanaugh, who holds a more conservative record. But Roberts is unlikely to offer a variable vote in the mode of Kennedy. Roberts has simply laid down more conservative markers over the years.

Infectious disease expert, who warned in 2005 that time is running out to prepare for the next pandemic, said in a conversation withthat America faces a huge challenge:  We are worse off today than we were in 2017 because the health care system is stretched thinner now than ever. There is no excess capacity. And public health funding has been cut under this administration.
Say what? Those are the way tin-pot dictators act, jailing their political opponents. If he had done a half hour studying up (something that seems beyond him), he would know that under the law, a president can request -- but not order -- the Justice Department to appoint a special prosecutor and Justice must then make a decision independent from White House control. Trump has a strange tropism toward Richard Nixon, forgetting that such safeguards were put in place precisely because of his abuses of power.

Facts First: The decline -- shown in the Consumer Price Index, but not in some other measures -- happened in 2018, not last year.

Before Joe Biden became vice president in 2009, Hunter Biden, who graduated from Yale Law School, worked as a lobbyist. He became a partner at a law and lobbying firm in 2001.

Over the following weeks, campaign advisers looked to position Bloomberg as the only manager in the race and seized on the rise of coronavirus as an example of the kind of issue Bloomberg would tackle as a candidate. They even paid to air a three-minute ad on CBS and NBC on a Sunday night, playing up Bloomberg as the best prepared candidate to be president.
However, no one has joined these new associations yet. The Trump administration has yet to act on the president's executive order that would expand access to these groups.

The lineup includes some of Trump's staunchest allies on Capitol Hill, including Florida Sen. Rick Scott, Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz, Utah Sen. Mike Lee, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley, Colorado Rep. Lauren Boebert, Arkansas Sen. Tom Cotton and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy. And it includes several of his strongest supporters from the states: Florida Gov.

Most of the questions on Monday will come from New Hampshire voters, an electorate which prizes its position as the first-in-the-nation primary and is often known for asking discerning and pointed questions.
Enrollees will pay no more than 8.5% of their income toward coverage, down from nearly 10% now. And lower-income policyholders will receive subsidies that eliminate their premiums completely.
Jobs and investment are pouring into 9,000 previously-neglected neighborhoods thanks to Opportunity Zones, a plan spearheaded by Senator Tim Scott as part of our great Republican tax cuts. In other words, wealthy people and companies are pouring money into poor neighborhoods or areas that have not seen investment in many decades, creating jobs, energy, and excitement. This is the first time that these deserving communities have seen anything like this. It is all working!

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky acknowledged European help during his meeting with Trump at the United Nations in September, though he said the world's efforts had been inadequate so far: And, I'm sorry, but we don't need help; we need support. Real support. And we thank -- thank everybody, thank all of the European countries; they each help us. But we also want to have more -- more.
Which brings me to Tuesday and Trump's comments about McCain, who died in August 2018 after a battle with brain cancer. Here's all of what Trump said:
Klobuchar is markedly more centrist than many of the other Democrats running for President, including some of her colleagues in the Senate. Klobuchar has a liberal voting record, but she does not support abolishing the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency or Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders' Medicare-for-all bill – instead pushing to lower the age when people are allowed to buy into the government health care program.
With unyielding commitment, we are curbing the opioid epidemic – drug overdose deaths declined for the first time in nearly 30 years.

But there are many measures that would be an easier lift. They could restore the annual open enrollment period to three months, which it was before the Trump administration cut it to six weeks. And they could increase funding for marketing and enrollment assistance, both of which were deeply slashed in recent years. And they could pull back on allowing private brokers to advise consumers looking for policies, which Trump officials pushed.
He blamed McCain for the failure in September 2017.
Having told moderator Anderson Cooper that he never actually groped or assaulted any women the way he bragged about in the tape, Trump's apology also leaves him wide open to new women contradicting his claims and to new tapes of scurrilous remarks.

Karkkainen noted that the vast majority of proposed actions assessed by the federal government under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) sail through without having to go through an Environmental Impact Statement process, the most comprehensive form of environmental review. Precise numbers for road and highway projects are not available, but in 2014, the Obama administration's Council on Environmental Quality estimated that about 95% of all analyses under NEPA (not only for highway projects) were classified as Categorical Exclusions, meaning that the proposals did not require either the full Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) or even the quicker process known as an Environmental Assessment (EA).

Trump seems to fancy himself more of a king than a President. The same man who once pledged to drain the swamp seems to love mucking around in it, and attacks anyone who tries to clean it up.
Trump repeatedly promised that he would cover all Americans when given the chance to repeal and replace Obamacare. He stated that coverage for everyone was ​just human decency back in February of 2016.

Medical staff searched for a solution. They told her about a program in Michigan made possible by Obamacare, and enacted by the state's Republican governor. Healthy Michigan expanded the pool of people eligible to receive Medicaid benefits. It was open to anyone who made $16,000 per year or less, or $33,000 per year or less for a family of four.
Trump has tried to announce some good news at the beginning of every briefing. But many of his claims of progress have been incorrect.
The premiums are way too high and the deductibles, you can't even use it. The deductible is so high, unless up get hit by a tractor, you can't even use it. Nobody's ever seen anything like it.

And Vindman testified that he had wanted to add in Trump saying there are recordings related to former vice president Joe Biden and a Ukrainian prosecutor Biden had pushed Ukrainian leaders to fire. (Trump was vague about what he meant; in public comments last fall, Trump brought up a video of Biden at a 2018 event telling the story of his effort to get the prosecutor ousted.)
And so there was an image in the White American mind of what business government had gotten into, that they shouldn't have been in it and that they didn't do well. There was a racialized story and the term public had already become degraded and associated with people of color: public housing, and public schools that had already become integrated.
Facts First: At the time Hunter Biden was appointed to the board of Burisma in 2014, he was a : At the time Hunter Biden was appointed to the board of Burisma in 2014, he was a lawyer at the firm Boies Schiller Flexner, an adjunct professor at Georgetown University's foreign service program, chairman of the board of World Food Program USA, and chief executive officer and chairman of Rosemont Seneca Advisors, an investment advisory firm. He also served on other boards.
But make no mistake. You shouldn't even think of pulling the trigger on early retirement unless you're confident you'll have the resources to cover the cost of medical insurance as well as your potential health care costs overall.
Many were in agreement: It's simply time to move on.
Patti Solis Doyle: Klobuchar had the best night but may still fall short in Iowa
Bloomberg on Wednesday claimed that he released his tax returns every year to the public for the 12 years he served as the mayor of New York.
PAWLENTY: But, you know, there's an analog in the Democratic Party to the Tea Party, when you look at groups like Occupy, when you look at groups that want to just recklessly defund the Department of Defense. They don't represent the whole Democratic Party and the Tea Party represents only one slice of the Republican Party.
The Dow, S&P 500 and Nasdaq are at or near record highs. And Wall Street's so-called fear gauge, a measure of volatility known as the VIX (VIX), dipped below 10 on Monday and is the lowest in a decade.
The President said Thursday he had tasked a handful of Republican senators with cobbling together an Obamacare replacement. No such working group appears to exist, however.
His administration is also allowing states to make major changes to their Obamacare markets, which could also leave low-income, older or sicker residents with few choices and higher costs. Few states have taken the federal government up on this offer so far.

Facts First: Bloomberg was misleading by omission when he cited a 95% decline in stop and frisk without explaining that the reduction happened only in the last two years of his 12-year mayoralty, following a 605% increase in his first 10 years.
MIRA: Nueva York desafiará decreto de Trump contra ciudades santuario
Another hallmark of his foreign policy was his approach to Russia -- namely, his hesitation to single out Russian aggression and, at times, embrace its leader, Vladimir Putin, against his allies' and advisers' warnings.
… against Washington. And if you want to tell people you're going to stand against Washington, the question we should ask is, when have you ever stood up to the lobbyists in Washington?
But as is often the case with Trump, the reality that he sketched was often at odds with the facts . His 80-minute appearance was pockmarked with exaggerations, falsehoods and misleading rhetoric.
But it's not Trump's fault, he tweeted Tuesday, even though he enacted the policy. Blame the Democrats, who are saying it's inhumane, according to the President's logic: Separating families at the Border is the fault of bad legislation passed by the Democrats, he wrote on Twitter. Border Security laws should be changed but the Dems can't get their act together! Started the Wall.
At her event in Goffstown, Klobuchar pitching herself as a candidate who can win independent and lean Republican voters. She pledged to go everywhere, not just where it is comfortable, but where it is uncomfortable and outlined a platform that included overturning Citizens United, reinstating the Voting Rights Act, rejoining the Paris Climate Accord and getting on the path toward a public option for health care.

Now I understand why he doesn't want to make this determination. His intelligence services are telling him that Mohammed bin Salman was responsible and because either of a personal relationship he has or a business relationship he has with Saudi Arabia, he is declining to make that finding to Congress. But this isn't his general executive discretion. He has to, under the law --
Overall, Trump's debate performance may have given heart to his base supporters, stopping his slide, but did little to bring new voters into the fold, especially women. Voter preferences are now hardening, and more trouble could lie ahead.

The Trump administration estimates that 200,000 Obamacare enrollees will move to short-term plans next year. Also, 300,000 people who now buy individual market polices outside of the Obamacare exchanges will switch to short-term plans and another 100,000 uninsured folks will purchase them next year. By 2021, enrollment in the individual market will decrease by 1.4 million.
Protections for those with pre-existing conditions. Insurers are not allowed to discriminate against those with pre-existing conditions. They cannot deny them coverage, nor charge them more.
First, the new administration should organize a diverse group of scholars who will be charged with offering a comprehensive and holistic portrait of America's racial history. The Pulitzer Prize-winning 1619 Project by Nikole Hannah-Jones offers an important template in this regard, but one that -- even as it has been debated among historians -- has also been attacked on ideological grounds by conservatives and neo-Confederates for being overly critical of the nation's long political and cultural embrace of White supremacy.
Indeed, Roberts often points out that the architect of the Supreme Court placed bronze tortoises at the base of the court's exterior lampposts to symbolize the judiciary's commitment to constant-- but deliberate -- progress.
The glum outlook from key GOP senators on Monday came just days after Senate Republicans were unable to pass a bill to repeal key provisions of Obamacare. In a surprise move, Republican Sen. John McCain joined Sens. Lisa Murkowski and Susan Collins in voting no early Friday, denying Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and President Donald Trump a significant political victory.
Massachusetts' Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a rumored 2020 presidential contender, tried to set the stakes early on.
Delay the Cadillac tax. The Republican plan keeps but delays the controversial Cadillac tax, which calls for imposing a 40% excise tax on generous employer health insurance plans. Originally scheduled to go into effect in 2018, the law would have taxed employers on any premiums that exceed $10,200 for individual policies and $27,500 for family plans. After intense lobbying by companies and unions, lawmakers pushed back the start date to 2020. The Republican plan delays it until 2026.

Trump claimed to have added 600,000 manufacturing jobs.
REP. JAMES LANKFORD (R), OKLAHOMA: You know what? That's the great unknown. A lot of third party candidates have tried to jump in over the past several years, famously Ross Perot and others they try to jump in. Sometimes they made a -- they've been a difference maker for the Republicans or Democrats, but they're not actually one. There's not others than a few Independents that are even in the House and the Senate may end up caucusing either Republican or Democrats.
It's worse than a hoax. The first part of it was a coup. And this is just a continuation of it. -- January 6 interview with Rush Limbaugh
To keep costs under control, nearly 40% of companies will offer only high-deductible plans next year, compared to 35% this year. Some 90% of firms will offer a high-deductible plan as an option, but that figure is expected to rise to 97% by 2020.
Trump's repulsive comments about women cast a shadow over Sunday night's second presidential debate in St. Louis. Over the weekend, scores of high-profile members of the Republican establishment finally reached their breaking point, openly calling for Trump to drop out of the race.

Cillizza: How did we get from that initial decision to a ballot measure all the way in 2018 that allowed Utah voters to have their own say on Medicaid expansion?
California and other Democratic-led states defending Obamacare have appealed the ruling to the US Supreme Court, which has denied a request to fast-track the appeal -- meaning it is possible a Supreme Court decision may not be issued until after the 2020 presidential election.
LEMON: Yeah. Hey, Jack, can we talk about Rudy Giuliani?
Mead's story is just one of the many inspiring Governor Rick Snyder in his fight to keep parts of Obamacare. Snyder is one of 16 Republican governors in states that have expanded Medicaid in their states, even though the Supreme Court ruled it wasn't mandatory under Obamacare.

Mary and Reed Christensen are bracing for a sharp spike in premiums. They will have to pay $2,300 a month for an Obamacare policy next year, up from $1,522 now. The Blair, Nebraska, couple are meeting their insurance agent on Friday, but they don't have many choices -- their current insurer, Aetna, dropped out of the market so Medica is the only option.
Trump's rally scripts included a list of positive economic statistics. Now that those numbers have been rendered obsolete by the virus, Trump has turned to reminding Americans that the economy used to be thriving -- and making vague pledges that things will be just as prosperous, or even more so, once the virus is gone.
My intention is to go to the private sector and help support my family, Christie said. Whenever he calls or I call him and we have conversations, I'm always willing if he asks to give my opinion.
Over the last 2 years, my Administration has moved with urgency and historic speed to confront problems neglected by leaders of both parties over many decades.
Yet even this victory will exert a price. If Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is forced by Democratic opposition to invoke the nuclear option – changing Senate rules to get around a Senate filibuster for Supreme Court nominees – poisoned feelings could linger in the chamber for years.

Klobuchar's website has one page that outlines her health care proposals in five paragraphs that briefly summarize her proposals on health care, prescription drugs, addiction and mental health, reproductive rights and seniors. But each of those paragraphs, except the one on reproductive rights, has a link to other pages with more details on her plans.
There were already indications Democrats and Republicans in the House might not be on board for the same version of the proposals. Instead, Collins and Alexander said they would introduce the stablilization bills early in 2018 and debate it around the massive omnibus spending bill lawmakers use to fund the government.
Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump delivered another rapid series of false and misleading claims on Sunday night, this time at a Fox News virtual town hall event at the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, DC.

Childcare workers are making wages lower than McDonald's workers, Sanders said.
He added he did not support Obama in 2008.

Eleven states that run their own Obamacare exchanges, along with the District of Columbia, allowed their uninsured residents to obtain coverage outside the usual time frame, in addition to those who lost their work policies or had other qualifying life changes. In total, more than 240,000 people signed up on the state-run exchanges between March and July, with several states reporting much greater interest than in 2019.
He has just about zero chance of winning a presidential election, Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group, wrote in a note to clients Monday. The markets instead should assume that Trump gets reelected the better Sanders does, whether you like that or not.
Roger was never involved in the Trump campaign for president. He wasn't involved. I think early on, long before I announced, he may have done a little consulting work or something, but he was not involved when I ran for President. And he's a person who, again, he knows a lot of people having to do with politics. His whole life is politics. That's what he is. -- February 20 speech to Hope for Prisoners graduation ceremony
March 11, 2016 - Carson announces his endorsement of GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump.
On two occasions, Trump contrasted the fatality rate for the coronavirus with the fatality rate for the Ebola outbreak of 2014 to 2016, saying in the other case (Ebola), it was a virtual hundred percent and that with Ebola -- we were talking about it before -- you disintegrated. If you got Ebola, that was it.
TRUMP: Look, Wolf, he's a desperate person. He's a sad and, you know, he's a pathetic person. He doesn't even use his last name in his ads. He's a sad person who has gone absolutely crazy. I mean, this guy is a -- he's a nervous wreck. I've never seen anything like it. And he's saying things like that.
CRUZ: And when it comes to Iran, Donald has said he would leave the agreement in place and try to renegotiate it, giving the Ayatollah Khomeini over $100 billion. That reflects you do not understand the radical Islam terrorist that is the Ayatollah that wants to murder us.
We must move to universal health care. And I am so proud of the work we did as a party to protect the Affordable Car Act, Klobuchar said Sunday. We are to the point now where Obamacare is more popular than the President.
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks to guests and supporters during a rally at the Indiana State Fairgrounds on April 20, 2016 in Indianapolis, Indiana.
That is more important in the US than in any other developed country, because the US has a mind-boggling number of uninsured people. Since Trump came to office, the numbers have been climbing as he tries to dismantle the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare. Millions lost coverage in 2018, bringing the number of uninsured to 27.5 million, according to the US Census. (The administration is still in court trying to end Obamacare.)
In just over 2 years since the election, we have launched an unprecedented economic boom – a boom that has rarely been seen before. We have created 5.3 million new jobs and importantly added 600,000 new manufacturing jobs – something which almost everyone said was impossible to do, but the fact is, we are just getting started.
This has been one of Ivanka Trump's political hobbyhorses for some time. Recently, she and Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Florida, worked together on the outline of a plan that would allow new parents to effectively shift Social Security money, payable after retirement, to the time following the birth of a child. (Democratic Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York panned the idea, saying it was like robbing Peter to pay Paul.)
Democrats also want some kind of deal on how to handle the expiration of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program – which is a hard sell for conservatives.
GOV. JEB BUSH (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Yes, I just find it remarkable that medal-of-honor recipients or -- like Leo Thorsness or John McCain who were in Hanoi Hilton as prisoners of war aren't viewed as American heroes because that's what they are. And it's a long list of things that Donald Trump says that disparages people, large groups of people, individuals like John McCain. I find it remarkable that, as a candidate for president, he would think that's an evidence that he's a strong person. He's not.
Trump claimed twice that the average household has gained $10,000 in income during his presidency.
Just hours after House Republican leaders planned to press ahead on a plan to try to keep the government open without their Democratic colleagues in the House, conservatives in their own ranks told reporters they believed the votes weren't there to pass a bill with just Republicans.
BASH: So I mean do you think -- are you pledging to tone down the rhetoric a little bit and maybe that could help?
Let me be very clear, Sanders said. I voted for Obamacare. But to be very honest with you, I'm not going to argue with anybody who says that it is too complicated. I am an advocate of a 'Medicare for All' single payer program. I think Obamacare is a good Republican Romney type program, which has worked in Massachusetts. It's a moderate program which addresses some needs.
If I get really, really sick and I have to go to the hospital, at least I'm not going bankrupt, said Mashoney, noting that Obamacare limits how much he has to pay out-of-pocket for care. Those things are very important to me.
He did it because he couldn't get his way. He's not the great negotiator that everybody said he was. And, frankly, that whole press conference he had, I think the real crisis here is the president's state of mind.
COOPER: Does any of this make sense to you, Amy?
They have a history of losing members after they've gone too far and their position is indefensible to the rest of the conference, the senior GOP aide said Sunday after Poe announced his departure. It also probably doesn't help that the President of the United States publicly rebuked them this morning minutes before two of their leaders hit the Sunday shows.
People have to feel the impact of what happens quickly. They have to know their lives are better, said Sebelius. Things that are very tangible have to happen visibly and quickly.
US presidents have consistently supported European integration efforts.
But more damning still was the way he handled the disgusting video from 11 years ago in which he made vulgar sexual remarks. Trump could possibly have achieved a measure of forgiveness if he had issued a sincere, thoughtful apology about his past as well as some ugly incidents in this campaign. But his apology was limited in scope, seemed slightly dismissive, and went off track when he mixed ISIS into the conversation.
While we don't yet have an analysis of the Senate's plan, it is clear that if signed into law, the bill would fall well short of Trump's broad promises to insure everyone. According to the CBO, under the House bill that passed in May – which is similar to the Senate bill – 23 million Americans who already have insurance would lose their coverage within a decade.

A majority of Democrats and independents favor all four of these options, but only buying into Medicare or Medicaid garners the support of about two-thirds of Republicans. Less than a quarter of Republicans favor Medicare-for-all and 47% support a national plan that would allow people to keep their coverage.
Now in my mind, I try not to confront them. You know, I have the idea of like letting them know that I'm not there to confront them, but to protect the family, to stop it, you know, to avoid somebody getting killed. So that's what I did. So I kept my (inaudible) and hands so they could know that I'm not--
All right. So, we have to cover what is going on with the health care, because they're coming down to the fire, the GOP is trying to get something to repeal and replace Obamacare. That would be delivering on a signature promise.
I certainly hope the administration does not do anything in the meantime to hasten that collapse, Collins said on State of the Union.
While the Senate bill's passage could help fulfill Trump's promise to repeal and replace Obamacare and cut taxes, it would also break a host of promises he made to Americans on health care.
[11:55:12] Reform means we go from back of the pack to the front of the pack. So instead of the slow growth that we have been going through for years, we want to get back to real sustained economic growth. We want to build an economy where there is more demand for higher paying jobs. That's the whole purpose of all this. Make sure people can grow up and reach their potential. Make sure the jobs are there to give people the opportunity to reach their potential. This is why we are doing this. This is without question the single most thing we can do to, once again make America the best place to do business.
On Tuesday, Trump falsely accused McCain of misleading the White House over how he would vote.
And the business of making those promises a reality, coupled with his lack of relevant Washington experience, has left Trump with few choices beyond sticking to his rhetorical guns while scrambling behind the scenes to find ways to convert those bold ideas into sound policy.

Good evening to both of you gentlemen. Thank you for joining us. Jack, I'm going to start with you. You just heard me lay it out. All of it, right? Mueller has indicted multiple members of the Trump's inner circle. Democrats take control of Congress in a matter of days. How bad could this get?
CRUZ: Donald believes that he is the onewho discovered the issue of illegal immigration.
Here's what I know: These latest comments will cause zero erosion in Trump's support among his hardcore backers. They will love the wringing of hands and woe-is-me reaction by who they believe to be elites. He's freaking them all out! They don't know what to do with him!
TRUMP: Because they don't cover most of the subjects. We're the policemen of the world. We take care of the entire world. We're going to have a stronger military, much stronger. Our military is depleted. But we take care of Germany, we take care of Saudi Arabia, we take care of Japan, we take care of South Korea. We take - every time this maniac from North Korea does anything, we immediately send our ships. We get virtually nothing.
And that's what we're up against. And whether we like it or not, that is what we're up against.

We have created 5.3 million new jobs and importantly added 600,000 new manufacturing jobs – something which almost everyone said was impossible to do, but the fact is, we are just getting started.
Another quote for you. The fact that Cohen continued to work on the project and discuss it with individual one, remember individual one is the president, well into the campaign was material to the ongoing congressional and SCO, special counsel's office, investigations, particularly because it occurred at a time of sustained efforts by the Russian government to interfere with the U.S. presidential election.
Cruz said, You would carpet bomb where ISIS is, not a city, but the location of the troops. You use air power directed and you have embedded special forces to direct the air power. But the object isn't to level a city. The object is to kill the ISIS terrorists.
And then what happens? Now we see the storm running up the east coast. Let me show you what the models said overnight. Yesterday, those same models were here, and I liked that solution. Now they are here, not liking it so much. Still no contact with the U.S. landfall- wise, but I don't like that progression to the west.
That might signal a change from his latest proposal in which he called for just three brackets -- a 12% bracket, a 25% bracket and a 33% bracket -- just as the House Republican's tax reform blueprint does.
'Those at the top are not doing their part:' WH looks to raise taxes on wealthy
I'm just tired of voting for CRs, said Sen. Angus King, an independent from Maine who caucuses with the Democrats.
Over the weekend, Trump attacked the late senator in several tweets that targeted McCain's ties to the controversial Russia dossier and his vote against repealing Obamacare. He also referred to McCain as being last in his class at the US Naval Academy.
So there's -- there are lots of reasons he did it. I think to be consistent, having had criticized President Obama for things far worse than what this president is doing, I think it's -- I think it's consistent for me to have voted no.
Achieving that will require a shift in thinking both on and off Capitol Hill. To start, it's hardly a cop-out to concede that, more than any ideological divide on the left or lack of tactical imagination, the trouble for Democrats now is rooted in simple math. Unless a GOP senator joins them, Democrats don't have the votes to defeat Kavanaugh.
You've got to remember, if we just repeal Obamacare, it's not like life and the world goes back to life before Obamacare. Obamacare did so much damage to the U.S. health insurance system, that it's not as if you can just go back to the day before. So that's why we are offering a better way. That's why we are offering the American Health Care Act. That's why we're offering a system that brings choice and competition back into the marketplace, gives people, through the use of risk pools, health savings accounts and tax credits, the ability to go find affordable coverage, and that brings insurers back into the marketplace.
Trump talked about how he donates his presidential salary, then said, I never had a story -- I don't think I've had a story that I give it. But I guarantee if I was ever late -- because it comes in quarterly -- if I was ever late, it would be a front-page story... -- February 27 remarks in meeting with black leaders
Today, we say to the private insurance companies – we say that whether you like it or not, the United States will join every other major country on earth and guarantee health care to all people as a right, Sanders said at a rally in Los Angeles last month. The goal of health care is to provide quality care to all, not to have insurance companies make billions of dollars a year off our sickness.
But they can't completely quit their impulse to own the libs by blaming the Obama administration for their testing and medical equipment fiascos while refusing to open Obamacare insurance exchanges for the rocketing number of new unemployed folks, according to new CNN reporting
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell reached a key Senate milestone Tuesday, surpassing former Sen. Robert Dole of Kansas to become the longest-serving Republican leader in the chamber's history.
We can all hope that Trump's big bet that he will force the Iranians back to the negotiating table will pay off, but history suggests that these kinds of bets are easy to make on the campaign trail, but are much harder to pull off when you are sitting in the Oval Office.
BUSH: Well, he is a whiner and I'm defending the honor of people that I really respect. And I think that's more than appropriate. I do this with joy in my heart, because I do believe that this country is the most extraordinary country on the face of the earth.
Facts First: It's not true that every poll on potential election matchups shows Trump leading every Democratic candidate, let alone leading them by a lot.
I am running because I see that sense of community is getting fractured, Klobuchar said on Sunday in Iowa. It's getting fractured by someone in the White House who gets up every morning and tweets whatever he wants but doesn't respect the amendment that allows him to do it.

By then, he had already promised universal coverage. When he was a presidential candidate in 2015, Trump told CBS's Scott Pelley on 60 Minutes that everybody's got to be covered. He conceded that it may be an un-Republican thing to say, but he wanted to ensure that everyone had quality health care.

Instead he highlighted a new anti-narcotics initiative in a fresh example of how he has often sought to turn coronavirus briefings into the political platform he lacks with campaign rallies canceled.
Last month, a federal appeals court held that the individual mandate is unconstitutional. But critically, the court punted on whether the rest of the massive law -- even provisions unrelated to the mandate -- could remain on the books. Over 98 pages, the 2-1 appeals court asked a district court to review that issue -- infuriating supporters of the law.

For the past several years, America's economy has grown around 2% a year. Cruz said Friday that he can get the economy expanding at 5% or more a year.
Trump has made no secret of his unwavering belief in the rightness of his gut. He is an instinctual actor; he goes with what feels right as opposed to what conventional wisdom or the graybeards of Washington tell him is right.
What would Trump do about the refugee crisis in Syria? We don't know, he didn't answer — twice. Question after question, Trump said nothing. I mean, words came out of his mouth but they barely formed sentences and they definitely didn't form thoughts. He basically vomited fragments of nothingness all over Hillary Clinton and America. And like Clinton, we all just had to sit there — frustrated and annoyed.

But Wolfe was not convicted -- nor even charged -- with leaking classified information, and he denies he ever did so . Wolfe pleaded guilty to one count of making a false statement to the FBI about his contact with journalists; two other false statement charges were dropped
Though Pence now supports the health law's repeal, the Healthy Indiana Plan that he established in 2015 as the state's governor has brought Medicaid coverage to more than 350,000 people. The architect of the plan was health care consultant Seema Verma, who has been nominated to head the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services.
You say this is a binary choice. A two-part question: Why would somebody not believe this is take-it-or-leave-it when you hear from members of the Freedom Caucus and conservatives, say, take your bill or change it?
NUZZI: Well, I think if she actually decided to run, she would be a very serious candidate. She would certainly be one of the most serious candidates who we talk about right now as being someone who might throw their hat in the ring.

Klobuchar's primary pitch to voters is likely to be electability. The Democrat has been notably successful in Minnesota, winning her three terms in the Senate by an average of 26 percentage points. Klobuchar won re-election in 2018 with 60% of the vote, two years after Trump came within two points of defeating Hillary Clinton in the state.

On Tuesday night, Biden offered a more nuanced take than the other candidates on the stage, arguing that we can't just walk way completely from Afghanistan and that there is a big difference between having combat troops in a country such as Afghanistan and maintaining a residual force of US Special Forces to advise and assist local forces.
While the Senate bill's passage could help fulfill Trump's promise to repeal and replace Obamacare and cut taxes, it would also break a host of promises he made to Americans on health care.

The White House has yet to decide whether it will take the lead on crafting an Obamacare replacement, they said, or whether the President will punt to Republican lawmakers.
So Trump could have accurately made a less sweeping claim. But he was exaggerating when he declared that the four countries simply weren't taking them back.
More recently, as president-elect, Trump reiterated his support for the idea in January.
One key feature of most CPACs is the presidential straw poll, an informal and nonscientific survey of attendees that can be a bellwether for the party -- or, more often, a show of organizing strength. While Romney won four CPAC straw polls between 2007 and 2012, Trump won none of the four pre-2016 straw polls before his own nomination.

Still, he said Obamacare's Medicaid expansion has helped people.
When Biden said 13 years ago, he appeared to be referring to how, in 2006 and 2007, he was calling his 2002 vote a mistake. The vote itself was more than 17 years ago.

The administration rolled out hundreds of executive actions curtailing both legal and illegal immigration to the United States, starting with one of his first actions as President: the travel ban, which has been derided by critics as an attempt to ban Muslims from the US.
We will see on the second point, but when you are talking about giving people direct checks , expanding unemployment insurance, giving people more money to buy food and raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour , you aren't talking about unpopular ideas. Democratic aides tell CNN over and over again this isn't repealing Obamacare. They are giving people something, not taking something away, and that's emboldened members to act swiftly and decisively and not give in to talk that they have to unify the country by bringing Republicans onboard with a plan.
This story has been updated with additional developments from Friday.
If you introduce a public competitor within the private insurance market place, there is no doubt that will have a real effect on the premiums, on deductibles and it will drive down the cost of health care, Delgado said of the bill, which is a companion measure to a proposal already introduced in the Senate by Democratic Sens. Tim Kaine of Virginia and Michael Bennet of Colorado and is similar to a proposal introduced previously by Reps. Brian Higgins and John Larson last Congress.

At times, Trump brought the level of discourse embarrassingly low with all sense of presidential decorum thrown out the window. Gone were the pleasantries and respect with Trump referring to Mrs. Clinton as a pronoun (she, her) throughout the evening. Clearly this was done on purpose to diminish Clinton. She handled it like a seasoned professional, making her look like the adult in the room. Trump once again demonstrated why he's temperamentally unfit for the presidency.

Maybe it was wishful thinking or a nudge to one particular audience member, but none other than then-President Barack Obama suggested, during a news conference days after the election, that the weight of the job alone might tamp down Trump's boisterous tendencies.
BOB CASEY, (D) PENNSYLVANIA: Well Piers, when we're walking outside which usually when I leave that Thursday lunch, we -- I usually walk underground, this just happened to be outside but the first thought that I had, the initial thought when I heard all the sirens and the law enforcement, I thought it was a dignitary being escorted then as I got closer to that corner, I knew there was more urgency to it and then I heard about three or four pops of gunfire, of course then, we knew it was very serious.
But Trump has been obstinate in the face of those political warning signs, instead concerned that repealing and replacing Obamacare remains the one signature 2016 campaign promise he has yet to make good on.

Trump has also struggled to make good on his core campaign promise of repealing and replacing Obamacare with something much better amid disagreements between warring factions of the Republican Party. And amid his quest to get a bill passed as soon as possible, Trump failed to help bridge those differences and was forced to accept a loss, canceling a scheduled vote on the House floor.
More time, however, is unlikely to calm carriers' jitters. Insurers want to know whether the Trump administration will continue to fund a key set of Obamacare subsidies and enforce the individual mandate. Many are asking for big rate hikes or are exiting the market completely because of the uncertainty of the health reform law's future under the Republicans.
The justices' initial moves to handle the pandemic were ambiguous. They issued orders regarding the allotment of argument time between parties but left open when those cases would actually be heard. Until Monday, lawyers, who continued to prepare filings and cautiously try to be ready for arguments, had not received any formal word about alternative methods for airing the March and April disputes.
Biden has sharpened his attacks on Sanders' health care proposal in recent days as he campaigns in New Hampshire.

Vindman testified that the transcript was substantively correct even without the changes he had proposed.

So the Fifth Circuit will look at it. And if it upholds exactly what O'Connor did then this thing will shoot right to the Supreme Court because that's so broad.

One specific thing Trump has been clear on, however, is Medicaid. He has been consistent in voicing his opposition to any cuts to the program, which helps to provide coverage to low-income Americans. On the campaign trail, he often touted his promise to not touch Medicaid.

Meanwhile, he issued another executive order in late 2017 that would make it easier for Americans to buy alternatives to the Affordable Care Act that are cheaper, but offer fewer protections, such as short-term health plans . The law's defenders, however, fear that such plans could siphon off younger and healthier people, which could cause premiums to rise for those left buying policies in the Obamacare exchanges.

As a candidate, Trump pledged to narrow America's trade deficit, especially with China. Although progress was made, Trump wasn't entirely successful. In 2019, the goods trade deficit with China fell to its lowest level since 2014. The overall US trade deficit also shrank in 2019, but it remained higher than when Trump took office. The gap was further exacerbated by the pandemic, with the trade deficit increasing nearly every month between April and August 2020. In November 2020, the trade deficit reached its highest level since 2006.
Simply put, walls work and walls save lives. So let's work together, compromise, and reach a deal that will truly make America safe.
He spoke exclusively to CNN on Tuesday.
After the administration kicked off the week with its surprise shift to supporting the invalidation of the Affordable Care Act in the Texas case, Trump has been beating the drum constantly, thrusting the thorny issue into the center of the political arena even as federal judges in other cases ruled against him. On Wednesday, one jettisoned the administration's approval of Medicaid work requirements in two states and another on Thursday blocked a rule that would make it easier for small businesses to band together to buy health insurance, which could undermine Obamacare.

SWERDLICK: No idea. But -- and I haven't seen that video yet -- Alex. But I have two reactions to it.

The question for Sanders, then, is whether he can deliver the message he wants and not get bogged down by the incoming fire.

Verbal fisticuffs between Trump and Clinton over emails, tax returns, and sexual assault have turned a presidential contest into a brutal spectator sport filled with vulgar exchanges that made the spectacle unfit to be watched by children. A largely substance free example of the worst kind of political theater — one largely devoid of serious policy discussion — this debate exemplified how modern day American politics has reached a historic low.

What happened after Trump released the transcript
LEMON: You can count on that, Mr. President. But let's go back to 2013. OK? This is what Donald Trump said to Fox News ahead of a government shutdown when Barack Obama was still president.
Good morning. Welcome to your NEW DAY. We are in Houston. Alisyn's in New York. Republicans want a dog fight, and, boy, did they get one. We have seen nothing like what went down on last night's final GOP debate stage right before Super Tuesday.
Former Vice President Joe Biden, the leader in national polls of the Democratic presidential primary, says the federal government should use tariffs on low-cost dumped foreign steel in an effort to protect domestic steel producers. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders is promising to create union, family-wage jobs in steel manufacturing. Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren has criticized the Trump administration for how it has granted exemptions to Trump's own steel tariffs -- complaining that the administration's acts have undermined American steel producers. South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg is calling for net-zero emissions from industry, including steel and concrete, manufacturing, and agriculture sectors, by 2050 -- so environmental improvements in steel production, not the end of steel production.
In his Thursday evening address, delivered from the White House and timed to reach the broadest swath of Americans, officials said Biden would both reflect on one of the darkest years in recent memory while leaning heavily into a message that, through collective effort, the end is in sight.
But after that the debate turned to Clinton, and Trump's constant attacks were effective. The problem is that while Trump is an eccentric candidate, Clinton is a poor one. She struggled to explain why she was running, overused cliches and gave lawyerly answers that sounded like she was squirming. She even let Trump tell a good gag at her expense about Abraham Lincoln.
The executive budget has always been a messaging document, Mick Mulvaney, the director of the Office of Management and Budget, said Monday. What are the messages this year? There's two primary messages. Number one: You don't have to spend all of this money, Congress, but if you do, here's how we would prefer to see you spend it. … And the other message is that we do not have to have trillion dollar deficits forever.
Another crucial mistake by the presidential hopeful was his failure to control the vitriol coming from his Bernie Bro supporters. One example: After Joe Biden trounced Sanders in South Carolina by garnering 61% of the black vote, one Sanders supporter explained Biden's victory on Twitter, saying, People won't say it but the truth is that many voters in SC are low information voters. Which is a nice way to put it.
The problem is we're a low-tariff country. To import something into the United States is not very expensive, but many of these countries we can't export to because their tariffs are too high. And so I am in favor of deals that allow us to bring down those tariffs so that America can sell things to all these people around the world.

I talked to one delegate who told me that he was almost shaking when he was telling me about it, saying it's very under the radar that it's not entirely clear who or how many people will show up, but this delegate in particular is a vice-chair of the Republican Party in his home state and he said he will lose that as designation once he does this, but he says he doesn't feel like he has a choice.

Trump would not actually run until the next cycle, but his speech in 2011 had all the hallmarks of his 2016 campaign and term in office. He criticized the United States for being the laughingstock of the world and claimed that the leaders of other countries were taking advantage of America. Trump stated he was pro-life and against gun control, Obamacare and raising taxes. Jumping among the day's news items -- high gas prices, the sale of the New York Stock Exchange to a German company, the Somali pirate attacks -- Trump boasted he would be able to handle it much better than the current leaders.

Cruz has been arguing for months now that he is the candidate best positioned to unify the Republican Party ahead of the November battle. But his support among his many Senate and House colleagues has been tepid at best – with a handful of senators only recently endorsing him.
Pressure had been building on the White House to launch a special enrollment period to allow the uninsured to purchase Obamacare policies. The decision came the same day that President Donald Trump warned of a painful two-week stretch ahead as infections continue to spread.
We certainly accomplished a lot that is sometimes overshadowed, Short told CNN in a recent interview, looking back on what his West Wing legacy will be, citing regulatory reform and judge confirmations. You go back and think of things that you could have done differently. The failure to repeal (Obamacare) was certainly a disappointment. It was a disappointment that when given a chance to, that some wavered in that, Short said.

He's hitting something that is socially unnatural. And so what is that? You're attacking somebody that died seven months ago, Scaramucci told CNN's John Berman on New Day.

One of the single biggest promises I made to the American people was to replace the disastrous NAFTA trade deal. In fact, unfair trade is perhaps the single biggest reason that I decided to run for President. Following NAFTA's adoption, our Nation lost one in four manufacturing jobs. Many politicians came and went, pledging to change or replace NAFTA – only to do absolutely nothing. But unlike so many who came before me, I keep my promises. Six days ago, I replaced NAFTA and signed the brand new United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) into law.

Republican California Rep. Devin Nunes, ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee, appeared on Fox News and criticized the Intelligence Committee Inspector General Michael Atkinson. Trump claimed he was quoting Nunes when he tweeted on January 12, The Democrats know the ICIG is a major problem-didn't release his testimony. Looks so much like everything else we've seen, from the Russia Hoax, to the Ukraine Hoax that became the Impeachment Scam. Must get the ICIG answers by Friday because this is the guy who lit the fuse.
Klobuchar is markedly more centrist than many of the other Democrats running for President, including some of her colleagues in the Senate.

NEWMAN: Well, first of all, sketch comedy is the most fun thing you can imagine ever, and we all came from that background. But what was significant about working with Gilda in that context is that it's live TV. Things can go wrong. But then she would come up with something that really kind of saved the day. And I think we were doing a Howdy Doody sketch, and this is in the documentary, by the way.

Again, it's debatable that the economy needed reviving when he took office. It's been growing for more than a decade. He did move to cut many regulations — but there are serious environmental impacts for those moves. Further, that tax cut bill, which permanently cut corporate rates and temporarily cut individual rates, has made the national deficit skyrocket to more than $1 trillion per year. The national debt goes unmentioned in this speech, which is an incredible thing for a Republican president.

And Sen. Gary Peters, the newly installed chair of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, told reporters recently that not only will the bill be something his members can run on in 2022, but it will be something they use against Republican candidates.
Rubio, for his part, has been less aggressive going after Cruz on the airwaves in Iowa, instead devoting his focus to New Hampshire. But in stump speeches and interviews, Rubio frequently criticizes Cruz for his vote to reform the NSA surveillance program, which Rubio argues removed a valuable tool from counterterrorism efforts, and has used the vote to characterize Cruz as soft on security.
But up to 28 days or so, you know, if you have any other of these symptoms I am describing, you really do need to get checked it out and that's a message we've been giving to everybody who's concerned about this.
He has blamed the media and an inherited  very obsolete system  over the testing problems. He has blamed China for not warning the world sooner about the virus. (Fauci has acknowledged that Trump has exaggerated how long ago China could have possibly issued a warning). He has criticized people who are suing him over various matters, since it's unfair, and noted that he donates his presidential salary even though nobody said thank you.
LEMON: Filings today giving greater detail about the Trump campaign's links to Russia. A big question now, what will the incoming Congress do about it? We're going to talk to a member of the House Intelligence Committee next.
Trump is intent, it seems, on undoing the key international and domestic accomplishments of the Obama administration. The question is: does he have a plan B that makes any sense? Trump said he would repeal and replace Obamacare, but when it came down to it he and the Republican Party didn't have a real viable plan to do so.
A fellow senator who caucuses with the Democrats, independent senator Angus King of Maine as well as Obama's former energy secretary Ernest Moniz say they don't think that this plan is realistic.

In some other time, in some other job or position, the conversation might have ended there. But her proximity to power, and the promise of her moderating influence, made the line go viral.

Trump: I never was a fan of McCain, I never will be
Keeping the government running is an obligation – but Republicans, especially the President, are eager to dispel the unflattering reviews of their performance on Obamacare by moving onto another goal, tax reform.
MORGAN: I mean, having said that, is anyone raising any eyebrows about the fact that it later emerged this woman was unarmed, didn't have a gun on her and certainly the scenes you see earlier on when the police all surrounded with their raised firearms, you know, there could be questions I guess raised about whether the use of deadly force was completely legitimate here.

Even more concerning, experts are waiting to see whether insurers want to remain on the exchanges in 2019 if policyholders are older and sicker. For a while last year, it looked like tens of thousands of people could have had no choice of insurer in 2018 as carriers dropped out amid all the uncertainty in Washington D.C. However, state officials were able to convince insurers to cover all the so-called bare counties before open enrollment began in November.

A.B. STODDARD, ASSOCIATE EDITOR & COLUMNIST, REALCLEARPOLITICS: People are pleased with the economy, but they are upset with President Trump about other things. Mark is right. He plays to a 35 percent portion of the country. He spends a lot of energy on culture wars and trying to get NFL players fire and tries to distract away from the subjects that everyone has bipartisan support in the '80s and '90s on infrastructure. He rarely talks about policy and how Republicans are going to save the day and Democrats are obstructionists. He had a chance to be more popular than on election day. He could have moved to the middle, but he didn't do it and continues to enjoy this game of everything being a base play.

And our country would've saved a trillion dollars and we would've had great healthcare. So he campaigned, he told us hours before that he was going to repeal and replace, and then for some reason, I think I understand the reason, he ended up going thumbs up, and frankly, had we even known that, I think we would've gotten the vote cause we could've gotten somebody else.

In addition to Trump's willingness to threaten personal pain at the negotiating table, these three examples also share the fact that none of the problems have been solved.

Cruz is wrong in his characterization of the Gulf War bombing campaign. The air attacks conducted during the Gulf War were precision-targeted, with laser-guided bombs designed to hit enemy fighters and minimize collateral damage. That is the mirror opposite of carpet bombing, which is an indiscriminate attack blanketing an area with explosives. The United States hasn't engaged in attacks that could be described as carpet bombing since the Vietnam War. In 1977, the Geneva Conventions adopted a protocol that banned indiscriminate air attacks of cities and towns with large concentrations of civilians.

OLIVIA NUZZI, WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT, NEW YORK MAGAZINE: Well, it's not just that she had a best-selling book. She had the best-selling book of 2018. I think she sold an estimated 2 million copies in its first 15 days of release, if I am getting that correct. It's pretty staggering.

We might let this go if it was a one-time slip, but it wasn't. Intentionally or unintentionally, Trump has repeatedly moved the dates of his accomplishments closer to the present.

The proposed regulation would also allow associations to base rates on gender and age, which could leave younger men paying less but older workers and women saddled with higher rates. Currently, the Affordable Care Act bans basing premiums on gender and limits the amount that can be based on age. However, plans would not be allowed to set premiums based on workers' health status.
Speaking at a health care symposium at Geisinger Medical Center near Danville, Pennsylvania, Clinton said compromise should be a key tenet for improving health care in the United States.

If they want to, they can rip apart the entire health care system. They have the votes in the House, they have the votes in the Senate, they have the new President coming in, the Michigan Democrat told CNN's Erin Burnett on Erin Burnett OutFront.

After 24 months of rapid progress, our economy is the envy of the world, our military is the most powerful on earth, and America is winning each and every day. Members of Congress: the State of our Union is strong. Our country is vibrant and our economy is thriving like never before.
Trump has previously argued that if Cruz won the Republican nomination, Democrats would argue that the Canada-born Texas senator was ineligible for the presidency. Last month, Trump asked a rally if he should sue Cruz just for fun over the issue.
In another time, with another President, the department would enjoy the benefit of the doubt. Delrahim would be taken at his word in the absence of compelling evidence to the contrary, and the debacle would be analyzed by most, as it may well have been, a principled but overaggressive litigation.
Republicans have long wanted to implement block grants as a way to curtail Medicaid spending, but its inclusion in the GOP bills to repeal and replace Obamacare helped doom the legislation in 2017. The description of the guidance given to journalists doesn't mention the words block grant.

The Senate bill would make sweeping cuts to Medicaid, get rid of the individual mandate, and eliminate Obamacare's taxes on the wealthy and insurers. It would also prevent federal funds from reimbursing Planned Parenthood for any health services it provides.

Sin embargo, parece que nada hace cambiar su conducta a pesar de que se perjudica y de que exaspera a sus partidarios.

Klobuchar spent the lead-up to the town hall with a trip through Wisconsin and Iowa, building on her campaign theme of retaking Midwest communities that have drifted away from Democrats in recent years.

A GOP source familiar with the plans tells CNN that while there have been phone calls and one-on-one conversations, senators are making their own choices about objections. The House is learning about some of their plans second-hand. And while House members are lined up and prepared to challenge six states -- Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin -- they recognize that those efforts only go somewhere if a senator is willing to sign on.

The House and Senate could move as soon as next week on a budget resolution that gives committees instructions to begin work on the $1.9 trillion relief bill. While not every Democrat has publicly voiced how they would vote on the resolution and the price tag of the bill is still up for debate, many have said they are comfortable taking that first step even if they have concerns about what will ultimately end up being included in a package.
The Republican Party will not stop until that becomes a reality. And that's why we need to stop Hillary Clinton. A Clinton presidency only means more debt, more ObamaCare, and more hard-working families never seeing a raise. If Hillary Clinton is given the chance, she'll stack the deck with the Supreme Court, with activist left wing judges who will treat the constitution like a doormat. You can kiss your gun rights good-bye if she ever finds her way into the White House. In foreign policy, a Clinton presidency means forgetting our friends and enabling our enemies. Just look, just look at her disastrous Iran nuclear deal which lined the pockets of the world's number one state sponsor of terrorism with your money while abandoning our greatest ally in the Middle East, the nation of Israel.

Why he's important: Jones was lucky to win a special election in 2017 to take the Senate seat left vacant when Jeff Sessions left to become Trump's first attorney general. Now Jones could face Sessions, who is running for his old seat, in 2020. If there's a pickup opportunity for Republicans, this is it. While Jones has broken with Democrats on some key issues, he's all in on impeachment.

Facts First: Trump can criticize House Democrats for being in too much of a rush with their impeachment inquiry to subpoena Bolton, Trump's former national security adviser. But it's not true that they didn't want Bolton. Democrats asked Bolton on October 30 to testify voluntarily on November 7. He declined to appear -- because Trump's White House directed current and former administration officials not to participate in the inquiry.

While Obamacare plans can be pricey, the federal government provides premium subsidies for lower- and moderate-income folks -- a category many newly unemployed may fall into. Individuals with incomes up to roughly $50,000 a year or families of four making up to than $103,000 generally qualify for help.

CUOMO: Here's the question. The president seemed to suggest that he was going to come in from the outside and do better for people. How is what's happening right now a reflection of that? It was an end-run around the procedure. You now have them voting on things his own party isn't sure about, and the only thing that seems clear is that the Republicans want to make good on their promise to destroy Obamacare, and they'll see that as a political win with their base. But how is that better for people?
During his first presidential campaign, Trump set a goal of 4% economic growth nationally, despite skepticism from economists. While Trump heavily leaned on his economic accomplishments throughout his time in office, annual GDP growth since 2017 never reached 4%, according to data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis. The quarterly GDP growth rate did hit 4% once, in the 4th quarter of 2020 , though economists say that wasn't enough to make up for the year's historically awful second quarter. 2020 also marked the first year US GDP declined since 2009.
Absent those levels of urgency, and a sense among enough lawmakers that actively supporting new restrictions is a pragmatic requirement, one they'll be confident defending in the next campaign, action is unlikely. But even that might not be enough. The issue is too simply too hot. The backlash is inevitable and, for politicians, unavoidable. Ultimately, something more will be required.

The administration faced more of an uphill battle to reach those who have remained uninsured at the start of the third year of the Obamacare exchanges. Also, several large insurers reported higher-than-expected costs in their exchange businesses, prompting at least one major player, UnitedHealth (UNH), to consider exiting the program next year.
The mission that drives us here today is to restore this beautiful American idea. What is that idea? That the condition of your birth does not determine the outcome of your life.

He's already moved into weaponizing the Mueller report – its full nearly 400 pages are yet to be released, though they're expected to be sent to Congress in mid-April if not sooner – as an example of the broad-scale conspiracy by the so-called deep state against him. (He offers no evidence for those claims, of course.)
My father was his kryptonite in life, he was his kryptonite in death. On a personal level, I agree with you, all of us have love and families, and when my father was alive, up until adulthood, we would spend our time together cooking, hiking, fishing, really celebrating life, and I think it's because he almost died, she said. And I just thought, 'your life is spent on the weekend not with your family, not with your friends, but you're obsessing, obsessing over great men you could never live up to.' That tells you everything you need to know about his pathetic life right now.
By then, he had already promised universal coverage. When he was a presidential candidate in 2015, Trump told CBS's Scott Pelley on 60 Minutes that everybody's got to be covered. He conceded that it may be an un-Republican thing to say, but he wanted to ensure that everyone had quality health care.

The senator from Texas has never strayed from the right-wing of the GOP.

Throughout his relatively short congressional career, he has done more than almost any other politician to champion the ideas of tea party conservatism.
Our roaring economy has, for the first time ever, given many former prisoners the ability to get a great job and a fresh start.

Axing the mandate, which requires nearly all Americans to have health insurance or pay a penalty, would likely wreak havoc on the Obamacare market. It would remove the stick that the health reform law wields to prod younger and healthier people to sign up for coverage.
CRUZ: Of course it does. And we've seen for seven years a president that has made the presidency and has made, sadly, his administration a laughing stock in the world.

This week, Aetna announced it plans to withdraw from 11 of the 15 states where it currently offers health insurance through public exchanges. It is the latest blow for Americans who depend on Obamacare for their health insurance, and puts them in the crossfire between the federal government and the health insurance companies whose proposed mergers it has just blocked. It's a battle that hurts everyone – and one that jeopardizes the Affordable Care Act.

Sanders and Warren seemed eager to defuse tensions over a year-old conversation that came to light recently. The occasional mild rebuke, such as Buttigieg suggesting we shouldn't measure the boldness of a health care plan by how many Americans it will alienate, sparked no drama or instant memes.

The case is the latest dispute concerning Obamacare to come before the justices and pits supporters of the contraceptive provision against those who say it violates their religious and moral beliefs.

Facts First: The individual mandate, which required Americans to obtain health insurance, was indeed a key part of Obamacare -- but Trump hasn't killed Obamacare, essentially or otherwise. He has not eliminated Obamacare's expansion of the Medicaid insurance program for low-income people, the federal and state marketplaces that allow people to shop for coverage, or the consumer subsidies that help many of them make the purchases.
Story highlights Every politician in Washington is watching to see what happens in Alabama. A Moore loss would be yet another mark against the already-struggling Trump.
Jones is a CNN host who does not make speeches on MSNBC. Jones has habitually given Trump credit for the justice reform bill, and he says he has never given an address in which he has thanked Sharpton for it and not Trump. Jones also says he has never cried when speaking with Trump about criminal justice reform. (100 percent fantasy, Jones said in a text message.)
So welcome to you all. Well, Star, it's beautiful to having you back to really talk in general terms about what is going on. What is your view? You hear that guy. It's a classic story isn't where people say all these furlough has don't really hurt people. They damn well hurt people like hell.
MARQUARDT: Wait and see it is.
CAMEROTA: Governor, I want to ask you about the shelters, because the numbers that we're getting just seem like only a fraction of the people in Puerto Rico took advantage of the safety of a shelter, something like 11,000 evacuated their homes and headed to a shelter. But you have 3.5 million people. Why didn't more go?
MARIOTTI: Yes. It's pretty astounding, and you have to imagine right now that if Donald Trump is watching this, his steam is coming out of his ears, and he wants Matt Whitaker to do something about this.
White House Senior Advisor and President Donald Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner reads a statment in front of West Wing of the White House after testifying behind closed doors to the Senate Intelligence Committee about Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election July 24, 2017 in Washington, DC.
I have met the men and women of Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Indiana, New Hampshire, and many other States whose dreams were shattered by NAFTA. For years, politicians promised them they would negotiate for a better deal. But no one ever tried – until now.
(CNN) The State of the Union address Tuesday night gives President Donald Trump the chance to shift from weakness to strength by spotlighting the resilient American economy.
But after aggressive intervention from the White House, Trump's political team and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, the GOP now has one candidate in each of those races – giving the party nothing to worry about in Tuesday's primaries in two of the most important Senate battlegrounds on the 2018 midterm map.

Facts First: It is standard for presidents to inherit dozens of vacancies. : It is standard for presidents to inherit dozens of vacancies. According to Wheeler , there were 53 vacancies on January 1, 2009, just before Obama took office; 80 vacancies on January 1, 2001, just before George W. Bush took office; 107 vacancies on January 1, 1993, just before Bill Clinton took office.
COOPER: All right, Deborah Feyerick. Appreciate the reporting.
If you want to consider how destabilizing even this test might have been, a short time ago the Pentagon spokesman explained to reporters the view of the Defense Department was this missile posed a potential threat when it was launched to aircraft, civilian aircraft flying in the region, satellites overhead because it achieved such a high altitude. Shipping in the Sea of Japan. We asked why, then, if it was such a threat, it wasn't shot down. The spokesman saying it did not pose a direct threat to the United States at this time.
For all of the White House's talk that they want to let Alabama voters decide on their senator, Trump has put a major thumb on the scale for Moore in the last 10 days. Which means Trump has skin in the game. Which means he has to own a loss by Moore – if that happens. (You can be sure Trump will claim credit for pulling Moore over the line if the GOP nominee wins.)
Additionally, a spate of negative headlines about Klobuchar's demanding management style have trickled out around her 2020 announcement.
The former aide also speculated about why only a few Republicans have criticized Trump's comments, saying that it's likely because they don't want to get in the Twitter crosshairs.
CRUZ: And one of the things that is critically important. Listen, we've got lots of challenges in the world. But the answer can't just be wave a magic wand and say problem go away. You have to understand the problems. You have to have real solutions.

The statement was just one of Trump's handful of tweets on the subject.
Vindman testified that the transcript was substantively correct even without the changes he had proposed. When I first saw the transcript without the two substantive items that I had attempted to include, I didn't see that as nefarious. I just saw it as, OK, no big deal. You know, these might be meaningful, but it's not that big a deal, he told the House Intelligence Committee in November
The milestone elicited kind words even from his Democratic counterpart.
OLIVIER KNOX, YAHOO! NEWS: It's also the core - as Julie alluded to be, it's one of the core messages. It's this or nothing, which is a very interesting argument, especially with - when the president is saying, hold on, well, maybe the - maybe it's an opening bid. It's really interesting to watch how this White House is ramping up its pressure campaign to get this passed. It looks - with the exception of the president's tweets - it's pretty conventional. It is a lot of regional interviews from the White House grounds. It is presidential and vice presidential travel. Vice President Pence is going to Kentucky this weekend. And it's this. This is another - this is another component of this multipronged attack.
LEMON: So with the Mueller investigation flexing its muscles today revealing just how much they know about the Trump campaign and how much former Trump aides have told them, it was another bad day for the President. Let's discuss now. Michael D'Antonio, he is the author of The Truth about Trump. Also Susan Glasser of The New Yorker. Good evening.

CNN no ha confirmado esa información y el secretario de prensa de la Casa Blanca, Sean Spicer, dice que los planes no provienen de la Casa Blanca.

Why did they do it? They did it for America – they did it for us.
So, the last thing we want to do is prevent our ability to actually get law made. So, it really is a conversation about the third prong approach -- the other bills we're going to pass outside of reconciliation, which in the House we're a majority body we can pass -- that go the Senate.

CASEY: Well, there's always a lot of back and forth that we -- if we roll the table of some of the things the other side says about our side or about the President which is even worse than to hear and even for Washington is bad. But, look I think most Americans can see through that. They know that there are two facts, there's a bill on the floor that could be passed tomorrow, not tonight but tomorrow when they come back and this end -- that would end the crisis.
It's an outstanding program that I hope folks on both sides of the aisle see it is a way to save and help people who truly need it, and it can be replicated, Brooks said.
Mostly, though, he again took the opportunity to rail at both parties: Republicans, he said, had offered no alternative to Obamacare. Progressive Democrats who are for pushing Medicare for all, Schultz claimed, had not accurately assessed the potential downside.

Mexico is spending a significant amount of money to help the US on migration issues, deploying thousands of troops to both its Guatemala border and its US border to thwart would-be asylum seekers.

The most revealing false claim: Pelosi and the speech
Though mental illness remains stigmatized, and to hugely varying degrees across race and wealth status, the conversation around it has evolved. The media is moving away from some of the derogatory language it used so thoughtlessly even a few years ago. But for those not wealthy enough to check into rehab facilities or access even basic care, the right words are far from enough to tackle a growing and dangerous problem.

Wages are rising at the fastest pace in decades, and growing for blue collar workers, who I promised to fight for, faster than anyone else. Nearly 5 million Americans have been lifted off food stamps. The United States economy is growing almost twice as fast today as when I took office, and we are considered far and away the hottest economy anywhere in the world. Unemployment has reached the lowest rate in half a century. African-American, Hispanic-American and Asian-American unemployment have all reached their lowest levels ever recorded. Unemployment for Americans with disabilities has also reached an all-time low. More people are working now than at any time in our history — 157 million.

TRUMP: They have no angle. I know every angle. No, they have no angle. The military under past leadership, including for many years was taken advantage of by other countries. Allies and not allies, they were taken advantage of. Our country has to be respected. We're not respected when we do that. When horrible things are happening on trade where we have barriers put up, where we have tariffs put on and we open our country up, we just open it up, where cars are sent into our country with virtually no tax, no nothing and yet they won't accept our cars, when cars are sent in and they pay no tax but we're expected to pay 25, 40, 50 percent and we pay nothing, I'll be honest with you, it's just not in my DNA.
COOPER: It's important for you to know all the details no matter how horrible.
As president, I will not be neutral. And let me say this week, a Texan, Taylor Force. He was an Eagle Scout, he was a West Point graduate, he was an Army veteran. He was murdered by a Palestinian terrorist this week in Israel, and I don't think we need a commander in chief…
The Delgado bill would create a public insurance option on the Affordable Care Act exchanges, alongside the private insurance plans. The goal would be to give Americans more choices when buying Obamacare coverage, particularly in areas where few carriers participate. The proposal would set premiums for public plan enrollees to cover all the benefit costs, including administrative expenses.
We won't be contributing to the economy because we are going broke paying our health insurance, said Christensen, a substitute teacher who also grows vegetables and flowers to sell at a farmer's market. But there is that one ounce of doubt that we may need it for a huge medical expense next year -- you never know.
TAPPER: Senator, you have worked with Chris Christie very closely. You two are famously or infamously close both professionally and you're also friends. I assume you're not going to vote for him, however, next month when he is up for re-election.
The end result (and the lesson for any lawmaker) is the same, however. Collins gave away the valuable thing she had and didn't get what she wanted in return.
Republicans have responded by lambasting the bill as too expensive and a labeling it a socialist wish list. They have also attempted to tie it to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, not Biden. Michael McAdams, spokesman for the National Republican Congressional Committee, said that history could repeat itself, even if the bill is popular now.
The move was designed by newly empowered Democrats to put Republicans on the record voting for or against protecting Obamacare and its safeguards for those with pre-existing conditions. The GOP has for years fought against the law, with House Republicans voting in 2017 for repeal.

CAREY-JONES: We don't. We're still trying to find out. We're not sure. We just were told that she's safe.
The prospect of reaching across the aisle, in pursuit of good-faith compromise, has also struck many as out of touch with the moment, especially as Democrats fight with one arm against GOP efforts to undercut Obamacare – like they did in eliminating the individual mandate late last year – and the other to chart a path toward expanding coverage and care to millions of the uninsured.

Senator Elizabeth Warren had a very good debate. It seems that the challenges she has faced in the past few weeks, such as her slide in the polls and frustration with her shifting positions on Medicare for All , strengthened her resolve and sharpened her focus.

Justin Walker is in every way the wrong nominee at the wrong time for the D.C. Circuit, said Marge Baker, executive vice president for policy and program of the liberal group People for the American Way. In the middle of a pandemic, the idea that Mitch McConnell would prioritize the advancement of a demonstrably anti-health care judicial nominee is outrageous, she said.
I think the President just listed off the names of people he's spoken to on the phone about health care, one Senate Republican aide told CNN.
And let me put this into context as well. This is not the only storm that is looming over this island. There is an economic crisis, $70 billion in debt. So the rebuilding that is already being talked about by the governor and the people of Puerto Rico is not going to be easy by any means.
Facts First: Trump was mixing up two separate issues. While the Trump administration does have : Trump was mixing up two separate issues. While the Trump administration does have new agreements with all Guatemala and Honduras, those agreements are related to the handling of people who come to the US seeking asylum, not criminals the US is seeking to deport.

MILLER: I don't see how. It's about the physical phone. It's not about hacking into the system. The Apple that says that they're so worried about this back door also encourages users to pay Apple to store large amounts of data in the cloud, which is far more vulnerable to hackers than the actual device where you'd have to figure out the code.
Lo sorprendente (casi impresionante) sobre Donald Trump es la consistencia entre el candidato y el presidente.
Klobuchar's primary pitch to voters is likely to be electability. The Democrat has been notably successful in Minnesota, winning her three terms in the Senate by an average of 26 percentage points. Klobuchar won re-election in 2018 with 60% of the vote, two years after Trump came within two points of defeating Hillary Clinton in the state.
Facts First: Trump was relying on Van Drew's figures, so this is perhaps less egregious than when Trump makes his own inflated claims about crowds, but nonetheless, both men were way off. Ben Rose, director of marketing and public relations for the Greater Wildwoods Tourism Improvement and Development Authority, told CNN that the authority estimates there were between 3,000 and 3,500 people in the parking lot outside Trump's rally venue and between 2,000 and 2,500 people at a park across the street. Wildwood Mayor Pete Byron told CNN that, after speaking with the city's fire chief and police chief, he estimated there were 14,000 or 15,000 people in town for the rally, including people inside the venue.

TAPPER: Meanwhile, Governor Ralph Northam is fending off his own calls to resign, after he admitted to wearing blackface in 1984.
So this ain't a conversation about people of color. This is a conversation about anti black racism, white supremacy in the United States of America.
But roughly three-quarters of Americans prefer other proposals to expand Medicare or Medicaid, Kaiser found. Some 77% favor allowing people age 50 to 64 to buy into Medicare, while 75% would allow people who don't have job-based insurance to buy into Medicaid, the government health insurance program for low-income Americans.

Biden said he made a mistake in casting a 2002 vote , as a senator from Delaware, to give President George W. Bush the authority to go to war in Iraq. But he said he cast the vote because the Bush administration had said they were just going to get inspectors into Iraq to check for weapons of mass destruction -- and that, once Bush actually went to war, he became immediately opposed: From that point on, I was in the position of making the case that it was a big, big mistake.

The novel coronavirus, Covid-19, is one of the most contagious diseases in the world. Key to controlling its spread is early diagnosis with widespread, accessible and free testing, followed by aggressive contact tracing and quarantining of contacts.
To keep new cases from entering our shores, we will be suspending all travel from Europe to the United States for the next 30 days...There will be exemptions for Americans who have undergone appropriate screenings...These restrictions will also not apply to the United Kingdom. -- March 11 Oval Office address to the nation on the coronavirus
The Trump administration also waged a multi-front battle looking to chip away at abortion access throughout the President's tenure.
Tonight's debate did not shake up the race. The 60% of undecided caucus voters in Iowa will likely leave this debate still undecided. Biden had a steady performance with particularly strong answers on foreign policy and a demonstration of the ability to not only fight Trump but also heal the country. But Biden's performance was not a home run, as many of his answers were just lackluster. The same goes for Pete Buttigieg. While Mayor Pete was solid, he never achieved that memorable debate moment.

I didn't want to be there in first place, to be honest, and everybody knows that. That was when I was a civilian, I said it.

QUESTION: Can you say what some of those options might be?
CRUZ: Actually that's incorrect. There are two different agreements. There's TPA and TPP. I opposed TPP and have always opposed TPP, which is what you asked about. And when it comes to trade, look, free trade, when we open up foreign markets, helps Americans. But we're getting killed in international trade right now. And we're getting killed because we have an administration that's doesn't look out for American workers and jobs are going overseas. We're driving jobs overseas.
The schoolchildren who faced water hoses and police dogs in Birmingham gave the civil rights movement one of its most iconic victories. But a new generation of activists has arisen in the city with another message:

Speaking in general terms, and not the specific docket, Kagan noted that in some of the high-profile cases the justices don't often need a fresh look at an issue they've long considered. They know pretty well how they feel about a particular subject in part because they've seen similar cases on the same subject many times before, so they've developed a way of thinking about an area of the law, Kagan said.
And I think that there's -- there's bipartisan agreement we have got to secure the border. I think there are some members of leadership on the Democratic side, in particular Speaker Pelosi, who is really out there on her own, saying things like walls are immoral and she will only allow $1 for a wall.
PENDERS: It's going to be difficult to handle. There's no questioning that. You know, telling me they're going to pay me down the road doesn't help me today when I have to pay the power bill. I have to pay the water bill, you know. And I have to pay insurance. I have to go to the pharmacy and buy medications from my daughter. Well, how am I supposed to pay for it when I have no money today or when I get paid on my next pay day? You know, promising me something down the road doesn't help me today.
Bloomberg on Tuesday took a swing at President Donald Trump when the debate turned to the deadly coronavirus, which is spreading around the world and sparked a massive selloff this week in the stock market.
President Donald Trump's attacks on the late Sen. John McCain are stupid and socially unnatural, Anthony Scaramucci said Thursday.
This is a smart, strategic, see-through steel barrier – not just a simple concrete wall. It will be deployed in the areas identified by border agents as having the greatest need, and as these agents will tell you, where walls go up, illegal crossings go way down.
But what Trump's comments about McCain should remind us of is this: Whether there is political gain to be found in dishonoring a lifelong public servant, it is simply wrong. It is not who we are – or who we should be. That everyone – Republicans, Democrats, independents and all the rest – won't come together to say that as one is profoundly depressing and disappointing.
And I wish you peace and strength in the days ahead.

Slavitt: What I believe is that there are a number of ideas, including new ideas, that are going to be necessary to get to where we want to get. I believe that it's going to take a number of years from where we are today, so for someone who believes in single-payer, Medicare for all, I hope that you can also be for other things that are good for people in the meantime, and that those things might even build the ability to get there.

Republicans have a narrow two-seat Senate majority. Given the vocal anti-Trump wing (John McCain, Jeff Flake, Bob Corker) and the number of moderate skeptics (Lisa Murkowski, Susan Collins) within the Republican Senate conference, it's already very, very difficult to get legislation passed. (See: Obamacare, repeal of.) If Jones managed to win – and polling is all over the map on the race – then Republicans would be down to a single-seat edge until next November.

After Guzmán's conviction in 2019, he was sent to a Supermax prison in Colorado in which many prisoners are held in long-term solitary confinement . Human rights group Amnesty International has complained that the use of prolonged isolation at the prison amounts to a violation of international law.
TRUMP: I think India should be involved in Afghanistan. I gave our generals all the money they wanted. They didn't do such a great job in Afghanistan. They've been fighting in Afghanistan for 19 years. General Mattis thanked me profusely for getting him several hundred billion and thanked me more the following year when I got him $716 billion. He couldn't believe it because our military was depleted. Now we're rebuilding our military. Pat was very responsible for a lot of the orders for the new F-35 fighter jets and F-18s including ships and missiles and everything. But General Mattis was so thrilled. But what's he done for me? How has he done in Afghanistan? Not too good. Not too good. I'm not happy with what he's done in Afghanistan and I shouldn't be happy. But he was very thankful when I got him $700 billion and the following year $716 billion. So, I wish him well. I hope he does well. But as you know, President Obama fired him and essentially so did i. I want results.

LEMON: Michelle Obama, the former First Lady, is America's most admired woman. That's according to a new poll. And you've got to see who she knocked off the top spot after a 17-year winning streak.
Meanwhile, moderates such as Biden, Buttigieg and Klobuchar favor building on the Affordable Care Act. They would add to the Obamacare exchanges a government-backed public option, which would presumably have lower premiums and would compete with the private insurers. They would also boost federal subsidies so more people could afford coverage.
People need to be held accountable for this. One of the things I'm proudest of is that in my time in the U.S. Senate working with Jeff Miller here from Florida in a bipartisan way, and I'll give him credit - Bernie Sanders was a part of this - we passed a V.A. accountability bill. And what it did is it created now a law that gives the V.A. secretary, because of the law I passed, it gives the V.A. secretary the power to fire people that aren't doing a good job.
The administration justified the budget cuts by saying it was basing advertising on effectiveness and performance. Democrats and Obamacare supporters quickly decried the move as sabotage.

LEMON: Don't read ahead in the textbook, if you will.
But the move could light a match to a simmering debate within the Democratic Party, pitting Sanders against other candidates, including some of the Senate bill's co-sponsors, over the best path toward universal coverage. It is a fight Sanders appears to welcome. During the early stages of the 2020 campaign, he has relentlessly attacked private insurers, arguing that their presence is a malign influence on the whole of American health care – a step, both rhetorically and on the policy front, that his opponents have so far refused to match.
Facts First: By several measures, US air was : By several measures, US air was cleaner under Obama than it has been under Trump . Three of the six types of pollutants identified by the Clean Air Act as toxic to human health were more prevalent in the air as of 2018 than they were before Trump took office, according to Environmental Protection Agency data.

Health reimbursement arrangements allow employers to give workers cash to buy coverage elsewhere.
State officials refused to say whether the expansion would continue if Congress repealed Obamacare and eliminated funds for Medicaid expansions. If that happened, it's unlikely states would have the money to make up for the lost federal aid.
Watch members' comments over the next several days while they are home on recess to get clues to how much of a lift this is going to be for the House speaker.
As Bloomberg blanketed the airwaves over the next four months, critics complained that he was trying to buy the election.

Every slur and slander from 30 years of unhinged Clinton hatred was dragged before the audience of uncommitted voters (is there really such a thing as a Muslim American uncommitted voter?). None of the attacks stuck, because they seemed nasty and irrelevant, and put Trump in the position of being a barker for a particularly unpleasant sideshow.
The top question on everyone's mind was how Trump would handle the issue of the tape in which he speaks in deeply offensive ways about women. On that topic, he showed he absolutely does not get it. This was locker room talk, he said several times (then awkwardly pivoted to talk about ISIS.) And even though he added, I'm not proud of it. I apologize..., the repeated mantra that it was locker room talk showed he believes it's only natural, really OK for men to refer to women in those terms, and perhaps even to sexually assault women in the way he described in that tape.
En los anales de la política estadounidense, ningún otro presidente ha hecho tanto para perjudicarse como Trump. Cualquier otro que hubiera llegado a la presidencia con un déficit de casi tres millones de votos populares se habría esforzado por liderar de forma digna y unificadora.
After anemic performances in the first three nominating clashes in Iowa, New Hampshire and Nevada, Biden bet everything on the Palmetto State and its diverse, more moderate electorate. A loss would likely have meant a humiliating end to a half-century-long presidential career, but his win will unleash a comeback narrative.
Facts First: Sanders has not said he will never do a deportation. He is calling for a temporary deportation freeze, not a permanent ban. While he is also proposing a permanent end to deportations of undocumented immigrants who have been in the US for five or more years, this is just one portion of the undocumented population.
MORGAN: And what is the combined impact?

After the past 48 hours, it's difficult to determine on what basis either candidate would win Sunday night's debate. Donald Trump was emerging out of the fallout from a blistering, embarrassing, potentially fatal recording of him suggesting he's used his celebrity to sexually assault women. In the hours before the debate, he gathered four women who claim they'd been victims of either Hillary Clinton's husband or her to exploit their pain for his own personal gain.

Multiple Senate sources familiar with the matter told CNN the arguments on both sides were made Wednesday morning on the minimum wage hike. The Senate's parliamentarian, Elizabeth MacDonough, has not yet ruled on the matter, and it's not clear yet when she will.

Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are two sides of the same coin. Both support raising taxes. Both supported Bill Clinton's nationwide ban on popular firearms. And both support letting transgender men go in little girls' bathrooms, a narrator says in an ad called Same.
The chief justice dissented in 2015 when Kennedy joined the four liberals to declare a right to same-sex marriage. He compared the court's decision to the infamous Dred Scott v.

Wheeler said Trump has appointed 187 judges by traditional counting methods -- two Supreme Court justices, 50 appeals court judges and 135 district court judges -- but that it's possible to get to a total of 191 judges by adding Trump's three appointments to the Court of Federal Claims and his designation of a sitting judge on that court as chief judge.

Commercial Metals announced a $250 million investment to build a micro-mill in Oklahoma. Nucor and a partner announced a $75 million investment in improvements at a mill in Arkansas. Ferrous CAL announced a $53 million investment in a Michigan plant to make steel for automotive companies.

No more fines or penalties!!! Trump took care of that!! Saved me 700 bucks this year!!!
So. Let's take a step back here and think of what happened here in Washington on Tuesday. Sitting next to the leader of a foreign country, the President of the United States went after a former Republican senator (and former GOP presidential nominee) who not only served in the Vietnam War but spent years of his life being tortured in a North Vietnamese prison camp. And this is a President who received several deferments during Vietnam, including for bone spurs. In an interview with The New York Times in 2016, Trump called the condition temporary and minor.

If you add in spending by outside groups supportive of Clinton's candidacy, the total is still just under $770 million, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Clinton did outspend Trump, but by less than double, not at least three times.

Cruz communication director Rick Tyler said Trump was having a Trumpertantrum, a line the Texas senator has used in recent weeks.
It is clear the Republican Party is the only party willing to fight for these values and lead America to greatness in the 21st century. You see, the dirty little secret Democrats don't want you to know is that they are the same party doing the same old thing.

Still, Roberts has remained largely nestled on the right-wing and, in a signature set of cases, has been consistent on fighting the use of affirmative action and racial remedies. It is a sordid business, this divvying us up by race, he wrote in a 2006 voting rights case. The following year, as he rejected school integration plans in Louisville and Seattle, he wrote, The way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race.
There was some debate on the issues -- Syria, the Supreme Court, health care and jobs. But the focus was on the candidates, each trying to outmaneuver, insult or corner the other.
The 307,000 number comes from a Veterans Affairs report released last September and it represents the number of pending records that belonged to veterans who had died in previous months. However, that number does not necessarily represent veterans who were actively seeking treatment in VA health care, according to the VA's inspector general.

On Tuesday, First Lady Melania Trump -- what an amazing photograph -- she hosted a White House tour for about 20 members of the Bush family. They got to spent time there, they've got to talk to people they used to work with in the residence.
Additionally, a spate of negative headlines about Klobuchar's demanding management style have trickled out around her 2020 announcement.
The president is tweeting saying that the bill is great. Why does the American medical association, the AARP, and even Republican governors say he's wrong? We're going to take you through two different lawmakers' perfective on this.
Facts First: CNN did not turn off its camera as Trump promoted Ingraham; it was serving as the pool camera feeding the speech to various networks. And CNN did not stop broadcasting Trump's speech; CNN was not even airing the speech live on television. (Also, CNN's photojournalists at Trump events have the tally lights on their cameras set permanently to off, so Trump would have no way of seeing from the stage even if they did ever turn a camera off.)

Obamacare revolutionized health insurance for people with pre-existing conditions. Under the health reform law, insurers could no longer deny coverage to consumers because of their medical history or base premiums on it. Also, carriers were required to cover 10 essential health benefits, including maternity care, mental health services and prescription drugs.
STODDARD: It will be triumphant. They've been very frustrated all year to repeal and replace Obamacare. They needed to win. It's a big one. And the president is a salesman. He's going to call it a middle-class and go on and on. This is a big accomplishment and a big rescue for them.
Arch-Trump supporter Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina said Monday that he would most likely support the nomination.
It's with that in mind that Trump backed his White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney's arguments that the administration should support a federal judge's ruling in Texas invalidating Obamacare in its entirety, a senior White House official and Republican close to the campaign told CNN.
House Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows issued a blunt warning to House Speaker Paul Ryan on Wednesday, suggesting if he fails to address conservatives' concerns on immigration he'll risk his top leadership post.

SCARAMUCCI: Because you just said I wasn't going answer it.
Can you talk to us, sort of in broad strokes about calls (inaudible) he's (inaudible) so far, leadership of Congress, folks outside of Congress, any governors, that sort of thing? Can you talk to us broadly about the message that he's sending and the people that he's talking to, both inside and outside of the administration?
So let me be clear, local control, obviously, high state standards. That's what it is in the state of Ohio.
Workers, get ready to pay more for health benefits next year.
Next week, they're going to trot out the same old Democrats with the same old message running the same old candidate. We are the party of new ideas in a changing and faster world than ever before. Democrats depend on super delegates and bureaucrats to sneak their agenda through the back door. We are the party of the grassroots. We honor what the voters say.
That's compared to 16% who think the cost will be better and 36% who feel it will be about the same.
San Diego used to have the most illegal border crossings in the country. In response, and at the request of San Diego residents and political leaders, a strong security wall was put in place. This powerful barrier almost completely ended illegal crossings.
The insurer ticked off a list of concerns, including continual changes in federal operations, rules and guidance and an increasing lack of overall predictability.
Geoffrey Stone, a member of the review committee appointed by the White House to examine the program, said in an interview with NBC News that the committee found that the bulk data collection program by itself could not be credited with stopping any really big attacks.
So in that moment, I saw a man getting knocked out in the floor, and they started hitting him with the helmet right on the floor.
Trump has not gotten Congress to give him the funds necessary for his wall. Here he says it's long, tall and powerful. A section of wall being improved blew over in a strong wind this week.

It was on her watch ISIS began to spread its wings of evil over the Middle East, and she has spent the last 16 months looking in the eyes of the American people and lying about how recklessly she jeopardized the American people, our national security, with her secret e-mail server. She lied. And she lied over and over and over and over. She lied. She lied.
Speaking of health care, the insurance system can be a confusing world to navigate. But if you don't understand how your plan works, you'll end up paying for it. Here's a cheat sheet on how not to get ripped off at the doctor's office.
That, in turn, could make insurers think twice about participating in the exchanges, especially since they would still be required to cover those with pre-existing conditions and not charge them more based on their medical history.
First of all, what is your reaction to this ruling out of Texas?
The merger is clearly not going well because the insurers are suing each other. Cigna sued Anthem on Tuesday, claiming Anthem breached the merger agreement, which included an obligation to pay a breakup fee of $1.85 billion. Cigna is also seeking $13 billion in damages.
It's not enough just to be sure that your resources can support you. You also want to have a comprehensive retirement income plan that spells out how you'll actually get the income you'll be relying on to support you throughout retirement.

John McCain was tortured for more than five years in Vietnam and survived for more than a year after being diagnosed with brain cancer in 2017.
But, really, it's been about the rare event. I mean, the northern extent of having tornado watches and warnings in February just does not happen when you get up to areas of Pennsylvania into New York. It's just unbelievable.
It is, to be certain, a limited move. There will be no video pictures of the black-robed nine as they question lawyers in cases, and the court is allowing access to real-time arguments only for special May sittings during the Covid-19 pandemic.

At her event in Goffstown, Klobuchar pitching herself as a candidate who can win independent and lean Republican voters. She pledged to go everywhere, not just where it is comfortable, but where it is uncomfortable and outlined a platform that included overturning Citizens United, reinstating the Voting Rights Act, rejoining the Paris Climate Accord and getting on the path toward a public option for health care.
JAKE TAPPER, CNN ANCHOR: Yeah, to unite the Republican Party and no one knows this challenge more than Reince Priebus. He's been bruised and battered during this election process, this campaign process. He had fought with Donald Trump's campaign very openly. They fought with him. He tried to calm things down.
And we saw just last week that she -- she said she was a Native American on her application for membership in at least one state bar association. You know, one wonders whether or not that's grounds for disbarment. If you misrepresent yourself on your application to the bar, I would say it probably is grounds for disbarment.
The Pennsylvania state unemployment rate was at 4.5% in December 2019, worse than the best rates under presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush. (The rate increased steadily in 2019 from the 3.8% rate in of April, May and June, which was the state's lowest rate since at least 1976.)
Trump has been clear when questioned about his support for the lawsuit to end Obamacare, which the Supreme Court is expected to take up next term .

Apple (AAPL), Google owner Alphabet (GOOGL), Microsoft (MSFT), Cisco (CSCO) and Oracle (ORCL) are collectively sitting on more than half a trillion dollars in cash. They're holding much of it overseas to take advantage of lower tax rates.
Or, on the flip side, Trump could take actions that seek to stabilize the market so insurers don't drop out before Republicans can put a replacement plan into effect. These might include bolstering Obamacare's risk program that aims to protect insurers with a disproportionate share of high-cost, sick enrollees or making it harder for Americans to sign up for coverage outside the open enrollment period.
SCARAMUCCI: I appreciate it. Thank you for letting me be here. Thank you. CUOMO: All right. Be well.
Scaramucci told Berman that he always got along with McCain, adding that he was a decorated Vietnam War veteran.
Association health plans may not be right for all small businesses or their workers. Depending on how they are set up, some plans won't be able to set premiums for a company based on its employees' health, which generally drives up rates for younger and healthier folks.
BUSH: Yes, and I agree. And we've laid out a detailed plan on how to reform it or the veterans' administration with outrageous management that doesn't provide care for the veterans even though there's been massive increases in spending.

My confidence in Abrams is not a dig on any other potential pick for vice president, but a recognition that leadership and experience can be gained in more than one way — and that the proof is not just a glossy cover letter, but the tangible results of hard work in communities across the country.
TOWNSEND: And so I think the media and the American people understand that and sort of allowed for that. The problem is, tomorrow is a month since the attack. It is hard to imagine that no one has talked to this woman. The autopsy in which -- was done at Dover Air Force base for all of the victims with FBI agents present is a well known fact. The results of that are understood by investigators and there is no excuse for not sharing that information with this victim's mother.
So, the president clearly owns this one. And this is so unnecessary, as Rachael said. Nothing is going to happen on this until January 3rd when the Democrats I think are going to probably pass one of three likely funding bills which I can get into if you'd like to hear them. But they'll have I think three options to reopen the government. Then you have to send a Democrat -- Senate Republicans to figure out how to proceed.
What nobody says -- this is very important to me: Why isn't Germany paying? Why isn't UK paying? Why isn't France paying? Why aren't the European nations paying? Why is it always the sucker -- United States? That's one. -- January 22 press conference in Davos, Switzerland
Continuing resolutions are hurting the readiness of our troops, endangering our troops, and for those of us defense hawks, we find it very difficult to support CRs, Byrne said. The alternative is to let the Democrats crash the whole government, and that's what they are trying to do.
JIMMY KIMMEL, LATE NIGHT HOST: This guy, Bill Cassidy, just lied right to my face. There's a new Jimmy Kimmel test for you, and it's called the lie detector test. You are welcome to stop by the studio and take it anytime. There you go.
He also blamed McCain for wars in the Middle East.
(CNN) George Washington is said to have told Thomas Jefferson that they should create the Senate to cool House legislation -- like a saucer cools hot tea.
Still, there are going to be some intra-party schisms on how this bill ultimately looks. Not all Democrats are comfortable with raising the minimum wage to $15, for example. In New York, that amount might make sense. In Montana and West Virginia -- where the cost of living skews much lower -- that kind of minimum wage could be the difference between a business staying profitable and not. That's why you have some Democrats arguing any minimum wage increase should be regional, while others are arguing that it should be phased in.
I've gotten to know many wonderful Angel Moms, Dads, and families – no one should ever have to suffer the horrible heartache they have endured.
The cost-sharing reduction payments go directly to insurers to reimburse them for reducing deductibles and co-pays for lower income enrollees. They are the subject of a court battle between the House of Representatives and the Trump administration, which inherited the case from the Obama administration. The subsidies are expected to cost $7 billion this year.
We must move to universal health care. And I am so proud of the work we did as a party to protect the Affordable Car Act, Klobuchar said Sunday. We are to the point now where Obamacare is more popular than the President.

It would be great to see Trump help Congress find spending discipline by forcing Congress to abandon its bipartisan, spend-by-omnibus tradition. He should veto any of these thousand-page, trillion-dollar bills that reach his desk.
It's a picture of a President who knows little of policy details and cares less and appears not to perceive the vast responsibilities of his role.
It's a shame that they, you know, that they didn't -- but I do think the point that de Blasio is making about how a lot of these technology platforms have exacerbated income inequality and it's hard to look away from the fact Jeff Bezos is the richest man in the entire world. And Amazon is a hugely successful corporation that, obviously, didn't need the tax breaks that were going to be spent.
Yes, you are giving money to the states directly as a block grant. Yes, some governors will like that. But you have some Republican governors, you've got the AMA, the American Medical Association, you got the AARP, you got the CBO who are all saying, no, this bill does not keep as many people covered as is the case right now.
On former House Speaker John Boehner's new gig on the board of a cannabis company
The former aide also speculated about why only a few Republicans have criticized Trump's comments, saying that it's likely because they don't want to get in the Twitter crosshairs.
CUOMO: You're hurting my feelings, Anthony.
For three such respected DOJ attorneys to do so simultaneously—just hours before a major filing, and without replacement by any other career lawyers other than a rookie—is simply flabbergasting.
In any administration there's a delicate balance between trying to distance yourself from the president and knowing that your opponent will never let you do so, said Doug Heye, a former communications director of the Republican National Committee. Republicans certainly saw that in 2006, and are now preparing themselves for a similar reaction, albeit with increased Democratic enthusiasm, next year.
Klobuchar has admitted that she can be too tough on her staff in response to the stories.

Of course, members of the caucus weren't the only Republicans opposed to the health care bill. A collection of moderates including Rep. Charlie Dent of Pennsylvania and powerful House Appropriations Chairman Rodney Frelinghuysen, of New Jersey, had also come out against the bill.
Trump claimed three times that military spending by non-US NATO members was declining before he took office and reversed the trend.
The speaker made it clear he was more concerned with the White House position than the Senate process, we'll see what the Senate does this week. Frankly I have no idea what the Senate is going to produce this week and we'll also have the president engaged to make sure we have something that if it lands on his desk he's going to sign it, and that's very important to us.
One spat with a member of Congress has deteriorated even further: the relationship between Trump and Arizona Republican Sen. John McCain, who, even while being in his home state of Arizona recovering from cancer treatment, still publicly criticizes the President. On Monday, McCain referred to Trump's news conference with Vladimir Putin – where Trump appeared to back Putin over the US intelligence community – as one of the most disgraceful performances by an American president in memory.
COOPER: And there are other facilities that we have that are like this consulate. That's the bottom line here.

Facts First: The $10 billion LNG facility Trump visited in Louisiana in 2019 was : The $10 billion LNG facility Trump visited in Louisiana in 2019 was granted its key permits under Obama , and its construction also began under Obama. Federal regulators have approved other multi-billion-dollar LNG facilities for Louisiana under Trump, but they had not been waiting anywhere close to 10 or 14 years for approval.
On March 19, 2019, President Donald Trump offered this assessment of the late war hero and senator: I was never a fan of John McCain and I never will be.
The President must change course and allow open enrollment in the Affordable Care Act, as even Republican governors have called on him to do, Biden said in a statement. He should also drop his support for a lawsuit that would undo the ACA, because it would cost almost 20 million Americans their care — the last thing we should pursue during a public health emergency.
Those comments come after a weekend in which Trump repeatedly attacked McCain, who, in case you forgot, is deceased, for graduating last in his class from the Naval Academy and for allegedly sending the so-called Steele dossier to the media. (Trump offered zero proof that McCain had leaked the dossier, put together by a former British intelligence agent, to the press.)
The organizers behind this past weekend's rallies for gun reform understood this. They made a point of harping on the distinction, making it one of the prevailing rhetorical themes of the demonstrations, which flooded Washington on Saturday and clogged thoroughfares in dozens of other major cities across the US and around the world.

QUESTION: But do you think that the president is remorseful for what he said, because of the outcry from Friday? SANDERS: I think the president supports our law enforcement, and he supports the protection of the citizens of this country, and he wants to empower our law enforcement to be able to do their job. I don't think there's anything beyond that.

We rate Rubio's claim that Obama's resolution was not about targeting ISIS as false, but we also rate his claim that Obama also asked Congress to authorize the use of force against Assad as true.
Sen. Bernie Sanders said that Americans are sick of endless wars.
SANDERS: He didn't -- he certainly didn't dictate. But, you know, he -- like I said, he weighed in, offered a suggestion like any father would do.
You ignore that. That's a reality. He had no authority. The court struck him down from doing it and you all applauded him doing it.
It obviously makes it harder for us, but we've continued to do reporting on it. We did a number of pieces on the process itself, raising questions about it. It's not the same as doing the reporting on the nuts and bolts of what's in the bill until it comes out. It's self-evident that it's more difficult to report on a bill if you don't know what's in it, he told CNN.
MICHAEL HOLMES, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Chris, I've got to tell you, I haven't seen anything quite like this. We've been covering Irma and then Maria for a couple of weeks now. This is by far the worst we've seen.
I think what shocks many in the establishment, and certainly my Republican colleagues is that we wrote a bill to address the crisis facing working families and the middle class and low-income people, and not the wealthy and large corporations and their lobbyists, Sanders added.
He said he probably never will like McCain, because John McCain received a fake and phony dossier.

Since South Carolina's Democratic electorate is more than 60% African American, the perception is that the Sanders supporter was equating low information voters to black voters who support Biden.
Neal Katyal, a former acting solicitor general during the Obama administration agreed with Clement's take on severability during the same talk .
Here's what's on Biden's health care checklist:
A pesar del caos, Trump tiene una especie de programa, que ha consistido en la prohibición a los musulmanes, la abrogación y el reemplazo del Obamacare, la construcción de un muro en la frontera con México y algunos proyectos de infraestructura. Es notable que no se haya pretendido comenzar ninguno de estos proyectos con el orden que se esperaría de un presidente y no parece que vayan a hacerse realidad.
It's a high-stakes gambit by the new president. Wall Street will be watching closely.
It's unlikely GOP lawmakers will approve this bill, though these frightening figures will make it even harder for them to proceed down this path. House Republican leaders cast aside an attempt to swiftly and simply repeal Obamacare earlier this year after encountering stiff opposition from fellow lawmakers and others, who said it was critical to come up with a replacement bill at the same time.
JAY SEKULOW, ATTORNEY TO PRESIDENT TRUMP: I wasn't involved in the statement drafting at all. Nor was the president. I'm assuming that was between Mr. Donald Trump Jr, between Don Jr, and his lawyer. I'm sure his lawyer was involved. That's how you do it. You know that. So to put this on the president, I think, is just absolutely incorrect.
To have that just snatched away from you because a different President and a different administration comes in, it's really sad, Ireland lamented. I deserve to have access to affordable health insurance. I deserve to be able to go to the doctor if I have an issue or go to the hospital and not have to go into massive debt.
[21:25:05] Of course, every American has a unique identity. I am proud to be gay. I am proud to be a Republican. But most of all, I am proud to be an American.
But where this could cause some heartache is for individual GOP representatives in the Salt Lake City suburbs, which have been trending more and more purple. We saw four Republicans break rank and vote against the replacement bill, and among the yes votes are a representative who won election by less than 1 percentage point, and another who won re-election with a plurality of votes against a Democrat and a third-party challenger. So while there's little danger for the party at large, this issue could play into some swing district results.
We eliminated the very unpopular Obamacare individual mandate penalty – and to give critically ill patients access to life-saving cures, we passed right to try.
I want to build on the momentum that we saw here in 2018, Klobuchar told reporters Saturday in Wisconsin. No one ever thought that the Democrats were going to be able (to defeat) Gov. Walker, but we did it, and we did it in a smart, Wisconsin way with a grassroots campaign with (Democratic Sen.) Tammy Baldwin at the top of the ticket, and we can do it in the presidential, as well.
For years, Mark, the conservative Republicans are saying you have to pay for these cuts and there is not going to be an increase in the nation's debt. We are not going to force our children and grandchildren to pay for what we are doing right now.
My father was his kryptonite in life, he was his kryptonite in death. On a personal level, I agree with you, all of us have love and families, and when my father was alive, up until adulthood, we would spend our time together cooking, hiking, fishing, really celebrating life, and I think it's because he almost died, she said. And I just thought, 'your life is spent on the weekend not with your family, not with your friends, but you're obsessing, obsessing over great men you could never live up to.' That tells you everything you need to know about his pathetic life right now.
Trump claimed twice that median household income has increased by about $10,000 during his presidency. (He once said over $10,000 a family, once said almost a $10,000 increase.)
Clinton had far more spending support from outside groups promoting her candidacy -- $230.1 million for her versus $72.1 million for outside groups promoting Trump, according to the Center for Responsive Politics -- than Trump did. But even if you add up the Clinton campaign's own spending, spending by pro-Clinton outside groups and spending by the Democratic National Committee, it is not even double the spending by Trump's campaign, spending by pro-Trump outside groups and spending by the Republican National Committee.
Now on opponent, Fred Thompson, actually made an ad using that 1994 pro-choice clip against him. I asked the governor about it during a debate. Here's what he said back in 2007.
As part of our military build-up, the United States is developing a state-of-the-art Missile Defense System.
President Donald Trump has been adamant about one point this week: The Republican Party will soon be known as the party of health care.
BRIGGS: Al Gore offering up fond memories of Bush 41. The former vice president was part of the ticket that beat Mr. Bush, then lost to his son Bush 43 in a hard-fought presidential bid eight years later. Gore remembers one of the first calls he received after that hotly contested 2000 race.
CARPER: And maybe even meet with the witnesses.
Facts First: Trump was exaggerating the number of Venezuelans living in the US. There were about 363,000 Venezuelan-born people living in the US in 2018, plus an additional 129,000 people of Venezuelan origin, according to an analysis of Census Bureau data by Mark Hugo Lopez, director of global migration and demography research at the Pew Research Center.

Some television spots, however, could not be canceled and will continue to air. Also, open enrollment information remains available through the web site, emails, robo-dial calls, Twitter and other online sites. Agency personnel continue to answer all emails and phone calls related to enrollment questions.
In an interview published by Time magazine in early December, Zelensky did say, Look, I never talked to the President from the position of a quid pro quo. That's not my thing. But Zelensky continued: I don't want us to look like beggars. But you have to understand. We're at war. If you're our strategic partner, then you can't go blocking anything for us. I think that's just about fairness. It's not about a quid pro quo. It just goes without saying.
And there was another Russian national that just got sprinkled into this Cohen filing that we saw from the special counsel's office that apparently reached out to Michael Cohen in November of 2015, Don.
I know that the Congress is eager to pass an infrastructure bill – and I am eager to work with you on legislation to deliver new and important infrastructure investment, including investments in the cutting edge industries of the future. This is not an option. This is a necessity.
Sandoval later ran for governor and defeated Reid's son Rory in the 2010 elections. And Sandoval is actually heavily courted by Republicans to run in 2016 for the Senate seat that Reid now holds. But Sandoval have already declined.
TIM COOK, APPLE INC. CEO: This case is not about my phone. This case is about the future. What is at stake here is can the government compel Apple to write software that we believe would make hundreds of millions of customers vulnerable around the world including the U.S.
Sen. Amy Klobuchar will take to the national stage on Monday headlining a CNN town hall in New Hampshire to make her most public case yet for why she should be the next President of the United States.
Here is the full list of 71 false claims from the two-week period:
BASH: Do you think it's deserved?
One of the keys for success in the exchanges is you have to have a healthy mix of people to insure. And one of the ways that we do that is through the individual mandate. Other ways, as well. But this administration has spent the last eight, nine months trying to destabilize the exchanges. So they're driving insurers out of the marketplaces.
It's worth noting that, in October, Trump said Jones' offending comments had occurred three weeks ago. In the new version of the story, Trump put Jones' comments much earlier -- about a week after he signed the bill in December 2018.
The town hall format is familiar for Klobuchar, who has found success in her home state – which almost went for President Donald Trump in 2016 – by consciously visiting each of Minnesota's 87 counties, often to hold town-hall style events.
1978-1982 - Completes his neurosurgery residency at Johns Hopkins.
This and other gestures, including his award of a scholarship to a young minority student to attend school under a controversial administration program, were touching and emotive. But they also were a trap for critics who risked coming across as callous if they accused Trump of cynicism.
COOPER: We ran out of time for The Ridiculist. That does it for us. PIERS MORGAN LIVE starts now. Have a great weekend.
Editor's Note: Watch CNN's town hall with Sen. Amy Klobuchar hosted by Don Lemon at St. Anselm College in Manchester, New Hampshire, Monday at 10 p.m. ET on CNN.

As many as 13,000 may have been exposed to the tainted steroid injections linked to the outbreak. Injections made by a company called New England Compounding Center, a type of pharmacy that is regulated by state officials not the FDA.
One of the more significant changes provides states with more flexibility in determining the essential health benefits that insurers must offer, starting in 2020. While carriers must still provide the 10 broad categories of essential health benefits mandated by Obamacare, states could give them more leeway in selecting which specific services to cover.
It's important for us at least, and I think for all of us here to remember to not lose sight about what this investigation is about: an outside, foreign adversary effectively sought to hijack our most critical democratic process, the election of a president, Warner said on Thursday.
More of the same will not motivate or mobilize Democratic voters and that's true for the topics at these debates as well.
Similarly, Trump's national security adviser Robert O'Brien said in an interview on Sunday with ABC's This Week that it was unclear whether embassies or US military bases would be targeted, but insisted Trump's claim about four embassies being threatened was consistent with the intelligence.
So, naturally, Trump told a rally crowd last week: And by the way, they think they caught me -- they never catch us -- because, you know: Mexico's paying for the wall. You know that. You'll see that. It's all worked out. Mexico spent -- it's driving them crazy.
This reality stands in stark contrast with President Barack Obama's rosier assessment of the law, published recently in the Journal of the American Medical Association. In what was widely seen as a report card, the President wrote: The Affordable Care Act has made significant progress toward solving long-standing challenges facing the U.S. health care system related to access, affordability, and quality of care.
But what exactly that is remains a work in progress.
Can you explain the discrepancy between the president and senior Republican leadership on the Hill when it comes to what should be done next?
And we begin with special counsel Robert Mueller recommending no jail time for President Trump's former national security adviser Michael Flynn.
He's a closer. And closers don't worry too much about every niggling little detail.
CNN's Nic Robertson is live in Hamburg, where one of the interesting G-20 dynamics this time, Nick, will include demonstrations much closer to the event site than we've become accustomed to in recent years. Why is that?
CNN previously reported that the senator, who had been held as a prisoner of war in Vietnam, did not want the President at his funeral. McCain's daughter, Meghan McCain, also revealed earlier this year that she wished Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner, Trump's daughter and son-in-law and senior advisers, had not attended the funeral.
MORGAN: Who's being in-charge? Is it Speaker Boehner or Ted Cruz?
And his wife is keeping him from actually moonwalking. I mean, this is a person that does not know what were the appropriate levels are. I mean, he cannot -- he can't govern.
Following that advice doesn't require a package so large and sprawling. But in addition to economics, Biden's plan reflects the convergence of Democratic values with opportunity.
Those who don't qualify for subsidies, however, saw their monthly rate spike to $621, up from $476. The share of consumers receiving premium assistance was 83% both this year and in 2017.
Now Reid told me today that he thinks it would be smart for President Obama to give Sandoval a lifetime position on the Supreme Court.
The contest took place in a charged political atmosphere as Democrats assail President Donald Trump over his handling of the growing coronavirus crisis, as the stock market tumbles and fears of recession threaten to reshape the 2020 battlefield. It also marked the end of the road for businessman Tom Steyer, who sunk more than $20 million into South Carolina and appeared headed for a distant third place finish in the race.
COOPER: Again, the reports that she told her boyfriend that she believed President Obama was in some way electronically monitoring her home, did she ever talk to you about that?
I'm very unhappy that he didn't repeal and replace Obamacare, as you know. He campaigned on repealing and replacing Obamacare for years and then he got to a vote and he said thumbs down. And our country would've saved a trillion dollars and we would've had great healthcare. So he campaigned, he told us hours before that he was going to repeal and replace, and then for some reason, I think I understand the reason, he ended up going thumbs up, and frankly, had we even known that, I think we would've gotten the vote cause we could've gotten somebody else. So I think that's disgraceful, plus there are other things.
During Tuesday's presidential primary debate, Democrats continued their embrace of policies that would make our country poorer, less free, less safe and less fair.
CUOMO: But the schedule of what people might pay, that is out there making the rounds, pending a CBO score, which you have to wait for under the rules for this type of reconciliation, the price won't be the same as it is now. It's going to be different for people.
COOPER: Maybe so. Isha, thanks very much. We will be right back.
Elliot Williams: Silence on a key issue
BASH: You have in you some pretty explosive terms to talk about the so called Tea Party, you called them Tea Party anarchist, you called them wacky, you called them the weird caucus. I even talked to some liberals who are big supporters of yours who say, You know what, that's going too far. Are you sort of stirring the pot with a language like that?
And the country, by the end of the term, just as another election gears up, will have its first full glimpse of why elections matter.
Trump claimed that we have right now 27,000 Mexican soldiers on our border.
President Trump has threatened to end the payments, which would throw insurers and the exchanges into chaos for the year. The uncertainty has prompted many carriers to request big premium hikes for 2018 and others to downsize or exit the market.
CAMEROTA: David, it also did not play great in Pyongyang. Kim Jong- un then issued his own statement in reaction to President Trump's statement. So here's what Kim Jong-un said: He is unfit to hold the prerogative of supreme command of a country, and he is surely a rogue and a gangster fond of playing with fire rather than a politician. I will make the man holding the prerogative of the supreme command of the U.S. pay dearly for his speech calling for totally destroying North Korea. Whatever Trump might have expected he will face results beyond his expectation. I will surely and definitely tame the mentally deranged U.S. dotard with fire.
Another key promise Trump repeatedly has made is that his health plan will lower costs. In January, for example, President-elect Trump told the Post that his plan would include lower numbers, much lower deductibles.
A much better solution that works is the tax plan I've laid out which would enable our exports to be tax-free, would tax our imports, would not raise prices for Americans, and would not result in reciprocal tariffs. Fix the problem and that's what's missing from what Donald says.
We will continue our extensive coverage after this.
People wait in their cars for the San Antonio Food Bank to begin distributing food on April 9, 2020.
Desde hace más de dos siglos y con algunas excepciones, los presidentes se han mostrado como líderes estables y maduros que podrían incluso servir de ejemplo para los niños. Trump ha actuado frecuentemente como niño, ha vomitado acusaciones y condenas tan impulsivamente que su aptitud para el cargo queda en duda. Estas declaraciones son las que ponen en peligro tanto su presidencia como sus esperanzas de reelegirse.
So, my takeaway is -- why do the Democrats just stand there and let things happen to themselves. Biden is ahead nationally, and nobody did anything to stop him. Warren is effectively calling Sanders a backwoods misogynist and he slinked off into a corner.
And now that they have lost the majority, Republicans have virtually no chance of passing any legislation that would repeal and replace President Barack Obama's signature health care law.
Expedites consideration of measures with broad bipartisan support.
And, finally, let's call this the Edward Snowden effect. The Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board will get $3.1 million. They are a White House oversight group set up to guard Americans' right to privacy against overreach by government cyber-intelligence.

Sen. Amy Klobuchar will take to the national stage on Monday headlining a CNN town hall in New Hampshire to make her most public case yet for why she should be the next President of the United States.
Klobuchar is markedly more centrist than many of the other Democrats running for President, including some of her colleagues in the Senate. Klobuchar has a liberal voting record, but she does not support abolishing the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency or Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders' Medicare-for-all bill – instead pushing to lower the age when people are allowed to buy into the government health care program.
LEMON: An extraordinary court filing today ahead of Michael Cohen's sentencing next week for tax fraud and campaign finance crimes. The prosecutors saying Cohen made illegal campaign contributions to influence the 2016 presidential election in coordination and at the direction of President Trump.
Given how hard repealing Obamacare has been so far, there's little reason to assume it will get much easier. So for all intents and purposes those taxes will stand indefinitely. They include a high-income Medicare surtax on investment income and on wages over $200,000 ($250,000 if married).
[14:00:00] DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: So, if we're building the wall, we're paying as they build it, we pay it as they finish. This way if they don't do a good job, we don't pay them. So not all of the money has been paid, but the money has been used. So maybe you guys can remember that when you say I haven't spent the money. We spent the money.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Are you willing to speak then off camera with some health care journalists (ph) --
Stepien told CNN that Trump is willing to deal with the political realities of 2018, even if that means staying out of the way in some races.
Dreeben noted that in its first full term at the Supreme Court during the Trump administration the office of Solicitor General made four major shifts in high profile cases. These reversals were abrupt and appeared strikingly at odds with institutional norms, he wrote. But the Trump administration prevailed in all of the cases including one concerning public sector unions that overturned some 40-year old precedent.
CNN's Maegan Vazquez and Ted Barrett contributed to this report.
Trump has worked to undermine the Affordable Care Act from his first day in office, when he issued an executive order directing agencies to interpret its regulations as loosely as possible. He championed congressional Republicans' bills in 2017 that would have weakened the law's protections.
CAREY-JONES: No, we -- it wasn't something that was displayed. It was a momentary breakdown where she had to go and have emergency care. Once she understood what the diagnosis was, she knew how to move forward. She had her challenges as a new parent, and I always spoke closely with her.
And the idea that Republican leaders stayed on Capitol Hill to head off a shutdown, that's laughable. Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan couldn't get out of town fast enough after Trump scuttled the deal to keep the government funded temporarily. And note to this White House. Capitol Hill is empty. Negotiations said to be frozen.
I thought the reaction was pretty positive even though there were a lot of people saying – and rightfully so – 'God, here we go again,'  said Rep. Mike Simpson, a Republican from Idaho.
Republican leadership briefed their conference Tuesday night on a plan that would keep the government open until mid-February, fund the Children's Health Insurance Program for six years and delay key Obamacare taxes.
Was he aware at the time that Don Jr. had had a meeting that was based on the pretext that he would be promised information that was negative about Hillary Clinton when he suggested that the statement only say that the meeting was primarily about Russian adoption policy?
In the days surrounding the House immigration votes earlier this summer, Trump faced criticism – from members of his party own party – for what they considered erratic support for efforts by GOP leadership to push a compromise bill on immigration. Short explained Trump's stance bluntly
TRUMP: It was a meltdown. I watched it. I watched him melt down on the stage like I've never seen anybody. I thought he came out of the swimming pool.

What's more, some of the groups the alliance contracts with to provide enrollment assistance likely spent most of their funding during the fall sign up season.
(CNN) The Trump administration has decided not to reopen enrollment in the Affordable Care Act's federal exchanges amid the rising coronavirus pandemic, a senior administration official said Tuesday evening.
Like its peers, Anthem is concerned that the Trump administration will stop funding the federal cost-sharing reduction subsidies that insurers receive to reduce deductibles and co-pays of lower-income Obamacare enrollees. The White House and House Republicans won't commit to continue making these payments, despite pressure from many insurers, state officials, medical providers and others.
However, as CNN has reported , Bloomberg has been accused of sexist and misogynistic behavior in the past. His campaign chairwoman responded to new questions about those accusations to CNN, saying in part, In any large organization, there are going to be complaints -- but Mike has never tolerated any kind of discrimination or harassment, and he's created cultures that are all about equality and inclusion.
Utah is dealing with shifts in its politics that add to this Medicaid debate in odd and esoteric ways. There's an ongoing battle over how candidates qualify for party primaries that has exposed factions within the Utah Republican Party, and fueled a larger conversation about whether or not the state's residents are adequately represented.
Biden on Trump weakening sanctions on North Korea
If the health care bill doesn't pass, then that trillion dollars of Obamacare taxes ... we won't incorporate those in tax reform, Ryan said on CNBC's Power Lunch.We will have to put those off to the side and they will have to be gotten to when we get to health care reform.
You know, Roger Stone was not involved in my campaign in any way -- other than the very, very beginning, before I -- I think, I -- long before I announced -- a little bit. And: And again, Roger Stone was not a part of it -- the campaign. He was somebody I've known over the years, but not a part of the campaign. Very, very, very early on -- long before I -- I think long before I even announced, he was involved in a minor way. -- December 24 exchange with reporters after teleconference with members of the military
But absolutely correct, we would not have seen this 10, 20, even 30 years ago. It is quite an accomplishment. And not just the pressure that she had to have of being the FLOTUS, but the pressure that came with being the first African-American woman to be the First Lady of the United States of America. She has blazed quite a trail.

Wednesday's decision to halt the merger is the second roadblock a federal judge has put up for an attempted health care merger since the beginning of the year. Aetna's plans to takeover Humana for $37 billion was frozen by a federal judge last month.
CASSIDY: I'm sorry he doesn't understand. Under Graham-Cassidy- Heller-Johnson, more people will have coverage and we protect those with pre-existing conditions. States like Maine, Virginia, Florida, Missouri, there will be billions more dollars to provide health insurance coverage for those in those states who have been passed by Obamacare and we protect those with pre-existing conditions.
And she quarreled with Trump's vision of runaway American prosperity.
We want a market-based system which will give us lower cost, more competition, and more choices.

Over the weekend, Trump attacked the late senator in several tweets that targeted McCain's ties to the controversial Russia dossier and his vote against repealing Obamacare. He also referred to McCain as being last in his class at the US Naval Academy.
La plataforma de inmigración de Sanders exige una reestructuración del sistema a gran escala a través de acciones legislativas y una serie de decretos presidenciales.
I endorsed him at his request, and I gave him the kind of funeral that he wanted, which as President I had to approve. I don't care about this. I didn't get thank you. That's OK. We sent him on the way. But I wasn't a fan of John McCain, Trump said during a speech Wednesday at a tank factory in Lima, Ohio.
Boehner's relationship with Cruz pre-dates their time in Congress together. Cruz was hired as part of Boehner's legal team, after he sued a Democratic congressman, Rep. Jim McDermott of Washington state, for breaking wiretapping laws back in 1998.
In an interview published by Time magazine in early December, Zelensky did say, Look, I never talked to the President from the position of a quid pro quo. That's not my thing.

I think that's just about fairness. It's not about a quid pro quo. It just goes without saying.
And the study show that the best way to get people covered is not through a mandate, through penalties, but through getting a governor engaged. Our bill gives the governor responsibility, which he or she may not want, but that's the best way to get people covered.
Under the rules, it takes two-thirds of the Senate -- 67 votes -- to remove an impeached President. That means 20 Republicans would have to turn on Trump, an idea that seems fanciful, since no Republicans have suggested the abuse of power that led to his impeachment should cost him the White House.
Because of the power that we give the commissioner, the time to get the pot right is when you either hire him or extend him. And so I'm wanting the owners to get the pot right.
[21:40:03] COOPER: Yeah then Gloria, I mean to Jeff's point, how bad of a position would it put Republicans in to just obstruct it?
I know I can be too tough sometimes and I can push too hard, she told MSNBC earlier this month. That is obvious. But a lot of it is I have high expectations for myself and I have high expectations for people who work with me.
CRIMMINS: I think it's what we have now. I mean, what's the change? And that's why Trump is winning.

(Voice-over): No one does. Yet the raft is full of children.
It is entrepreneurial and offers patients more control over their health care decisions than anywhere else in the world. One of the primary problems with Obamacare is that it does not prioritize these values. As the Trump administration and congressional Republicans consider what to do after the repeal of Obamacare, they should, as the Hippocratic Oath states, do no harm to those elements of our health care system that are functioning well. But they should also take steps to promote policies that emphasize choice and innovation.

JONES: It is a huge snowball.
Those expectations carry from 2018 through 2028, in spite of a coming surge in baby boomer retirements, meaning that our current expansion rate will have remained, by the time all is said and done, unchanged over two decades. The longest similar stretch on record followed World War II – and it lasted about 10 years.
Polls actually asking about people's approval of Trump's handling of the virus situation at the time found that his approval rating is much lower than 78%. In an NBC/Wall Street Journal poll conducted March 11-13, 45% of registered voters approved of his handling of the coronavirus, while 51% disapproved. A Quinnipiac University poll conducted March 5-8 found that 43% of registered voters approved, 49% disapproved. (Some subsequent polls found Trump's coronavirus-related approval above 50%.) Conversely, a CNN poll taken in October and November 2009 found that 57% approved of Barack Obama's handling of the H1N1 flu pandemic.
Let me turn now to my colleague Dana Bash.
They treated Birmingham like it had whistled at a white woman. It was like an insult: How dare you raise your own minimum wage without our say-so. Scott Douglas, executive director of Greater Birmingham Ministries
MARQUARDT: A protest is planned this afternoon in El Paso, Texas after a 7-year-old migrant girl from Guatemala died in U.S. custody. She was detained with her father in a remote part of New Mexico on December 6th. Officials say she was medically cleared to be taken to a detention facility with the rest of her group which included another 50 unaccompanied children.
Notably, prior to being named acting head of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, Slavitt had been brought on to help the Obama administration fix the botched rollout of its healthcare.gov website. That effort to fix the Obamacare enrollment website was spearheaded by Jeff Zients, who is now Biden's Covid coordinator.

The fear of losing 'Healthy Michigan'
The deepening sense of foreboding is focusing debate on whether Trump -- who spent weeks downplaying the likely impact of the pandemic -- had cost lives by not being more proactive.
ACOSTA: We maybe way to have but Trump is not slowing down, his got a bunch of events lined up throughout the South and Southwest to set a table for Super Tuesday next week and all of the early polls indicate Trump has a chance to clean up and perhaps force some of his rivals out of the race. Anderson?

Thank you, Melania, for your extraordinary love and profound care for America's children.
President Barack Obama visited Capitol Hill Wednesday, urging Democrats to not rescue Republicans by helping them pass replacement measures in a closed-door meeting.
But when it comes to follow through, at least in his first 100 days in office Trump has come up short on the bite, failing to deliver on his toughest campaign promises.
There's nothing wrong with encouraging people to work. There's everything wrong with our government declaring that if you don't work, we'll let you die like the scum that you are. Decent people, and a decent government, don't predicate basic health care on whether or not we are employed, gay, female or transgender. Our president and his party make themselves out to be moral arbiters and are right now using our most essential government functions to play out this charade.

Francisco argued in court papers that the accommodation still makes some entities feel complicit in providing contraceptive coverage to their employees.

For instance, even though Clinton was poised to become the first woman president, Biden actually did better among women in this year's Democratic primary in Michigan than Clinton did four years ago: Biden got 57% and Clinton got 51% vs. Sanders.
The town hall format is familiar for Klobuchar, who has found success in her home state – which almost went for President Donald Trump in 2016 – by consciously visiting each of Minnesota's 87 counties, often to hold town-hall style events.
We gather here to mourn the passing of American greatness, the real thing, not cheap rhetoric from men who will never come near the sacrifice he gave so willingly, nor the opportunistic appropriation of those who live lives of comfort and privilege while he suffered and served, McCain said at the time.

Trump told a story about how the military was so depleted under Obama and Biden that a general advised him against some sort of military action because we have no ammunition.
Those two comments – almost four years apart and more than six months after McCain's death – provide telling bookends to understand just how much Trump has changed Republican politics (and politics generally), and not for the better.
He was calling (President George W.) Bush, President Bush all the time, 'Get into the Middle East! Get in to the Middle East,'  Trump claimed, adding we've lost tremendous health and tremendous lives in that war.
He changed and made more inaccessible, more expensive and more difficult for people to qualify for either of those two items, the Affordable Care Act or Medicaid, he continued.
I know I can be too tough sometimes and I can push too hard, she told MSNBC earlier this month. That is obvious. But a lot of it is I have high expectations for myself and I have high expectations for people who work with me.
Bloomberg said he reduced stop and frisk by 95% after deciding the policy had gone too far, while Biden said the decline was due to the Obama administration's decision to send monitors to assess the situation.
Partial birth abortions are illegal, and Planned Parenthood has repeatedly denied that it performs partial birth abortions, or that it has participated in any illegal activity.

And now he's saying I'm not going anywhere. But tomorrow I expect Democrats to submit a resolution of impeachment in Virginia. And that will begin a process that has not been used in Virginia in our lifetimes.
I saw how Abrams harnessed the power of labor unions and generous donors to train and hire low-income rural Georgians to sign one another up for Obamacare when her state refused to accept the federal funds for Medicaid expansion. Whenever those in power refused to act, Abrams was on the ground with everyday Georgians working to ensure that their communities had the care and resources to get ahead and stay ahead. And there is no doubt she would adopt a similar approach at the national level, too.

Mexico is spending a significant amount of money to help the US on migration issues, deploying thousands of troops to both its Guatemala border and its US border to thwart would-be asylum seekers. It's possible to argue that this is like Mexico paying for a kind of human wall . But Trump's wall is an actual, physical project that Mexico is not funding.
After Trump previously suggested that China wanted to participate in a trilateral deal with the US and Russia, a spokesperson for the Chinese government said in May 2019: We oppose any country's attempt to make an issue out of China on arms control and will not participate in any negotiation for a trilateral nuclear disarmament agreement.

This story has been updated Sunday with additional developments.
Premiums will decrease about $50 per person per month, on average. An uninsured couple making $70,000 annually could find coverage for $1,000 less per month than they would have before the law was passed. A family of four making $90,000 a year could see their premiums drop by $200 a month.
This year, the total annual cost of benefits was nearly $13,500. Employers paid about $9,300 in premiums and contributions to employees' health savings accounts. Workers shelled out about $2,750 in premiums and another $1,400 in out-of-pocket costs for care, the industry group found.

The President has the support of millions of veterans in the United States. I don't think those veterans are in love with the fact that he's attacking John McCain, he said.
Of course you have a dictatorship in Cuba, he added. What I said is what Barack Obama said in terms of Cuba, that Cuba made progress on education. What Barack Obama said was they made great progress on education and healthcare. That was Barack Obama.
Second, 2021 must see a coordinated effort at the local, state and national levels to eradicate the thousands of racist policies that keep too many Black Americans at the bottom of the well of this society. Criminal justice reform is the tip of the iceberg on this score. Eliminating the cash bail system and disparate sentencing for crack versus powdered cocaine, releasing non-violent drug offenders and transforming a juvenile justice system that disproportionately harms Black children should be at the top of the policy agenda.

Here are the repeat false claims we have previously fact checked in a weekly roundup:
An email stressing the final enrollment deadline was sent out by the federal exchange, healthcare.gov, on Friday. It noted that most consumers are eligible for subsidies and can find plans for $50 to $100.
There will be more people covered, Cassidy said on CNN's New Day on Wednesday.
It's a supply-and-demand pincer move unlike any we've seen before, made more acute by uncertainty over how severe it will be and how long it will last.
Health care – and Trump's attempts to roll back Obamacare – became a galvanizing issue for Democrats in the 2018 midterms. Four in ten voters in 2018 said health care was the most important issue facing the country, according to a CNN exit poll, as they swept a wave of Democratic lawmakers into office to give Democrats the majority in the House of Representatives.
QUINN: It never works. But, listen, to me, another really big curiosity in this whole thing is, why was Paul Manafort lying to protect Konstantin Kilimnik? Why was he resisting acknowledging that Kilimnik was his co-conspirator? This is just remarkable. This is a guy who, as Garrett said earlier, has been identified by our government as likely to be connected to Russian military intelligence. So why is Paul Manafort protecting him? And, you know, that question begs an answer.
The president says the executive order will boost competition, give consumers more options and lower premiums. Critics, however, argue that these policies would provide skimpier coverage and would raise the cost of plans on the Obamacare exchanges by siphoning off younger and healthier consumers.
Chemo and radiation is a very tough customer. It does so much good, but it also does a lot of damage, and so he's recovering from the last round of chemo and radiation. He's tough as a boot, he's at our ranch and he's watching today, she said.

Let's talk about Marco Rubio for a moment. What was your reaction? He clearly seemed to stumble at that Republican debate the other night going back two or three or four times with the same line -- I think it was four times. He basically -- instead of answering the question, he switched the subject talking about President Obama, how he's doing a lot of damage to the country. How much damage do you think that did to Marco Rubio on the eve of the New Hampshire primary?

Biden's relief proposal now shifts to Congress, where it may change substantially as Democratic leaders transform it into a bill. They must decide whether they want to use a special legislative process called reconciliation, which would require only a simple majority of votes to pass the Senate -- eliminating the need for Republican support -- but would limit the provisions that could be included. Also, reconciliation could be used only sparingly each year.

House Democrats will have a conference call at 9 a.m. ET on Wednesday where this issue could come up. There is some growing concern that forcing Greene off committees through a floor vote could set a dangerous precedent for the future if Republicans take back the House and then use the move to oust Democrats they don't like from their committee assignments. Usually, this is a call leadership makes. Giving the full House a vote is extremely unusual.

Asked by CNN's Jake Tapper on State of the Union Sunday whether Trump and Paul agree that a replacement needs to be passed at the same time Obamacare is repealed, Conway dodged.
The new rule is the latest effort by the administration to undermine the Affordable Care Act. Earlier this year, it proposed rules that would allow insurers to sell short-term insurance plans, which last just under a year but don't have to comply with Obamacare's regulations, and to make it easier for small businesses to band together to offer coverage that doesn't adhere to all of the health reform law's mandates. Both of these options could have lower premiums, but also cover fewer benefits.
The Alaska Republican is an independent voice -- and she voted to convict Trump in his second impeachment trial. But it's hard to see how she would have an incentive to rescue an already deeply embattled Democratic Cabinet nominee, especially with her own reelection race looming next year.

During those months when the networks were paying so much attention to Republicans' health care plans, public support for the GOP's proposals plummeted, support for Obamacare went up, and House Republicans suffered through a messy, embarrassing process conducted in full view of the public before finally passing their version of the legislation.
America and policies of trickle-down economics have left a generation of voters with too much debt, too many jails and too few options. The Sanders / Warren agenda is music to the ears of this rising generation. Anything that divides two candidates who represent the future of America is a distraction we cannot afford.

Trump might perhaps have been referring to his effort to broker a deal between Ethiopia and Egypt in a dispute over a dam Ethiopia is building on the Blue Nile river, a tributary of the Nile. But that dispute had not been resolved at the time of his complaint about the Nobel, so Trump could not have accurately claimed here to have made any successful deal.
In 2013, then Senate Majority leader Harry Reid got so fed up with GOP obstruction on then-President Barack Obama's judicial nominees, he led a major change so that presidential nominations only need a simple majority to be confirmed, which helped get more Obama judges on the bench. When Republicans took control of the Senate, they used the same 51-vote threshold to confirm a record number of conservative judges appointed by then-President Donald Trump.

Here are a few ways to look at this:
The pandemic set off new crises for the industry, including damage to supply chains. Farm bankruptcies before and during the pandemic soared.
While much of the recent decline in food stamps is due to the stronger economy, experts said, the Trump administration is pushing policies that will kick millions more off the rolls.
Over the last year, the Trump administration has rolled out a series of policies to curtail the flow of asylum seekers to the border, such as the so-called remain in Mexico policy. Forcing migrants, many of whom are from Central America, to Mexico marks an unprecedented shift in US asylum policy. Instead of living in the US as they work their way through the immigration court process, migrants are required to stay in Mexico, under the policy formally known as the Migrant Protection Protocols.

The highest profile test of Trump's clout came in Alabama earlier this month, where Republican Roy Moore surprisingly lost a US Senate race to Democrat Doug Jones, the first time the ruby-red state has elected a Democrat in two decades. Republicans have argued that Moore, who was accused of sexual impropriety by multiple women near the end of the campaign, was a unique candidate, but the loss has some Republicans girding for a difficult 2018.
Facts First: This was wrong. The aid did not arrive weeks ahead of schedule. While Trump did lift his freeze on the aid on September 11, more than two weeks before a September 30 legal deadline, the delay caused by Trump's freeze meant that : This was wrong. The aid did not arrive weeks ahead of schedule. While Trump did lift his freeze on the aid on September 11, more than two weeks before a September 30 legal deadline, the delay caused by Trump's freeze meant that $35 million of the aid could not make it out the door in time to meet the deadline, according to impeachment testimony from Mark Sandy, deputy associate director for national security in the Office of Management and Budget. To deal with this problem, Congress had to pass an extension of the deadline. Had that provision not been included, then any unobligated funds as of September 30th would have expired, Sandy testified

In addition to the potential loss of health insurance for the more than 20 million who currently depend on ACA, the loss of the ACA could also result in having Covid-19 itself labeling the millions being infected as being uninsurable.
The first thing to note is that Sanders' proposal has only 14 co-sponsors in the Senate. That's not even a majority of Democrats. That's less than a third of the 60 votes usually required to overcome a filibuster and pass major legislation, although he has said he would use budget rules to maneuver around the practice of the filibuster in order to get Medicare for All passed.

Short-term plans don't have to adhere to Obamacare's regulations so consumers would have a wider array of options with lower monthly rates. But these policies can exclude those with pre-existing conditions or base rates on a person's medical history. They can also offer skimpier benefits so policyholders may have to pay more out of pocket if they actually need care.
President Donald Trump's budget takes this art form to another level – really, to another universe. Some of the issues and questions stem from the surprise budget resolution last week in Congress, which delivered more money but – so far – no clear plan for precisely how it would be spent.
In a call with investors Monday, Meredith CEO Steve Lacy said that Koch Industries wasn't asking for as much control of the company as some other potential backers.
COOPER: Randi joins me now from Dallas. Where is Ted Cruz in the polls in Texas? Is he making headway? KAYE: Well, there's a new statewide poll, Anderson out tonight in Texas from the University of Houston. And that poll does show Ted Cruz 15 points ahead of Donald Trump. I should point out that only about 400 voters were included in that poll but here's what's interesting, Anderson, 19 percent of those polled say they are still undecided.
Multiple Republicans including Republican Study Committee Chairman Mark Walker said the Obamacare stabilization money hadn't been included. Steve Womack, a Republican from Arkansas, reiterated that the bill wasn't finished yet, but that at present he did not believe that stabilization measures for the Affordable Care Act marketplace would be included in the bill because of fights over whether to include the Hyde Amendment, which is regularly attached to annual funding bills, and makes permanent a ban on federal agencies from using funds for abortion services except in cases of rape, incest or when the life of the mother is in danger.
Trump claimed that, before Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden's son Hunter Biden was appointed to the board of directors of Ukrainian natural gas company Burisma Holdings, Hunter Biden didn't have a job. -- March 5 Fox News town hall in Scranton, Pennsylvania
COOPER: Kellyanne, do you dispute that -- that Mitt Romney seems to have moved to the center in that debate and sense that there is a different tone, maybe a more centrist approach?
Plus, the proposed regulation would allow associations to base rates on gender, age and industry, which could leave younger men paying less, but older workers and women saddled with higher rates. Currently, the Affordable Care Act bans basing premiums on gender or industry and limits the amount that can be based on age.
'Those at the top are not doing their part:' WH looks to raise taxes on wealthy
Trump's emphasis on good news, or supposed good news, has been coupled with a refusal to spend much time addressing the bad news. Trump has left it to others to discuss the coronavirus death toll and the number of positive tests.
One person walked into a room when he was supposed to go this way, and he said he was going this way, and he walked in and he went this way, and everyone said, 'What happened, what was that all about?' Boy oh boy, who was that, I don't know. I don't know. I don't want to be controversial, so I won't use his name, OK? Trump said during a wide-ranging remarks Friday, prompting boos from a fired-up crowd.
It is the biggest job-killer in this country, Cruz said. Millions of Americans have lost their jobs, have been forced into part-time work.

TRUMP: Especially the one on the border where people are allowed to come in just pour into our country like Swiss cheese.
Facts First: There have been empty seats at various Trump rallies since he came down an escalator to launch his campaign in 2015, including an October rally Minneapolis, a July rally in Greenville, North Carolina, an October 2018 rally in Houston and an April 2017 rally in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, according to journalists on the scene.
Rather, the resolution calls for overhauling transportation systems in the United States to remove pollution and greenhouse gas emissions from the transportation sector as much as is technologically feasible, including through investment in zero-emission vehicle infrastructure and manufacturing; clean, affordable, and accessible public transit; and high-speed rail. That is not a call to completely eliminate air travel.
Here's one person's story on why she's worried about her future medical expenses.
Treece, 64, who recently retired as the office manager of a small home improvement business that didn't offer coverage, ticked off the problems with the GOP bill. It would allow insurers to charge older policyholders significantly more than younger ones. It would allow them to base premiums on a consumer's health status in some cases. It wouldn't cover annual checkups or preventative tests.
(CNN) How the next four weeks play out will have immeasurable consequences for millions of Americans as Democrats race to pass their sweeping $1.9 trillion Covid-19 relief bill before unemployment benefits lapse.
Protecting people from surprise medical bills ranks last.
I received calls from the President of Mexico and the Prime Minister of Canada asking to renegotiate NAFTA rather than terminate, Trump tweeted Thursday morning. I agreed subject to the fact that if we do not reach a fair deal for all, we will then terminate NAFTA.
Tara Setmayer: Trump's strategy -- Attack, attack, attack
Facts First: Trump has yet to provide evidence backing up his claim that Iranian Gen. Qasem Soleimani was actively planning new attacks against four US embassies and top administration officials have struggled to defend the President's comments. But there is no way to know if Trump flat-out lied without seeing the underlying intelligence, which remains classified.
The issue is now we are seeing some real effects of what that means for the way the Senate is run. Sen. Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican who is technically still the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, announced Monday night he would not allow a hearing to go forward on Biden's Attorney General nominee Merrick Garland on February 8 because he argued those confirmation hearings for attorney general are typically two days. The Senate impeachment trial starts on February 9 . Again, aides say party leaders are close. We will see if this gets buttoned up Tuesday.
'Those at the top are not doing their part:' WH looks to raise taxes on wealthy
Klobuchar's primary pitch to voters is likely to be electability. The Democrat has been notably successful in Minnesota, winning her three terms in the Senate by an average of 26 percentage points. Klobuchar won re-election in 2018 with 60% of the vote, two years after Trump came within two points of defeating Hillary Clinton in the state.
The government should require businesses to provide paid time off to employees. That is not overreach; it is for the protection of all of us. And for the tens of millions who work in the gig economy, who do not get paid if they don't work, financial assistance should be made available immediately, so that Uber drivers and GrubHub delivery people don't find it necessary to keep working while they're sick, potentially driving the virus from one home to another.
Ryan: Obamacare is the law of the land
CAREY-JONES: Normal, regular. It was just, you know, business as usual, you know.
Good morning, Senator. Thank you so much for joining me.
President Trump, however, has made it clear that he intends to dismantle the law as soon as possible. Hours after taking office, he signed an executive order aimed at weakening Obamacare. Congress has begun the process of repealing major provisions of the law, but remains divided over how to replace it.

It's just wrong, Biden said. How can you run against Donald Trump when you have, what is it, 10, 12, 14 NDAs?
REINCE PRIEBUS, REPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN: Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. To the people of Cleveland, we say thank you for your hospitality. And to my wife, Sally and my son, Jack, and daughter Grace, I love you, thank you for everything you do for me.

Aloul knows this all too well. She has long wanted to provide health insurance for her five employees, but it was too expensive. So she offers a more flexible schedule and a higher salary, but that's often still not enough to convince some applicants to join her agency. The candidate for nursing director, for instance, is a single mom with two small children and said she could only take a position with benefits.
November 9, 2020 - HUD Deputy Chief of Staff Coalter Baker releases a statement that Carson has tested positive for the coronavirus. He is in good spirits and feels fortunate to have access to effective therapeutics which aid and markedly speed his recovery.

I think it's stupid. I'm being very declarative here. I think it's stupid, Scaramucci, whose short-lived tenure as White House communications director imploded due to his combative personality, said later. There's no strategy that you can tell – other than the fact that you're frustrated and you want to ventilate your frustrations into the international airwaves. OK. But I think it's stupid.
One key meeting between National Economic Council Director Brian Deese and a group of 16 bipartisan senators will take place on Sunday. But more are planned -- and Biden himself is expected to be an active player in the days and weeks ahead.
So far, some of the initial votes have been cast in high profile cases, other cases are yet to be argued. Drafts will fly between chambers from now until the end of June. By then -- as the presidential election gears up -- the public will have a greater sense of how fast and how far the court will move.
Hype and hate won't stop this virus. Denial didn't work when President Trump tried it. And attacking Democratic governors won't help the country heal either.

Wednesday's arguments were the third time the justices, due to the coronavirus, heard oral arguments by telephone.
Health Secretary Alex Azar said that short-term policies will give Americans more choices so they can find coverage that meets their needs. Rates will likely be lower for younger and healthier Americans since these policies' premiums are based on consumers' health status and the plans don't have to offer as many benefits as those on the Obamacare exchanges.
El plan tiene un precio de 1,7 billones de dólares en sus primeros 10 años, incluyendo 400.000 millones para investigación entre universidades y el sector privado.
Saving and strengthening the Affordable Care Act: The central theme of Biden's health care campaign, prior to the pandemic, was improving the Affordable Care Act. Though The central theme of Biden's health care campaign, prior to the pandemic, was improving the Affordable Care Act. Though former President Donald Trump did not succeed in achieving his key 2016 pledge to repeal the law, his health officials made a multitude of changes to it. Reversing those will keep Biden's team busy.
WASHINGTON, DC - JANUARY 12: Speaker of the House Paul Ryan (R-WI) talks with reporters during his weekly news conference in the Capitol Visitors Center at the U.S. Capitol January 12, 2017 in Washington, DC.

Trump looked better but his arguments on foreign policy, especially, though forceful, still did not meet the reality test. Clinton was clear but not as crisp this time. A draw.
Kushner's troubles began, though we didn't know it at the time, before Trump took office, when he saw fit to attend the now infamous Trump Tower meeting with a Russian lawyer who claimed to peddle dirt on Hillary Clinton. After arriving in Washington, and being handed an almost comically large policy platter, his background check didn't check out and he's been working ever since with an interim clearance. When chief of staff John Kelly launched a security clearance crackdown in the midst (or is it the aftermath, now?) of the scandal surrounding former staff secretary Rob Porter, Kushner came into his crosshairs.

Just over half of consumers who looked for coverage during the open enrollment period for 2020 coverage encountered difficulties, and nearly 5 million folks sought in-person help but couldn't get it, according to a Kaiser Family Foundation analysis released Monday.
Trump has not been chastened, however. Most recently, he's sought credit for not being in the middle of a nuclear war.
I know I can be too tough sometimes and I can push too hard, she told MSNBC earlier this month. That is obvious. But a lot of it is I have high expectations for myself and I have high expectations for people who work with me.
Roberts and Kavanaugh were also difficult to read in November when the Court heard a case concerning the Trump administration's efforts to terminate DACA (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals) -- the Obama era program that shields hundreds of thousands of undocumented immigrants who arrived in the US as children from deportation.
Blue Cross, the largest insurer in the state's individual market, plans to offer five policies under the name Freedom Blue that will differ from its Obamacare offerings. The insurer offered a comparison between one of its new plans and its most popular bronze policy on the exchange. The Freedom Blue plan's medical deductible and co-pays are somewhat lower, but it has a separate deductible for prescription drugs and its out-of-pocket maximum are considerably higher.
Similarly, Obamacare is now favored by a majority of Americans, according to a March poll by Kaiser.

Trump said at the March 14 and March 16 briefings that much of the media had been very fair in its coronavirus coverage. But he has used other briefings as a vehicle for his long-running effort to undermine the credibility of prominent news outlets.
Utah GOP gives Romney a pass
David Gergen has been a White House adviser to four presidents and is a senior political analyst at CNN. A graduate of Harvard Law School, he is a professor of public service and the former director of the Center for Public Leadership at the Harvard Kennedy School.
States' funding would be based on their prior spending levels. For the lump sum model, it would be increased annually based either on the state's historic growth rate or a medical inflation rate, whichever is less. The agency could work with states to readjust the funding levels under special circumstances, Verma said.
GRANHOLM: And importantly the executive order was temporary. It was not a long-term -- this is a permanent wall to fund a fake emergency that everybody --
YANG: That if there are economic -- more economic sanctions, if use disrupt the civil society inside North Korea, you can -- could have people surging across that border into China, which they don't want.
[06:15:08] Nevertheless, rescuers remained hopeful and determined as the global community rallies around Mexico. Volunteers from around the world coming from as far away as Japan and Taiwan, working together with hundreds of ordinary people who have flocked to the area to do whatever they can to help save lives.
Facts First: As we have repeatedly : As we have repeatedly noted , Trump released the rough transcript of his July phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky before, not after, House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff delivered an exaggerated rendition of the call at a committee meeting. When Trump released the transcript, therefore, Democrats did not say it was different than what Schiff had said.
Errol Louis wrote that Sen. Bernie Sanders and his followers must face wrote that Sen. Bernie Sanders and his followers must face the hard reality that the political revolution he called for is not occurring . Voters that supported him four years ago have clearly decided to look elsewhere, and they seem to be gravitating to Biden.

President Obama gave them nothing. He gave them pillows and sheets and things like that, and I gave them tank busters. -- January 22 interview with CNBC's Joe Kernen
And beyond the diplomatic implications, Trump has also had to confront the reality that China long ago stopped artificially devaluing its currency – instead working to prop it up, which benefits US exports.
That weight has enormous implications for our future. If you were to talk to Peter Orszag, who was the budget writer for Mr. Obama for four years, or to Erskine Bowles, who I have known for over 20 years, or Paul Ryan, they will all tell you the same thing. Until we get our fiscal house in order and really redirect the trajectory of our spending, we will end up collapsing like Greece.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on Thursday sought to distance his caucus from Trump's latest venture, saying he looks forward to seeing what the President is proposing and what he can work out with the (House) speaker.
In an interview published by Time magazine in early December, Zelensky did say, Look, I never talked to the President from the position of a quid pro quo. That's not my thing. But Zelensky continued: I don't want us to look like beggars. But you have to understand. We're at war. If you're our strategic partner, then you can't go blocking anything for us. I think that's just about fairness. It's not about a quid pro quo. It just goes without saying.
A woman almost got trampled when she tried to pet a moose
Academic studies have associated Part D coverage with decreases in hospital admissions and over $2 billion in savings due to improved drug adherence among patients with congestive heart failure. The government doesn't directly negotiate drug prices in Part D of Medicare, nor does it set the cost of the benefit. Instead, health plans and PBMs negotiate prices with drug manufacturers and then compete with one another based on price and quality, for market share. As a result, Part D is the rare federal program that has come in under-budget. According to the Congressional Budget Office, total program costs between 2004-2013 were 45 percent less than original projections.
THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.
But if Republican repeal efforts fail, House Speaker Paul Ryan signaled Tuesday that no one should expect lawmakers to include those tax cuts in tax reform.
[22:45:14] LEMON: That was actually brilliant the way she did it because it wasn't good to see you, hello, she just said good morning. And that was a First Lady good morning and then she moved on. But listen. I want to talk about it. I have got to put this poll up, all right? Because there's -- this new poll is out asking Democrats about how they feel about 23 presidential nominees.
Which is a very weird thing for politicians, who depend on channeling the public will, to do. In search of some explanation for this bizarre behavior, I reached out the the Salt Lake Tribune's Benjamin Wood, who has been all over this Medicaid expansion fight.
I want to give a special shout-out to a man who's been an extraordinary mayor for this city, Obama said that day. He's been a leader throughout the country for the past 12 years, Mr. Michael Bloomberg is here.
The caravan of vehicles features two 45-foot buses along with several RVs and a contingent of SUVs and support vehicles. It will head east from California to unify, educate, and most importantly encourage Americans to continue their opposition of deficit spending, government-run health care, and irresponsible bailouts, the group said in a statement.
Jeb Bush was heavily criticized for being unrealistic when he promised to get the economy humming at 4% a year. Cruz is aiming even higher.
Trump claimed that normally, presidents are left no court vacancies at all; if you have one, he said, it's lucky.
COOPER: And again, the stigma that so many place on mental health issues, I mean, the silence that surrounds this, it's something that we -- it is unfortunate we always end up talking about it in the wake of something --
Sanders leads the Democratic field in raw measures of engagement on social media with more than 10 million followers on Twitter and 5 million likes on his campaign's official Facebook page.
Conservative groups such as Freedom Works, run by former House Majority Leader Dick Armey, Campaign Liberty and the Institute for Liberty are just some of those who will attend the march.
In its defense, the administration acknowledges that it had to make last-minute changes to its budget in light of the Friday agreement, which funds the government through 2019 at higher levels of discretionary spending. The issue is, Trump's budget doesn't change any of its assumptions for the period after 2019, creating a series of fiscal crises.
Bottom line, the dynamic of the caucus remains unchanged.
HEWITT: Governor Kasich, if it takes 20,000 or 30,000, if the Pentagon says that's what needs to be done, will you follow their advice?
The other story he's not telling is the one of creating fear in the immigrant community with deportations and other enforcement moves.
BASH: Well -- well, on that note, we expect at some point, maybe soon, maybe not, the findings of the Mueller investigation to finally be completed.
– President Barack Obama, to House Republicans, apparently quoting Republican governors and senators
On Tuesday, Trump falsely accused McCain of misleading the White House over how he would vote.
Blame features prominently in a lot of Trump's foreign policy, too. He's repeatedly blamed past presidents – from Reagan to Obama – for negotiating what he says are bad trade deals and for failing to stand up for the US. This was before he started announcing a raft of new tariffs on goods coming into the US from Canada, Mexico, Europe and China.
The directive will call on federal agencies to amend the rules governing these plans to free them from state regulation, according to a Wall Street Journal report on Saturday. Instead, the nationwide plans would be subject to the same federal oversight as large-employer policies.

REP. DENNY HECK (D), WASHINGTON: I don't know if you heard about that general election that we had. We're all a little tied up there for a few weeks.
Klobuchar spent the lead-up to the town hall with a trip through Wisconsin and Iowa, building on her campaign theme of retaking Midwest communities that have drifted away from Democrats in recent years. Klobuchar, a three-term senator from Minnesota, is pitching herself as a pragmatic lawmaker who is willing to work with those who oppose her to get things done.
SCHATZ: Adding a provision to fund a dam opens the door for similar projects in the next C.R. This project has tripled in cost. It's behind schedule and if regular order had prevailed, it's unclear whether that would have been funded at all in the normal energy and water appropriations bill.
But because Congress cut the tax penalty to zero, Texas and other Republican-led states sued, saying Roberts' logic no longer applies.
Kathleen -- Is it great Kathleen (inaudible) we'll be enjoying his company all evening. Tell me what you are going through right now, what your particular concern is?
SNELL: Well, this is not necessarily something that's going to calm critics down. It's also not a situation that makes it any easier on the Senate because they are going to have to confirm replacements for Zinke --
JOSH BARRO, POLITICS EDITOR, BUSINESS INSIDER: Yeah, well I mean that's fine as an explanation for why we have a Republican House and a Democratic President but it's an excuse for why republicans have decided that they're going to hold hostage the normal operation of government in order to have negotiations.
The proposed regulation stems from an executive order President Trump issued in October and is the administration's latest step in whittling away at Obamacare. It would allow small firms to form small business health plans based on their location or industry. Sole proprietors would also be eligible to join the plans, which would ideally be able to use their scale to secure less expensive coverage much like large-employer plans do.
What would happen to the federal budget deficit?
BLITZER: Very poised. We say she's got a really excellent speech that she's been working out for a long time, it's been a challenge, the story, the personal story of her relationship with her father, but this video that is about to, that we're going to show a video put together by this convention.
Our solution is a portable monthly tax credit. This is why we believe this is the right way to go.
It was so bad, where he goes before Congress, and he makes a statement that I made, and it was a total fraud. I never made it...That's why I released the conversation, because if I didn't release it, people would have said that I made the statement that he made. -- January 22 interview with Fox Business' Maria Bartiromo

CMS fined Lincoln Manor $282,954, including $10,091 a day for 28 days, from the time the nursing home noticed the problem with the wound until supervisors had retrained nurses to avoid similar errors. An administrative law judge called the penalties quite modest given the appalling care.
Facts First: This was a major exaggeration. While Trump's administration has : This was a major exaggeration. While Trump's administration has invested in new military planes, it is not even close to true that the planes currently in use are all brand new.
COOPER: Many of the gay community believe this is probably the most anti-gay of Republican platform they have seen.
The plan is the latest move by the Trump administration to inject conservative ideals into the 55-year-old health program for low-income people, coming two years after it allowed states to require certain beneficiaries to work , an effort that's largely been halted by the courts.
But if he respects your toughness and respects your honestly and your loyalty, somebody said, as you guys were entering this eight-hour segment, that the loyalty for the president is one-sided. That is absolute nonsense. He is a symmetrical loyalist for sure. If you take care of him, he's going to take care of you. I've seen it yesterday. I can't tell you the number of people when I was sitting in the Oval Office with him that he was calling to thank for voting for the bill and staying onside as fellow Republicans and doing the right thing for the United States.
The economy has added 487,000 manufacturing jobs under Trump. Manufacturing job growth slowed significantly in 2019, with a total gain of just 29,000 jobs from January through December, but the President still has a pretty good true story to tell here.
He was calling (President George W.) Bush, President Bush all the time, 'Get into the Middle East! Get in to the Middle East,'  Trump claimed, adding we've lost tremendous health and tremendous lives in that war.
I think that's difficult. I want to help people now. That's why you do Medicare at 50.
Bloomberg made the comments in response to a question from CNN's Anderson Cooper about why Democratic voters should trust Bloomberg, who only rejoined the party in 2018 after tenures as both a Republican and independent.
Therefore, we recently imposed tariffs on $250 billion of Chinese goods – and now our Treasury is receiving billions of dollars a month from a country that never gave us a dime. But I don't blame China for taking advantage of us – I blame our leaders and representatives for allowing this travesty to happen. I have great respect for President Xi, and we are now working on a new trade deal with China. But it must include real, structural change to end unfair trade practices, reduce our chronic trade deficit, and protect American jobs.
Above all, friend and foe alike must never doubt this Nation's power and will to defend our people. Eighteen years ago, terrorists attacked the USS Cole – and last month American forces killed one of the leaders of the attack.
TAPPER: Are you at all concerns, Senator Turner, about the image of impeachment proceedings against an African-American lieutenant governor while the attorney general and the governor who have both admitted dressing up in blackface escape any consequences? NINA TURNER, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: Very concerned, Jake. I was going to say, I hope that the legislature starts impeachment for all three of these folks. You know, what a hell of a way to start off black history month. Totally (INAUDIBLE).
The concerted effort on Biden's first major legislative achievement is an acknowledgment that the party in power is often punished in midterm elections, in part because of the opposing party's ability to seize on complicated legislation and use it to turn voters against the controlling party.
The Freedom Caucus continued to push to repeal popular pieces of Obamacare, such as the requirement that insurers cover people with preexisting conditions, something President Donald Trump had publicly said he wanted to keep in place.
I know I can be too tough sometimes and I can push too hard, she told MSNBC earlier this month. That is obvious. But a lot of it is I have high expectations for myself and I have high expectations for people who work with me.
Facts First: The US has not just now become the world's top energy producer: it took the top spot : The US has not just now become the world's top energy producer: it took the top spot in 2012 , according to the US government's Energy Information Administration -- under the very Obama administration Trump is accusing of perpetrating a war on the industry.
When Trump made a similar claim about Hirono, the Green New Deal and air travel in February, Hirono told HawaiiNewsNow: As usual, climate change denier Donald Trump makes things up and doesn't know what he's talking about. While the Green New Deal is an ambitious plan to combat climate change, it does not call for the elimination of air travel. I will continue to fight against this president's lies.
Republican members and aides who had considered themselves allies of Trump on Capitol Hill aren't surprised the President demands loyalty, but they're clearly frustrated by the position they are in.
SANDERS: I -- I think by being truthful and transparent, as he has every single day.
Of course, this is nonsense. For the Obama administration it was simply the best deal on offer. Could the Obama team have pushed harder for tougher sunset clauses on the deal that would have pushed even further into the future the moment when Iran could resume its nuclear program? Maybe.
BASH: Well, and you are referring, of course, to what the House is likely to do and later the Senate, which is a joint resolution to terminate the president's national emergency.
About 9 million fewer Americans will have health insurance next year thanks to the Trump administration and Republicans in Congress, a new report estimates.
TAPPER: I want to turn to foreign policy.
More than 11.5 million people had signed up for coverage through the federal exchange and the 12 state-based exchanges, as of Dec. 24, according to federal data. That was 286,000 more than the comparable time a year ago.
Beyond television, that included mailers, newspapers, Instagram, Facebook, Spanish-language radio, panel trucks, texts, phone and ads on music streaming services like Pandora and Spotify.
Tom Steyer came to life when he spoke about climate change. The question was about trade, but unlike Warren, who seemed to be reaching to include Wall Street in her national security answer, Steyer seamlessly and personally made an appeal to put climate at the heart of any future trade deal.
The effort will hurt people with pre-existing conditions, said a coalition of 27 patient and consumer groups, including the American Heart Association, the Arthritis Foundation and the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network.

And as for the moderators Anderson Cooper and Martha Raddatz: Did someone slip PEDs into their drinking water? This is the first time we've seen this kind of muscular, unyielding and disciplined questioning from the floorkeepers at a debate, and the demand that the candidates actually engage the topics being asked was bracing and refreshing. More of the same at debate 3, please...if there is one after this utter fiasco of a week for the Trump campaign.
My sense is that the two of them have a much better working relationship today and respect each's role, Short said, adding there's a lot that we feel we've all accomplished together. He calls McConnell a champion on regulatory acts.
European markets opened lower, while most Asian markets ended the week with gains.
The caucus would prefer this be done on a bipartisan basis. We haven't made a decision yet to use reconciliation, but we are prepared to move very quickly if it looks like we can't do it any other way, Rep.

Zelensky did say there had been no pressure from Trump and made other statements to that effect, but he has not gone so far as to say Trump did nothing wrong.
Trump might well have made an innocent slip rather than an intentional falsehood, but this was at least the sixth time he has cited an inaccurate percentage for these tariffs.
'Those at the top are not doing their part:' WH looks to raise taxes on wealthy
The Democrats support illegal immigration because they view those illegal immigrants as potential voters and far too many of the Republicans are doing the bidding of Wall Street and the special interest and they view it as cheap labor.
The complications of tax reform and funding the government are one reason why the White House is looking for a clean win on the confirmation of Gorsuch – a process that could be completed by the end of next week.
Worse still, I have been deprived of basic Constitutional Due Process from the beginning of this impeachment scam right up until the present. I have been denied the most fundamental rights afforded by the Constitution, including the right to present evidence, to have my own counsel present, to confront accusers, and to call and cross-examine witnesses... -- December 17 anti-impeachment letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi
One person walked into a room when he was supposed to go this way, and he said he was going this way, and he walked in and he went this way, and everyone said, 'What happened, what was that all about?' Boy oh boy, who was that, I don't know. I don't know. I don't want to be controversial, so I won't use his name, OK? Trump said during a wide-ranging remarks Friday, prompting boos from a fired-up crowd.
CUOMO: That sounds like a hollow criticism.
On Tuesday night, Sanders had to defend his numerous comments praising elements of the Cuban communist regime, which have recently gained attention following a 60 Minutes interview and a CNN townhall.

Rodney Whitlock, a health policy consultant and former Republican Senate staffer, said health inspectors are out there looking for opportunities to show that the nursing homes are not living up to some extremely tight standards. He said while the motivation for tough regulation was understandable, the fines don't make it easier to hire people and doesn't make it easier to stay in business.

Facts First: There is no evidence that either the first whistleblower (who filed the complaint about Trump's dealings with Ukraine) or the second whistleblower (whose lawyers said they had firsthand information corroborating claims made by the first whistleblower) disappeared, nor that the first whistleblower's sources in the administration have disappeared. Whistleblowers have no obligation to speak publicly.

One of the longest negotiations I've ever seen, by the way. If they don't come back early, I was saying don't negotiate. They come back early.
PRESTON: Yes. No doubt, going into 2018. Listen, soaring rhetoric from Paul Ryan saying that is going to be a generational defining moment. I would argue that happened back when President Trump was sworn into office. He talked about optimistic and we shouldn't live in fear. I would argue the country is living in fear right now. Not necessarily because of Paul Ryan but because of the leadership in the White House. And Republicans have a lot to do, as do Democrats, in the new year to try to restore trust.

Warren pivoted to make a vital argument about the centrality of the women's vote to victory in 2020, reminding the audience that The only people on stage who have won every single election they've been in are the women. It was reminiscent of 1984 when President Ronald Reagan was asked about his age during a televised debate with the younger Walter Mondale. Without missing a beat, Reagan, who some thought was too old to be president, promised that he wouldn't use Mondale's youth and inexperience against him.

TAPPER: Are you worried at all that that might be an effective attack against Democrats?
CNN reported that more than two dozen GOP lawmakers, ranging from rank-and-file members, conservatives and party leaders, refused to say they'd back Trump's re-election bid – a surprise declaration given that members of Congress are typically quick to endorse sitting presidents of their own party without hesitation.
Former Texas Congressman Beto O'Rourke says he supports taking the border wall, the border fencing in and around El Paso, where he's from, down, because he said it hasn't made the country safer. Do you think the existing walls and fencing along the border should come down?
Members of Congress, we must never forget that the only victories that matter in Washington are victories that deliver for the American people. The people are the heart of our country, their dreams are the soul of our country, and their love is what powers and sustains our country. We must always remember that our job is to put America first!
There are similar quotes, like those about McCain.
Slavitt's role is expected to be temporary, sources said, as the incoming Biden administration is days away from inheriting the daunting task of getting the spread of Covid under control and quickly vaccinating the country. The expected hire underscores the all-hands-on-deck approach the Biden team appears to be taking when it comes to the coronavirus, as it looks to meet its goal of administering 100 million vaccine shots during Biden's first 100 days in office.
Let's take a broader look at the Republican Party now. Mr. Trump, one of the concerns your opponents have expressed throughout the course of this campaign is the notion that in their estimation you hold views that are at direct odds with Republican Party tradition.
And I'm a big golden rule guy, treat other people the way we want to be treated. And I always like to say, how would you want to treat this woman if this was your sister that was involved or your mother was involved? And we use it as a standard, as a rule, as a guide.
Other actions, including many issued through the use of executive authority, can be undone through the regulatory process or with the flick of Joe Biden's pen once he's president. Still, those actions will have sometimes had a years long impact on American lives, affecting everything from their jobs to their schools to the kinds of lightbulbs they can buy.
I recognized the politics are hard for them because the easier thing to do is to give in to the most extreme voices within their party and stand pat and do nothing. But that's not our job. Our job is to fulfill our constitutional duties.
Maintaining comprehensive benefits packages ... for now. Obamacare requires insurers to cover 10 essential health benefits, including maternity, prescription drugs and mental health services. The Republicans want to jettison this rule, but can't do so under the budget reconciliation process.
Just cannot believe a judge would put our country in such peril. If something happens blame him and court system. People pouring in. Bad! he tweeted.
El CBO y el Comité Conjunto de Impuestos encontraron que cinco millones menos de personas tendrían cobertura del Medicaid en 2018 y otros 14 millones dejarían de inscribirse en el programa para 2026. Mientras tanto, seis millones menos de estadounidenses contarían con cobertura en el mercado individual para 2018, pero esa cifra disminuiría a dos millones para 2026. Eso se debe, en parte, a que menos empleadores les ofrecerán seguro a sus trabajadores, llevando a que cada vez más personas lleguen al mercado individual.
Trump has spent the last several days in meetings at Mar-a-Lago with Republicans who are clamoring to assure him of their allegiance.
Meghan McCain on Monday continued her fierce pushback against President Donald Trump, who over the weekend revived his long-running feud with her father, the late Sen. John McCain.
We all remember reading in high school history about the literacy tests and poll taxes that prevented blacks from voting in the Jim Crow South. The tactics have only gotten more sophisticated. This has not been an accident. Voter suppression works, and it is most successful at hampering the votes of vulnerable groups in society, namely people of color, the elderly, students, and the disabled.
In criticizing the previous administration's dealings with China, Trump took a shot at Hunter Biden, the son of the former vice president.
If so, this is the type of case where the four liberal justices may have to settle for a strong dissent.
I want to build on the momentum that we saw here in 2018, Klobuchar told reporters Saturday in Wisconsin. No one ever thought that the Democrats were going to be able (to defeat) Gov. Walker, but we did it, and we did it in a smart, Wisconsin way with a grassroots campaign with (Democratic Sen.) Tammy Baldwin at the top of the ticket, and we can do it in the presidential, as well.
BROWN: It's all of those things. That will mean a lot more people almost immediately can get insurance. And that's the way I want to go.

More people have health insurance than ever before, but many still struggle to pay for care. According to a new report, medical debt is the No. 1 reason consumers reported being contacted by a collection agency. If efforts to overhaul the Affordable Care Act result in more people losing their coverage, those numbers could rise.
TRUMP: The establishment, the media, the special interest, the lobbyists, the donors, they're all against me.
A Klobuchar aide told CNN on Monday that the senator prepared for the town hall like she would for a major interview.
CUOMO: Do you think that the race is over for the nomination?
But again I'm talking about people like myself and Ted who are 45 years old. We're years away from retirement. For people that are on it now, we don't have to change it at all. If we don't do anything, we will have a debt crisis. It's not a question of if. It is a question of when. In less than five years, only 17 percent of our budget will remain discretionary; 83 percent of the federal budget in less than five years will all be spent on Medicare, Medicaid, the interest on the debt.
And if you look at them, they're really quite remarkable in that each and every one of them should send shivers through the White House because they all identify different forms of connections to people who were in the administration, are in the administration, and talk about how Mr. Cohen is providing important information.
Why he's important: Manchin is a political survivor, a Democrat in what's become a very red state.
Facts First: It's true that Sanders It's true that Sanders voted against the Brady Bill five times , but it's unclear how a longer waiting period would have prevented Roof from purchasing the firearm.
We're going to cut off federal taxpayer funds to any city that defies federal immigration laws.
But the sticking point for Republicans is increasing taxes. President Obama says, one, I can't ask for seniors to make sacrifices without asking the wealthiest Americans to do so as well. And then he says, two, politically, he can't ask Democrats to -- in the House and the Senate to vote for something that trims these programs without asking for them -- asking Republicans to vote for something they don't want to do, which is raise taxes.
He's very committed to repealing and replacing it. Mr. Trump has been very up-front about what some of those particulars are, she said. And we also know that you have popular provisions like coverage for pre-existing conditions. We also know there are Americans relying upon it now.
Trump added Wednesday that veterans were on his side during the dispute, because McCain didn't get the job done with the Veterans Administration.
I've been in my share of locker rooms covering sports over the past 20 years and while lewd talk is real, I've yet to hear an athlete use the crude, childlike words Trump used describing how he approaches women: Grab them by the p—y. ... You can do anything.
He befriends the bewildered. He pushes everybody around him including you through comfort barriers that they never thought that they could ever, ever shatter. And he does all this with the discipline of an animal in the jungle, you know, his motto is that a lion wakes up every morning and knows one thing that it has to run faster than the fastest gazelle and a gazelle wakes up and she knows that she needs to run faster than the fastest lion. But whether you are a gazelle or lion, you wake up in the morning, you get the hell going. And that is Donald.
So it was fair for Trump to applaud the second statement, but its existence does not mean that media reports about the first statement were inaccurate.
Sen. Elizabeth Warren danced around a question about reporting that Bernie Sanders allegedly told her last year that a woman could not be elected president. If nothing else, her response did get Sanders off message for a while.
Other liberals on the bench joined in with Ginsburg's concerns. Justice Sonia Sotomayor, for instance, pointed out that there would be a substantial number of women who wouldn't be able to get coverage. I understand the figure to be around 75,000 and 125,000 she said. And Justice Stephen Breyer echoed Roberts' thoughts. I don't understand why this can't be worked out, he said.
The White House has been in regular talks with leaders and top tax writers in the House and Senate to come up with a framework for a tax reform bill they can all agree on.

We're at a moment of awakening in this country where more and more White folks are feeling that they have to relearn and unlearn some of what they've learned. And there's a sense of wanting to change our course, recognizing that we have gone off course as a country and that we have to face up to decisions in order to really have the country we all deserve.
Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush said the Senate did not give President Barack Obama the authorization he asked for to use military force against ISIS.

Until then, the jobless can still shop for plans on the exchanges and receive enhanced subsidies, though they may have to pay a premium depending on their income.
Allow insurers to sell plans that cover less of the costs. Obamacare created four tiers of coverage, each with a requirement to cover a certain share of policyholders' costs, on average. The bill would eliminate this rule. Presumably, insurers would be able to offer plans with higher deductibles and co-pays. However, since the legislation does not lift the cap on out-of-pocket expenses, insurers could not require consumers to pay more than that for covered services. The deductibles for many bronze-tier plans are already pegged to that cap.
Listen, he spends his weekend obsessing over great men because he knows it, and I know it, and all of you know it: he will never be a great man, McCain said on ABC's The View, where she is a co-host.
As one Republican aide put it to me, every member who is following Trump down this path to overturn the election has to remember that it will all be for nothing if they ever disagree with Trump down the line.
But Pennsylvania's Attorney General Josh Shapiro, joined by New Jersey's attorney general, told the Supreme Court that the lower court got it right. He pointed out that an accommodation is already in place that allows certain objecting employers to exclude contraception for the benefit packages and allowing third parties to provide the coverage directly.
After critics blasted Donald Trump last week for unveiling a roster of 13 economic advisers without any women, the Republican nominee has added nine new members -- eight of which are female.
The President felt burned by the Freedom Caucus's rejection of the compromise, a White House official said.
And, later, his campaign mastered the use of technology to help lift him to presidential victory. So how did his team drop the ball on the Obamacare rollout? I will ask President Obama's former chief of technology ahead.
Additionally, a spate of negative headlines about Klobuchar's demanding management style have trickled out around her 2020 announcement.

SANDERS: Overnight, the regime of the Venezuelan dictator Maduro detained two leading opposition figures, following its outrageous seizure of power through sham elections this weekend. The vice president spoke with Mr. Lopez just last week, and he and Mr. Ledezma are political prisoners held unjustly by the Maduro regime.
He was calling (President George W.) Bush, President Bush all the time, 'Get into the Middle East! Get in to the Middle East,'  Trump claimed, adding we've lost tremendous health and tremendous lives in that war.
Anthem joins a growing list of insurers exiting Obamacare for 2018. Humana (HUM), Aetna (AET), Wellmark Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Iowa and Blue Cross Blue Shield of Kansas City have all said they are pulling out, citing a mix of uncertainty and big losses from higher-than-expected bills racked up by sick policyholders. Some 19,000 Missouri residents could be stranded next year because of Blue Cross of Kansas City's withdrawal.
Democrats, for their part, they are on the campaign trail pushing back on the national emergency declaration, calling it manufactured and inappropriate.
He was accepted to the La Lumiere school, graduated first in his class, sped through Harvard College in three years and entered Harvard Law School, where he was managing editor of the law review. After his 1979 graduation, Roberts earned two prestigious judicial clerkships, for Judge Henry Friendly, on the New York-based 2nd Circuit, and for then-Associate Justice William Rehnquist.
The President has the support of millions of veterans in the United States. I don't think those veterans are in love with the fact that he's attacking John McCain, he said.
Elizabeth Warren gave half of a great answer, excoriating generals who say we've turned the corner so many times that we're going in circles. But she also weirdly shoehorned in an attack on giant financial institutions. Amy Klobuchar was the only one who truly took the fight to Trump, demonstrating impressive expertise on military affairs, and heart-rending empathy on trade.
Jones has habitually given Trump credit for the First Step Act criminal justice reform law -- including in a CNN appearance three weeks before Trump made the October claim, in which Jones said, I think Trump has gotten too little credit for what he did on criminal justice reform.
At a Trump event in January, Council on Environmental Quality chairwoman Mary Neumayr said , The Council on Environmental Quality has found that the average time for federal agencies to complete Environmental Impact Statements is four and half years. Further, for highway projects, it takes over seven years on average.
Facts First: It's not true that median household income gains under Trump were almost $10,000 in three years. A firm called Sentier Research says real median household income, pre-tax, was $65,666 in December 2019 -- up from $61,496 (in inflation-adjusted December 2019 dollars) in January 2017, a difference of $4,170. Trump habitually adds an additional $5,000-plus on account of his loosening of regulations and supposed energy savings, but these explanations do not make sense mathematically.
Bernie has tremendous volunteer investments in Nevada, said Kristian Ramos, a political consultant who works with Latino groups like Mi Familia Vota, which is focused on expanding the voting population in Nevada.
Vindman did eventually speak to Congress in the impeachment inquiry, but only under subpoena.
Facts First: Trump's deal with China reduces, but does not eliminate, some of the US tariffs on imported Chinese products. Schumer accurately described the tariff changes in a January : Trump's deal with China reduces, but does not eliminate, some of the US tariffs on imported Chinese products. Schumer accurately described the tariff changes in a January letter in which he argued that Trump had given away leverage with a temporary deal of some reduced tariffs in exchange for American goods and vague promises of reform.

The case will continue even if the Justice Department under Biden withdraws, because it originated with Texas and other Republican-led states. But the President could work with the new Democratic majority in Congress to short circuit the GOP states' legal argument -- by setting the penalty at a $1, for instance.
RYAN: So let me just finish. Don't interrupt me, if you don't mind.
The town hall format is familiar for Klobuchar, who has found success in her home state – which almost went for President Donald Trump in 2016 – by consciously visiting each of Minnesota's 87 counties, often to hold town-hall style events.
It's not addressing the two issues, Bloomberg added of Obamacare. Number one, it's going to bankrupt us. And number two, Europe seems to get more for that money. They say yes and then they go back to taking care of every special interest.
CNN's Erica Orden is following all of this. Erica -- let's start with Michael Flynn. This was a fascinating moment because both sides, the Flynn legal team and the Mueller legal team had said that Michael Flynn deserves no jail time because of his extensive cooperation. Now we see the Mueller coming out swinging saying that Michael Flynn's version of the facts is untrue and he should have known that lying to federal investigators is against the law.

Crazy Nancy thereby gives the strong edge to Sleepy Joe Biden, and Bernie is shut out again. Very unfair, but that's the way the Democrats play the game. Anyway, it's a lot of fun to watch! -- January 17 tweet
Bloomberg's poor debate performance exposed what many advisers had worried were his lackluster campaign chops, not to mention his lengthy history as a Republican politician -- and the positions that came with that. Along with his stop and frisk issues, and the lewd remarks he'd allegedly made, Bloomberg also had to contend with critical comments he made about Obamacare, the sweeping health care policy passed by former President Barack Obama.
Facts First: Trump was exaggerating, though the February unemployment rate was indeed impressive.
We're very open to hearing her, and hopefully she'll have a good hearing, Manchin, a longtime supporter of fossil fuel industries in his home state, said Monday.
But if 2018 was the year of women getting elected, is 2019 the year when women get things done? The historic female duo leading the House Appropriations Committee, Democratic Chairwoman Nita Lowey and Republican Ranking Member Kay Granger say just watch.
A national Medicare-for-all plan received the lowest favorability score in Kaiser Family Foundation's January tracking poll, released Wednesday. Some 56% of respondents said they favor Medicare-for-all, in which all Americans would get their insurance from a single government plan.
ROMANS: Good morning. I'm Christine Romans. It is Wednesday, December 5th. It is exactly 5:00 a.m. in the East.
In the 2017 tax bill , Republicans effectively eliminated the individual mandate, a key part of Obamacare, by reducing the penalty for not having insurance to $0. But other provisions of the law remained. The bill did not eliminate Obamacare's expansion of the Medicaid insurance program for low-income people, the federal and state marketplaces that allow people to shop for coverage, or the consumer subsidies that help many of them make the purchases. While Trump continued to take other steps to weaken Obamacare, much of it still exists.
GEORGE CARY, WIFE DIED OF FUNGAL MENINGITIS AFTER INJECTION: First of all, she was a wonderful woman that she had a love for life. She was part of our family, and that this should not have happened. This is a tragedy that goes beyond our family.
First, this was the first debate since Cory Booker, Julián Castro and Kamala Harris ended their campaigns. The debate was poorer without their voices, and without Andrew Yang, who failed to qualify, in the mix.
Trump vs. Democrats on the economy
When he finally had the chance to do it, he voted against repeal and replace, the President said. Remember thumbs down?
COOPER: One of the most contentious moments, Jill, was, I mean, the State Department said that they had -- I don't have the exact phrasing but basically the appropriate number of people on the ground, and there was -- there was a sharp rebuke from the panel saying, how can you say that when -- given four Americans are dead.
Michelle Obama, Bill Clinton and Michigan
The town hall format is familiar for Klobuchar, who has found success in her home state – which almost went for President Donald Trump in 2016 – by consciously visiting each of Minnesota's 87 counties, often to hold town-hall style events.
BASH: Welcome back to STATE OF THE UNION. I'm Dana Bash.
Not surprisingly, the more education a recipient has, the more likely they are to be employed. About half of those who didn't finish high school have jobs, but nearly 70% of those with at least a bachelor's degree do.
Facts First: The US did not become the world's top energy producer under Trump: It took the top spot under the Obama administration The US did not become the world's top energy producer under Trump: It took the top spot under the Obama administration in 2012 , according to the US government's Energy Information Administration.
To be sure, Trump delivered on a number of initial campaign promises . He cut regulations, lowered taxes, withdrew from the Trans Pacific Partnership, pulled the US out of the Paris Climate Agreement and appointed hundreds of conservative justices. But in many cases, the reality behind the talking points and slogans fell short of what was actually promised.
Again, publicly, no end to the standoff in sight. The question is, what about behind the scenes?
Well, I'm female, I'm progressive and the rest, so what's your problem? she said with a laugh. Two out of three ain't bad.
Instead, the Republican plan seeks to allow insurers to impose a 30% surcharge on the premiums of those who let their coverage lapse for at least 63 days. The plan would enable insurers to levy this surcharge for one year, but it would only apply to policies bought in the individual or small group markets.
Last week, former 2016 Trump campaign adviser Michael Caputo was named to serve as the agency's new spokesman. A source familiar with the situation told CNN that Caputo was brought in because of the President's distrust of Azar and to expect to see an uncomfortable power dynamic between the two men.
Klobuchar's primary pitch to voters is likely to be electability. The Democrat has been notably successful in Minnesota, winning her three terms in the Senate by an average of 26 percentage points. Klobuchar won re-election in 2018 with 60% of the vote, two years after Trump came within two points of defeating Hillary Clinton in the state.
BUTTIGIEG: And they said that was socialist. So, I think the word has mostly lost its meaning. And it's certainly lost its ability to be used as a kill switch on debate. TAPPER: Earlier on the show, you said that you will be President
TRUMP: It was never 25. A lot of people thought it was 25 billion. That was for overall homeland security. That was for much more than the wall. The wall was a piece of that. So, a lot of people said he should have taken the 25 billion. Well, that covered a lot more territory than the wall.
It's something that's happened in this country that shows that positive change is possible and every kid watching tonight and every parent watching tonight can be proud of this party and of this country. That was beautiful.
But anyway, I digress. Rudy Giuliani sending conflicting messages about the president's cooperation with Robert Mueller's investigation. We're going to tell you what he's saying, and we're going to dig into exactly what Mueller has done so far, where he's going next and how bad it could get for President Trump.
You know, I just got back from India, and I didn't shake any hands there. And it was very easy because they go like this. (Takes slight bow.) -- March 12 exchange with reporters before meeting with Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar
SANDERS: Like I said, the statement that was issued was true and there were no inaccuracies in the statement.
It's true that Biden criticized Bush's approach to diplomacy in the lead-up to the war, warned in the lead-up to the war that Bush was not being honest about how hard the war would be, and he criticized Bush's handling of the war from its first weeks on. But Biden made clear that he supported the war despite that criticism.
Klobuchar has a score of 2.815, ranking first among the 48 Democrats in the Senate during that time. And Warren has a score of .548 and ranks 32nd out of 48 Democrats in the Senate.

Facts First: The $10 billion LNG facility Trump visited in Louisiana in 2019 was : The $10 billion LNG facility Trump visited in Louisiana in 2019 was granted its key permits under Obama , and its construction also began under Obama. Federal regulators have approved other multi-billion-dollar LNG facilities for Louisiana under Trump, but they had not been waiting anywhere close to 10 or 14 years for approval.
I know I can be too tough sometimes and I can push too hard, she told MSNBC earlier this month. That is obvious. But a lot of it is I have high expectations for myself and I have high expectations for people who work with me.
Trump also suggested that in his next tax proposal the first rate above 0% might be different than in his latest version. But he wasn't specific on what the final numbers would be.
SUZIE MILLS, GENERAL MANAGER TRUMP INTERNATIONAL HOTERL & TOWER: When he made me general manager nine years ago, there were only three female general managers of Five Star hotels in the whole of North America.
Trump added Wednesday that veterans were on his side during the dispute, because McCain didn't get the job done with the Veterans Administration.
But as isolating as social distancing is, it's also selfless, she added. Remember that following guidance and isolating is ultimately a socially generous act, a gesture of community. Her mother is finding ways to cope: She's getting outside, but keeping a safe distance from neighbors. And she's still making food for her local homeless shelter once a week, but is no longer serving the meals — a decision that will protect her and others.
Klobuchar has admitted that she can be too tough on her staff in response to the stories.
Trump quoted a tweet about how syndicated opinion columnist Connie Schultz, a Trump critic, is married to Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown. Trump wrote: Nice conflict. Brown dropped out of presidential race FAST. Polled at ZERO! -- February 11 tweet
Since Congress failed to repeal and replace the health reform law, administration officials can only adjust Obamacare's regulations. Like its prior moves, the administration says the 2019 guidance focuses on lowering costs and increasing choices for consumers, states and insurers.
Indiana applied to the Trump administration Tuesday to extend a regulatory waiver and funding for its Healthy Indiana Plan until Jan. 31, 2021. This would allow it to extend its innovative package of incentives and penalties that are intended to encourage low-income Hoosiers on Medicaid to adopt healthy behaviors. Beneficiaries pay premiums, get health savings accounts and can lose their benefits if they miss payments.
Trump is still a hero to his base, but since he just comprehensively lost a national election, McCarthy is taking a gamble. In the shorter term, his genuflection means that with the House GOP in thrall to the former President and his vengeful instincts, Republicans will be even less ready to work with Biden on critical efforts to respond to the pandemic.
Though it is exceptional, America's health care system is not perfect. But its shortcomings are not a function of too much choice and competition but, perhaps, of too little. Obamacare's premise was that more money and more federal government involvement could address whatever problems our health care system has. This approach has largely been unsuccessful at dealing with rising health costs.
COOPER: I want to read something that at the director of the FBI James Comey recently said, he said quote We have awesome new technology that creates a serious tension between two values we all treasure, privacy and safety. That tension should not resolve by corporations that sell stuff for living. It also should not be resolved by the FBI which investigates for a living, it should be resolved by the American people, deciding how we want to govern ourselves in a world we have never seen before.
Once those back-end updates are complete, people should be able to shop for plans with new subsidies fairly quickly, she said.
GLASSER: Well, that is right. And in fact, actually, there's a tantalizing I think and significant sentence in one of the filings today in which the Special Counsel's office says that Cohen has provided information that relates to the core part of the investigation involving Russia and the questions surrounding the 2016 election.
GEORGE SPARKS, TED CRUZ SUPPORTER: No. Negative, no. This is a very conservative state. And I feel he'll have the backing to do it.
The Trump administration is not defending Obamacare, so a coalition of Democratic states is appealing the judge's ruling.
The judges wrote: Our conclusion is straightforward because the members -- 29 senators and 186 members of the House of Representatives -- do not constitute a majority of either body and are, therefore, powerless to approve or deny the President's acceptance of foreign emoluments.
They said, what do you think of the Green New Deal? I said, well, it should be studied carefully. We should look at it. Look at it closely. I don't want to talk about it until about two months before the election. And then, I'll tell you how totally insane it is. How about this crazy senator -- how about this crazy, crazy senator from Hawaii? They said 'I'm totally in favor' -- not the smartest. She said, 'I'm totally in favor of the Green New Deal.' Well, you know, that would mean there's no more airplanes. 'Oh.' So they started screaming at her in Hawaii. They said how the hell are we going to get to Hawaii? They said we're going to build a railroad. She said, 'The world's longest track, it's the world's longest.' She doesn't know that they don't want airplanes anymore,. -- January 30 campaign rally in Des Moines, Iowa
Biden also gave the false impression that the monitor was the reason the number of stops declined.
We're working on a strategy, in concert with the leadership of the House and the Senate, for both a legislative and executive action agenda to ensure that an orderly and smooth transition to a market-based health care reform system is achieved, said Vice President-elect Pence last week, emphasizing the shift will be stable.
Pelosi told reporters the enthusiasm for the Democratic field, embodied in the large numbers attending campaign rallies, is a positive sign for those down ballot, and even raised the prospects of winning back the House in 2016 – something few political analysts, or even Democrats, believe is within reach.
Instead, we have Donald Trump. And his instincts are perfectly wrong for a pandemic.
Here are some of the things to be on the lookout for when interpreting Trump's budget – and his message.
JOHN MILLER, DEPUTY COMMISSIONER, NEW YORK POLICE DEPARMENT: So this is the kind of talk that's confusing the issue here. We've got to get to the baseline issue. So what's this really about, it's not about a back door, it's about a front door when the government comes in with a legal search warrant.
LEMON: If you haven't read Garrett Graff's latest article in Wired, you've really missed it because here's a headline. It says, The Mueller investigation nears the worst-case scenario. Nears the worst- case scenario. And you write how the innocent explanations from President Trump over the last two years are steadily being stripped away. Talk to me about that.
Facts First: The US had its : The US had its first confirmed case of the coronavirus on January 21, more than six weeks before Trump spoke here, so it's not true that the US had not really seen even some possible effects until three weeks ago.
President Donald Trump's effort to repeal Obamacare was central to Democrats sweeping into power in the House in the 2018 midterms -- a victory that came eight years after Republicans had gained the House majority on their opposition to Obama's signature health care law.
California's metropolitan areas have had many decades to build up massive health care systems to serve the poor, including county hospitals, federally qualified health centers and community clinics. But the current scale of suburban poverty is a recent development.
We're going to have to come up with a better phrase than moving the goal posts, as the Washington Post called it , to cover such a ghoulish shift in position from a president who just weeks ago was assuring American's the coronavirus was totally under control and would miraculously disappear in April.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is setting up her lawmakers as protectors of the Affordable Care Act and of people with pre-existing conditions, following the program laid out in 2018, when Democrats' defense of the law helped them take back control of the House amid Republican efforts to repeal it.
CONSUEGRA: Between them, yes, there was many.
The cooperators who have come through, who've been honest, who've been truthful, who've given him good information he's gone to bat for. Michael Flynn being one of them.
The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee has promised to blacklist all consultants who work for primary candidates against incumbents. But Rep. Cheri Bustos of Illinois, the chair of the committee, was forced to cancel a fundraiser with Lipinski last year because of pressure from the left.
SCARAMUCCI: But if you go down the base, if you look at the statistical base, you'll see that the base and the majority of the American people, certainly all the American people that voted for him either don't care about the tweets, they find them funny. They find them refreshing. They don't overreact and micro --
An ADP Research Institute study had similar findings. One reason may be that the economy has been improving. Some companies interviewed by ADP said they may increase their part-timers' hours to retain talent and reduce training costs.
The case is noteworthy because the law is nearly identical to a Texas law that the Supreme Court struck down in 2016. Back then, Kennedy joined with the liberal justices to rule against the law. Roberts, Thomas and Alito were in dissent. Last term, Roberts joined the liberals in putting the Louisiana law temporarily on hold in a 5-4 emergency order.
Well, there's that, Schultz responded when we pointed this out on Twitter.
To prevent the wave of addiction that is likely to follow Covid-19, America needs widespread investment in the social determinants of health: employment, income, housing, food, and education, among other critical supports. President Biden's economic relief package will deliver $1,400 payments to Americans, increase unemployment insurance, expand paid family and sick leave, increase the child tax credit, fund schools, support state and local governments, and enhance public health.
MARQUARDT: And Elie, now this news that the special counsel says he still wants to interview President Trump on the Russia investigation. Of course, his lawyers have pushed back and say they are opposed. They don't want to do that.
GUPTA: Yes, and again, let me add as well, George and Heather, you know, it was tough to hear. Your story of what happened to your mom and wife, you know, it is difficult especially with this type of meningitis, a fungal meningitis as you may know is more rare than bacterial and viral meningitis.
Facts First: Steele has not admitted that his dossier is fake. In a court : Steele has not admitted that his dossier is fake. In a court filing for a defamation lawsuit against him and in a deposition , Steele acknowledged that some of the information in the dossier is raw intelligence he had not verified. But that is not the same as acknowledging that the dossier is fake.
The Congressional Budget Office projects that bill would cut the federal government's spending on Medicaid by 25% by 2026 as compared to current law.
President Donald Trump has made some grand promises on health care.
And Xavier Becerra , chosen by the President to lead the Department of Health and Human Services, has emerged as a culture war lightning rod over his stance on abortion and Obamacare, a perennial fault line between Republicans and Democrats.
This is what happens when you govern by personal preference and favor seat-of-the-pants decisions rather than more thought-out ones.
Again, though, reality has clashed with those hopes and expectations. Though Trump is clearly inclined to do deals, and relishes taking the big seat in any boardroom situation, he's failed to pass any meaningful legislation across party lines. His signature tax reform was done with a bare Republican majority utilizing budget reconciliation measures even though it's likely to add $1 trillion to the deficits. He also struggled to bridge gaps within the GOP congressional conference, which failed to repeal and replace Obamacare when negotiations broke down in the Senate.
We want to work with our Republican colleagues to advance this legislation in bipartisan way, but the work must move forward, preferably with our Republican colleagues, but without them if we must, Senate Democratic Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said.
CNN's Veronica Stracqualursi contributed to this report.
Facts First: It's true that fewer people receive food stamps than when Trump took office, but he exaggerates the figure.
We asked them about that and they say she has recused herself of all matters related to the Ameridose and NECC.
Ours is a unique moment in history. It is time for Congress to step up and into the role the Founders envisioned for the branch closest to the people. That makes this coming Election Day a date with destiny we should embrace.
Donald Trump had a good night. It started poorly because it had to start poorly; discussion of his locker room banter was bound to be personally embarrassing. He sounded like he was giving a legal deposition. When Clinton and the moderators demanded greater clarity, he lost his temper and called Bill Clinton an abuser of women. I suspect he didn't intend to do that. The man has skin as thin as gossamer.
You're going to need to get more help up here. We don't have enough people to hold the line, one officer said.
Last year, McCain died of brain cancer, and as part of his services, lay in state in the Capitol building in Washington.
GRANHOLM: I don't -- I don't know. I don't know if it is or not. I totally agree with you.
We are never going to get there, Jake, by increasing the tax burden. You could double the corporate and marginal tax rates in this country and you still would barely cover the current deficits. We have got to grow our economy. When Ronald Reagan lowered the tax burden and lowered the regulation early in the '80s, we were creating 300,000 or 400,000 or 500,000 jobs a month. One month, we created a million jobs. That's remarkable.

Here is what President Trump's former lawyer, Michael Cohen, said about the President's truthfulness. Take a listen.
Rather, her political analysis – and wit (cc: Mitch McConnell) – seems as assured as ever.
Yet Trump also put himself across as a rare politician who keeps his promises -- a powerful source of attraction for his supporters and an appeal to suburban uncommitted voters who he needs to convince he is worth a second term.
For his part, Trump has taken on two new high-profile fights: joining a suit to repeal Obamacare wholly and pledging, on Twitter on Friday, to close our southern border totally if and when two migrant caravans moving through Mexico make it there.
Utah GOP gives Romney a pass
MORGAN: You pretty heavily in debt, I think you've about $30,000. So, this really is a critical time to you and your life and you're just one of many people in this kind of position. Let me turn to you talk to Van Tine, we spoke the other night with another one of your patients and they must all be going through a form of this kind of anguish because it's the uncertainty, it's the very last thing that people in this position need.

Former Mayor Pete Buttigieg asserted during the debate on Tuesday that the Trump administration admitted that the Iran nuclear deal was working before pulling out of it.

The @NRA is spending $1 million on Ed Gillespie's behalf.
You can spend a lot of money when you have $62 billion, but you can't do away with your record, Biden said, pointing out that Bloomberg criticized the Obama administration's signature achievement, the Affordable Care Act.
Whether it's unfair Chinese trade practices, the North American Free Trade Agreement he's dubbed a disaster or Iran's destabilizing actions, Trump has kept up much of his bold campaign rhetoric.
This is moving in the right direction. It buys us time. It presents the Democrats with some tough choices, Rep. Tom Cole, a Republican from Oklahoma, had said.
CARPER: My inclination would be, and I'm one of those people who actually says, let sort of regular order, regular order here, and regular order is for them to have primaries in Alabama, runoffs in Alabama, elections in Alabama.
But Sanders has long held that simply patching Obamacare or creating a buy-in to public programs would not solve the underlying problems.
Facts First: Some Americans certainly didn't know a whole lot about Ebola before 2014, but the claims that nobody had ever even heard of Ebola and that nobody knew anything about it are absurd. Ebola was discovered : Some Americans certainly didn't know a whole lot about Ebola before 2014, but the claims that nobody had ever even heard of Ebola and that nobody knew anything about it are absurd. Ebola was discovered in 1976 . It had been the subject of considerable media coverage in the next three decades, not to mention scientific study.

San Diego used to have the most illegal border crossings in the country. In response, and at the request of San Diego residents and political leaders, a strong security wall was put in place. This powerful barrier almost completely ended illegal crossings.
Almost daily, stories seep out of the administration about feuding between top officials and rival centers of power around Trump, including the camp led by political adviser Stephen Bannon and the family inner circle comprising his son-in-law Jared Kushner and his daughter Ivanka Trump, who announced Wednesday she would take an unpaid staff position.
All of the Democrats onstage, with the exception of Sen. Amy Klobuchar, endorsed a ban on fracking, but none of the candidates acknowledged that the resulting shale boom from fracking has helped make the US less dependent on Middle East oil, thus protecting our gas prices from the whims OPEC nations, especially Iran. This gas price stability also helps the poor and middle classes, who spend a higher share of their budgets than the rich on transportation.
Trump isn't one for wonky policy details. He often makes vague pronouncements on issues like health care. In May, for example, he tweeted,​ Despite what you hear in the press, health care is coming along great. We are talking to many groups and it will end in a beautiful picture!
Much like consumers are learning about how to sign up for coverage and how their coverage works ... it's importance to acknowledge the health plans are also learning. They are learning what the right strategy is, what products to offer, what markets to be in, Slavitt said. We would certainly expect there to be growing pains along the way.
Among them are a willingness to name enemies and, as importantly, demand more of would-be allies in office – in the same way, to give a recent example, liberal activists pressured Democrats, even those facing reelection challenges in red states, to maintain the party line in the fight to save Obamacare.
We should not, as Melania Trump pleaded, simply forgive her husband's indiscretions, and move on to the important issues. The average Trump voter is not motivated by economic anxiety. Stop finding politically correct terms for blatant racists. They'd rather we undo decades of social progress than yield an inch on exploitative structures that keep them powerful.

Trump then told his usual story about how he had come up with the concept of the Veterans Choice health care program himself in 2016, thinking he was so smart, but was told others had unsuccessfully tried to get such a program passed for 45 years. He claimed he managed to get it passed himself.
Trump has suggested that Republicans could just let the market collapse. Right now, the Trump administration is responsible for making cost-sharing reduction payments to insurers. If the administration stopped, it could lead to more uncertainty.
Senator Amy Klobuchar won the debate, if we define winning as making a more clear, confident, sustained case than we've seen before.
Trump's marathon Monday briefing ran for more than 100 minutes.
And the urgency with which Democrats feel they need to tout the relief bill is a clear sign that the party is trying to learn the lessons from legislative achievements early in Barack Obama's presidency, including the nearly $800 billion Recovery Act passed in 2009 and the fight over the Affordable Care Act, the sweeping health care overhaul signed into law in 2010.
BASH: Do you not think that Medicare for all is practical?
Trump has previously attacked McCain's record of service, saying the Vietnam veteran and one-time prisoner of war is not a war hero because he was captured.

Biden's new acting solicitor general is Elizabeth Prelogar , who is likely recused from the issue because as a private lawyer she filed a brief on behalf of 47 senators in support of the law. That means if the solicitor general's office files a supplemental brief, or a missive to the court, it will likely be handled by a career employee.
GOP aides say that the base is furious right now at anyone who isn't standing with Trump. The only hope most members have is that the large number of Republicans who are going to rebuke this effort in the Senate will only amount to a temporary blip and not a long-lasting stain on party unity.

About 9 out of 10 enrollees in healthcare.gov receive subsidies, and three-quarters of consumers are eligible for financial assistance that would lower their premium to $50 or less a month, according to the agency.
The executive budget has always been a messaging document, Mick Mulvaney, the director of the Office of Management and Budget, said Monday. What are the messages this year? There's two primary messages.

NATO countries other than the US spent a total of $262 billion on defense in 2016, according to official NATO figures released in November 2019 (which used 2015 prices and exchange rates). The US spent $651 billion itself that year, about 71% of the total. That's a large percentage, but 100% is a significant exaggeration.
We do have this new, solidified, conservative majority but we also might have a concern about what is called severability, really kind of jibes by knocking down one provision, take the whole thing. That might be at issue at the court, too. So they will have to look at it if it gets to them.

Some argue that it's far too early to freak out about Sanders, even if he performs well during the early nominating contests.

Perspective here. Excuse me, stocks are still higher for the year. The Dow is up 3.5 percent. The S&P 500 up almost 3 percent. The Nasdaq composite up more than 6 percent for the year. So, still higher on a year, but it's been a volatile, volatile past couple of months.
Thursday's measures will likely be the first of many efforts to bolster the Affordable Care Act and roll back Trump administration health care actions.
Fraud is not enough. Certainly, let's wipe out the fraud, but as you said, it won't add up. You already gave those numbers. The second point is on foreign aid. I hear that all the time as well. I'm against any sort of wasting of money on foreign aid, but it's less than 1 percent of our federal budget. The numbers don't add up.
Health care spending has been surging recently. CNN's Tami Luhby takes a look at where Americans are spending their money when it comes to their health.
After touting the criminal justice reform bill he signed in 2018, Trump appeared to criticize the 1994 crime bill signed into law by President Bill Clinton and supported by then-senator Joe Biden -- and suggested Barack Obama, who was not yet in elected office of any kind, had something to do with it: And, again, this was a Biden/Obama law that was -- this was -- and, obviously, it was -- it was really a Hillary -- this was a Bill Clinton and a Hillary. And it was -- I guess Biden was a senator then and pushing it hard. Obama was -- somebody said he was talking about it, but he had to be pretty young, if that were the case. -- March 4 interview with Fox News' Sean Hannity

I want to build on the momentum that we saw here in 2018, Klobuchar told reporters Saturday in Wisconsin. No one ever thought that the Democrats were going to be able (to defeat) Gov. Walker, but we did it, and we did it in a smart, Wisconsin way with a grassroots campaign with (Democratic Sen.) Tammy Baldwin at the top of the ticket, and we can do it in the presidential, as well.
More recently, as president-elect, Trump reiterated his support for the idea in January.
RYAN: Don't forget how all this works together. Subsidize the sick and the pre-existing condition through risk pools and reinsurance. The health savings accounts to bring the consumer in the marketplace, to put pressure on providers to compete for our business based on cost and quality. And then give families who have jobs, but don't have the kind of jobs that gives them health insurance benefits, the same kind of tax benefit everybody else gets, so they too, at the beginning of the year -- at the beginning of the month, can go buy a plan that best meets their needs.
But on urgency, keep in mind, it has been a full two months since the U.N. secretary-general called this a textbook case of ethnic cleansing. It has been three months since the violence started. And even though it's complicated, I mean, the U.S. believes that the violence started with an attack by a Rohingya militant group, that today the State Department referred to as terrorists.
The acidic mood in Congress is also caused by the chasm on whether to punish the ex-President for inciting the riot.
There are many pages of this bill that deal with sunsetting the bramble of ways the US government currently helps Americans with health care — Medicare, Obamacare, Tricare, federal employee benefits and more — and unifying them in this new plan.
Peter Thiel in combination with Tom Barrack answered that question. They are trying to expand the tent, I think for the first time decisively since the entire convention began.
He's not going to listen to them, says Douglas Holtz-Eakin, once a top economic aide to President George W. Bush. Who knows what he'll do?
So Donald in the midst of this, and this is really what started my friendship, did something I had never seen before and that I have used consecutively after, he said look, I want to do this. I don't know what I should know so I will pay your boss the price that he wants and I'll close it in one week on one condition. You, Tom Barrack, tell me everything I should know that I don't know. I said look, I just told you, I'm not doing that. We're not entering into this kind of a coverage and that no contract. No contract. You and I shake hands right here, no lawyers, no contract, no nothing. You just tell me the things that I should know and how to fix it and I'll do this deal.

The senator from West Virginia is also emerging at a pivot point of the battle to pass Biden's $1.9 trillion Covid relief bill, which all Republicans are likely to oppose. He said Monday that he would seek to amend the legislation to set a federal hourly minimum wage at $11 over two years, instead of the current Democratic proposal for a hike to $15 over five years.
Every day, America's men and women in uniform demonstrate the infinite depths of love that dwells in the human heart.

The Governor named election integrity as an emergency legislative item during his State of the State address in February. Governor Abbott was joined for the press conference by Senator Paul Bettencourt and Representative Briscoe Cain, who have both filed several pieces of legislation to enhance election integrity in Texas
Facts First: Democrats were not always for the wall. In 2013, many Democrats supported a comprehensive immigration reform bill that included 700 miles of border fencing. But that was fencing, not the giant wall Trump has proposed -- and many Democrats supported it only as part of a package that included provisions they wanted, most notably a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants.
There are millions of people, literally, in the country who aren't enrolled because they don't even know they are eligible for something, said Joel Ario, managing director of Manatt Health Solutions and former health official in the Obama administration.
TAPPER: A rendition of Rodin's The Thinker might be appropriate for Beto O'Rourke as he ponders and ponders and ponders a potential 2020 bid.
Trump is intent, it seems, on undoing the key international and domestic accomplishments of the Obama administration. The question is: does he have a plan B that makes any sense? Trump said he would repeal and replace Obamacare, but when it came down to it he and the Republican Party didn't have a real viable plan to do so.
Romney's views on abortion have changed over time, often it seems coinciding with when he's running for office and where he's running for office. In 1994 he was running against Senator Ted Kennedy in Massachusetts and he said this.

The President's claims are preposterous. The European Communities (forerunner of the EU) were formed in the 1950s as part of a joint US-Western European plan to stabilize and secure Western Europe and promote prosperity, by means of trade liberalization and economic growth, throughout the shared transatlantic space, Desmond Dinan, a public policy professor at George Mason University who is an expert in the history of European integration, said in response to a previous version of this claim.

The Senate bill would make sweeping cuts to Medicaid, get rid of the individual mandate, and eliminate Obamacare's taxes on the wealthy and insurers. It would also prevent federal funds from reimbursing Planned Parenthood for any health services it provides.
I'm still optimistic it's going to be included, Collins said Monday evening before House Republicans met. It is the right thing to do. It would result in rate decreases that would provide substantial relief.
And there's nobody that knows more about the borders than Senator Jeff Sessions. I would say this. We're all in this together. We're going to come up with solutions. We're going to find the answers to things. And so far I cannot believe how civil it's been up here.
Like Warren, he lambasted Bloomberg for failing to release the women at his company who had alleged misconduct from nondisclosure agreements.
Those two comments – almost four years apart and more than six months after McCain's death – provide telling bookends to understand just how much Trump has changed Republican politics (and politics generally), and not for the better.
Last June, after another behind-the-scenes negotiation, Roberts joined with the four liberal justices to block the addition of a citizenship question on the 2020 census.
The challenge for Biden's Justice Department is not only telling the justices it manifestly opposes the position taken by the Trump administration in the case, but how to pull off the task. Changing its position on the Affordable Care Act wouldn't end the lawsuit, which was brought by Texas and other Republican-led states, but could inform how the justices look at the case.
I'm not aware that our opinions or views have been solicited on that question yet, he told Representative Sandy Levin, a Democrat from Michigan, while testifying before Congress Wednesday on his agency's budget request. We will look at that whenever it comes to us. Of course, there's a rule of law that we need to enforce.

It will also be an immediate test of House Speaker Paul Ryan's diminished authority after he failed to unite his caucus behind an effort to fulfill the one promise – repealing Obamacare – that has united his party this entire decade.
Rising fuel prices are pressuring airline profits. A report published early last week predicted total profits to drop to $33.8 billion, down from a previous forecast of $38.4 billion.
CAREY: No. She was concerned about me.
Trump isn't one for wonky policy details. He often makes vague pronouncements on issues like health care. In May, for example, he tweeted,​ Despite what you hear in the press, health care is coming along great. We are talking to many groups and it will end in a beautiful picture!
I'm depressed that Donald Trump could be caught on tape bragging about sexually assaulting women and try to laugh it all off in a debate as locker room talk. But what were the debate moderators supposed to do Sunday night? Spend more than a few minutes conveying America's utter disgust at this latest example of Trump's pattern of misogyny? Nah, a few minutes is enough I guess. So on to policy, right?

Cutting ACA outreach will result in fewer people insured, and those who fail to sign up will be the healthiest. That will push premiums up. — Larry Levitt (@larry_levitt) August 31, 2017

Drug overdose deaths have declined for the first time in nearly 31 years. -- January 30 campaign rally in Des Moines, Iowa
Why are many Republicans vaccine skeptics? Keilar rolls the tape
In the early days of the Affordable Care Act, insurers agreed to offer lower premiums to encourage participation in health care exchanges because the law guaranteed partial reimbursement for their losses. But the payments never came after Congress, then controlled by Republicans, ultimately declined to appropriate the money.

The president weighed in as any father would, based on the limited information that he had.
The initial salvo on that ban came within days of Trump's inauguration and with little consultation with government agencies that would typically be consulted. The result was chaos at airports worldwide and the detention of Muslims at US airports who had valid visas and even green cards to travel to and stay in the US.
TRUMP: I will. First of all, I think and I know the H1B very well. And it's something that I frankly use and I shouldn't be allowed to use it. We shouldn't have it. Very, very bad for workers. And second of all, I think it's very important to say, well, I'm a businessman and I have to do what I have to do.

Yes, at times it really felt like a cage match up there, pushed forward by a newly aggressive Marco Rubio going for broke against Donald Trump.
The Freedom Caucus' tone differed greatly from the mood of the conference hours earlier. As members emerged from leadership's briefing Tuesday night, many rank-and-file members – from defense hawks to fiscal conservatives – seemed reluctant but ready to lend their support if they had to.
Trump claimed five times to have been the one who got the Veterans Choice health care program created.
More than four years later, one of the core stated rationales underlying Trump's pitch to voters is looking flimsy. At best. We know he enjoys the process – the banter, the debate, the fighting – of trying to hammer out an agreement. But his ability to close those deals, as President, has been sorely lacking. Even his most significant legislative achievement, the GOP's tax bill, was sealed by Majority Leader Mitch McConnell without even a note of bipartisan support. Republican efforts to gut Obamacare collapsed under the weight of internal dissent – and confusion stoked by Trump's shifting positions on the legislation at hand.
However, once the conversation turned to more substantive topics, Trump was able to focus more on Clinton's failed record, forcing her to play defense for much of the night, particularly on her emails, Obamacare and energy policy.
The change in policy aligns with Trump's promise to reduce bureaucracy, regulation and government intervention in business.
The President has the support of millions of veterans in the United States. I don't think those veterans are in love with the fact that he's attacking John McCain, he said.

Patients with severe effects of Covid-19 could end up with lasting conditions including chronic lung and kidney conditions and even strokes and heart damage. Without the ACA's protection for people with preexisting conditions, patients who have recovered from Covid-19 could be denied health care coverage.
There is no such thing as redemption money, immigration experts said. Some of the experts thought Trump might have been attempting to refer, rather, to remittance money -- money immigrants send back home to their countries of origin.
I have no idea what 'they've been trying to get' for 44 years, Alison Bateman-House, assistant professor of medical ethics at New York University's Langone Health, said in response to a previous version of Trump's claim. The Right to Try law was a creation of the Goldwater Institute, and it first became state law in 2014 (in Colorado), relatively soon after it was first conceived of.

But Trump has been obstinate in the face of those political warning signs, instead concerned that repealing and replacing Obamacare remains the one signature 2016 campaign promise he has yet to make good on.
Trump said the most China has ever spent on US agricultural products is $20 billion. -- January 19 speech to the American Farm Bureau Federation
And beyond the diplomatic implications, Trump has also had to confront the reality that China long ago stopped artificially devaluing its currency – instead working to prop it up, which benefits US exports.
Minority voters -- especially in cities like Cleveland, Philadelphia, Charlotte, Atlanta and Detroit -- are critical to Democratic hopes of winning back swing states that Trump claimed in 2016 and putting new battlegrounds on the map.

I think the President fails to understand this, but more importantly, in my own – from my own feeling, we need more compassion, we need more empathy, we need more togetherness in terms of working together. We don't need more bullying and I'm tired of it, she said.
COOPER: It is deathly quiet behind you, I got to say. Does it look like all of this will end up getting wrapped up together with the fight over the debt ceiling? BASH: It does look that way. Now what I'm told is that the house speaker has been having those conversations that I mentioned with some of his closest confidence and advisors in the Republican caucus and they are trying to come up with a package not about Obamacare, they moved off of that in these discussions, but about the economy specifically about the debt, something that can take home to constituents, Republicans and not just the Tea Party right, but also even moderates tell me they feel they need to take something home to say, you know, we addressed the problem with the debt in this country and in exchange for that, did agree to raise the debt ceiling.

Humana also said Tuesday it was pulling out of Obamacare for 2018.
That's why you see so many Republicans saying, don't do this. Republicans are afraid that he's going to take the money from somewhere else and something they care about, but, fundamentally, they think it's a president who failed, who hates to lose, who is acting childish, and is -- is violating the Constitution.
His unpopularity, especially in key states with bellwether Senate races, will make it difficult for him to fully endorse some Republican candidates. Additionally, the more Trump is involved, the more blame he will take if Republicans suffer sizable losses in these contests, a trend that would fall in line with historic norms.
Their dueling votes showcase a diversity of thought, the statement said.
SANDERS: ... in the White House.
It was that concern – and qualms about the legal justification for the move – that drew objections from Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar, Attorney General William Barr and White House counsel Pat Cipollone as the White House debated its position on the Texas lawsuit, which was brought by a coalition of Republican-led states. The Texas ruling is being appealed by a coalition of Democratic-governed states, because the Trump administration declined to defend the law in the first place.
The discussion for a universal health care plan is front and center in the 2020 election. Beyond Covid-19, we need to pursue a better path to universal health coverage. The road for the required fix is long and there has not been the political will or leverage from any side to close the gap once and for all. In the face of Covid-19, we don't have the luxury of political fighting. We need the political sophistication, humility and courage to ensure care for all.
Governor Kasich, a pair of entrepreneurs from Alabama and North Carolina have just received approval to build the first U.S. factory in Cuba, making tractor for small farms.

In its defense, the administration acknowledges that it had to make last-minute changes to its budget in light of the Friday agreement, which funds the government through 2019 at higher levels of discretionary spending. The issue is, Trump's budget doesn't change any of its assumptions for the period after 2019, creating a series of fiscal crises.

VISER: And you almost have this, you know, laughing stock, you know, ability of the United States to laugh at their failures. In this case, you know, by all accounts this was successful and so you wonder at some point how that changes the thinking of the United States when they deal with North Korea, knowing that provocation has some major consequences, not only in the Asian region, which it always has, but to our own country, to Alaska, and, you know, potentially, depending on sort of how they progress in their capabilities, other parts of the West Coast. And so how does that change the negotiations if they get to negotiations and how does that change President Trump's ability to sort of needle a country that now has the capability of really punching back.
the shooter. Gunfire was exchanged. Law enforcement shot and killed the shooter.
«Casi todas las propuestas presupuestarias de los presidentes que conozco están básicamente muertas a su llegada», dijo este lunes el senador John Cornyn, republicano de Texas, sin rodeos, unas horas antes de la publicación del presupuesto.
CRUZ: And as president, what I will do for seniors, for anyone at or near retirement, there will be no changes whatsoever. Every benefit will be protected to the letter. But for younger workers, we need to change the rate of growth of benefits so it matches inflation instead of exceeding inflation. And as you noted Dinan, we need to have for younger workers, that a portion of your tax payments are in personal accounts, like the 401(k), that you own, that you control, that you can pass on to your kids and grandkids.
For Trump priorities like building a wall along the Mexico border or entitlement reform, a one-seat advantage for Senate Republicans isn't enough. And if past is prologue, Democrats feel absolutely no pressure – politically or otherwise – to sign onto any Trump agenda item. Which means that even a single Republican opposing Trump forces Vice President Mike Pence to break a Senate tie. Two Republicans opposing a Trump priority and that priority is doomed.
MARQUARDT: All right. David, back to you -- how could Mulvaney help Trump navigate this Russia investigation. We've seen a number of events this week with regards to Michael Flynn and Michael Cohen and Paul Manafort. So there is a sense that Robert Mueller might be wrapping things up in the early months of next year. How do you think Mulvaney is going to help with that?
We have to sort of take a strong, good, hard look and come up with plans that work. And we're rushing into things, and we're just - we're leading with the chin.
There will be the actual objections -- valid ones, with precedent -- immediately triggering action between the two chambers.
And then there's today's heavily redacted Manafort filing. Mueller's office says that Paul Manafort testified to a federal grand jury twice in the past six weeks. Twice, which suggests prosecutors were using Manafort to build a criminal case against someone else. And then there's this from page nine of the filing.
So that's why legal experts, even legal experts who were opposed to the Affordable Care Act in previous cases are saying this is just ridiculous.
Trump has already thrown his weight behind the plan, tweeting: I am very supportive of the Senate #HealthcareBill. Look forward to making it really special!
According to the Tax Policy Center, a mere 50 farms and closely held businesses were among the 5,190 estates to pay the estate tax in 2017, before Trump's tax law. The Center wrote on its website: The Tax Policy Center estimates that small farms and businesses will pay $20 million in estate tax in 2017, one-tenth of 1 percentage of the total estate tax revenue.
President Trump boasted last week that millions of people are joining association health plans, one alternative to Obamacare that he's planning to expand.
The most egregious false claim: Obama and trade
And CNN's Dan Merica reports that Pennsylvania's state GOP is planning to meet to discuss what to do about Sen. Pat Toomey, who also voted to convict and who is not seeking reelection in 2022. County parties have already censured him.
The House of Representatives will vote Wednesday for a second time in two days to pass the final version of the GOP's tax plan, but not all House members have read it in its entirety.
BROWN: Well, first of all let me -- look -- first of all let me say we have plenty of progressives in Maryland, and we were vying for Amazon to come to Maryland. We're glad they're coming to Northern Virginia. We'll benefit in Maryland.
Scaramucci told Berman that he always got along with McCain, adding that he was a decorated Vietnam War veteran.

(CNN) President Donald Trump was impeached in December by the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives, but now it's up to the Republican-led Senate to decide whether to remove him from office.
Alice's story underscores the disparities and unfairness that can exist in criminal sentencing – and the need to remedy this injustice. She served almost 22 years and had expected to be in prison for the rest of her life.
In other words, they know which way they are headed.
I don't think you're going to see one massive plan like Obamacare. You're going to see a step-by-step approach targeting the individual damage of the individual reforms, and we'll put in replacements for each individual one of those problems, Johnson said. Anyway, that would be my approach. Other people have different ideas.
The results come as multiple polls show similar shifts in the Democrats' favor in the dynamics of the midterm race. It is the third poll released in the past two days to show Democrats with a double-digit lead over Republicans on a generic ballot question.
In Pakistan, a rally in support of a 14-year-old girl, a blogger and activist for education of girls who was shot on her way home from school yesterday.
Look, this is the -- the White House. He's the president of the United States of America. And there are processes and...
TRUMP: Well, first of all, I want you to understand that the Democrats, and I've watched them very intensely, even though it's a very, very boring thing to watch, that the Democrats are doing nothing with Social Security. They're leaving it the way it is. In fact, they want to increase it. They want to actually give more.
LANKFORD: You know, what's really interesting about that, Piers, I do hear that a lot around here to say, Look at those Republicans aren't they divided? But when you actually look at the vote counts that have happened this week, there are 20 or 30 Democrats that are voting with us very often through a lot of the votes even this week and no one's actually looking at the Democrat Party saying, Gosh. They're so divided. They've got 20 or 30 members. They are voting with the Republicans. It's all in your perspective and I get a good chance to look at it.
HECK: Well, because Michael Cohen pleaded guilty to it and because they named the President individual one, which I don't think they would have done in any way, shape, or form. They weren't required to reference the President, but they did so. And I have to assume that that is on the basis of significant and material corroborating evidence that they have collected.
And I think that is -- if we're going to talk about misleading, that's the only thing misleading I see in this entire process.
When he finally had the chance to do it, he voted against repeal and replace, the President said. Remember thumbs down?
Reality Check: Carson on absurd government regulations
Before the full briefing, Walker acted, issuing the temporary restraining order in an opinion loaded with references to religious persecution.
The Department of Housing and Urban Development also sought to strip protections for transgender Americans seeking housing in federally funded homeless shelters. The department argued that the change would better accommodate religious beliefs of shelter providers, as well as other practical concerns, but it came during the coronavirus pandemic, worrying advocates who feared that it could leave some transgender Americans without housing in the middle of a public health crisis. The rule has yet to be finalized and Biden will likely seek to keep the existing rule in place.
CUCCINELLI: The -- well, Robbie had mentioned the control Republicans have and the dysfunction over there. And I certainly agree there's dysfunction over there. But it's because a good swath of the Republican Senators didn't tell the truth about what they were really going to do on Obamacare when they finally had the opportunity. And so now, at a slim margin of 52-48, because they aren't keeping their promises, and that's it, they can't pass a repeal of Obamacare. So, now go down the street to the White House, and their story, they keep adding pieces here as time goes on.
DE VOGUE: -- so we understand how we got to today. Remember back in 2012, the Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the individual mandate. Remember it was Chief Justice John Roberts, he said it was ok under the taxing power.
Facts First: Trump did not name the judge, but no judge put Manafort in solitary confinement.
A new president and a new tone from the White House can put some pretty significant pressure when pressure is needed, Hudak said. For this to happen in some expedited time, it's really going to require significant influence from the president, especially on key senators.
Right out of the gate, the debate was primed for conflict. CNN's Wolf Blitzer prodded Senator Bernie Sanders to confront Vice President Joe Biden on his support for the Iraq War.
But Trump now seems to recognize the House Freedom Caucus's history as a rabble-rousing collection of leadership agitators, and being a part of a group the White House thinks brought down its first major legislative effort could be a politically vulnerable position.

We borrowed a ream of paper from the newsroom copier (500 sheets) and measured it to be two inches thick. The average building story height is 10 feet. So, if you do the math, a three-story building would be about as tall as 90,000 sheets of paper. That's pretty close to the height of an imaginary stack of new regulations.
Trump: I never was a fan of McCain, I never will be

CNN analyst Jeffrey Toobin in fact reported on widespread suspicion about the motive behind DOJ's decision to stop the merger, which went against the grain of past Republican administrations' hands-off approach.
Most of the questions on Monday will come from New Hampshire voters, an electorate which prizes its position as the first-in-the-nation primary and is often known for asking discerning and pointed questions.
Trump has also struggled to make good on his core campaign promise of repealing and replacing Obamacare with something much better amid disagreements between warring factions of the Republican Party. And amid his quest to get a bill passed as soon as possible, Trump failed to help bridge those differences and was forced to accept a loss, canceling a scheduled vote on the House floor.
LEMON: Thank you. We'll be right back.
We'll find out later today the particulars of an upcoming summit between President Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin. National security adviser John Bolton met with Putin in Moscow to work out the details. Helsinki, Finland, and Vienna, Austria, look like the likely meeting sites. The summit will probably happen next month, after Trump visits Britain and attends a NATO meeting in Belgium. The prospect of a Trump-Putin meeting has sent ripples of consternation through European capitals. Many fear attempts to isolate Moscow for its destabilizing activities could be quickly undone by Trump.
These include policies that weaken protections for people with preexisting conditions and that undermine the Obamacare exchanges or other health insurance markets.
ROSSELLO: Well, there's two reasons. Number one, we don't have all of the data. This has been done with the municipalities. So 11,000 should be an indicator that a lot more people have gone to the shelters. As soon as we have more data, I'm going to keep communicating through Twitter and then communicating with people so they know the up-to-date numbers.
Take Maine Republican Sen. Susan Collins, who got seemingly ironclad promises in order to sign her crucial vote onto the GOP's tax reform bill (a banner achievement, but the Republicans' only real legislative accomplishment while controlling Congress and the White House). The tax bill also repealed the individual mandate – the Obamacare requirement that Americans have health insurance or a pay a fine or tax.
At her event in Goffstown, Klobuchar pitching herself as a candidate who can win independent and lean Republican voters. She pledged to go everywhere, not just where it is comfortable, but where it is uncomfortable and outlined a platform that included overturning Citizens United, reinstating the Voting Rights Act, rejoining the Paris Climate Accord and getting on the path toward a public option for health care.
OK, here is a really important part of our American Health Care Act: refundable tax credits. I want to explain exactly what we mean when we say this.

Facts First: The Democrats were not trying to make the Iranian commander, whom Trump had killed in a US airstrike, sound wonderful. Prominent Democrats, such as the party's presidential candidates and congressional leaders, criticized Trump's decision to order the killing of Soleimani, but they offered no defense of Soleimani's actions or personality.
TRUMP: And it's my absolute intention to leave Social Security the way it is. Not increase the age and to leave it as is.
There are different ways to measure the number of manufacturing establishments in the country. According to the Census Bureau's Statistics of US Businesses data series, the number of manufacturing establishments in the US fell by 61,076 between 2001, the beginning of the George W. Bush administration -- when there were 352,619 establishments -- and 2016, the last full year of the Obama administration, when there were 291,543 establishments. That's a reduction of about 17%.
Now why is the crap (ph) set where it is? And that's something -- by the way, 12 members of the Freedom Caucus, for example, were co- sponsors of the Price legislation just last December, which is this kind of a tax credit situation.
Trump responded that this was a mere one case and that frankly, the testing has been going very smooth. He also claimed: If you go to the right agency, if you go to the right area, you get the test. -- March 12 exchange with reporters before meeting with Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar
Administration officials say the short-term plans will provide a cheaper health insurance alternative for those who can't afford to buy coverage on the Obamacare exchanges.
But the move is expected to weaken some of the Affordable Care Act's consumer protections for those buying these plans and make coverage more expensive for those who remain on the Obamacare exchanges.

Biden will also likely want to reverse various measures the Trump administration put in place to chip away at the Affordable Care Act. These include broadening the duration of short-term health plans to a year, and, more recently, allowing Georgia to stop using the federal exchange , healthcare.gov, and shift to a private sector model instead. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services went a step further in recent weeks, establishing a pathway for all states to do this for 2023.
El plan también reestructuraría el Departamento de Seguridad Nacional, de acuerdo con la propuesta, el Gobierno crearía un programa para dar la bienvenida a los migrantes desplazados por el cambio climático y establecería una meta de aceptar al menos 50.000 personas durante su primer año en el cargo.
But, look, I agree. The crisis is in the Oval Office and not on the border. The president is declaring a national emergency as he even stated in his announcement yesterday or the day before because of 2020 and what he anticipates to be a tough re-election.
TRUMP: You're right, Jake. But it has been taken over by the federal government. It was originally supposed to be that way. And certainly sounds better that way. But it has all been taken over now by the bureaucrats in Washington, and they are not interested in what's happening in Miami or in Florida, in many cases.
The Society's CEO, Gary M. Reedy, stepped up to the fact check plate -- diplomatically, but unequivocally. The mortality trends reflected in our current report, including the largest drop in overall cancer mortality ever recorded from 2016 to 2017, reflect prevention, early detection, and treatment advances that occurred in prior years, Reedy said in a statement to CNN.
Trump's need to exaggerate the size of his crowds and to compare himself favorably to previous presidents combined to produce this doozy of a false claim, made during his rally in Las Vegas on February 21, about Ronald Reagan: I thought he was a great guy, great president, didn't like his policy on trade, that's OK ... but if he came to Las Vegas, you know, they'd have a ballroom. They'd have 500, maybe a thousand people.

CNN's Brianna Keilar explains why many Republicans are hesitant to take the coronavirus vaccine.
At issue for Republicans is whether the Trump base – which views what the President says as gospel truth and believes the media is lying, at all times, for partisan purposes – turns out to vote for Moore and whether that turnout is enough to put him over the top. Democrats, by contrast, are trying to figure out whether they can come close to approximating the African-American turnout during the two presidential races of Obama.

I had a really nice conversation with him and Melania and I really was under the impression this sort of fight between our families and between him and my father, especially at this particular moment would end. I understand the argument is he's talking about policy, and that's the attack, but it's still particularly hurtful, especially after I've had this conversation with him on the phone, to have this moment of booing at CPAC … at this particular moment in time is incredibly hurtful and I feel, quite frankly, very naïve to have believed that this would be any different, she said.
[06:25:11] CUOMO: Now, Maggie, we heard from McMaster yesterday, the kind of fulsome praise for the use of Rocket Man, that it was accurate and that it was evocative and got people's attention and that they are perfectly happy with the state of play there. How deep does that go?
When he created that program, President Barack Obama promised the government would look out for them. When Trump ended the program, Democrats (and a lot of Republicans) promised to do something to fix the problem.
Sen. Amy Klobuchar will take to the national stage on Monday headlining a CNN town hall in New Hampshire to make her most public case yet for why she should be the next President of the United States.
La gente está sorprendida de escuchar que no necesitamos nuevas leyes, dijo. Trabajaremos con el sistema y la estructura que ya existen.
The House voted Wednesday on a resolution affirming the chamber's authority to defend the Affordable Care Act in federal court.
You can call it what you want, but that's the only reason we don't have it, because of John McCain, he said on the Rick & Bubba radio show.
Trump claimed that Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador and Mexico used to refuse to accept back people the US wanted to deport, but now has stopped doing that. (Facts First: Trump was mixing up two separate issues. While the Trump administration does have new agreements with all four countries, those agreements are related to the handling of people who have come or are trying to come to the US seeking asylum, not criminals the US is seeking to deport. In 2016, prior to Trump's presidency, none of the four countries was on the list of countries that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) considered recalcitrant (uncooperative) in accepting the return of their citizens from the US. You can read a longer fact check here .)
DRUCKER: -- told a bunch of us today, Republicans were put on this earth to support tax cut bills. That's why this was a little easier.
The Point: Predicting how something like the Mueller report lands with the public is a tricky thing – particularly when we don't know for sure what's in it. And it's possible that once we do know more of what Mueller found – as opposed to just Barr's top lines – perceptions could change. But the most likely outcome today is that the report goes out with more of a whimper than a bang – in political terms.
Still, the discussions come after Trump appointed Vice President Mike Pence , rather than Azar, as the White House's point man for the coronavirus response at a rare presidential news conference. Trump had privately expressed frustration over Azar's lack of communication on key issues as the head of the White House coronavirus task force.
The 59-year-old boxing trainer said he wasn't worried about Biden's losses in Iowa and New Hampshire, where the former vice president placed fourth and fifth respectively.
I never said that, Credico told CNN in a text message Wednesday. Credico noted that he has said he didn't feel personally threatened by Stone himself, but he has also said that he felt threatened -- because of the climate in this country right now -- that someone else might try to kill him, t elling CNN's Kate Bolduan that he feared somebody may pull a Jack Ruby on me.
Just as Trump has a handy fictional excuse for why he lost the popular vote in 2016 -- millions of illegal votes in California and maybe elsewhere -- he has a handy fictional excuse for why he didn't win New Hampshire: hundreds and hundreds of buses of improper voters, shipped up from Massachusetts, he told a rally crowd in New Hampshire last week.
Officials said that the stockpile was never meant to be the sole source of supply for items like protective equipment and that local authorities should seek to fill their need on the open market. That will come as terrible news to state governors and frontline health care workers who are pleading for more equipment -- and for Trump to fully unleash the power of government to surge manufacturing of such items.
Here is a list of just some of the exchanges Bolton could be able to testify about.
Biden has yet to announce his pick to head the agency, which runs the federal exchange, and his choice for Health and Human Services Secretary, Xavier Becerra , has yet to be confirmed by the Senate.
Which brings me to Tuesday and Trump's comments about McCain, who died in August 2018 after a battle with brain cancer. Here's all of what Trump said:
Why is health care in the US so expensive?
You didn't write that bill, Klobuchar said.
Rep. Ted Poe announced Sunday he has resigned from the conservative House Freedom Caucus over its opposition to the Republican health care plan, becoming the group's first public casualty in the fall-out over its role in defeating the bill.

Missing from the conversation are a range of issues that would more fully showcase each candidate's point of view and speak to the hearts and interests of the Democratic base. I put out a quick Twitter poll and found that voters want to hear more about: voting rights; election protection; criminal justice reform; immigration and family separation; the future of work; curbing the rise of white nationalist terrorism; women's rights and reproductive health; gun control; federal courts; education equity; eliminating the electoral college; poverty and Income inequality; veterans issues; affordable housing; addressing police brutality; disability rights; LGBTQ rights -- and the list goes on.
The problem is the newspaper polls are more fake than the news they write. They write fake polls. It's true. They write fake polls. You call them suppression polls. You read them and you get depressed because it looks like you're doing badly. They do that. I think it's almost worse than what they write, and you can't get much worse than what they write. -- December 18 campaign rally in Battle Creek, Michigan
Trump has already thrown his weight behind the plan, tweeting: I am very supportive of the Senate #HealthcareBill. Look forward to making it really special!
We know this is a small thing, but Trump has made repeated false claims at rallies about CNN's cameras. (He usually claims that CNN's red light has vanished when he has attacked CNN, supposedly proving that CNN has stopped broadcasting live or stopped filming. In reality, CNN's cameras at his rallies are set so that no light goes on and off as they go live or stop going live, or as they record or stop recording.)
BARRO: So this is different in more irresponsible.
What's especially depressing is that our media, let alone our democracy, seems ill-equipped to handle anything like Trump. Martha Raddatz and Anderson Cooper tried, but fact checking Trump doesn't work because Trump doesn't care about facts. In fact, he denies he's lying as he's lying and then, for extra audacity, accuses everyone else of being liars. I keep waiting for the ghost of George Orwell to show up on the debate stage and bite Trump on the ankles.
The commission must explore targeted programs to repair the purposeful injury to Black Americans caused by racial slavery, Jim Crow bigotry, inequality in federal housing policies and the GI Bill and predatory lending during the Great Recession.

The Freedom Caucus' tone differed greatly from the mood of the conference hours earlier. As members emerged from leadership's briefing Tuesday night, many rank-and-file members – from defense hawks to fiscal conservatives – seemed reluctant but ready to lend their support if they had to.
Leadership also had to convince defense hawks to back another short-term spending bill after they've said repeatedly that they have deep concerns about how that could affect the military.
SERFATY: Now, after all that, of course, the dust still settling here this morning, but the big question going forward is how will all of this change the dynamic of the race going forward. Of course, Chris, this is only four days before Super Tuesday.
COOPER: I just don't understand how any candidate who has been running for a long as Mitt Romney is and as smart as Mitt Romney is could get his own policy so wrong unless he was trying to appeal to a wider range of people by kind of painting with a very broad brush and the definition that not most people have about what a pre-existing condition is.
The law outlines that the House and Senate will have up to two hours to debate, but how that time is divided and who will speak has not fully been flushed out.

MIAMI GARDENS, FLORIDA - MAY 06: Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis speaks during a press conference at the Hard Rock Stadium testing site on May 06, 2020 in Miami Gardens, Florida. Gov. DeSantis announced during the press conference that a COVID-19 antibodies test will be available. The test can show if a person has had the virus in the past without showing symptoms, and therefore may be immune to it. The test will be available to first responders and health care workers first, with the goal of being able to expand testing to the general public. (Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)

CUOMO: And God bless him for being there.
What specifically would you do as president to make sure that veterans in crisis are able to get the help they need?
Some of this is just a result of the erratic relationship between the White House and Congress. Planning a budget from the executive branch is complicated; it's nigh on impossible when legislators throw an eleventh-hour spending pact at you. Despite it all, the budget plan remains a crucially informative and important document – an annual view into the President's priorities and goals.
President Ronald Reagan's crowds in Las Vegas
But when it comes to follow through, at least in his first 100 days in office Trump has come up short on the bite, failing to deliver on his toughest campaign promises.
Trump might perhaps have been thinking of the well-known saga of the company Altamont Winds, which announced in 2015 that it would shut down its turbines in California's Altamont Pass. The turbines had been the subject of numerous complaints from bird advocates, but the shutdown was the company's own decision.
The CDC found that the drug overdose death rate was lower in 2018 than in 2017 in 14 states and the District of Columbia. But the 2018 overdose death rate was also higher than in 2017 in five states -- California, Delaware, Missouri, New Jersey and South Carolina.
Already, wide majorities of Americans say in polls they support Biden's plan, which the White House began selling as a necessity to return the country to normal through funding for reopening schools and expanding vaccine distribution. Republicans struggled to unify behind a message of opposition, focusing instead on culture war issues and internal divides in the post-Donald Trump era.

TAPPER: Well, I think you would argue that it was authorized but not appropriated but I don't want to get into the weeds of all of that.
But Elie -- the last question to you. The Trump entities as we highlighted at the top there are under investigation across the board. It does feel like to some extent that the walls are closing in on the President. What does it mean for Trump legally, personally himself? Should he be scared at this moment more so than in the past?

Trump claimed President Barack Obama left him 142 openings on the courts, in part because Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell -- who thwarted many of Obama's judicial nominees -- did a great job.
That came out a couple weeks ago. So you add in the details today, but one other thing, I've got to point out, the level of breathtaking corruption by those surrounding the President of the United States is something that should be remarked upon. You know, these people were not just like petty criminals. Paul Manafort and Mr. Cohen, Michael Cohen were ripping people off in a massive scale. Tax fraud is alleged that he is now pleaded guilty to. Michael Cohen, you know, monetizing his relationship with the President and the Trump administration, $4 million essentially was paid to him after Trump became President, he was elected President, and he apparently it was all a con, according to the prosecutors in their filing today.

[14:50:21] DAVID CHALIAN, CNN POLITICAL DIRECTOR: It is. Now, this may have been one of Sarah Huckabee Sanders's most troubling appearances in the press briefing room and you can hear it from the reaction of the entire press corps when she's jumping in. Because they are failing at P.R. 101 here of actually martialing all the facts and putting them out and getting their stories straight. All they do is raise more questions. How much did the president know? Had the president read the e-mail? We still don't know the time line here. I understand that she said he didn't dictate and that's their answer to The Washington Post. But when she said that the statement that you just read that was given to The New York Times, Donald Trump Jr's statement --

Facts First: There is no evidence for either Trump's general claim that they are rigging the Democratic presidential primary to hurt the chances of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, nor for the specific claim that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi scheduled Trump's impeachment trial to damage Sanders' chances in Iowa.
Such arguments ignore the primary responsibility of the executive in keeping Americans safe. A future investigation will for sure probe whether Washington as a whole took the investigation sufficiently seriously and may find that Congress was asleep at the switch.

All three dropped out before the first vote has even been cast.

But could it have also been an effort to keep another Democratic-led House v. Trump dispute off the books.
RYAN: And that's one of the critical things we're trying to achieve here. Instead of using OPM -- other people's money -- to pay for health care that you don't care what things cost, we want to harness the power of the marketplace, the power of the consumer, of the patient and the doctor to demand better services, to demand better quality. We want transparency on price, on quality, and an economic incentive to act on that thing so that we can bring consumers to the bear.

Las solicitudes presupuestarias anuales son listas de deseos políticos que establecen las prioridades políticas de un líder o partido.

Estos son votos de mensajes y son utilizados por ambas partes para poner en cero los contrastes clave, sobre la atención de la salud, la reforma tributaria, la financiación de la educación, el medio ambiente y los programas de investigación médica.
