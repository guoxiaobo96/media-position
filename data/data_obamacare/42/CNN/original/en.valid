(CNN) —\n\nOur weekly roundup of the news, notes and chatter about the prospects for the next Democratic presidential race:\n\nMassachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren says – present tense – she's not a 2020 candidate. I am not running for president in 2020, she told CNN's Jim Acosta this weekend.\n\nBut many of her recent actions suggest otherwise.\n\nWarren announced last week at a Democratic National Committee gala that she'd sent a check for $5,000 to all 50 state parties – $250,000 total. I want a Democratic Party strong enough to compete for every vote, in every race, at every level, in every state, in every election – and I'm willing to do my part to help make that happen, she said.\n\nWhile Warren was bolstering her state-level ties, she was warring with fellow Democrats on Capitol Hill.\n\nFighting against a bank bill Tuesday, after the vote to advance the legislation, she retweeted a list of Democrats who backed it, adding: Senate Republicans voted unanimously for the #BankLobbyistAct. But this bill wouldn't be on the path to becoming law without the support of these Democrats. The Senate just voted to increase the chances your money will be used to bail out big banks again.\n\nThe upshot: Warren is certainly aware that the short-term awkwardness with colleagues could pay off in 2020, when the party's primary electorate is likely to be well to the left of the Senate Democratic caucus.\n\nNews and notes:\n\nDNC MOVES TO CURB SUPERDELEGATES: The fight over exactly what role superdelegates should play in the 2020 nominating process won't be resolved until this summer – but the Democratic National Committee voted over the weekend on a big-picture goal: Reducing them. The full DNC accepted a recommendation to revise the role and reduce the perceived influence of superdelegates. What that means, exactly, will be sorted out by the Rules and Bylaws Committee ahead of a June deadline to prepare a final proposal for the August DNC meeting.\n\nWhat to watch: The 21-member Unity Reform Commission recommended a 60% reduction in superdelegates – binding DNC members to their states' results on the first ballot but allowing elected officials and former presidents and vice presidents to retain their unpledged status. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders' allies are pushing to go further – doing away with unpledged delegates altogether, at least on the first ballot.\n\nThe campaign that never ends: Sanders on Friday told CNN's Jake Tapper that superdelegates should be eliminated entirely. In a statement on the DNC's moves Saturday, Hillary Clinton praised other reforms but didn't mention superdelegates at all.\n\nBERNIE SANDERS IN TRUMP COUNTRY: Since Donald Trump's election, Bernie Sanders has visited 28 states (not counting his home in Vermont), often headlining multiple events in different cities over the course of just a few hours. He's keynoted events with progressive groups opposing Obamacare repeal and the GOP tax bill, done a book tour, and – increasingly as the midterms near – endorsed and stumped with congressional candidates.\n\nThe reasoning is simple, Sanders said this week before heading for Texas and Arizona: We have put a significant effort into going into states that Trump won. Not exclusively, but most of the states that I've visited have been states that Trump won. The reason for that is, I think it's important for people who voted for Trump to understand that many of the promises that he made on health care, on taxes, on many other issues, are promises that he did not keep.\n\n– On Trump's new tariffs – 25% on steel imports and 10% on aluminum imports – Sanders, who campaigned on protectionist policies like Trump, said: Do we need radical changes in our trade policy to rebuild American manufacturing and protect the American worker? Absolutely, positively. That's exactly what I campaigned on. Do I think that Trump's approach of just putting tariffs on steel and aluminum, is gonna solve the problem? The answer is no, it is not. We need a more comprehensive approach.\n\n– Asked if Congress should get more involved in the process, he said: Absolutely, absolutely, absolutely. I will credit Trump, which I very rarely do, to put his finger on a real problem. I do not want to see the continued de-industrialization of the loss of good paying jobs, whether it's steel, aluminum, or any other industry. We need serious legislation.\n\nBIDEN ISN'T SLOWING DOWN: Former Vice President Joe Biden's busy week began with campaign stops in Pennsylvania, where he stumped for Democrat Conor Lamb before Tuesday's special election in Pennsylvania's 18th District. It ended on Friday with a speech at the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois, where he spoke about economic opportunity.\n\nBiden's stop in western Pennsylvania was not just a stump speech, but an opportunity to offer a glimpse of how he'd approach 2020 if he runs for president again: by working to rebuild a Democratic coalition that includes white, rural, blue-collar voters. He slammed Trump for the tax bill, saying it would lead to cuts in Medicare and Social Security, and tried to appeal to voters dissatisfied with the President in a district he won by 20 points in 2016.\n\nKAMALA'S PLANS: In a Politico dive into California Sen. Kamala Harris's positioning in the Senate, she discussed being approached to run in 2020 – without actually tipping her hand about whether she'll do it. I have seen so many people along the way focused on that thing out there, and they trip over the thing in front of them. And the thing in front of us is so important, Harris said. I'm going to let everybody else sit around and think about things that have yet to approach.\n\nMERKLEY 'KEEPING THE OPTION OPEN': Oregon Sen. Jeff Merkley told local radio station KOIN he is keeping the option open for a potential 2020 run – but that his planned March 24 trip to New Hampshire doesn't mean he's in. My main focus is the fight for 51, to get a Democratic majority in the Senate that can stop some of the worst of Trump's policies and also the packing of the courts, Merkley said.\n\nA NIXON TO EXCITE THE LEFT? Cynthia Nixon, that is. The actress and activist, a staple of New York City progressive politics for some time now, is inching closer to a primary challenge to Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who's seeking his third term – and could, with a rout, put himself in a position to run in 2020. But Nixon, who's getting advice from strategists Rebecca Katz (a longtime top aide and ally of New York Mayor Bill de Blasio) and Bill Hyers, poses two kinds of threats to Cuomo: 1) To actually beat him. She has the name recognition and the right politics to flank him on the left; and 2) By coming close, to put a major dent in Cuomo's standing with liberals, who already have their qualms.\n\nAsked on a conference call last week whether he thought de Blasio was encouraging Nixon into the race, Cuomo offered this: I think it was either the mayor of New York or Vladimir Putin. I am going to leave it to you great investigative reporters to follow the facts and ferret out the truth.\n\nGARCETTI ON LATE NIGHT: Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti was on Late Night with Seth Meyers on Tuesday and spoke about his passion for local politics – and slammed national politicians in Washington, which is something he's been repeatedly doing through his stops and visits around the country in early primary states. He specifically called out Washington for not acting on the issues of homelessness and DACA – both of which strongly impact his city.\n\nMeyers did ask him about his 2020 prospects, and what he would say about the attacks on him from the right calling him the Hollywood candidate. We do have more Kardashians than anywhere else, but most of us are not Kardashians … so I can relate to that conversation on a local level with the mayor in Dayton, a mayor in Columbia, South Carolina, mayor in South Bend, Indiana, like Mayor Pete (Buttigieg) … and we speak the language I think of America. It's Washington that's that swamp and it's only getting swampier.\n\nELLISON GRABS THE SINGLE-PAYER TORCH: Minnesota Rep. Keith Ellison, the DNC deputy chair, is the new lead sponsor of the House single-payer health care bill, taking over the title from former Rep. John Conyers. The House allowed the largely symbolic switcheroo by unanimous consent on Wednesday, but it was an important one for folks who didn't want the legislation attached to Conyers' name after his resignation amid sexual harassment allegations last year. The movement carries on, Ellison said in an interview that afternoon. I remain a staunch advocate of the ACA, but we can imagine a world in which we can have universal health care styled on a 'Medicare for all' bill.\n\nWhat now? We are in the middle of a very critical national conversation and we're going to incorporate into the next iteration that which we learn – so we expect the bill to get better, with more flesh on the bones, he said. (The text of the bill remains unchanged.) You can also expect Republicans to use Ellison's title with the DNC – which is also mostly symbolic – to allege the party is moving too far left. It's worth noting, though, that single-payer is a long ways away from being adapted by a DNC platform committee.\n\nFrom the right:\n\nFLAKE CALLS FOR A TRUMP CHALLENGER: During an appearance on NBC's Meet the Press on Sunday morning, Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake again called for a Republican to challenge President Donald Trump in 2020. Flake has long been a Trump critic, and has said he himself would not rule out a 2020 challenge to Trump.\n\nFlake's upcoming visit to New Hampshire next weekend is stoking speculation that Flake is considering being that Republican challenger to Trump in 2020. The senator will address the New Hampshire Institute of Politics at their Politics & Eggs event on Friday, which has become a popular stop for potential presidential contenders.\n\nBefore you go:\n\nContinuing his re-entrance into the political world, former Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick will be speaking at the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia on Thursday at an event called Renewing the Founders' Promise.\n\nCNN's Sophie Tatum, Ashley Killough, Saba Hamedy, David Siegel and Betsy Klein contributed to this memo.
Story highlights Many doctors know that such talks are important but aren't sure what to say Medicare covers advance planning conversations Only 14 percent of doctors surveyed have billed Medicare for such discussions\n\n(CNN) —\n\nDoctors know it's important to talk with their patients about end-of-life care.\n\nBut they're finding it tough to start those conversations – and when they do, they're not sure what to say, according to a national poll released Thursday.\n\nSuch discussions are becoming more important as baby boomers reach their golden years. By 2030, an estimated 72 million Americans will be 65 or over, nearly one-fifth of the U.S. population.\n\nMedicare now reimburses doctors $86 to discuss end-of-life care in an office visit that covers topics such as hospice, living wills and do-not-resuscitate orders. Known as advance care planning, the conversations can also be held in a hospital.\n\nPayment for such discussions was initially included in the Affordable Care Act, but removed because of the controversy over so-called death panels. Medicare ultimately changed its policy, independently of Obamacare, to allow reimbursement for the end-of-life planning sessions.\n\nThe poll of 736 primary care doctors and specialists, including 202 in California, examined their views on advance care planning and end-of-life conversations with patients. Among the findings:\n\nWhile 75 percent of doctors said Medicare reimbursement makes it more likely they'd have advance care planning discussions, only about 14 percent said they had actually billed Medicare for those visits.\n\nThree quarters also believe it's their responsibility to initiate end-of-life conversations.\n\nFewer than one-third reported any formal training on end-of-life discussions with patients and their families.\n\nMore than half said they had not discussed end-of-life care with their own physicians.\n\nThe survey was commissioned by The John A. Hartford Foundation, the California Health Care Foundation and Cambia Health Foundation. (California Healthline is an editorially independent publication of the California Health Care Foundation.)\n\nPatients and their families increasingly want to talk about end-of-life care with their physicians well before facing a terminal illness, studies have shown. Most also want to die at home rather than in a hospital, although cultural differences influence end-of-life preferences.\n\nPatients want their primary care doctors to have these conversations, and the poll shows that physicians recognize that it's their responsibility, said Dr. Sandra Hernández, president and CEO of the California Health Care Foundation and a physician who treats HIV patients. It's wonderful that Medicare is reimbursing for these discussions. Now, physicians need more skills and training.\n\nHaving the patient be able to participate in defining what end-of-life looks like is where the whole health care delivery system is going, Hernández said.\n\nPolicy experts are urging more end-of-life conversations not just to accommodate patients' desires, but to save money on aggressive medical interventions that patients and their families don't want and that won't prolong life.\n\nA recent study found nearly 40 percent of American patients dying with cancer received at least one chemotherapy treatment in the six months before they died, more than in six other countries studied. An average of about $18,500 was spent on U.S. hospital costs for patients in their last six months.\n\nNearly a quarter of the physicians in the national poll said that the electronic health records they're required to use don't have a place to include patients' end-of-life preferences. Even when electronic health records signaled that a patient had an advance care directive, nearly a third of doctors reported they couldn't access its actual contents.\n\nAnd doctors who received their medical training years ago say they rarely focused on how to talk to patients about end-of-life care, although medical education is improving in that regard.\n\nFollow CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\n\nPhysicians in large medical systems may find more support than those in private practice. At Kaiser Permanente in Northern California, physicians receive training in end-of-life discussions and have time to carry them out, said Dr. Ruma Kumar, the HMO's regional medical director of supportive care services.\n\nKaiser Permanente uses physician extenders – nurse practitioners, registered nurses and social workers – to work with patients on various stages of what the HMO calls life care planning. The HMO also offers a website to guide people through the process.\n\nKumar said Kaiser encourages both doctors and patients to think of end-of-life planning as a routine part of care, just like you'd get a mammogram or colon cancer screening.\n\n(The general survey has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.6 percentage points. For the internist/primary care provider sample, margin is plus or minus 4.5 percentage points. For specialists, plus or minus 6.0.)\n\nThis story was produced by Kaiser Health News, which publishes California Healthline, a service of the California Health Care Foundation.

THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.\n\n\n\nDANA BASH, CNN ANCHOR: A triple threat to U.S. security: atrocities from ISIS, a land grab by Vladimir Putin, and Washington politics that could shut down the department charged with keeping America safe.\n\n\n\nThis is STATE OF THE UNION.\n\n\n\nANNOUNCER: This is CNN breaking news.\n\n\n\nBASH: Good morning. I'm Dana Bash.\n\n\n\nAnd we begin with the war on ISIS, Jordan carrying out new airstrikes on ISIS targets inside Syria. On the ground, there's a tense standoff between the ISIS fighters and the Kurdish Peshmerga in Northern Iraq.\n\n\n\nCNN's Phil Black is in Irbil.\n\n\n\nPhil, what's the latest there?\n\n\n\nPHIL BLACK, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Dana, everything we have seen and everything we have been told by front-line fighters on the ground here near Mosul suggests that there has been a significant uptick in airstrikes on ISIS positions in and around that ISIS-controlled city.\n\n\n\nWe were at a distance of some 10 miles from the southern gates of Mosul. We heard, saw multiple detonations. The sound of fast-moving aircraft overhead was pretty constant, this as Kurdish fighters on the ground are really digging in and holding defensive lines a small distance away from that city.\n\n\n\nThat's what they call phase one of this operation, to contain ISIS within that city. Phase two will be hard. It will be dislodging ISIS from that city. The Kurdish fighters say they will be ready to take part. The time frame is not yet clear. Some U.S. officials have suggested it could be as early as April. Kurdish officials think it's going to be longer than that.\n\n\n\nBut, ultimately, it comes down to when the Iraqi army controlled by the government in Baghdad is ready to go. And that's no small task, rebuilding, retraining, remotivating the army. It is the same force that ultimately abandoned Mosul when ISIS first invaded this region, Dana. BASH: Phil, no small task, that is an understatement. Thank you\n\n\n\nvery much for that report.\n\n\n\nAnd here in the United States this Sunday morning, there is deep skepticism over the ISIS claim that the U.S. hostage Kayla Mueller was actually killed by a Jordanian airstrike inside Syria. A spokesman says her family remains hopeful.\n\n\n\nCNN's Kyung Lah is Prescott Arizona, where her -- where she is from.\n\n\n\nKyung, what are you hearing?\n\n\n\nKYUNG LAH, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, Dana, everything that we have been told by people who are in touch with the family is that they still do not have confirmation. They do not know the status of their daughter.\n\n\n\nAnd it is simply agony for the people of this town, as well as her family, made worse as we learn more about Kayla Mueller. She is a girl who grew up here, became a very dedicated woman to social justice. She went to Syria to try to help the refugees.\n\n\n\nI spoke with a professor of hers who was a mentor. And that professor says that Mueller was very sober about the risk. She knew profoundly what was at stake here. She still went. And her family now also knew. They are still awaiting word. They have reached out in a public statement to her captors, urging them to reach them -- Dana.\n\n\n\nBASH: Kyung, thank you very much for that report.\n\n\n\nAnd a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee tells CNN there's no reason to believe ISIS is, in his words, moving beyond what until now have been aspirations to attack the U.S. homeland.\n\n\n\nBut, as the threat grows, the Department of Homeland Security may shut down in a matter of weeks because Congress is blocking its money in a partisan fight over immigration.\n\n\n\nWe're joined now exclusively by the U.S. homeland security secretary, Jeh Johnson.\n\n\n\nAnd, Mr. Secretary, thanks for coming in.\n\n\n\nBefore we get to that, I want to ask about what you just heard the report about Kayla Mueller. You heard her say that she knew the risks of going into a place like Syria. The State Department advises U.S. citizens not to do that.\n\n\n\nGiven that, what should the U.S. responsibility be to go in and get hostages?\n\n\n\nJEH JOHNSON, U.S. SECRETARY OF HOMELAND SECURITY: Well, obviously, we're learning as much as we can as quickly as we can about Ms. Mueller's situation. Our thoughts, our prayers, our concerns are with her family right now.\n\n\n\nYou're correct. The State Department advises against travel in that particular part of the region right now. It is dangerous. People need to be cautious. And we do what we can to ensure the safety of Americans who travel. That part of the world right now is obviously a very, very challenging situation.\n\n\n\nBASH: Should the U.S. be responsible for going and rescuing hostages who are going, even though the U.S. State Department says it's just too dangerous?\n\n\n\nJOHNSON: Well, we know from prior examples that, where we can, we do our best to secure the safety of Americans held hostage by terrorist organizations.\n\n\n\nAnd so it's something that we continually evaluate our ability to do in this region, but it is a very, very challenging situation, obviously.\n\n\n\nBASH: OK.\n\n\n\nSo, let's talk about the jihadists overall. Americans looking at this, looking at the fighting, you know, probably constantly saying, how does this affect me, how does this affect the United States, and say, why does it matter?\n\n\n\nJohn (sic) Steinbach, who is the FBI's counterterrorism division head, told CNN's Pam Brown about an example of why it should matter. Listen to this.\n\n\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nPAMELA BROWN, CNN JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT: There are ISIS cells in the U.S.\n\n\n\nMICHAEL STEINBACH, FBI ASSISTANT DIRECTOR OF COUNTERTERRORISM: There are individuals that have been in communication with groups like ISIL who have a desire to conduct an attack, yes.\n\n\n\nBROWN: That are living in the U.S. right now?\n\n\n\nSTEINBACH: Correct.\n\n\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nBASH: People who are in contact with ISIL living in the U.S. right now. How many are we talking about?\n\n\n\nJOHNSON: Well, Dana, I would put it this way. We have evolved to a new phase in the global terrorist threat, in that, 13 years ago, when we were attacked on 9/11, we had a relatively conventional command-and-control structure from core al Qaeda that would dispatch, deploy operatives to commit terrorist acts.\n\n\n\nThe situation now is more decentralized, more diffuse, and frankly more complex, in that terrorist organizations such as ISIL or al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula use the Internet, use social media to communicate and to inspire acts of terrorism in individuals' home countries.\n\n\n\nAnd for that reason, we need to be particularly vigilant here at home, working with state and local law enforcement, working with the public through campaigns such As If You See Something, Say Something.\n\n\n\nBASH: But...\n\n\n\nJOHNSON: It is a more complex situation, very clearly.\n\n\n\nBASH: Certainly complex, but, if I may, can you shed more light on what we just heard? Do you have a handle on who the individuals are and how many there are in the United States who are in contact...\n\n\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nJOHNSON: The FBI and the Department of Homeland Security do a pretty good job of tracking the travel of individuals of suspicion, of investigating potential acts of terror or material support to terrorism.\n\n\n\nJust this past Friday, there were arrests of five individuals who were providing material support, allegedly, to ISIL. So, our law enforcement community does what I believe is a pretty good job of tracking these individuals. And we work with them to track the travel of individuals of suspicion.\n\n\n\nBASH: Can you give us a sense? Are we talking about five, 10, 100, 1,000? What's -- give us the context of the...\n\n\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nBASH: ... that we're talking about.\n\n\n\nJOHNSON: Well, what I can say is this.\n\n\n\nThe numbers that we see are larger in European countries. And that's one of the reasons why we're concerned about travel to and from Europe and making sure that we have got the appropriate security assurances from countries from which we -- for which we do not require a visa.\n\n\n\nBut here at home, we do a pretty good job of tracking these individuals. And we have, in a number of instances, arrested people for material support, for attempting to travel to Syria, for example.\n\n\n\nObviously, there's an unknown factor, but I believe we have the systems in place to do a pretty good job of tracking these individuals through law enforcement, through -- through travel, through our efforts to monitor what they're doing.\n\n\n\nBASH: So people should feel you have got it covered?\n\n\n\nJOHNSON: People should be vigilant right now. Yes, we should have a lot of confidence in our homeland security\n\n\n\nlaw enforcement capabilities. We have come a long way since 9/11. But this also requires working with the public in campaigns through If You See Something, Say Something, working with state and local law enforcement, the cop on the beat working in the communities, which is why we're working more closely now with municipal police departments, county sheriffs, state law enforcement, through fusion centers, task forces, and so forth.\n\n\n\nGiven how the homeland security challenges we face are evolving, it's becoming all the more important to do that.\n\n\n\nBASH: OK.\n\n\n\nLet's turn to the Department of Homeland Security and the fight that's going on right now that could potentially shut down your department or at least keep funding out of your department.\n\n\n\nI also want you to look at the calendar to -- so people understand how close we are to the deadline for that happening. It's February 27. Here we are, just a little more than two weeks away, and we should note that, by the way, Congress is out of town. They're not working for one of those weeks, so it makes it incredibly difficult.\n\n\n\nTell us where things stand right now. It is a standoff over the idea that Republicans are trying to push funding this bill along with making sure that the president's executive order on immigration doesn't happen.\n\n\n\nJOHNSON: Dana, I am on Capitol Hill now virtually every working day talking to Democrats and Republicans about the importance of a fully funded Department of Homeland Security in these times in particular.\n\n\n\nWe're on a continuing resolution right now, which, as you point out, expires on February 27, which is less than 20 days at this point. And, as long as we're on a continuing resolution, that, in and of itself, creates uncertainty about how we go about our Homeland Security missions.\n\n\n\nAnd, if we go into government shutdown, for example, that means furloughing employees, furloughing Homeland Security officials. As Craig Fugate, the administrator of FEMA, pointed out the other day, if we go into government shutdown, he's got to furlough something like 80 percent of his FEMA work force.\n\n\n\nAnd so I'm on the Hill every day stressing the importance of a fully funded Department of Homeland Security, separate and apart from riders to try to defund our efforts to reform the immigration system.\n\n\n\nBASH: And are you getting...\n\n\n\nJOHNSON: If people in Congress want to have that debate about immigration reform, let's have that debate, but don't tie that to funding public safety at Homeland Security for the American people. We need a fully funded department right now. BASH: Actually, since you mentioned the -- the potential risks,\n\n\n\nI just also want to point out that, in your own contingency plan in 2013 if there were a shutdown then, nearly 90 percent of Border Patrol agents would still have to work, 85 percent of ICE agents, and 93 percent of TSA officials. They would have to come to work without pay, but they would have to come to work.\n\n\n\nSo, is it really going to be that big of a deal to most of your agency to -- when it comes to the risks to this country?\n\n\n\nJOHNSON: Yes, it is that big of a deal.\n\n\n\nLet's not forget the Department of Homeland Security interfaces with the American public more than any other department of our government at airports, at ports. And so to just say, well, we will just make them come to work without pay, first of all, is a real challenge for the working men and women of my department.\n\n\n\nSecond, it means furloughing at least 30,000 of our department and cutting back very significantly on our operations, our operations to pursue homeland security. So, this is not a situation to make light of. In these challenging times, we need a fully funded Department of Homeland Security right now.\n\n\n\nBASH: And you mentioned the continuing resolution. That's sort of official Washington-speak for the fact that this -- that your department has -- they have kicked the can down the road for many years, and not started -- started anew.\n\n\n\nAnd what has that meant for your ability to face new threats? Because threats change every day.\n\n\n\nJOHNSON: As long as we're on a continuing resolution, we are, first of all, restricted to last year's spending levels. But we are not allowed to fund new initiatives, new initiatives for border security, for example, new initiatives to hire more Secret Service agents for the coming presidential election cycle, new initiatives to fund grants.\n\n\n\nWe fund in excess of $2 billion a year in grants to state and local law enforcement for homeland security, for surveillance equipment, for communications commitment. And, as long as we're on a C.R., I cannot fund those new initiatives, which should be of serious concern to sheriffs, police chiefs, mayors, and governors.\n\n\n\nBASH: Before I let you go, I have to ask you about the Secret Service, which is underneath your department.\n\n\n\nIt seems like, every week, there is some kind of breach at the White House. This past week, we saw what happened with the drones. The Secret Service is now acting without an actual director. How far away are we from your interview process finishing up on that?\n\n\n\nJOHNSON: We're not far away.\n\n\n\nWe're taking a serious look at candidates for permanent director. And the president and I recognize that the Secret Service is the finest protection service in the world, but we -- we need significant change in how the agency conducts business.\n\n\n\nThat was one of the findings of the independent panel. And I thought that their work was fair and thorough. And so we're looking at a new permanent director. And I think we will have one pretty soon.\n\n\n\nBASH: And, as somebody who oversees the Secret Service, when you hear a drone has landed at the White House, do you say, are you kidding me? Again?\n\n\n\nI mean, what is your reaction when you hear this kind of breach? Because the public is also -- is obviously saying, how does this kind of thing...\n\n\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nJOHNSON: In the last couple of months, we have added security to the White House compound, in light of the fence-jumping incident.\n\n\n\nIt's important to remember that securing the White House compound, the protection of the first family and other national leaders is a balance between providing for their physical safety, but we live in democracy where people want transparency, they want access to their national leaders and the buildings and the structures of government. And so it means striking the appropriate balance.\n\n\n\nBASH: Mr. Secretary, thank you so much.\n\n\n\nI think I'm going to see you roaming the halls of Congress, looking for some kind of solution to your funding problem in the next couple of weeks.\n\n\n\nJOHNSON: You certainly will. Thank you.\n\n\n\nBASH: When they're working, at least.\n\n\n\nThank you. Thank you so much.\n\n\n\nAnd up next, Republican Senator Ted Cruz on this Homeland Security fight, the war on ISIS, and getting tough with Vladimir Putin.\n\n\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n\n\nBASH: Top officials from the United States and Europe are in Germany this Sunday for urgent discussions about security and the growing threat posed by Vladimir Putin's Russia.\n\n\n\nVice President Biden is there. And he's sounding and talking tough, sort of like Ronald Reagan.\n\n\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nJOSEPH BIDEN, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Given Russia's recent history, we need to judge it by its deeds, not its words. Don't tell us; show us, President Putin.\n\n\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nBASH: Republican Senator Ted Cruz, a member of the Armed Services Committee, is also at the conference.\n\n\n\n(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\n\n\n\nBASH: Senator, thank you so much for joining us.\n\n\n\nLet's start with the fight over what to do about the Ukraine. The German chancellor, the French president have been trying to negotiate some kind of an agreement. And Angela Merkel of Germany has specifically said she does not think it is time to arm the Ukrainians yet.\n\n\n\nWhy do you think she's wrong?\n\n\n\nSEN. TED CRUZ (R), TEXAS: Well, what she said at this conference is that she did not believe there was any prospect for Ukraine to be successful in defending itself against Russian aggression. I think that's mistaken. But, at the same time, I think Chancellor Merkel's position is not surprising, given where President Obama's position is.\n\n\n\nWhat we're doing with regard to Ukraine and with regard to Russia makes no sense, and it isn't working. It is long past time for us to step forward and provide defensive weapons, so that the men and women of Ukraine can defend their nation.\n\n\n\nThey are our allies. In the Budapest memorandum, we committed ourselves to standing with Ukraine to defend themselves -- to defend their territorial integrity.\n\n\n\nBASH: You mentioned the fact that you think that the German chancellor is wrong. There seems to be a pretty significant rift here between -- within the Western powers on how to deal with this.\n\n\n\nDo you think that the U.S. should just arm the Ukraine over the objections of the Germans?\n\n\n\nCRUZ: Well, look, there isn't a rift.\n\n\n\nI mean, what we're seeing is, when America doesn't lead, Europe can't be expected to step into the breach. What is missing from this is the president of the United States. And I have got to tell you, Dana, I'm part of a large bipartisan congressional delegation here. And it is striking that, across bipartisan lines, the delegation is united on the need for us to get serious and provide defensive arms to Ukraine.\n\n\n\nBASH: The president wasn't there speaking out this weekend, but the vice president gave a very strong speech. He even got applause from some of your fellow Republicans, the secretary of state as well, with a pretty robust message toward the Russians in defense of Ukraine.\n\n\n\nIsn't that leadership?\n\n\n\nCRUZ: Look, the vice president, I thought, gave an effective speech, but I have got to tell you, in the room, what everyone kept saying is, interesting speech. We have no confidence that President Obama is listening to the vice president.\n\n\n\nListen, what we needed here and what we have needed for six years is strong American leadership. The Obama-Clinton-Kerry foreign policy has been consistently wrong. It's been wrong on Russia. It's been wrong on ISIS. It's been wrong on Iran.\n\n\n\nWhat we needed today with regard to Ukraine was presidential leadership that stood up and said, we're going to honor our treaty commitments. We're going to provide defensive weaponry for the Ukrainians who are fighting to defend their own nation, to stand up to Russian aggression. That's a message that would be heard by our allies.\n\n\n\nBut it's also a message that would be heard by our enemies, nations like Iran, who are looking at the weakness of this administration and viewing it as an invitation for them to move even faster towards acquiring nuclear weapons.\n\n\n\nBASH: Senator, you mentioned ISIS. Let's turn to that.\n\n\n\nLindsey Graham, your colleague who's there with you in Munich, has called for 10,000 U.S. troops on the ground back in Iraq to confront ISIS. Is that a good idea?\n\n\n\nCRUZ: Well, you know, we met today with the president of Kurdistan. And the Kurds on the ground are fantastic fighters.\n\n\n\nThe Peshmerga have been our allies. They have been our friends. And they're actually fighting every day to stop ISIS. Now, Dana, what makes no sense whatsoever is, the Obama administration is refusing to directly arm the Kurds. We need to arm the Kurds now because they are our boots on the ground.\n\n\n\nI don't believe it is necessary to put American boots on the ground if we are arming the Peshmerga. They're fighting there. Just today, they didn't ask us for boots on the ground, but what they did say is they need the weaponry to stand up and destroy ISIS. And the Peshmerga on the ground, combined with overwhelming American airpower, can take out ISIS.\n\n\n\nBut we're not seeing leadership from the administration to get that done. Instead, they continue to send weaponry to Baghdad, who doesn't pass it onto the Peshmerga, and it doesn't get put to use effectively.\n\n\n\nBASH: So, you're saying Lindsey Graham and even some in the Pentagon who apparently are considering about 10,000 U.S. troops on the ground, that would be a bad move?\n\n\n\nCRUZ: In my view, American boots on the ground should always be the last step, and we need to exercise other steps before that. We have the availability of overwhelming airpower, and we have\n\n\n\nboots on the ground that are ready and eager to fight the Peshmerga, and they lack sufficient tools and equipment to do so.\n\n\n\nBASH: Senator, I want to turn to the plight of the U.S. aid worker Kayla Mueller, who is allegedly -- according to ISIS, they say that she died at the hands of a Jordanian airstrike.\n\n\n\nWe don't know the -- her fate. But, big picture, do you think it should be the position of the United States to negotiate in order to get aid workers or Americans who are hostages of groups like ISIS? Because, currently, it is not.\n\n\n\nCRUZ: Well, look, the reports coming from the ground are murky right now. We don't know her fate. Certainly, our prayers are with her and her family. We hope these early reports that she was killed are inaccurate.\n\n\n\nI don't think it is a wise policy to be negotiating with terrorists. The Obama administration has gone down that road. For example, in the negotiations for Sergeant Bergdahl, it released five senior Taliban terrorists. There are now multiple reports that one or more of them have returned to actively fighting against Americans, trying to -- trying to kill Americans.\n\n\n\nBASH: And...\n\n\n\nCRUZ: It doesn't make sense to -- to negotiate with terrorists.\n\n\n\nBASH: And real quick, when I said negotiate, what I meant was, what they want is money. They want ransom. And it is the United States' policy not to do that.\n\n\n\nFamilies are very frustrated, because they want to do whatever they can to get their kid back. As a parent, do you understand that?\n\n\n\nCRUZ: Oh, look, of course we all understand the agony of the families.\n\n\n\nBut giving money to terrorists that are using rape as a weapon of war, that are crucifying Christians, that are crucifying and beheading children, giving money just buys additional arms for them to kidnap more Americans, for them to murder more. That doesn't make any sense. The answer is to have serious leadership to defeat them.\n\n\n\nBASH: OK, Senator, we're going to take a quick break.\n\n\n\nAnd when we come back, we are going to talk about politics back home. And, believe it or not, there is another potential shutdown of part of the government looming. Senator Cruz is part of this debate.\n\n\n\nAnd we're going to talk about that after the break.\n\n\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n\n\nBASH: And we are back with Senator Ted Cruz of Texas who is joining us from Munich where there is an international security conference going on.\n\n\n\nSenator, I want to bring it back home to the stalemate in Congress over Homeland Security funding. The government again, that part of the government, runs out of money in just a few weeks. Republicans are looking at you and wondering what is your end game here because this is a strategy crafted by you, the idea of holding up funding for the Department of Homeland Security in order to try to stop the president and his executive order on immigration.\n\n\n\nSo what is your end game?\n\n\n\nCRUZ: Well, Dana, the premise of that question is not true, and it's frankly ridiculous. This is a strategy that came from Republican leadership. This is the cromnibus strategy.\n\n\n\nIf you'll recall I fought tooth and nail against cromnibus in December because I said in December this gives up our leverage and it puts us into effectively a boxed canyon. So I would say it's now up to leadership to lay out their strategy. I told them this was not a winning strategy and they went down this road anyway fighting tooth and nail.\n\n\n\nBut let me make a broader point. What we saw last week was stunning irresponsibility from the Senate Democrats. The Senate Democrats three times filibustered funding for the Department of Homeland Security. We have a bill on the floor to fund DHS.\n\n\n\nBASH: Right.\n\n\n\nCRUZ: And three times the Democrats stood together filibustered and said, we will not allow the Senate to take up this bill.\n\n\n\nBASH: Senator -\n\n\n\nCRUZ: At a time of growing national security threats across the world, that's irresponsible.\n\n\n\nBASH: OK. Senator, with respect, it's not a ridiculous premise because what you wanted to do was hold up the entire government funding back in December and the cromnibus, we won't get too much in the weeds here, was a compromise to try to work around that. So, that's I think the reality of what's going on here.\n\n\n\nOn your point about the Democrats, yes, they are holding up the bill. They're not allowing debate, but in the reality that if there were a debate, this bill still wouldn't pass and, again, when I say this bill, it's funding the Department of Homeland Security but also stopping the president for his executive action on immigration.\n\n\n\nThe votes aren't there to pass that, right?\n\n\n\nCRUZ: Well, Dana, number one, we need to fund the Department of Homeland Security. The Democrats need to stop holding national security hostage for partisan political objectives. What they're doing is wrong and irresponsible. Number two, when it comes to amnesty, amnesty, the president's\n\n\n\nexecutive amnesty is wrong, it's illegal and it's unconstitutional. And you say it would necessarily get support in the Senate. Well, you know, it's interesting. We don't know that seven Democrats had publicly criticized it on the campaign trail. They told their constituents they didn't support the president ignoring federal law, ignoring the constitution and unilaterally and illegally granting amnesty to four to 5 million people here illegally.\n\n\n\nI think we need to tee it up and give those Senate Democrats an opportunity to go on record to demonstrate...\n\n\n\nBASH: And Senator, are you talking to those Senate Democrats?\n\n\n\nCRUZ: ...whether they were telling the truth when they were talking to the voters back home or whether they'll just stand with President Obama instead.\n\n\n\nBASH: Have you been workings behind the scenes to try to get those Senate Democrats to buck their president, to vote with you all and pass a bill that stops his executive action?\n\n\n\nCRUZ: You know, unfortunately right now, Dana, the Democrats are working as a unit to filibuster funding for the Department of Homeland Security. And it's one of the patterns we've seen the last six years that's really unusual, is that Senate Democrats have consistently been unwilling to take on the president. It's part of why Harry Reid and the Democrats shut down the Senate. And I got to say it's unprecedented.\n\n\n\nI mean, look, Dana, if there's one thing that I think you would acknowledge I've been willing to do is take on my own party when my own party is not standing for the principles we're supposed to stand for. It is time to see some Senate Democrats willing to take on their own president but right now they're putting partisan politics ahead of principle and that's why they're filibustering the funding for Homeland Security. It's the wrong thing to be doing.\n\n\n\nBASH: You are dead right. You have had your differences, it's an understatement, with your party. And there are some that we talk to who say, here we go again, Ted Cruz taking us into a fight that we can't win again.\n\n\n\nWhat do you say to that?\n\n\n\nCRUZ: Well, I think it's a good talking point for people who want to shift blame. Let's be clear, the cromnibus was leadership's plan. I said at the time it is a bad plan and it is a plan that is designed to lose.\n\n\n\nBASH: I want to turn to 2016 politics before we go.\n\n\n\nThe former governor of your state, Rick Perry, gave an interview to The Texas Tribune and the Washington Post, was asked about having you as a competitor potentially. And here's what he said. It's one of the selling points, if you will, to the American\n\n\n\npeople as they decide who is going to follow Barack Obama. I think they're going to make a rather radical shift away from a young, untested United States senator whose policies have really failed.\n\n\n\nOuch. He's calling you the Republican Barack Obama.\n\n\n\nCRUZ: Listen, I like Rick Perry. He was a good governor in the state of Texas. He's a friend of mine. People occasionally throw rocks in politics. That's his choice. I'm going say I think he did a good and effective job as governor of our state.\n\n\n\nBASH: OK. Taking the high road there. Are you going to run for president, Senator Cruz?\n\n\n\nCRUZ: Dana, I'm looking at it very, very seriously. I think we're facing enormous challenges in this country.\n\n\n\nThe Obama economy has led to the lowest labor force participation since 1978. Ninety-two million Americans aren't working. Obamacare is a train wreck. We're seeing our constitutional rights under assault. And abroad the Obama-Clinton-Kerry foreign policy is an unmitigated disaster. Leading from behind doesn't work.\n\n\n\nAnd I think this next election, 2016, is going to be a fundamental Fork in the road. And I believe the American people are looking for a new path. They want to get back to the free market principles and constitutional liberties that were part of the foundation of this country. And so it's something that I'm looking at very seriously. And I'll tell you, the support we're seeing both on the grassroots level and also among the donors has been extraordinary, really has been encouraging.\n\n\n\nBASH: Wow, that certainly sounded like you've been practicing your stump speech in the mirror. Thank you so much, Senator Cruz. Appreciate your time.\n\n\n\nCRUZ: Thank you, Dana.\n\n\n\nBASH: And up next, Democratic senator, Tim Kaine, joins me for a very different perspective on what's needed to win the war on ISIS.\n\n\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n\n\nBASH: Now that Senator Ted Cruz has given us his take on Homeland Security and the war on ISIS, let's get a democratic perspective from the Senate. Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia is also a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee.\n\n\n\nAnd Senator, I want to start with what appears to be the question of the day, ground troops. Do you believe that there should be ground troops in Iraq to go after ISIS, as many as 10,000 as some are calling for?\n\n\n\nSEN. TIM KAINE (D), VIRGINIA: Dana, I actually believe there should be ground troops but they should be ground troops from the region and not U.S. ground troops.\n\n\n\nI heard the interview with Senator Cruz, the Peshmerga, that is the fighting wing of the Kurds, the Iraqi security forces, other regional actors. I think we've just got to be candid. We cannot police a region that won't police itself and so the ground troops need to be from the region but the United States' strong support via the air campaign, via training and equipping, via helping guide, via air campaign to make that effective, that's what we should do. That's what we are doing and we can do more of it.\n\n\n\nBASH: Wow, first let's just say that you just agreed with Senator Cruz. I'm not sure that you expected to do that on many issues. But --\n\n\n\nKAINE: No, on this one -- on this one we're in the same place because, again, we can't police a region that won't police itself.\n\n\n\nI was with King Abdullah earlier this week. Very emotional after the death of this Jordanian pilot in a horrible way. Even (ph) he said this fight against ISIL, it is our fight. It is the region's fight. The U.S. can help us but you can't do it for us. We've got to speak out against the regional terrorism and it's up to us to do it.\n\n\n\nBASH: Do you agree that the U.S. is not doing enough to fund and train the Peshmerga to go ahead and help those in the region who do have the capability but need more?\n\n\n\nKAINE: Well, first, Dana, I'll say we're doing a lot. Today is the six month anniversary of the president starting the war against ISIL with this significant American air campaign. I have visited Al Udeid air force base in Qatar where we're directing the campaign. And we provided significant assistance to the Kurds and others. But I do think we can do more.\n\n\n\nSo, in terms of providing more arms and assistance to the Kurds, that's something that we should do. We should be building up the capacity, especially of the Kurds and the Iraqi security force, and also Sunni tribal leaders in Iraq because we've been able to kind of slow the advances of ISIL in Iraq but we have to push back and then move on to the tougher aspect of how to take the fight to ISIL in Syria.\n\n\n\nBASH: Senator, you mentioned it's been six months, which is kind of hard to believe, since the airstrikes have started. It's been happening without a new authorization from Congress, which you have been calling for since day one. We now think that it's actually going to at least -- the wheels are going to start moving this coming week.\n\n\n\nKAINE: Yes.\n\n\n\nBASH: What took so long?\n\n\n\nKAINE: Well, Dana, it is -- it is not a pretty sight and I'm really sort of very discouraged, frankly both by the administration and by Congress. When the president started this war on the eighth of August I\n\n\n\nindicated right from the start that there were not existing legal authorities from 2001 and 2002 that would justify this action and as soon as we decided to engage in a war on ISIL, and that's what the administration has called it.\n\n\n\nBASH: Senator, what --\n\n\n\nKAINE: Congress needed to weigh in.\n\n\n\nBASH: And what is the administration saying to you, a fellow Democrat who's been very outspoken about why they dragged their feet so long?\n\n\n\nKAINE: Well, partly because the congressional leadership went to the administration in July. Both houses in both parties and I'm sad to say this, Dana, but the leadership went to the White House and said, do what you need to do. We would rather not take this up before a mid-term election.\n\n\n\nSo, I introduced a resolution in September authorizing limited military action against ISIL but Congress wouldn't vote on it before the mid-term. And then I pushed it after November and I was able to get a vote in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee defining this mission in a limited way. We voted out a bill in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in December but the House hasn't even been willing to talk about this in a committee.\n\n\n\nAnd I'll tell you what offends me about this. We've already lost American service members lives in this operation and we've done it without Congress being willing to do the job of having a vote. If we're going to ask people to risk their lives, then Congress ought to do our job and put our thumb print on this mission and say, it is in the national interest.\n\n\n\nI think the White House will send an authorization up. There's going to be some hard questions about it, but I think the president will find strong support in both houses for taking appropriate military action.\n\n\n\nBASH: Senator, let's just quickly drill down on the content of this resolution. There are differences over how specific Congress should be about the question ever boots on the ground because...\n\n\n\nKAINE: Absolutely.\n\n\n\nBASH: ...there's a lot of gray area there of what that actually means. I know that you support only having boots on the ground in limited circumstances.\n\n\n\nKAINE: Yes.\n\n\n\nBASH: Do you think that is (INAUDIBLE)?\n\n\n\nKAINE: Well, I think that Congress in both parties would significantly support it. You heard Senator Cruz. He's not the only Republican who has\n\n\n\nsaid to me that American boots on the ground is sort of a last resort. And so the resolution that I introduced that was passed, a version of it in foreign relations said, no combat troops except in following instances, the rescue of hostages or any Americans that are captured. Some directing of the airstrike campaigns to be more effective.\n\n\n\nSo I think the right answer -- and there is a difference of opinion about this, but the right answer is only combat troops in limited circumstances, and then there's some other differences of opinion, too, that we're going to have to work through in hearings in the Foreign Relations Committees.\n\n\n\nBASH: OK. Well, people are looking for bipartisanship on Capitol Hill. We saw some here just this morning. Unlikely bipartisanship in opposition to ground troops but we heard it nonetheless. Senator, thank you so much for your time. Appreciate it.\n\n\n\nKAINE: Absolutely, Dana.\n\n\n\nBASH: And up next, the ever present backdrop of Washington's politics. When Homeland Security becomes a political football, does everybody lose? A current member of Congress and a former member of the Intelligence Committee joins us next.\n\n\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n\n\nBASH: In war and in peace, the one constant here in Washington is politics.\n\n\n\nJoining me now Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard, an Iraq combat veteran who is now a Democrat from Hawaii on both the Armed Services and Foreign Affairs Committee, and Mike Rogers, CNN national security commentator and the former chair of the House Intelligence Committee. Thanks to you both.\n\n\n\nI actually want to start with Kayla Mueller, the U.S. aid worker whose fate is unknown, and Diane Foley, who is the mother of one of the man who was beheaded, one of them, said this, Kayla, along with our son and others were held for nearly two years and there were many opportunities along the way, several times when the captors reached out, several times when returning hostages brought sensitive information. And yet nothing was done to save our young Americans.\n\n\n\nKnowing what you know, I'll start with you, Congresswoman, do you think that's true or is this understandably distraught feeling of a mother who lost her son?\n\n\n\nREP. TULSI GABBARD (D), HAWAII: Well first of all it's unimaginable to try to put ourselves in her position or in the position of the parents of each of these people who have either been beheaded or slaughtered by this radical Islamic extremist, terrorists.\n\n\n\nI think it's important for us as a country, as leaders of this nation, to not allow ourselves to be terrorized by these radical extremists, not allow ourselves to fall into the trap that they are trying to set up. And understand that when these very difficult things happen, just as we've seen most recently in Jordan, that we must strengthen our resolve, we must strengthen our focus and commitment, understanding exactly who our enemy is, why they are perpetrating these horrific acts and then come up with an effective strategy to defeat them.\n\n\n\nBASH: And you were in Congress chairing the Intelligence Committee when a lot of these issues were coming up. Is the U.S. doing enough? I mean --\n\n\n\nMIKE ROGERS, CNN NATIONAL SECURITY COMMENTATOR: It's a very difficult circumstance, obviously for the mother. I think she is distraught. She is trying to find rational thought in something completely irrational, the beheading of her son. That's set aside.\n\n\n\nThe United States took a pretty significant risk in sending a pretty daring rescue mission. Now, the intelligence proved to be able old. They were a little slow in implementing. But the fact that they would risk these soldiers and Special Forces community's -- personnel's lives in the rescue attempts shows, I think, that there were good faith efforts.\n\n\n\nRemember, in the Foley case, the amount of money was something like $132 million, if my memory serves me correctly. That is not a realistic number for negotiation. They really never intended to turn Foley over. They were using all of this for propaganda and that, I think, adds also to the difficulty.\n\n\n\nBASH: So, that' a -- I mean, that's an interesting point, because some of these parents and family members, are saying the U.S. -- it's the U.S. policy law to prevent us from giving money and paying the ransom to get our family members back. I'm assuming that you think that that is a good policy to stick with particularly since you think it's just a ruse propaganda.\n\n\n\nROGERS: I even think smaller amounts cause trouble. And remember, this is those hard decisions but that -- is that one person at risk really if you do this do you put -- how many other people do you put at risk? How many other Americans do you make targets on their head who (ph) were operating in that region? That's the problem. And so it is horrific because you get to know this person but think of the people who are exposed if you make these ransom payments.\n\n\n\nBASH: Yes. Congresswoman, I want to ask you about what to do now with regard to ISIS.\n\n\n\nYou are somebody who actually has been there. You were in combat in Iraq. Do you think it is the right thing to be sending in as many as 10,000 ground troops that some are calling for in order to just try to completely annihilate ISIS once and for all?\n\n\n\nGABBARD: Well first of all, in the question of ground troops, I agree with the two people, Senator Kaine as well as Senator Cruz who just spoke earlier that, yes, there do need to be ground troops on the ground to work in conjunction with the airstrikes that we and Jordan and some of the other coalition forces are conducting in order to be effective. But I think we also need to take it one step previous.\n\n\n\nWe need to start with the basics, which is, first of all, identifying who are enemy is, understanding that this war cannot be won, this enemy and threat cannot be defeated unless we understand what's driving them, what is their ideology. And the fact is when you look at what is happening today, we have over 40 different Islamic extremist terrorist groups going by different names. You look at the vast majority of terrorist attacks that are being committed around the world, there's one common element here and it is this radical Islamist ideology. And in order to defeat it, we have to do so militarily but simultaneously, it has to be an ideological defeat as well as a political solution that's offered.\n\n\n\nBASH: And on that note, you know, we've been hearing so much talk over the past couple of years about the fact that you've got to have a strong leader in the region to do the things that you just talked about. Now, unfortunately because of what happened to the Jordanian pilot, you have the king of Jordan now being able to rally his people.\n\n\n\nIs he the leader that the United States and western world has been looking for in order to combat the Islamic extremists?\n\n\n\nROGERS: The king who spent a lot of time of Washington, D.C. over the last few years really talking about this growing extremist problem for the region in eastern Syria. So he's been laying out plans literally for three years on how he thought that the United States should help the region. This could act as the catalyst for discussions that have already happened.\n\n\n\nAnd I think the king believed he couldn't wait any longer. And this was, in an odd way, his permission to engage in the very plans he's been laying out. He understood probably more than any other leader in that region the danger of this extremist group and what it meant to all of the leadership to simulate (ph) (INAUDIBLE).\n\n\n\nBASH: And having been on the ground there, do you think that this was an unfortunate but maybe --\n\n\n\nGABBARD: Galvanizing...\n\n\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nBASH: Galvanizing and turning point?\n\n\n\nGABBARD: ...were not only for the leadership of some of these more moderate Muslim and Arab countries but also for the people there to be able to support those actions.\n\n\n\nAnd I think, again, going back to my last point, the king of Jordan when he was here just a few days ago, he made that point that this is about having a decisive military strategy coinciding with and ideological war that's existing now within Islam. And this is something the king of Jordan said has been going on now for the last 1400 years. And it's time for leaders to step up and take action.\n\n\n\nBASH: Congresswoman, thank you so much. Former congressman, thank you so much for joining us.\n\n\n\nGABBARD: Thanks and aloha.\n\n\n\nBASH: We will continue this discussion for sure. We'll be right back.\n\n\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n\n\nBASH: Thank you so much for watching STATE OF THE UNION. I'm Dana Bash in Washington.\n\n\n\nFareed Zakaria, GPS, starts right now.
A little more than one month since President Joe Biden entered office, his cornerstone legislative priority -- a $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package -- is on the path to passage by the deadline his administration set, largely mirroring the key elements he originally proposed.\n\nWhile Biden's hope for GOP support on Capitol Hill has all but disappeared in the last several weeks, his enthusiasm for the proposal -- and his view that despite its high price tag it will only serve to bolster Democrats as they remain unified -- has hardly waned.\n\nAsked what he learned from his efforts to sell the proposal at a CNN town hall in Wisconsin earlier this week, Biden didn't hesitate.\n\nI learned based on the polling data that they want everything that's in the plan, Biden said. Not a joke. Everything that's in the plan.\n\nAs House Democrats prepare to push through the legislation next week, with Senate Democrats set to follow suit in short order, it's a moment that underscores a confluence of factors on politics, policy and quiet, but wide-ranging, behind-the-scenes work that has nearly all gone Biden's way.\n\nIt was equal parts an inside- and outside-the-Beltway effort by the White House, aided by congressional Democrats involved early, and often, on both the substance and politics of the proposal. Supporters were boosted by a continuous run of positive public polling -- which White House officials and congressional leaders made a point of regularly putting in front of their members -- all as they sought to capitalize on state and district-level officials and advocacy groups they knew would hold sway on Capitol Hill.\n\nThe effort to sell the proposal started early in the process with Biden's transition team regularly consulting with top Democratic lawmakers as they constructed their plan. Key elements, like the emergency expansion of the Child Tax Credit -- a potentially transformative plank of the plan -- came directly from legislation drafted by Democrats that held wide-ranging support in their congressional ranks. There was a recognition, multiple people directly involved said, that the cascading crises meant now was the moment to go big.\n\nBy the time Biden took office, his legislative affairs team -- made up of several former Capitol Hill hands who brought with them significant bipartisan credibility from their past staff work -- was already deeply engaged in the process.\n\nThat has carried on through the opening weeks of the administration. Since February 5, the team has met with House and Senate leadership multiple times a week, directly with 33 House members and held talks with more than 100 key congressional staffers.\n\nBiden's aides were also ever present as the dozen House committees moved through the process of considering each piece of the legislation, there for technical guidance, and on some of the thorniest issues like the qualification threshold for stimulus payments, even more than that, sources say.\n\nThe White House was bolstered by a pervasive posture from Democrats on Capitol Hill: that letting the new President down in his first legislative push was never an option. Even as Democrats have privately grumbled about certain aspects of the bill -- whether it be the overall scope, the eligibility for who receives stimulus checks or the rise in the minimum wage -- most members acknowledge they'll ultimately vote for it.\n\nEveryone is in the same place, one House Democratic lawmaker told CNN. There are things we want fixed, but we aren't aggressively opposed. It is the President's first major package, and there are a lot of people who feel like this is his first ask, so for all those factors people are not aggressively threatening not to vote for it.\n\nOn top of that, multiple senators and aides point to polling showing the bill with overwhelming popularity even among some Republican voters. They also argue the onslaught of local support from mayors, governors and county governments has made it hard for Republicans to effectively message against it at home.\n\nDemocratic senators meet with President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris to discuss his $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan in the Oval Office at the White House on February 3.\n\nThe GOP opposition\n\nIn the Senate, Republican leaders are expected to make the case that the process of writing the bill has been flawed. While the bill went through House committees, it's expected to go straight to the floor in the Senate.\n\nWe understand that, instead of building Senate bills through regular-order deliberation, the Democratic majority instead intends to bypass their own committees and bring the House bills straight onto the Senate calendar and the floor. This would make Senate Democrats' first legislative act of the 117th Congress the outsourcing of their own committee gavels to the House, a group of Republican senators wrote to Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and Minority Leader Mitch McConnell.\n\nIn the House, GOP leadership has urged their conference to vote no on the package, pointing out a series of issues with abortion-related language and the bill's overall effect on the federal deficit.\n\nBut Democrats argue it's easy to defend themselves on legislation that gives people direct checks, access to paid leave, an extension of unemployment insurance and doesn't create new or controversial programs. Much of the bill is bolstering or a continuation of programs that many Republicans already voted for.\n\nSeveral Democratic sources pointed out that there has been no significant opposition effort mounted to the plan -- no big outside spending to attack the plan, no unified push by GOP campaign or advocacy groups to puncture the growing bubble of momentum.\n\nIt stands in sharp contrast to the multi-group, multi-million dollar efforts put together by Democrats as they sought to sink former President Donald Trump's top legislative priority -- the repeal and replacement of Obamacare in 2017.\n\nMultiple GOP officials noted the difference in circumstances: while health care is a highly polarizing issue, poll after poll has made clear that relief for a country struggling through dual economic and public health crises simply isn't.\n\nIt's not like we're looking around and saying, 'Hey, you know what would be a great idea? Attacking stimulus checks to people,'  one senior GOP official told CNN.\n\nRepublicans will oppose the bill for a series of reasons, from the topline cost on down, but the combination of a party still finding its way in the wake of Trump's loss, along with a series of proposals that have maintained popularity, has stunted the force of the opposition, the official said.\n\nThe fact Trump himself was the genesis for the $1,400 direct payments included in the Democratic proposal is also not lost on Republicans, multiple officials said.\n\nGOP Sens. Susan Collins and Mitt Romney lead a group of 10 fellow Republican senators out of the West Wing after meeting with President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris at the White House earlier this month.\n\nThe outside game\n\nAs Washington was inundated with the impeachment trial of Biden's predecessor, the White House took pains to make clear they both weren't involved and weren't paying attention. It wasn't entirely true -- Biden was kept abreast of the trial and took to watching highlights each night, two sources said.\n\nBut what was true was the blitz Biden's team was deploying outside of the Beltway.\n\nThere were 70 local television appearances by senior administration officials and surrogates during a three-week period. An Oval Office meeting between Biden and a bipartisan group of governors and mayors garnered major local coverage.\n\nThe White House Office of Intergovernmental Affairs held a series of briefings with hundreds of state, local and tribal officials.\n\nAll of that has contributed to a firm sense inside the White House that the politics are firmly in their favor, several aides made clear. And not just that supporters would be rewarded politically, but that those who opposed it -- congressional Republicans -- would take a hit.\n\nIn a memo to senior White House staff detailing several recent public polls, Mike Donilon, one of Biden's closest advisers, said of the opposition: Rather than being cost free, this approach has been quite damaging to them.\n\nVoters are hurting -- and they're looking for leadership that comes forward with plans and solutions, Donilon wrote in the February 16 memo obtained by CNN. This is not a moment in the country when obstructionism will be rewarded.\n\nIt's a position with which Republicans disagree. There has been little hesitation from even moderate Republicans to reject Biden's plan, and the unbending nature of the White House's posture has led many GOP senators to question whether Biden was ever serious about bipartisanship to begin with.\n\nWhite House officials say he is, and will continue to be, on the lookout for opportunities to negotiate with Republicans. But they see little sign that moving without Republicans on their first legislation out of the gate will somehow poison future negotiations.\n\nThe hurdles ahead\n\nIn order to build consensus quickly, aides and members say that a decision was made early to write a bill that tracked very closely with Biden's own American Rescue Plan. The thinking from the start was that beginning from the ground up in committees could take too much time and potentially result in unnecessary Democratic infighting in a moment when unity was paramount.\n\nStill, Democratic leadership has worked closely with members in an effort to try and build a coalition of support. Schumer has been having one-on-one conversations with individual members, trying to do the work ahead of time on what they need to support the bill.\n\nThe benefit is Chuck's leadership style is through that flip phone. Chuck is constantly in informal conversations with members, which makes moving a package like this a lot easier, said one Democratic senator who spoke on background to discuss the ongoing caucus discussions about the Covid relief bill.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer in the Capitol.\n\nSuccess still isn't guaranteed. A handful of moderate members have made it clear privately and in public statements that they can't support legislation that includes raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour, and Schumer will need every single one of his members to back the bill in order to pass it.\n\nThere are not 50 votes signed on the dotted line, the Democratic senator told CNN on the state of talks right now. I have still got changes to this package that I want.\n\nThe expectation among many Democratic aides and members is that the $15 minimum wage, which is currently the biggest obstacle to getting the bill across the finish line, won't be allowed under the guardrails of reconciliation, a budget process that requires each provision to adhere to a strict set of rules but that could ultimately allow Democrats to pass the legislation on a party-line vote.\n\nMy question is why are we including it and burning up time and promising people they will get a $15 minimum wage increase when we know it is not going to happen, one Democratic member told CNN.\n\nIf the Senate's parliamentarian allows the provision to remain in the bill, it could force leadership to have to make tough political decisions about whether now is the time for that intra-party fight.\n\nThe perils of the high-wire act of relying solely on Democrats in the Senate was put on display Friday, when Sen. Joe Manchin, a West Virginia Democrat, announced he would oppose Biden's pick to lead the Office of Management and Budget, Neera Tanden. If Tanden is unable to secure Republican support -- something Democrats have been exceedingly skeptical of up to this point -- Manchin's no vote would effectively kill the nomination.\n\nIt's a dynamic the White House is keenly aware of -- Biden and his team have stayed in close contact with Manchin and his aides in recent weeks.\n\nThe dashed hopes of bipartisanship\n\nAt various points, the biggest threat to Democratic unity was the desire among some members to fight for bipartisanship. Many rank-and-file members sought to hold onto the idea that there was a middle ground, potentially willing to reshape the ultimate direction of the bill. Biden himself had made clear before he took office that, as a 36-year veteran of the Senate, he would seek bipartisan consensus.\n\nThey were encouraged by the President's own outreach directly to Republicans and a high-profile Oval Office meeting where Biden invited 10 Republicans to discuss their own ideas directly with him.\n\nA group of moderate Senate Democrats met frequently with Republican counterparts to try and find a bipartisan compromise, holding out hope in happy hour settings, phone calls and zooms that the relief bill could be crafted in a way to attract GOP support like the previous pandemic relief bills.\n\nBut after a group of Senate Republicans came out with a roughly $600 billion proposal that didn't include any direct state and local funding, many Democratic senators immediately torpedoed the proposal, forcing even the moderates to evaluate how hard they ultimately were willing to push for bipartisanship or wait for it, and whether there was too much of a risk of losing votes on the progressive side of the caucus.\n\nAt the same time, the message directly from Biden was clear: bipartisanship would be ideal, but it wasn't a necessity, particularly given the bill's perceived popularity outside of Washington.\n\nStill, a bipartisan group of House members took longer to convince. The Problem Solver's Caucus -- a bipartisan group -- and the Blue Dog Coalition -- a group of moderate and conservative Democrats -- pushed separately behind the scenes for leadership and the White House to separate out vaccine funding from the larger coronavirus package as a way to move the funding faster and to provide a way for at least part of the relief bill to be bipartisan.\n\nOther moderate Democrats agreed. The argument was that the White House could move the package in two steps. But in conversations with Biden's team, including chief of staff Ron Klain, the reality of the situation began to come into focus. Separating out the bills could take time and potentially take the pressure off Republicans to back the larger package altogether.\n\nDemocratic leaders and the White House made it clear: the package was going to stay together and so did Democrats.

Ted Cruz (R-TX) speaks with the media before participating in a taping of Fox News Channel's The Sean Hannity Show at the Indiana War Memorial on April 29, 2016 in Indianapolis, Indiana.\n\nStory highlights Cruz needs a strong showing in Indiana on Tuesday The spots are virtually identical\n\n(CNN) —\n\nThree days before Indiana's critical primary, Ted Cruz's campaign on Saturday released two ads linking Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, saying they're two sides of the same coin.\n\nThe ads seek to compare Trump's positions on taxes, Obamacare, firearm bans and North Carolina's law banning transgender people from using bathrooms that differ from their biological sex. The spots are virtually identical, with one referring to gun control and taxes and the other mentioning Planned Parenthood and Obamacare.\n\nDonald Trump and Hillary Clinton are two sides of the same coin. Both support raising taxes. Both supported Bill Clinton's nationwide ban on popular firearms. And both support letting transgender men go in little girls' bathrooms, a narrator says in an ad called Same.\n\nIn the second ad, entitled Coin, the narrator says, Both support the Obamacare individual mandate. Both support taxpayer funding for Planned Parenthood. And both support letting transgender men go in little girls' bathrooms, he said.\n\nRELATED: What you need to know about Indiana politics\n\nThey use the bathroom that they feel is appropriate, Trump is quoted as saying in the ad.\n\nBoth ads conclude: Trump and Hillary: Do we really want two big government liberals on the ballot in November?\n\nCruz can no longer mathematically capture the 1,237 delegates necessary to clinch the Republican nomination ahead of the party's convention in July. But he hopes a strong showing in the Hoosier State on Tuesday could help block Trump's ability to gain the necessary delegates and force the party into a contested convention.
But first, the bill has to go back to the other side of the Capitol, where the House -- which already passed its own version of the bill -- is scheduled to vote Tuesday to approve the changes made in the Senate. That vote is expected to succeed on a party line, as it did in the Senate, with a narrow Democratic majority.\n\nOnly after the House passes the Senate version would it land on Biden's desk.\n\nAfter that, the turnaround time -- between it being a more than 600-page bill and money in people's pockets -- could be relatively quick. People could start seeing the $1,400 stimulus payments hit their bank accounts within days of Biden signing the bill -- which is expected to happen soon after the House votes on Tuesday.\n\nFor the previous pandemic stimulus bill, the Internal Revenue Service started sending out the second round of payments -- that were worth up to $600 -- three days after then-President Donald Trump signed that billn late December. But it's possible that tax filing season , which is currently underway, could slow down the process this time.\n\nThe payments do not go all out at once. Those whose bank information is on file with the IRS would likely get the money first because it would be directly deposited into their accounts. Others may receive paper checks or prepaid debit cards in the mail.\n\nStill, millions of people could be at risk of missing out because the IRS does not know how to reach them. An estimated 8 million eligible people did not get the first stimulus payment, worth up to $1,200, which was approved last year and delivered over the spring and summer. While most people received the money automatically, very low-income people who don't normally file tax returns may have to take an extra step to register online or file a 2020 tax return.\n\nThis time, individuals earning less than $75,000 and couples earning less than $150,000 would receive the full $1,400 payment, plus an additional $1,400 per dependent. But the third round of checks would phase out faster than earlier payments -- completely cutting off individuals who earn more than $80,000 a year and married couples earning more than $160,000, regardless of how many children they have. Payments would reach about 90% of families, according to an estimate from the Penn Wharton Budget Model.\n\nUnemployment benefits\n\nAs for unemployment benefits, the Senate and House bills differ on the provisions.\n\nIf the House approves the Senate's changes and the bill is signed by Biden in coming days, the jobless may see little or no break in payments. But it depends on their state.\n\nThe Senate bill would continue the existing $300 weekly federal boost and two key pandemic unemployment programs through September 6. The House bill would provide a $400 weekly enhancement and continue it and the two pandemic programs through August 29.\n\nThe Pandemic Unemployment Assistance program provides benefits to freelancers, gig workers, independent contractors and certain people affected by the pandemic, while the Pandemic Emergency Unemployment Compensation program increases the duration of payments for those in the traditional state unemployment system.\n\nUnlike the relief package Congress approved in December, this legislation should be signed before any laid-off workers run out of benefits, and there are far fewer changes than in the prior bill, said Andrew Stettner, senior fellow at The Century Foundation. Still, some states will wait until the US Department of Labor releases all the necessary guidance to reprogram their systems.\n\nMost states should start sending out the jobless benefits in less than three weeks, he said.\n\nan estimated 11.4 million would begin to see their benefits Without an extension of the programs,an estimated 11.4 million would begin to see their benefits start to lapse after next weekend and phase out over the next month, according to The Century Foundation. The $300 enhancement is also set to end next weekend.\n\nWhen Congress passed the last relief bill extending the unemployment programs, some of the jobless had already started exhausting their pandemic benefits, which were created last March.\n\nAlso, lawmakers added the $300 weekly enhancement and made changes to the pandemic programs. And Trump waited to sign the bill until after benefits had lapsed for millions more out-of-work Americans.\n\nSome states were able to enact the new provisions swiftly, but others took more than a month. The delays left the unemployed waiting for $17.6 billion in benefits in January, according to a separate analysis by The Century Foundation.\n\nChild tax credit\n\nOther measures in the package, however, are new or involve larger changes to existing programs — including temporary enhancements to the child tax credit and federal premium subsidies for Affordable Care Act plans, as well as for COBRA policies for laid-off workers who want to keep their employer health insurance coverage.\n\nThese would take longer for federal agencies to implement so it could be several weeks, or even months, before Americans receive them.\n\nFor instance, families may not see the boost in the child tax credit until the summer.\n\nThe House and Senate bills call for increasing the credit to $3,600 for each child younger than 6 and to $3,000 for each child between 6 and 17 in 2021. It is currently a $2,000 credit for kids between the ages of 6 and 16.\n\nThe credit would also become fully refundable for the year and may be paid out monthly, rather than as a lump sum at tax time.\n\nFamilies could receive half their total credit as a periodic payment starting in July and running through the rest of the year, according to the legislation. They could then claim the remaining half on their 2021 tax returns.\n\nHealth insurance subsidies\n\nAmericans who would qualify for the relief package's heftier federal premium subsidies for Affordable Care Act policies would need to wait until the new regulations are programmed into the Obamacare exchanges, which might take a few weeks.\n\nEnrollees would pay no more than 8.5% of their income towards coverage, down from nearly 10% now. Also, those earning more than the current cap of 400% of the federal poverty level -- about $51,000 for an individual and $104,800 for a family of four in 2021 -- would become eligible for help. The provision, which is retroactive to January, would last for two years.\n\nLower-income enrollees could have their premiums eliminated completely for the same period, and those collecting unemployment benefits could sign up for coverage with no premiums in 2021.\n\nThe adjustments to the existing subsidy programs could be done rather quickly, but the provision for the unemployed may take longer to implement since it is new, said Larry Levitt, executive vice president for health policy at the Kaiser Family Foundation.\n\nOnce the systems are updated, those who already have Affordable Care Act policies could return to the exchange to see if they now qualify for assistance or larger subsidies. Also, the uninsured have until May 15 to enroll in 2021 coverage on the federal exchange, Healthcare.gov, and have extended sign-up periods in most states that run their own marketplaces. Biden directed the reopening of the federal exchange through an executive order in late January.\n\nAlso, the Senate legislation provides a full premium subsidy through the end of September to laid-off workers who want to remain on their employer health insurance plans through COBRA. The House bill would require them to pay 15% of the premium, which could still prove costly.\n\nThis provision could take longer to roll out since it's an entirely new benefit.\n\nMeanwhile, food stamp recipients would continue to get a 15% increase in benefits, but the boost would last through September, instead of expiring at the end of June, under the bills passed by both the Senate and House.
New failures are piling up among the member-run health insurance co-ops carrying out one of Obamacare's most idealistic goals, leaving just seven remaining when the health law's fourth enrollment season starts in the fall.\n\nThere were 23 in 2014.\n\nThe public knows them as co-ops. They're officially called consumer operated and oriented plans in the health law. Eleven are still in business, but four in Oregon, Ohio, Connecticut and Illinois will disappear by fall due to financial insolvency. Oregon's Health Co-Op and Connecticut's HealthyCT were told to close by their state's regulators last week. Tuesday, the Land of Lincoln Mutual Health Insurance Co. in Illinois was ordered to close by state regulators.\n\nFor the rest — which all posted annual losses in 2015, according to the National Alliance of State Health Co-Ops — survival is job No. 1. Some are diversifying to serve larger employers, no longer limiting themselves to their ACA mandate to offer health plans to individuals and small businesses. A Maryland co-op has sued the federal government to avoid paying millions of dollars to other insurers under the ACA's complex formula to keep premiums stable by balancing risks among insurers and helping ailing ones. Other co-ops are trying to renegotiate contracts with hospitals and other providers.\n\nA year ago, when more than 20 co-ops were up and running, about 1 million Americans were insured through these plans. By contrast, the alliance says the seven co-ops that will remain in 2017 have about 350,000 members. Their supporters continue to tout them for cost-effective coverage, pointing to sources such as a recent report by the Government Accountability Office that found co-ops' average monthly premiums in 2015 were below the averages for other plans in most areas.\n\nThey are not essential for the success of the Affordable Care Act, but they do offer an important alternative to commercial insurers, said Timothy Jost, a law professor at Washington and Lee University in Virginia and an expert on the health law.\n\nRelated: Health care spending expected to climb as America ages\n\nOperated as nonprofits and seeded with federal loans, co-ops were conceived as an alternative to commercial insurance. Co-ops' members serve on the board. Advocates envisioned co-ops spurring competition by giving Americans a way to buy health insurance from companies with a strong consumer focus.\n\nBut many struggled early — and their problems became part of the highly politicized debate over the law on Capitol Hill. Either they increased enrollments too fast, and then could not keep up with rising health costs, or they could not gain enough members to help spread their costs.\n\nShortfalls in anticipated levels of federal funding contributed, too. At the end of 2014, for example, insurers got blindsided when money they had counted on to offset losses was cut sharply from the Obamacare's risk corridor program. That program transfers funds from participating insurers with high profits to those with high losses. The move disproportionately hurt small insurers, according to the nonpartisan Commonwealth Fund.\n\nRelated: Obama calls for 'public option' for Obamacare\n\nFor the 2017 enrollment season, most co-ops have proposed increasing premiums, often by at least 10%. But raising premiums is only part of the solution.\n\nMaine's co-op, Maine Community Health Options, has contracted with a new pharmacy benefit manager, Express Scripts, with the aim of saving about $14 million annually by paying lower drug prices.\n\nIt has 80,000 members, about 60% of the Obamacare marketplace in the state. But the co-op estimated it has less than 5% of the market when large employers are included, a group it now will court for new customers.\n\nMaine Community Health is on track to make money, but not until 2017, said CEO Kevin Lewis.\n\nRelated: UnitedHealth to exit California's Obamacare market\n\nNew Mexico Health Connections, a co-op with 47,000 members, is seeking to raise money from investors, which the Obama administration only recently allowed co-ops to do, said the CEO, Dr. Martin Hickey. It's also adding larger employers and labor groups, including some teacher unions, to its client base.\n\nThe only way to survive is to diversify, Hickey said.\n\nMontana Health Co-Op, which has about 35,000 members in Idaho and Montana, is focused on holding down administrative costs. It has about 20 full-time employees and hasn't replaced some that left. Some people we had during our startup mode we figured we can now work without them, said spokeswoman Karen Early.\n\nMontana Health, which lost about $40 million in 2015, also has requested an average premium increase of 21% in Idaho for next year and 22% in Montana, she said.\n\nMaryland's co-op, Evergreen Health, is challenging the federal government's decision last week ordering it to pay $24 million to other state insurers whose members had higher health risks in 2015.\n\nIn addition to the health law's risk corridor program, which partially reimburses insurers for extreme losses, another provision requires insurers to make payments to competitors with sicker and costlier members. That is a sore point for Evergreen. The co-op, which has about 40,000 members, sued the government in June, alleging that the risk-adjustment system is flawed because it does not adequately measure risk. The lawsuit is pending in federal court and a decision is expected this summer.\n\nThis story was produced by Kaiser Health News, which publishes California Healthline, a service of the California Health Care Foundation.

John McCain are stupid and socially unnatural, Anthony Scaramucci said Thursday.\n\nHe's hitting something that is socially unnatural. And so what is that? You're attacking somebody that died seven months ago, Scaramucci told CNN's John Berman on New Day. Now, I understand the point and I understand the grievance that the President's bringing up, but you're not scoring any points with anybody.\n\nI think it's stupid. I'm being very declarative here. I think it's stupid, Scaramucci, whose short-lived tenure as White House communications director imploded due to his combative personality, said later. There's no strategy that you can tell – other than the fact that you're frustrated and you want to ventilate your frustrations into the international airwaves. OK. But I think it's stupid.\n\nOver the weekend, Trump revived his long-running feud against McCain – who died in August after a long battle with brain cancer – citing his ties to the controversial Russia dossier and his vote against repealing Obamacare. He said in the Oval Office on Tuesday that he was never a fan of John McCain and I never will be and complained on Wednesday that he wasn't thanked for giving McCain the kind of funeral that he wanted.\n\nScaramucci told Berman that he always got along with McCain, adding that he was a decorated Vietnam War veteran.\n\nThe President has the support of millions of veterans in the United States.

Wade should not be overturned. Just 29% want to see the decision reversed.\n\nThe poll matches other previous polls on the topic. The exact same percentage of voters (67%) said they agreed with the decision reached in Roe in a 2017 Quinnipiac University poll.\n\nWhat's the big idea: Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy announced his retirement this week. Many believe this vacancy will allow President Donald Trump to appoint a justice who is against Roe and could be part of a majority to overturn it.\n\nIt's possible that the only thing that will stop the Court from reversing the decision is public opinion polls that show Roe v. Wade is well-liked.\n\nThe Supreme Court in theory is immune from the majority will. Justices have lifetime appointments.\n\nYet, there is a body of academic literature to suggest that the court does respond to public opinion. That is, the court is directly influenced by the public.\n\nAs Harvard Law School Professor Michael Klarman has noted, many of the larger social changes inflicted by the court only occurred when public opinion on the issue changed. He points to Brown v. Board of Education coming after the desegregation of the military, civil service and baseball. Polling at the time indicated that a majority of Americans were for the decision. When it came to same-sex marriage, the Supreme Court only legalized it when public opinion shifted in its favor.\n\nPut another way, the court doesn't lead as much as it follows.\n\nWhen the court tries to get ahead of public opinion, it can inflict a major backlash. The most noticeable example is when the court outlawed the death penalty in 1972. Although the public's favoring of the death penalty was dropping at the time of the decision, more Americans were for it than against it. After the decision, support for the death penalty climbed by about 15 points and states passed measures challenging the court's decision.\n\nThe Supreme Court eventually reversed its own decision and reinstated the death penalty.\n\nToday, Roe is supported by a majority of the public as it was in a Louis Harris & Associates poll in 1973 after the decision was first reached. And although the question wording used by Harris was slightly different than that used by Kaiser, support for the decision seems to have risen a little bit.\n\nBut even on the issue of abortion, it could be argued that the court energized the anti-abortion groups and polarized the issue across partisan lines. That was the argument that none other Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg has offered. She noted back in 2013 that her criticism of Roe is that it seemed to have stopped the momentum on the side of change.\n\nIndeed, abortion wasn't a lightning rod issue during the presidential campaign (1972) before Roe was decided. As Ken Rudin points out, it only became a core issue for the Republican Party starting in 1974 and especially after the 1976 presidential campaign.\n\nNow, it's difficult being an elected Republican without being anti-abortion.\n\nA new conservative court could follow the party line when it comes to abortion. On the other hand, they will be aware of the public backlash that would follow. Facing a potentially similar backlash in 2012, Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts, who many have said might turn into the new swing justice in Kennedy's absence, went against his conservative tendencies when deciding the fate of the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare). In arguably the biggest case before the court this decade, Roberts chose to uphold it.\n\nI'm not arguing here that public opinion will definitely sway the justices. It may not. But given the coming ideological makeup of the court, public pressure might be one of the only barriers standing in the way of the of the court overturning Roe.

John McCain.\n\nListen, he spends his weekend obsessing over great men because he knows it, and I know it, and all of you know it: he will never be a great man, McCain said on ABC's The View, where she is a co-host.\n\nMy father was his kryptonite in life, he was his kryptonite in death. On a personal level, I agree with you, all of us have love and families, and when my father was alive, up until adulthood, we would spend our time together cooking, hiking, fishing, really celebrating life, and I think it's because he almost died, she said.

He also referred to McCain as being last in his class at the US Naval Academy.\n\nIn response to Trump's tweets, Meghan McCain tweeted that No one will ever love you the way they loved my father, adding that the President should be spending time with his own family instead of obsessing over mine.\n\nOn Monday, McCain said she genuinely feel(s) bad for (the Trump) family and that she can't imagine having a father who does this on the weekends.\n\nMonday wasn't the first time McCain offered a strong rebuke of the President's character.\n\nSpeaking at her father's funeral last year, McCain, who didn't mention Trump by name, made several unmistakable and pointed references to him throughout her emotional remarks.\n\nWe gather here to mourn the passing of American greatness, the real thing, not cheap rhetoric from men who will never come near the sacrifice he gave so willingly, nor the opportunistic appropriation of those who live lives of comfort and privilege while he suffered and served, McCain said at the time.\n\nShe later added, We live in an era where we knock down old American heroes for all their imperfections when no leader wants to admit to fault or failure.\n\nCNN's Veronica Stracqualursi contributed to this report.
(CNN) The Biden administration told the Supreme Court on Wednesday that it should uphold the Affordable Care Act, reversing the position of the Trump administration that had urged the justices to strike down the entire law amid the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nFollowing the change in Administration, the Department of Justice has reconsidered the government's position, Deputy Solicitor General Edwin Kneedler told the court in a letter Wednesday. The United States no longer adheres to the conclusions in a brief filed by the Trump administration.\n\nKneedler said the federal government now maintains that the law's individual mandate is constitutional, but even if the court disagrees, it should sever the mandate and allow the rest of the sprawling law to stand. Such a move would maintain the status quo, as the penalty associated with the mandate has been brought down to zero.\n\nThe case was argued on November 10 and is currently before the justices, with a decision expected by July.\n\nRead More
(CNN) Adapted from  The Chief: The Life and Turbulent Times of Chief Justice John Roberts  by Joan Biskupic. Copyright © 2019. Available from Basic Books.\n\nChief Justice John Roberts arrived at the Valletta campus of the University of Malta on July 3, 2012, to teach a class on Supreme Court history. As he emerged from the back seat of a black sedan, he held his brown leather briefcase in front of him, almost as a shield. He wore a blue blazer, striped button-down shirt, and tan khakis. His clothes looked crisp, though his face was haggard. He was as exhausted and distressed as he had been in years.\n\nRoberts had left behind a storm in Washington over his opinion upholding President Barack Obama's health-care overhaul -- the Affordable Care Act -- a stunning validation of Obama's signature domestic achievement that transformed public perceptions of the chief justice.\n\nRepublicans in Congress had been fighting the law dubbed Obamacare at every turn for two years, and all the GOP presidential candidates in 2012 had vowed to repeal it. And now Roberts, a nominee of President George W. Bush, had saved it.\n\nGoing forward, the chief justice would be viewed with skepticism by conservatives, despite also having taken the lead on limiting racial remedies and voting rights, helping roll back campaign finance regulations and voting for stronger Second Amendment gun rights.\n\nRoberts' moves behind the scenes were as extraordinary as his ruling. He changed course multiple times. He was part of the majority of justices who initially voted in a private conference to strike down the individual insurance mandate -- the heart of the law -- but he also voted to uphold an expansion of Medicaid for people near the poverty line.\n\nTwo months later, Roberts had shifted on both.\n\nThe ACA, signed by Obama in 2010, followed decades of failed attempts in Washington to control spiraling medical costs and provide Americans with higher-quality health care. It created a marketplace where the uninsured could buy coverage and protected people from being unable to get health insurance because of pre-existing conditions such as diabetes, cancer and other chronic illnesses. To support the system and draw in the healthy as well as the sick, the law required that most uninsured people obtain coverage (the individual mandate) or pay a penalty, to be collected as part of an individual's annual taxes -- a provision critical to the final ruling.\n\nThe law also expanded Medicaid benefits to a wider range of needy individuals. The money for about 90% of that expansion would come from the federal government. But it would come with a strict condition: If states did not broaden their programs as dictated they would lose all Medicaid funds.\n\nThe first meeting -- 5-4 against the mandate\n\nAfter an unusual three full days of oral arguments in late March 2012 (a typical case gets one hour on one day), the nine justices gathered in a private conference room off the chief's chambers to cast initial votes. They were alone, with no law clerks or administrative staff.\n\nThe discussion focused on the individual insurance mandate and Congress' power to regulate commerce. Roberts went first, as was the custom, laying out his views. He emphasized that he believed the Constitution's commerce clause never was intended to cover inactivity, such as the refusal to buy insurance.\n\nAfter the chief, conservative Justices Antonin Scalia, Anthony Kennedy and Clarence Thomas offered their views. Like Roberts, they thought Congress' commerce authority did not cover an individual's decision to forgo -- rather than obtain -- health insurance. There were thus four immediate votes cast to invalidate the mandate. No one at the table was surprised, based on the questions during oral arguments and word from law clerks inside the building circulating intelligence among the justices' chambers.\n\nPhotos: Chief Justice John Roberts Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts listens to President Donald Trump's State of the Union address in January 2018.

Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, fifth in seniority, was the first to cast a vote to uphold the individual mandate. She believed Supreme Court precedent demanded the law be found constitutional. She was followed by Justice Stephen Breyer, who agreed with her. Next in seniority was conservative Samuel Alito, who cast the fifth and final vote to strike down the law. The eighth and ninth justices at the table, liberals Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan, joined Ginsburg and Breyer in voting for the law as part of Congress' power to regulate interstate commerce.\n\nThere was no sign on March 30, 2012, that any of the nine would defy the usual ideological and partisan alignment. That political division bothered Roberts, but he felt just as strongly about boundaries on the commerce power as the other four in the majority did.\n\nRegarding Medicaid, all four liberals voted to uphold the program, and Roberts joined them. At the same time, he expressed some tentativeness.\n\nNo vote had been taken related to congressional taxing power. It did not seem to matter, because the individual mandate was going to be struck down. The only uncertainty was whether any of Obamacare would survive.\n\nRoberts did not want the entire law to fall. A pro-business conservative, he understood the importance of the insurance industry to US businesses, and he was genuinely concerned about invalidating an entire law that had been approved through the democratic process to solve the intractable health care problem.\n\nBut his four fellow conservatives believed that if the individual mandate was going down, it should take the whole law with it. They believed all the pieces were interlocked. Roberts thought the individual mandate was entwined with only two other provisions, those known as the community rating and guaranteed issue. The community-rating section prevented insurers from charging some individuals higher premiums than others based on health status. The guaranteed-issue section required insurers to cover people regardless of pre-existing conditions.\n\nAs was his prerogative as chief justice, Roberts chose to write the majority opinion, giving him the ability to shape what the court would ultimately say. Senior liberal justice Ginsburg was ready to write for the dissenting foursome.\n\nSoon after, Roberts began trying to persuade Kennedy to find that the unconstitutional insurance requirement could be severed from the rest of the law. But Kennedy -- often a swing vote on high-profile cases -- was firm in his position. He was puzzled, and then put off, by Roberts' view that the ACA provisions could be severed.\n\nThe deal is struck\n\nLater in April, Roberts tried another path. He began exploring whether, as the Obama administration had argued, the individual mandate could be upheld as a tax. (CBS's Jan Crawford reported earlier on Roberts' reversal on the mandate, but the full story of Roberts' switch, including on Medicaid expansion, and the changed votes of two liberal justices is detailed now for the first time.)\n\nThe chief justice then turned to Breyer and Kagan, the liberals most likely to work with him on contentious issues, to see if they could find common ground.\n\nAt the same time, Roberts began incorporating arguments that would invalidate the Medicaid expansion. This was a strange turn. None of the lower courts that had taken up the ACA had rejected the Medicaid expansion, and it wasn't seen as controversial in terms of constitutional debate and public controversy.\n\nRoberts posited in a draft opinion that Congress had in effect held a gun to the head of the states by conditioning all Medicaid money on the expanded coverage. Yet he was not prepared to find that the expansion had to be scrapped altogether, only that states could not be forced to join through the leverage of losing all Medicaid funding.\n\nBreyer and Kagan had voted in the private March conference to uphold the new Medicaid requirement, and their votes had been unequivocal. But they were pragmatists. If there was a chance that Roberts would cast the critical vote to uphold the central plank of Obamacare -- and negotiations in May were such that they still considered that a shaky proposition -- they were willing to meet him partway.\n\nWhen Ginsburg found out about Roberts' new position, her first thought was, It ain't over till it's over. She understood that the process could continue to be fluid, especially in such a monumental case.\n\nPeople change their minds about what they thought. So it isn't at all something extraordinary, and that's how it should work. We're in the process of trying to persuade each other and then the public, she told me in a 2012 interview in her chambers.\n\nAt the time, Ginsburg knew that Roberts was not deviating from his view of limited commerce clause power, and she wanted to make her dissent as persuasive as possible.\n\nI was forcing myself to stay awake and work on the opinion, Ginsburg said.\n\nAnother complication for Ginsburg was that in late spring she had fallen on the marble floor of her bathroom and cracked several ribs. There was nothing to be done except to work through the pain.\n\nScalia and the other conservatives were livid at the development. Scalia believed the taxing-power possibility had never truly been discussed in court, calling it a fly-by-night briefing. Kennedy thought Roberts had presented his interpretation as judicial modesty, when it amounted instead to a vast judicial overreaching.\n\nJUST WATCHED Trump fires back after Roberts rebukes him Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Trump fires back after Roberts rebukes him 02:57\n\nThe announcement\n\nThe decision was revealed on June 28, the last courtroom sitting of the 2011-12 session. As Roberts began reading his opinion from the bench, he tried to speak steadily, but he was nervous. About 13 minutes into the 20-minute announcement, after he had summarized various legal rationales, he misstated the overall judgment. Few noticed the slip because he had already laid out the reasoning.\n\nAs Roberts spoke, he occasionally looked out at the spectators. Among them was retired Justice John Paul Stevens, who later said he thought the chief had shown integrity.\n\nHe had to be thinking he did the right thing, Stevens said in a 2016 interview in his chambers, because he certainly made himself very unpopular with the conservatives.\n\nPerhaps Roberts' move was born of a concern for the business of health care. Perhaps he had worries about his own legitimacy and legacy, intertwined with concerns about the legitimacy and legacy of the court. Perhaps his change of heart really arose from a sudden new understanding of congressional taxing power. However the chief would explain it -- and he has not explained it beyond his written opinion -- the case added a new dimension to a man who insisted that he always decided cases based on the law.\n\nViewed only through a judicial lens, his moves were not consistent, and his legal arguments were not entirely coherent. But he brought people and their different interests together. His moves may have been good for the country at a time of division and a real crisis in health care, even as they engendered, in the years since, anger, confusion and distrust.\n\nCriticism on the right -- from insiders and outsiders -- was swift, including from the Wall Street Journal editorial page, which described the decision as shot through with confusion.\n\nDonald Trump, three years from launching his presidential run, went right to Twitter: Wow, the Supreme Court passed @ObamaCare. I guess Justice Roberts wanted to be part of Georgetown society more than anyone knew.\n\nTrump later added: John Roberts arrived in Malta yesterday. Maybe we will get lucky and he will stay there.\n\nWow, the Supreme Court passed @ObamaCare. I guess @JusticeRoberts wanted to be a part of Georgetown society more than anyone knew. — Donald J.

Now, I understand the point and I understand the grievance that the President's bringing up, but you're not scoring any points with anybody.\n\nI think it's stupid. I'm being very declarative here. I think it's stupid, Scaramucci, whose short-lived tenure as White House communications director imploded due to his combative personality, said later. There's no strategy that you can tell – other than the fact that you're frustrated and you want to ventilate your frustrations into the international airwaves. OK.

President Obama joined the chorus of Democrats calling for the creation of a government run health insurance program as Obamacare is facing growing problems.\n\nIn an article published Monday in the Journal of the American Medical Association, the president called for Congress to revisit the public option for Obamacare in areas where few insurers offer coverage.\n\nSome parts of the country have struggled with limited insurance market competition for many years, which is one reason that, in the original debate over health reform, Congress considered and I supported including a Medicare-like public plan, Obama wrote in the piece.\n\nA public option would mean a government run health insurance plan.\n\nAdding a public plan in such areas would strengthen the marketplace approach, giving consumers more affordable options while also creating savings for the federal government, the president wrote.\n\nObama's call comes days after presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton voiced support for a public option, in a nod to supporters of Bernie Sanders, who wanted the federal government to take over providing health care coverage for all Americans.\n\nRelated: Hours before debate, Sanders releases Medicare-for-all plan\n\nSome Democrats have long wanted to develop a government-sponsored health plan that would insure Americans under the age of 65, but they have never succeeded.\n\nInstead, Obamacare funded the creation of non-profit co-op insurers to provide consumers with alternatives. But more than half of them have failed since their debut in 2014, undone mainly by enrollees' unexpectedly high medical use. Other insurers -- particularly UnitedHealthcare (UNH) -- have announced they are pulling out of Obamacare, further restricting consumers' choices.\n\nResidents in 664 counties, most of them rural, may only have one insurer to choose from in 2017, according to a Kaiser Family Foundation review. That's up from 225 counties this year. Obama notes that 12% of enrollees live in areas with only one or two insurers.\n\nThree years after Obamacare's exchanges opened for business, the program is facing challenges.\n\nMany insurers found enrollees have higher health care needs than expected, forcing them to hike rates. A recent Kaiser study found the benchmark silver plan premiums are projected to rise 10% for 2017, on average, for a 40-year-old consumer in 14 major cities. That's double the 5% increase for 2016 policies, but it could change since state regulators often reduce insurers' rate requests.\n\nRelated: Insurers want to hike Obamacare premiums 10% for 2017\n\nIn the JAMA article, Obama made several other recommendations for improving Obamacare. He called on the 19 states who have not expanded Medicaid to do so and on Congress to increase financial assistance to make Obamacare coverage more affordable. And he said Congress should help reduce the cost of prescription drugs by requiring drug makers to disclose their production and development costs, increasing the rebates manufacturers must give for drugs prescribed to certain Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries, and allowing the federal government to negotiate prices for certain high-cost medications.\n\nThe president hailed Obamacare for reducing the uninsured rate from 16% in 2010 to 9.1% in 2015 and providing more comprehensive coverage for millions of Americans. He also credited health reform for helping slow the growth rate of health care costs in recent years.

John McCain wanted, marking his latest grievance in his recent onslaught against the Arizona Republican.\n\nI endorsed him at his request, and I gave him the kind of funeral that he wanted, which as President I had to approve. I don't care about this. I didn't get thank you. That's OK. We sent him on the way. But I wasn't a fan of John McCain, Trump said during a speech Wednesday at a tank factory in Lima, Ohio.\n\nLast year, McCain died of brain cancer, and as part of his services, lay in state in the Capitol building in Washington.\n\nCNN previously reported that the senator, who had been held as a prisoner of war in Vietnam, did not want the President at his funeral. McCain's daughter, Meghan McCain, also revealed earlier this year that she wished Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner, Trump's daughter and son-in-law and senior advisers, had not attended the funeral.\n\nTrump's remark about the funeral came as the President has continued to denigrate the dead senator's legacy.\n\nLast weekend, Trump attacked McCain in several tweets that targeted his ties to the controversial Russia dossier and his vote against repealing Obamacare. He also referred to McCain as being last in his class at the US Naval Academy.\n\nOn Tuesday, he continued his criticism, telling reporters at the White House that I was never a fan of John McCain and I never will be.\n\nThe late senator's widow, Cindy McCain, publicized hateful messages she's been receiving since Trump's tweets, and daughter Meghan McCain has continued to respond to the President online and on ABC's The View, where she's a co-host.\n\nAll the while, a growing number Republican members of Congress have been publicly pushing back on Trump's comments, defending McCain.\n\nIn front of factory workers at the Ohio plant on Wednesday, Trump dedicated a considerable amount of time in his speech to disparaging McCain.\n\nI have to be honest, Trump said, I never liked him much. Hasn't been for me.\n\nHe said he probably never will like McCain, because John McCain received a fake and phony dossier.\n\nHe also dug into McCain's now-famous vote against a repeal of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nWhen he finally had the chance to do it, he voted against repeal and replace, the President said. Remember thumbs down?\n\nOn Tuesday, Trump falsely accused McCain of misleading the White House over how he would vote.\n\nTrump added Wednesday that veterans were on his side during the dispute, because McCain didn't get the job done with the Veterans Administration.\n\nHe also blamed McCain for wars in the Middle East.\n\nHe was calling (President George W.)

Get in to the Middle East,'  Trump claimed, adding we've lost tremendous health and tremendous lives in that war.\n\nCNN's Nikki Carvajal and Devan Cole contributed to this report.

I agreed subject to the fact that if we do not reach a fair deal for all, we will then terminate NAFTA.\n\nBut Trump's decision to swerve away from NAFTA withdrawal also signaled the extent to which Trump is running up against the realities of governing as he attempts to implement his bold campaign promises.\n\nAs Trump's senior staff in recent days mulled a potential executive order announcing the US' plans to withdraw from NAFTA, officials have had to consider tedious factors to ensure that they would maintain fast-track authority over a renegotiated deal and drafted several versions of a potential order to ensure it would pass muster. It's part of the reason the White House has yet to formally notify Congress of its plans to renegotiate the deal.\n\nTrump's decision not to withdraw from NAFTA came only after Trump consulted with members of his Cabinet as well as business and congressional leaders, a senior White House official said Thursday.\n\n02:04 - Source: CNN Zakaria on NAFTA: Trump's decision is stunning\n\nRealities\n\nThe realities of governing have hit Trump harder than most presidents.\n\nNot only is Trump the first president to have never served in government or the military, but he surged to the White House on far-flung campaign promises that even many in his own party dismissed as unrealistic.\n\nAnd the business of making those promises a reality, coupled with his lack of relevant Washington experience, has left Trump with few choices beyond sticking to his rhetorical guns while scrambling behind the scenes to find ways to convert those bold ideas into sound policy.\n\nTrump has continued to rail against Iran, decrying the nuclear deal brokered under the previous administration as one of the worst deals just as he did during the campaign and arguing most recently that Iran was not living up to the spirit of the agreement.\n\nBut even though the Trump administration put Iran on notice in the first weeks of Trump's presidency, there's been little follow-through.\n\n02:53 - Source: CNN Tillerson: Iran could follow North Korea path\n\nAbsent any evidence to the contrary, the State Department was forced to affirm last week that Iran is abiding by the terms of the nuclear deal. The Trump administration has shown no signs so far of any plans to renegotiate the deal as the Republican nominee pledged during the campaign.\n\nAnd while he has continued to decry the US trade deficit with China and recently tied widespread loss of manufacturing jobs to the Asian powerhouse, Trump has confronted the reality of the US's complicated and delicate relationship with China in the last month as he's sought to enlist China in efforts to tame an increasingly belligerent North Korea.\n\nWhy would I call China a currency manipulator when they are working with us on the North Korean problem? Trump tweeted earlier this month as he took flak for reneging on a major campaign promise.\n\nAnd beyond the diplomatic implications, Trump has also had to confront the reality that China long ago stopped artificially devaluing its currency – instead working to prop it up, which benefits US exports.\n\n02:30 - Source: CNN Parallels between Trump and Nixon?\n\nBruising start\n\nBut Trump and his White House did not come to learn the limitations of his presidency and the realities of governing until after the bruising first weeks of his presidency.\n\nWhite House officials' meticulous review of the language of a potential executive order on NAFTA followed the administration's early stumbles as it eagerly sought to implement another one of the Trump's biggest campaign promises: banning travel from Muslim-majority, terrorist-prone countries.\n\nThe initial salvo on that ban came within days of Trump's inauguration and with little consultation with government agencies that would typically be consulted. The result was chaos at airports worldwide and the detention of Muslims at US airports who had valid visas and even green cards to travel to and stay in the US.\n\nTrump has also struggled to make good on his core campaign promise of repealing and replacing Obamacare with something much better amid disagreements between warring factions of the Republican Party. And amid his quest to get a bill passed as soon as possible, Trump failed to help bridge those differences and was forced to accept a loss, canceling a scheduled vote on the House floor.\n\nTrump has sought to sidestep his difficulties on the legislative front with a slew of executive orders, but a person close to the White House acknowledged Wednesday that they were no substitute for legislation.\n\nThey let you take action, the person said of the orders. It doesn't take place of something statutory.\n\n02:14 - Source: CNN One moment from each of Trump's first days\n\nFight continues\n\nBut even as Trump is learning the lessons of governing and confronting the headwinds – diplomatic, economic and political – he faces as he tries to implement his hard-charging agenda, he is showing no signs of letting up.\n\nA person close to Trump vowed Trump will only ramp up his actions on trade – still searching to make good in bold fashion on Trump's campaign rhetoric.\n\nNAFTA as we know it today will change. It just is, the person close to the White House and Trump said. It's just not going to stay the way it is. It's going to be different.\n\nTrump displayed the same bravado on NAFTA Thursday morning as he did on the campaign trail, despite backing down on a potential NAFTA withdrawal just the night before.\n\nNAFTA has been a horrible deal for the United States. It's been very good for Canada, it's been very good for Mexico, but it's been horrible for the United States, Trump said Thursday from the Oval Office, as if he were still rallying supporters on the campaign trail.\n\nCNN's Jim Acosta and Jeff Zeleny contributed to this report.
El republicano agredió tanto a sus contrincantes como a uno de los asistentes en un acto en Nevada, de cara a las primarias de su partido el próximo martes. (Crédito: Getty Images)\n\n(CNN) — Donald Trump soltó una fuerte retórica contra sus rivales así como contra un manifestante que estaba en una congregación del lunes por la noche, en el crepúsculo antes de las asambleas electorales de Nevada.\n\n«Me gustaría darle un puñetazo en la cara», dijo Trump al hacer la observación de un hombre que creó problemas en su concentración y que fue acompañado hasta afuera con una sonrisa en su rostro. «Él está sonriendo, está pasando un buen rato».\n\nTrump afirmó que el manifestante era «desagradable como el infierno» y acusó al hombre de intentar pegarle a los agentes de seguridad que le forzaron a salir de la concentración, aunque no parecía que el hombre estuviera peleando contra esos agentes.\n\n«En los viejos tiempos», añadió Trump, los manifestantes eran «sacados en camillas».\n\n«Ya no se nos permite hacer retroceder más», dijo Trump.\n\npublicidad\n\nMientras que Trump en ocasiones ha instado a no lastimar a los manifestantes, también ha sugerido repetidamente que los manifestantes deberían ser manejados de manera más brusca.\n\nCuando un manifestante de Black Lives Matter fue golpeado y pateado por los asistentes en una manifestación de Trump en el otoño pasado, el día siguiente Trump observó que «quizás le deberían haber dado una paliza».\n\nPoco después de ese incidente, la campaña de Trump comenzó a hacer un anuncio al principio de sus manifestaciones mediante el que instaba a los partidarios a no lastimar a ningún manifestante, sino que en lugar de eso, gritaran: «Trump, Trump, Trump» y que esperaran que los agentes de seguridad acompañaran a los manifestantes hasta afuera.\n\nLa campaña de Trump no hizo el anuncio antes de la concentración del lunes. No estaba claro qué era lo que protestaba el hombre que causó la interrupción.\n\nMomentos antes, otro hombre levantó una pancarta que decía: «Los veteranos le dicen a Trump: termina ya tu discurso de odio contra los musulmanes».\n\nTrump contra Cruz: 'Algo está mal con este tipo'\n\nEl favorito del Partido Republicano también incrementó sus ataques contra el senador Ted Cruz, refiriéndose a su rival presidencial republicano como «enfermo».\n\nTrump apuntó contra las tácticas de campaña del senador Cruz, entre ellas los anuncios que Cruz y sus aliados han levantado contra Trump.\n\n«Este individuo está enfermo, hay algo mal con este tipo», dijo Trump.\n\nLa campaña de Cruz ha dirigido varios anuncios que examinan el historial de Trump en una variedad de temas importantes para los conservadores, entre ellos el apoyo de Trump hacia el derecho al aborto y las medidas más estrictas de control de armas.\n\n«¿Acaso me perdí la parte en la que Donald desafía nuestros hechos?», le dijo la portavoz de Cruz, Catherine Frazier, a CNN. «Él no puede, porque nuestros anuncios hablan la verdad… él no es un verdadero conservador. Él no puede defender su historial, así que como un niño frustrado, él recurre a los insultos».\n\nTrump ha criticado en repetidas ocasiones a Cruz ya que el senador de Texas subió en las encuestas antes de las asambleas electorales de Iowa y desde entonces ha incrementado sus ataques contra él puesto que Cruz venció a Trump en la contienda de Iowa.\n\nEl senador de Texas, por su parte, ha criticado a Trump en una gama de temas, desde cuando Trump apoyó el derecho al aborto en 1999 hasta el uso que Trump ha hecho de las leyes de dominio eminente para obtener beneficios personales. Él también ha sugerido que Trump, quien se ha comprometido a revocar el Obamacare, apoya esa ley distintiva del cuidado de la salud, pues apunta a la entrevista de Trump del mes de septiembre con «60 Minutes», en la cual Trump dijo: «todos tienen que ser cubiertos», cuando se le preguntó si apoyaba la atención de salud universal.\n\nTrump: '¿Qué diablos es una asamblea electoral? '\n\nLa concentración del lunes de Trump viene en la víspera de las asambleas electorales de Nevada, y Trump usó mucho tiempo de su discurso instando a sus partidarios para que se dirigieran a las asambleas electorales para darle lo que sería su tercera victoria consecutiva en las primarias del Partido Republicano.\n\n«Todos dicen que Trump va a ganar mañana. Solo suponemos que vamos a quedar empatados», le dijo Trump a sus partidarios el lunes por la noche.\n\nY Trump, quien ha criticado el proceso de las asambleas electorales desde que perdió frente a Cruz en Iowa, le dijo a sus partidarios que se olvidaran del proceso –un poco más arduo– de las asambleas electorales, el cual implica que los votantes se reúnan en una ubicación para la asamblea y que escuchen discursos para cada candidato antes de emitir su voto.\n\n«Olvídate del término asamblea electoral, solo ve y emite tu voto, ¿de acuerdo?», dijo Trump. «¿Qué diablos es una asamblea electoral? Nadie sabe siquiera lo que significa».\n\nBeck, partidario de Cruz, denuncia a Trump como un 'acosador'\n\nEn una concentración de Cruz, en Elko, el lunes más temprano, el partidario Glenn Beck condenó ese tipo de arranques de Trump… refiriéndose a él como un acosador y pidiéndole a los votantes de Nevada que rechacen ese tipo de retórica.\n\nBeck criticó a Trump por amenazar a los manifestantes en las concentraciones anteriores, y señaló que Trump emitió un tuit amenazante el lunes dirigido a la familia Ricketts, la cual ha sido activa en el área política en los ciclos recientes.\n\n«Escuché que la familia (Ricketts), que es la propietaria de los Chicago Cubs, en secreto está gastando dólares en mi contra. Ellos deberían tener cuidado porque tienen mucho que esconder», tuiteó Trump.\n\nI hear the Rickets family, who own the Chicago Cubs, are secretly spending $'s against me. They better be careful, they have a lot to hide! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 22, 2016\n\n«Cuando tenemos un candidato que amenaza a las personas», dijo Beck, «esto no es algo estadounidense, esta no es justicia igualitaria, esto no es lo que nosotros somos».\n\n«Si cedemos a nuestra ira, si empezamos a ir por ese camino y empezamos a escuchar a los acosadores, entonces perdemos lo que no hizo grandes», dijo Beck antes de presentar a Cruz.
(CNN) Sixty-one: That's the number of arrests Washington, DC, police made the day rioters laid siege to the Capitol in protest of President-elect Joe Biden's electoral victory.\n\nMore have been arrested since, and several jurisdictions are now involved in hunting down the supporters of President Donald Trump who invaded and ransacked the Capitol during a joint session of Congress to affirm Biden's win. Some are already facing federal charges\n\nYet during an episode described as insurrection and an attempted coup, police made only 61 unrest-related arrests that day -- and only about half of those were on Capitol grounds, Metropolitan Police Department Chief Robert Contee said last week.\n\nNumerous media outlets, including CNN , have provided comparisons between the arrests during Wednesday's siege and those made during the summer's Black Lives Matters protests in the capital.\n\nIt's valuable context, for sure, and raises important discussions about police and race, but a longer view shows the BLM protests were but one example where police in the nation's capital seemed ready to respond with the full force of the law.\n\nHere are some examples, by the numbers:\n\n133 LGBTQ activists, October 8, 2019\n\nLGBT protesters perform a sit-in outside the US Supreme Court.\n\nJust across First Street from the Capitol, the US Supreme Court was set to hear arguments in three cases that many gay rights supporters felt would dictate the level of protection they'd receive under the 1964 Civil Rights Act and Title VII's employment rules.\n\nActivists sat in First Street in an act of civil disobedience, reported the Washington Blade , an LGBTQ news outlet that quoted US Capitol Police saying the demonstrators were charged with crowding, obstructing and incommoding.\n\n147 climate change protesters, January 10, 2020\n\nPolice move back protesters at a climate change demonstration on Capitol Hill.\n\nActor Jane Fonda's fire drill Fridays produced numerous arrests -- many of them celebrities -- in late 2019 and early 2020, as the ex-wife of CNN founder Ted Turner took her anger over climate change inaction to the capital.\n\nIn the 14th week of protests, Joaquin Phoenix and Martin Sheen were among the stars who found themselves in custody, as Capitol Police verified scores of people were charged with crowding, obstructing or incommoding.\n\n181 Obamacare supporters, September 25, 2017\n\nCapitol Police arrest protesters from disabled rights groups as they interrupt a Senate hearing.\n\nthe Affordable Care Act in the summer of 2017, protests erupted week after week in the capital, spurring several days of arrests. On two separate days in July, Capitol Police confirmed to CNN When the GOP began attempts to dismantlethe Affordable Care Act in the summer of 2017, protests erupted week after week in the capital, spurring several days of arrests. On two separate days in July, Capitol Police confirmed to CNN officers had arrested 80 and then 155 protesters who had entered the halls of Congress to engage in peaceful protests -- sit-ins, chanting, lying on the ground and the like.\n\nThe largest single-day arrest count from the protests, however, came in September, when demonstrators -- many of whom, Reuters reported, were in wheelchairs (most of them belonged to a disability rights group ) -- delayed a Senate hearing. Capitol Police began rounding them up en masse.\n\nFifteen were charged with disrupting Congress and 166 were charged with crowding, disrupting or incommoding, with 23 of those facing an additional charge of resisting arrest, according to Capitol Police\n\n217 Trump inauguration protesters, January 20, 2017\n\nPolice officers pepper spray protesters before the inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump in 2017.\n\nAs demonstrations broke out across the country, police in the nation's capital dealt with ugly street clashes between police and antifa in downtown Washington.\n\nSix officers were injured, and police deployed pepper spray after, CNN reported , Bursts of chaos erupted on 12th and K streets as black-clad 'antifascist' protesters smashed storefronts and bus stops, hammered out the windows of a limousine and eventually launched rocks at a phalanx of police lined up in an eastbound crosswalk. Officers responded by launching smoke and flash-bang devices, which could be heard from blocks away, into the street to disperse the crowds.\n\n302 Brett Kavanaugh opponents, October 4, 2018\n\nCapitol Police arrest demonstrators protesting US Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.\n\nSeveral days of protest over the nomination of Kavanaugh to the US Supreme Court yielded hundreds of arrests, but many of them came on a single day, as lawmakers reviewed an FBI report outlining allegations against the would-be justice.\n\nIt was another star-studded affair, as comedian Amy Schumer and model Emily Ratajkowski were among those taken into custody.\n\nThe arrests began mid-afternoon with 293 people arrested for unlawfully demonstrating in a Senate building and nine more arrested later in another Senate building, a Capitol Police spokeswoman said. All were charged with crowding, obstructing or incommoding, the department said\n\n316 Black Lives Matter protesters, June 1, 2020\n\nA police officer charges forward during Black Lives Matter protests in front of the White House.\n\nMany found themselves asking Wednesday: Where are the police and military?\n\nNo one asked such questions in June, when Black Lives Matter protesters, decrying the deaths of George Floyd and other African Americans at the hands of police, took to the streets to find military helicopters hovering over the city, National Guard troops patrolling the streets and tear gas filling the air.\n\nAn analysis of Metropolitan Police Department data shows local police arrested five times as many people during the Floyd protests as they did during last week's insurrection.\n\n372 Keystone pipeline protesters, March 2, 2014\n\nStudents in front of the White House demonstrate against the proposed Keystone XL pipeline.\n\nAs President Barack Obama's administration reviewed plans for the $5.3 billion Keystone XL pipeline, almost 1,000 demonstrators marched from Georgetown University to Secretary of State John Kerry's home and then to the White House, where they acted out a human oil spill.\n\n400+ 'Democracy Spring' activists, April 11, 2016\n\nCapitol Police arrest Democracy Spring protesters participating in a sit-in at the U.S. Capitol.\n\nIt began in Philadelphia with protesters from several groups marching 150 miles south to stage a sit-in on the Capitol steps, denouncing the influence of big money on politics and Congress' refusal to reverse it. On a single day of the lengthy protests, Capitol Police arrested more than 400 people for unlawful demonstration activity, and they were charged with crowding, obstructing and incommoding.\n\nWhile the Progressive Change Campaign Committee cast the demonstrations as nonviolent civil disobedience, aimed at starting conversations on key democracy issues, numerous media outlets reported more than 900 arrests during the protests. Salon pegged the final tally at 1,240 over a week of protests.\n\n575 immigration policy protesters, June 28, 2018\n\nProtesters line up as they're arrested in the Hart Senate Office Building.\n\nMore than 1,000 women marched through Washington, protesting the Trump administration's policy of separating children from their parents at the US-Mexico border. Rep. Pramila Jayapal, a Democrat from Washington, was among the hundreds arrested , according to Capitol Police.\n\nThe demonstrations were largely peaceful. Protesters scarcely argued with the officers arresting them, who in most cases declined to even employ handcuffs in taking the women into custody. Several Democratic lawmakers -- including Sen. Tammy Duckworth, who arrived with her infant in tow -- showed up to express their support for the demonstration.\n\n12,000+ Vietnam War opponents, May 1, 1971\n\nPolice in riot gear surround protesters in hippie attire during the 1971 May Day protests.\n\nThis isn't officially included on this list. It isn't the fairest comparison, given that half a century has passed and the country looks markedly different than it did in 1971. But the May Day protests against the Vietnam War have been described as the largest mass arrest and largest mass acquittal of demonstrators in US history.\n\nFive thousand police, backed by 1,400 National Guardsman, greeted the 35,000 protesters descending on Washington that day, according to the American Civil Liberties Union\n\nAnyone and everyone who looked at all freaky ... was scooped up off the street, one protester said, according to an ACLU article. A federal court later agreed, saying, The innocent as well as the guilty were in large numbers swept from the streets and placed in detention facilities.\n\nAn ACLU victory resulted in acquittals for almost all of the protesters, allowing them to collect monetary damages for their mistreatment, the civil rights group said.

Story highlights Supreme Court set to hear huge case that pits religious liberties against discrimination and gay rights The timing of the Flynn plea deal is key: John King explains why\n\n(CNN) —\n\nA major White House foreign policy decision, a giant Supreme Court case, what Dems want out of a shutdown deal, and why the timing of the Michael Flynn plea deal matters: It's all a part of the Inside Politics forecast, where you get a taste of tomorrow's headlines today.\n\n1) Jerusalem decision has Washington – and the Middle East – on edge\n\nPresident Donald Trump's busy week ahead includes a major foreign policy decision designed to show solidarity with a key ally, but one that also has Washington and the Middle East on edge.\n\nThe early word is that the President will state publicly that the United States is officially recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, but is holding off, for now, on moving the US Embassy from Tel Aviv.\n\nA fair compromise, is how team Trump advocates of such a move characterize it. It allows the President to edge closer to his campaign promise to relocate the embassy but stops short of a move that would anger Palestinians – and upend years of US policy treating Jerusalem as a so-called final status issue to be settled by the Israelis and Palestinians through negotiation.\n\nThe lobbying over the speech and its exact wording will continue up to the moment of delivery. Julie Hirschfeld Davis of The New York Times underscored how complicated – and consequential – this moment is.\n\nA lot of his pro-Israel and religious conservative supporters wanted to see him [move the embassy]. He's punting on it a second time. And I'm hearing he's getting a lot of pressure to actually say in this speech this is the last waiver he'll sign, this is the last time he'll delay the decision, Davis said.\n\nIt's not clear that they've actually laid the groundwork in the Arab world or in the Middle East at all for this kind of a speech, which is going to be a very significant statement. There's a possibility, too, that it could actually violate some UN Security Council resolutions that do not recognize the sovereignty of Israel.\n\n2) Wedding cake case makes it to the Supreme Court – gay rights v. religious liberty?\n\nOn the official Supreme Court docket, it is Masterpiece Cake Shop Ltd., v. Colorado Civil Rights Commission. In shorthand, it's the wedding cake case.\n\nAnd the outcome will set a major precedent in finding the dividing line between religious liberty and discrimination. At issue: a baker who refused to make a wedding cake for a gay couple on the grounds that it violated his religious convictions.\n\nIt's one of the major issues facing the high court in the current term, and Julie Pace of The Associated Press noted it is also a legal ruling that will shape an often contentious political debate.\n\nThe couple is really worried that this will open up the door to a wide range of discrimination from businesses against same-sex couples, Pace said. The baker argues that he's an artist and he shouldn't be compelled to make a cake that violates his religious views … There's a lot of interest from both sides here; [it's] a big argument to watch this week.\n\n3) Decision time: Spending debates will force strategy decisions by Democrats\n\nRepublicans control both the House and the Senate, but Democrats have some leverage in the year-end spending and policy decisions that have to be made on Capitol Hill – on issues ranging from children's health care and Obamacare fixes to efforts to protect the so-called dreamers.\n\nDemocrats may have leverage, but do not have the sway to get everything they want. Some might also object to what conservatives demand in exchange.\n\nSahil Kapur of Bloomberg discussed how Democrats are debating what is worth the most effort – and whether they are prepared to withhold their votes, and perhaps trigger a government shutdown, if they can't get what they want.\n\nDemocrats are debating amongst themselves how far to go, how hard to push and force this battle, reveals Kapur. There are three things they want: Obamacare stabilization, they want to extend the Children's Health Insurance Program and they want a DACA fix. Republicans need their votes to keep the government funded … we'll see what happens.\n\n4) A big year one priority slips to year two\n\nIt is take two for the President's big infrastructure promise. Or, to be more exact, take one will wait until year two.\n\nRemember, a giant public works spending package was a key Trump promise for the first year of his presidency. But it never moved from talking point to policy proposal so – along with Obamacare repeal – will be high on the list of promises not kept when the President's first year in office is scored.\n\nBut the White House is now promising it will be a 2018 priority. The details, though, remain murky. Michael Warren of The Weekly Standard said the vague signals – and mixed signals – are creating some confusion in Congress.\n\nMaybe we're actually going to get something in the next year, before the midterms, on infrastructure. The administration has got a goal, I'm hearing, of something like early summer, Warren said. What I'm hearing from Capitol Hill is some complaints that the administration's a little vague, not entirely clear about what they want. General idea is, though, more flexibility to states – and that means of course more money to spend on roads, bridges, these sorts of things.\n\n5) Timing is everything! Ripple effect of the Flynn deal\n\nIf you believe the old line that timing is everything in politics, the timing of the Michael Flynn plea deal interesting – in at least a couple of ways.\n\nOne: Special counsel Robert Mueller's spending comes into public view in the days ahead. You can be sure some Trump allies will make the case that enough is enough, and that it's time to wind down and stop spending taxpayer money.\n\nA guilty plea and promise of cooperation from the President's former national security adviser makes it difficult to challenge Mueller from a productivity standpoint.\n\nTwo: As the legal fallout from the Flynn plea agreement rattles the West Wing, the timing also could impact administration morale – which in turn can have an impact on personnel decisions. Working in the White House or other major agencies is exhausting in normal circumstances. Then there's the first year factor, and the fact that team Trump has not fully staffed many offices and agencies. It all adds to the burden of those who are on the job. We are already seeing a trickle of departures, and the end of the year is the traditional time for people to decide to move on.\n\nMany veterans of White House work see the anxiety over Flynn's decision to cooperate with investigators as perhaps tipping the scales a little for those who are torn between departing at year's end, or staying on.\n\nThe biggest issue on Flynn is the impact on staff morale and the effect on departures, said a veteran Washington hand plugged in to the Trump White House. The legal issues aside.

Perhaps, Trump said at the annual Governors' Dinner.\n\nThe dinner was first lady Melania Trump's first time officially hosting a major social event at the White House, which Trump noted in his toast.\n\nGovernors from around the country gathered in the White House for the dinner, packing the room alongside administration figures and their families. Chief of Staff Reince Priebus could be seen seated alongside fellow Wisconsinite Gov. Scott Walker.\n\nTrump entered the room with his wife after Vice President Mike Pence and second lady Karen Pence.\n\nHe boasted of his accomplishments in the few weeks since taking office and said, It's been a lot of fun.\n\nPointing to the meetings with governors slated for the next day, Trump said Obamacare has tremendous problems and needed to be repealed and replaced, which he said would be one topic among others at the pretty big sessions they would have.\n\nI think you're going to see something very special, Trump said.\n\nHe invited governors to hit the ground running ahead of the meetings and said they could speak with Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price at the event.\n\nThe President concluded his toast by inviting Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe, a Democrat and the chairman of the National Governors Association, to give a toast. He described McAuliffe as a friend and a very good guy, but also said, I just destroyed his political career.\n\nMcAuliffe told the crowd he expected they would have the greatest NGA meeting in the history of NGA meetings and offered a toast to the President.\n\nFirst major social event of Trump White House\n\nThe President, who doesn't drink, toasted with water. Governors were spotted snapping photos on their cell phones as he gave remarks.\n\nThe first lady had made sure to note that Sunday evening's dinner in the State Dining room was a time to put politics aside.\n\nI am proud to invite all the governors to the White House for this important annual event, Melania Trump, who wore a dark sleeveless gown, said in a statement earlier Sunday. Tonight, we come together as one Nation, leaving political labels and partisan interests behind.\n\nThe black-tie dinner is the first major social event of the Trump administration, planned by the East Wing under first lady Melania Trump and a cadre of aides and advisers, including acting senior adviser Stephanie Winston Wolkoff.\n\nOne of the first lady's longtime friends and confidants, Winston Wolkoff was previously the events director at Vogue magazine, orchestrating high-wattage events like the Met Gala.\n\nThe evening's theme, per the White House, was Spring's Renewal, drawing upon nature and florals for inspiration. Tables covered in white tablecloths were adorned with white and green floral arrangements, tall white candlesticks, and White House china (it was not immediately clear which administration's table setting was used Sunday evening).\n\nThe White House has come to life, gleaming with a dazzling, sensorial experience of eternal spring, the White House said in the statement.\n\nThe scents of jasmine and roses fill the air as we give thanks for this great Nation and the glory of renewal, the first lady said.\n\nIvanka Trump, who spent the earlier part of her Sunday at a monster truck rally in Baltimore, made the quick change into a strapless black gown, posing for a photo with Jared Kushner outside their home in DC's Kalorama neighborhood.\n\nFrom the monster truck show to the Governor's Ball… she tweeted before the evening began.\n\nFrom the monster truck show to the Governor's Ball... pic.twitter.com/CIe6SKHwTN — Ivanka Trump (@IvankaTrump) February 26, 2017\n\nFor his part, tuxedo-clad President Trump seemed to enjoy his surroundings.\n\nI want to just congratulate the first lady on having done a really beautiful job.

I like people who weren't captured.\n\nOn March 19, 2019, President Donald Trump offered this assessment of the late war hero and senator: I was never a fan of John McCain and I never will be.\n\nThose two comments – almost four years apart and more than six months after McCain's death – provide telling bookends to understand just how much Trump has changed Republican politics (and politics generally), and not for the better.\n\nWhen Trump initially attacked McCain as something less than a war hero in 2015, it was covered as the end of a campaign that never really got started. Trump has been in the race for all of a month. He was still an asterisk in most polling. And everyone who knew anything assumed that attacking McCain's five years spent as a prisoner of war in Vietnam – a time that left the Arizona Republican with lifelong wounds – was a death sentence of Trump's political ambitions.\n\nAfter all, while plenty of Republicans didn't agree with McCain's much-touted renegade nature – and his willingness to buck party leadership – no one ever questioned the man's service to the country (in the military and in elected office). And doing so was seen as the easiest way to destroy your political future.\n\nExcept it didn't destroy Trump. For all the hand-wringing and predictions of doom for his campaign, he just kept right on going – first to the Republican presidential nomination and then to the White House. For many of his supporters, Trump's broadsides against McCain were music to their ears – finally someone was standing up to the political establishment in Washington! Trump wasn't afraid of slaughtering a sacred cow – or all the sacred cows! He didn't care! And they loved it.\n\nWhich brings me to Tuesday and Trump's comments about McCain, who died in August 2018 after a battle with brain cancer. Here's all of what Trump said:\n\nI'm very unhappy that he didn't repeal and replace Obamacare, as you know. He campaigned on repealing and replacing Obamacare for years and then he got to a vote and he said thumbs down. And our country would've saved a trillion dollars and we would've had great healthcare. So he campaigned, he told us hours before that he was going to repeal and replace, and then for some reason, I think I understand the reason, he ended up going thumbs up, and frankly, had we even known that, I think we would've gotten the vote cause we could've gotten somebody else. So I think that's disgraceful, plus there are other things.\n\nThose comments come after a weekend in which Trump repeatedly attacked McCain, who, in case you forgot, is deceased, for graduating last in his class from the Naval Academy and for allegedly sending the so-called Steele dossier to the media. (Trump offered zero proof that McCain had leaked the dossier, put together by a former British intelligence agent, to the press.)\n\nSo. Let's take a step back here and think of what happened here in Washington on Tuesday. Sitting next to the leader of a foreign country, the President of the United States went after a former Republican senator (and former GOP presidential nominee) who not only served in the Vietnam War but spent years of his life being tortured in a North Vietnamese prison camp. And this is a President who received several deferments during Vietnam, including for bone spurs. In an interview with The New York Times in 2016, Trump called the condition temporary and minor.\n\nHere's what I know: These latest comments will cause zero erosion in Trump's support among his hardcore backers. They will love the wringing of hands and woe-is-me reaction by who they believe to be elites. He's freaking them all out! They don't know what to do with him!\n\nHere's what I also know: There are certain things that are right and certain things that are wrong – whether you are a Democrat, a Republican or somewhere in between. And attacking a dead man who spent five years as a prisoner of war and another three decades serving the country in elected office, is simply wrong. That's true if Barack Obama, George W. Bush, Millard Fillmore, Franklin Pierce or whoever the next president will be did it. (None of them would have said what Trump did about a man with as decorated a past as McCain but the point still holds.\n\nTrump proudly embraces his smashing of political idols. Desecrating the old ways of doing things – and doing so gleefully – he believes is at the root of his political people. It says, he thinks, that he won't let the rules that past crappy politicians have lived by govern him.\n\nBut what Trump's comments about McCain should remind us of is this: Whether there is political gain to be found in dishonoring a lifelong public servant, it is simply wrong. It is not who we are – or who we should be. That everyone – Republicans, Democrats, independents and all the rest – won't come together to say that as one is profoundly depressing and disappointing.

Aired 6-7p ET\n\nAired February 1, 2016 - 18:00 ET\n\nTHIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.\n\n\n\n[18:01:35]\n\n\n\nWOLF BLITZER, CNN ANCHOR: We want to welcome our viewers in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer. You're in THE SITUATION ROOM.\n\n\n\nANDERSON COOPER, CNN ANCHOR: I'm Anderson Cooper. Thanks for joining us.\n\n\n\nWe are now just one hour from the moment when doors open at caucus sites across Iowa, and just two hours from when they close and the voters inside get down to the business of picking a candidate and perhaps making history.\n\n\n\nBLITZER: We have correspondents and cameras at all the major events in prime locations tonight, expert analysis left, right, and center. Plenty to talk about.\n\n\n\nBy the end of the night, a billionaire with no political experience whatsoever could be one big winner and a self-proclaimed Democratic socialist could be the other, or a Canadian-born freshman senator or former senator and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. The polling is tight on both sides. So get ready for a surprise or two.\n\n\n\nWe begin the hour with Sara Murray. She is over at Donald Trump caucus night headquarters in West Des Moines.\n\n\n\nSara, what is the latest from the Trump campaign? How is Mr. Trump making his final push?\n\n\n\nSARA MURRAY, CNN NATIONAL POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT: Wolf, I think that everyone is realizing this could be a truly incredible night. And that counts Donald Trump as well. They do not want the take anything for granted.\n\n\n\nDonald Trump held two campaign rallies today, which is a bit of an unorthodox move for a candidate on caucus night. And we're also expecting him to appear at some caucus sites. Which ones, we don't know. And the same goes for his children. They have been all over the state today, doing some retail stops. And they too will appear at caucus sites.\n\n\n\nWolf, this is a shrewd move. A lot of people have said will Donald Trump supporters turn out? Going out to caucus is not the same as going to a rally, where Donald Trump is the entertainment. But by fanning himself and his children out to these caucus sites, they're guaranteeing some celebrity appeal, at least at a couple of the precincts around the country, Wolf.\n\n\n\nBLITZER: Sara, how confident are they that Trump will emerge the victor tonight?\n\n\n\nMURRAY: When Donald Trump was holding his rallies earlier today, he said he wanted to emerge victorious. He has made it clear that he really wants to win this state. But I would say that he and his team are cautiously optimistic right now. They know that the poll numbers look good for them. They feel confident in their ground game, even though they have been really tight-lipped about it. It's been very much behind the scenes.\n\n\n\nBut I think they feel like they are in a good spot heading into this night. As you know, though, better than anyone here, it all just depends on who shows up tonight. And there is no guarantee until they open those doors at the caucus sites, Wolf.\n\n\n\nBLITZER: And so far the weather is pretty good, so that should encourage turnout. Sara Murray, thanks very much.\n\n\n\nTed Cruz is holding a pre-caucus rally right now at a Baptist church in Marion, Iowa. He is counting on a big evangelical turnout this evening, but not a high overall turnout. A lot of experts believe that would mean a surge of first-time caucus-goers who would be expected, many of them at least, to go with Trump.\n\n\n\nOur Sunlen Serfaty is in Des Moines at Cruz headquarters tonight.\n\n\n\nSunlen is joining us now.\n\n\n\nThis is Cruz's last push for voters, Sunlen. What is his game plan? What has it been like so far today on the ground there in Iowa?\n\n\n\nSUNLEN SERFATY, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, Wolf, the Cruz campaign is touting that they have blanketed this state; 12,000 volunteers were deployed today to really get out the vote.\n\n\n\nFor the candidate himself, I think that it's no coincident that his last formal event before coming here to this rally later is about evangelicals, speaking and rallying evangelical voters at a Baptist church nearby. This is where he needs to perform well tonight. He has always been about appealing to evangelicals.\n\n\n\n[18:05:03]\n\n\n\nBut he needs to see those numbers perform for him tonight. In his final pitch, it was a very direct message to evangelical voters, all about character, questioning to point-blank to people out there on the trail saying the person you plan to caucus for, do they have integrity? Do they have character? Really trying to make that direct contrast with Donald Trump with evangelicals out here on the trail -- Wolf. BLITZER: Sunlen, you're there in Des Moines where Cruz will be\n\n\n\nrallying as the votes come in. What is the campaign expecting tonight realistically?\n\n\n\nSERFATY: Well, they have been really, I should say, Wolf, downplaying expectations for days. And this is significant and a notable shift, because for months Ted Cruz himself predicting a win here in Iowa, saying that he didn't even think he had peaked at one point in December.\n\n\n\nSo it is a pretty significant shift that they're now kind of downplaying expectations. Ted Cruz himself today, you can sense a little bit of doubt in his voice today. He said he is at peace where he is in Iowa. He's saying, although he does feel good, he went on to say this is in God's hands. This is in voters' hands. He says if Donald Trump wins here tonight, he will happily congratulate him and then move on -- Wolf.\n\n\n\nBLITZER: Sunlen Serfaty, thanks very much.\n\n\n\nNow to Marco Rubio. He is running a third in most of the polls, contending at least in the eyes of election watchers to be the leader of the alternatives to both Trump and Cruz. He will be campaigning right to the very end with a string of visits scheduled tonight to caucus sites, even as the voting again.\n\n\n\nCNN's Manu Raju is over at Rubio caucus night headquarters in Des Moines. He is joining us now.\n\n\n\nManu, several of Rubio's opponents are having rally-type events today, but Rubio's final push for Iowa voters is a face-to-face approach. Is that right?\n\n\n\nMANU RAJU, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT: That's right. In addition to that, Wolf, he has also dispatched hundreds of volunteers to make thousands of phone calls to uncommitted voters. And what the campaign is hearing back is good news, according to campaign officials that I speak with.\n\n\n\nThey feel like they're doing well in the polls, probably even better than what The Des Moines Register said that they were at last week, which is about 15 percent of the vote. They think that they will probably surpass that. But they are still managing expectations. They believe that they are probably almost certain to get third place. They do not think they are going to get into second place at this point, Wolf.\n\n\n\nAnd it's notable where Marco Rubio is going tonight. He is going into Polk County. That's here in Des Moines, that county a very populous part of the state in which they believe they need to do very well here in order to get that strong third-place finish.\n\n\n\nBLITZER: What are they really realistically expecting in the campaign, Manu?\n\n\n\nRAJU: They believe if they have a third-place finish and are much higher than the other establishment type favorites in this race, the governor specifically, if they are 10 points, 15 points higher than them, they will have a very strong message to tell out of Iowa and they can go into New Hampshire trying to be that unity candidate. We will see if they're able to do that just in a few hours -- Wolf. .\n\n\n\nBLITZER: All right, Manu, thanks very much.\n\n\n\nCOOPER: I want to get a first quick take from our panel, Wolf, on just what to look for in this next hour as the doors open at caucuses one hour from now.\n\n\n\nKevin, in terms of, you look at Donald Trump. You look at Ted Cruz. They have campaigned so differently in Iowa. Ted Cruz has gone to all 99 counties, really reached out to evangelicals, reached out to local officials. Donald Trump has had big events there, obviously. He has been spending more time there lately, but has not spent the time that Ted Cruz has and has not really advertised until just the last couple of weeks.\n\n\n\nKEVIN MADDEN, CNN CONTRIBUTOR: That's right.\n\n\n\nAnd I think what he is trying to do is that he is taking a new approach to what is usually a traditional process, which is trying to build up a whole lot of buzz, trying to get a whole lot of free media, and then build a new coalition, some evangelicals, some independent voters, new voters that he expects to come and support him, because he is a very untraditional candidate, someone who can challenge the status quo.\n\n\n\nAnd that's what is going to be put to the test, is whether or not -- it think this is a big test on whether or not momentum is going to be able to beat grassroots infrastructure.\n\n\n\nChairman Rogers, how effective do you think Donald Trump's attacks against Ted Cruz have been just in the last couple weeks? Ted Cruz was higher up in the polls, according to a lot of different polls. He then went after -- Donald Trump suddenly pivoted, went after him on the Canadian birth issue and other issues.\n\n\n\nMIKE ROGERS, CNN CONTRIBUTOR: I think it leaves a bit of a mark, but I don't think it's fatal by any means.\n\n\n\nAnd, again, it's going to come down to turnout. I think that rallied Ted Cruz voters to go out and grab a friend and bring them to the poll. I'm not sure that was helpful in that round of attacks. But beyond that, Donald Trump did something pretty interesting. About a few weeks ago, started having smaller group meetings where he was walking people through exactly, his campaign team, taking those new voters and walking them through exactly what to expect, how you go into a caucus, how you vote and how it works, because that can be very intimidating if you have never participated in politics to any degree.\n\n\n\nThat could be a switch that you're going to see here in little bit. But as far as the give and take on Cruz and Trump, most of those folks, no, I think most of those folks have already committed. It may fire up the wrong crowd in some of those cases. [18:10:05]\n\n\n\nCOOPER: Amanda, your former boss, Ted Cruz, in order to win, he doesn't just have to get his largely evangelical supporters to come out. He has to hope the Donald Trump's new people don't come out, right?\n\n\n\nAMANDA CARPENTER, FORMER TED CRUZ COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR: Yes.\n\n\n\nAnd I think that's why Ted Cruz has made such an aggressive play to go to those 99 counties, to pick up and win the places that Huckabee and Rick Santorum have won before. He has been very up front saying that I want to be the candidate that conservatives coalesce behind.\n\n\n\nHe is not necessarily interested in taking on and stealing voters from Donald Trump, but everyone else in the field. Think about Ben Carson. Cruz went up in the polls when Carson went down. And Cruz could still benefit a lot from the demise of Ben Carson.\n\n\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nCOOPER: You think a lot of Carson supporters would go to Cruz?\n\n\n\nCARPENTER: Yes, I think it's very likely. Huckabee, Santorum, even Rand Paul people, if they're in that caucus and they see where the momentum is and they want to get behind a candidate to win, Cruz can be their guy.\n\n\n\nCruz has been very up front in the race, saying this is between me and Donald Trump. If you don't vote for me, a candidate who has a chance of at least slowing down his momentum, you're voting for...\n\n\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nMADDEN: Amanda makes a good point, real quick. There is an anybody but Trump caucus out there. And who can finally get them in the last...\n\n\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nGLORIA BORGER, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST: Rubio. I think Rubio.\n\n\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nMADDEN: Because you know what? They don't want their vote wasted.\n\n\n\nBORGER: Here is the fascinating thing about Ted Cruz. Here is a man who was against NSA surveillance. And he is the most data-driven candidate, bar none, even including Barack Obama. This is somebody who knows everything about every voter in all of the 99 counties of Iowa.\n\n\n\nHe knows where you shop, what you do, who you're likely to vote for, whether you go to church every Sunday or just twice a month. He is so data-driven. And that will in the end I believe help him if he is close to Trump. (CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nCARPENTER: One of the things, I think they have learned a lot of lessons from the Barack Obama campaign, which one thing broadly I think we should all recognize. Before it was conventional wisdom a senator could not win. Now we have not only Ted Cruz doing well, but also Senator Sanders.\n\n\n\nAnd I think it's because the Senate has become a proving ground of sorts, where people can show where they are on the positions and prove to voters where they stand.\n\n\n\nDAVID GERGEN, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST: I guess Ted Cruz knows almost as much about us as Google. So, we have to assume...\n\n\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nBORGER: More.\n\n\n\nGERGEN: Yes, probably so.\n\n\n\nBut what I find fascinating about this is that Ted Cruz is playing the game that Barack Obama did to a very large extent. He is running a terrific ground game. And Trump has been engaging in an air game. And that's very new to politics.\n\n\n\nBut there was a really interesting story came out of Politico today that he got together with people back in Christmas of 2013 and started planning this out and said, I'm going to do an air war. I can keep the media's focus.\n\n\n\nBut there is an interesting question. I don't want to stretch this analogy too far. But if you're running an air game, do you need boots on the ground to win?\n\n\n\nCOOPER: Right.\n\n\n\nGERGEN: Do you need boots on the ground?\n\n\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nBORGER: Well, he needs a lot more boots. Let's put it that way.\n\n\n\nMICHAEL NUTTER (D), FORMER MAYOR OF PHILADELPHIA: You always need people on the ground.\n\n\n\nGERGEN: Yes.\n\n\n\nNUTTER: The air game gets you the attention. The ground game wins elections. That's really my perspective.\n\n\n\nMADDEN: And if Trump wins tonight, it will be because he has a better ground game than any of the people that you have seen in Iowa before.\n\n\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nMADDEN: If Trump wins tonight, it will be because he had a better ground game than many people thought.\n\n\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nBILL PRESS, RADIO TALK SHOW HOST: This is a time -- this is a time, organization, organization; 100 years ago, I was Democratic state chair of California. I learned the hard way.\n\n\n\nYou can do all the advertising you want, all the rah-rah-rah rallies. When it comes to Election Day, it's all over. And if you don't have the old GOTV, people, they know -- you have to know who your voters are. And you have got to get them out. It's as simple as that.\n\n\n\nAnd if Bernie has got it, he wins tonight. But just one other quick point. As complicated as the Democratic caucuses are, it's even more complicated than we learned, because they're weighted. So based on the turnout the last time, if you have 200 people at once caucus, you don't get as many delegates as you do if you have 200 people at a different caucus.\n\n\n\nSo, Bernie has to get his young people not in the college towns. But he is asking them to go home.\n\n\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nCOOPER: Explain that, because that's very confusing.\n\n\n\nPRESS: Well, again, they're weighted based on how they did, how they voted, how many turned out the last time.\n\n\n\nSo Bernie supporters are mainly in these -- a lot of them in these college towns, right? The college towns, you could have 500 people. You will not get -- even if you win it, you don't get as many delegates as if you have maybe 300 people back home. So he has been telling his students go home and caucus. Don't stay in your college town.\n\n\n\nCOOPER: Wow.\n\n\n\nBORGER: But the Republican caucuses...\n\n\n\nPRESS: That's a tough challenge.\n\n\n\nBORGER: But the Republican caucuses are much more straightforward.\n\n\n\nPRESS: Right.\n\n\n\nBORGER: They're different. We should point that out. They are different from the Democratic caucuses, right. You vote and leave.\n\n\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nGERGEN: Won't we get two sets of results tonight? We will get a delegate count, plus we will get a voter count?\n\n\n\nBORGER: Eventually.\n\n\n\nGERGEN: Won't we get a voter count?\n\n\n\nBORGER: Eventually. It takes long time.\n\n\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nJEFFREY LORD, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: ... county level and work their way up.\n\n\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nGERGEN: Right. But won't we know sort of how many votes were cast and who they went for? One person could win the delegate count and somebody else could win the popular count on that basis.\n\n\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nBORGER: I doubt it.\n\n\n\nGERGEN: But if the college kids all...\n\n\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\n[18:15:00]\n\n\n\nROGERS: One note of caution on this. Remember, they are folding up pieces of paper with names written on them and putting them in a shoe box. Some of them are bedazzled with those little jewels. I'm not kidding.\n\n\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nROGERS: They will have to open the box and count them. If you remember the Santorum-Romney issue in the last presidential race came down to a few problems in actually folding out the pieces of paper and counting them. This is not going to be instantaneous, electronic...\n\n\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nCOOPER: Chairman Rogers, I just love that you know what a bedazzler is.\n\n\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\n\n\nCOOPER: We're going to take a break. You have been watching infomercials.\n\n\n\nWe have got to take a quick break. A lot more to get to. We will get the latest from Clinton caucus night headquarters, where the pressure could not be any higher, and late reporting from the Sanders and O'Malley camps as well. We will also be joined by a top Cruz campaign official about expectations for his candidate, the senator now doing a little Q&A with voters in Marion as we speak.\n\n\n\nWe will be right back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n\n\n[18:20:15]\n\n\n\nBLITZER: To give you some idea of how drastically the race in Iowa has changed since the outset, Hillary Clinton once held a nearly 30- point advantage over Bernie Sanders in the polls.\n\n\n\nTonight, they're neck and neck. And because Senator Sanders holds a big polling edge in New Hampshire, it really puts a lot of pressure on Secretary Clinton to secure a victory tonight.\n\n\n\nGiven that, are they feeling that pressure over at Clinton caucus night headquarters?\n\n\n\nLet's check in with our Brianna Keilar, who is there.\n\n\n\nBrianna, what is the latest? What is Secretary Clinton's final push looking like?\n\n\n\nBRIANNA KEILAR, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, Wolf, today is so much about the waiting game after Hillary Clinton made her case last night for why she thinks Iowans should caucus for her, where she said that she is basically more electable and that she's more capable of getting things done.\n\n\n\nWe saw a number of events yesterday. Today was about going out, seeing volunteers. She brought them treats on the south side of Des Moines, thanking them for all of the work that they have put in for her.\n\n\n\nAnd then she relaxed a little bit, had some coffee with her daughter and her son-in-law, some coffee and pastries, before getting ready to wait for these results to come in tonight, Wolf.\n\n\n\nBLITZER: Brianna, Secretary Clinton, I know you ran into her earlier today. How is she feeling about tonight?\n\n\n\nKEILAR: Yes, I ran into her. I wasn't expecting to see her, Wolf. And she was in really great spirits. She was smiling. So it seems like certainly she seemed relax and perhaps confident going into this, which is really what we're hearing from some of her aides.\n\n\n\nThey feel good. They're looking at the indicators. They're looking at the polls over time here in the last couple of weeks. And they feel like the numbers are on their side. They feel like they have done everything they can when it comes to organizing, when it comes to getting people out to caucus. But so many of them also remember back to 2008.\n\n\n\nAnd this is what they say, Wolf. They say, we thought things were good going into that night too. And then, of course, she was given a stinging third-place defeat. So there is really, I think, this sense for them of anxiety a little bit, that even though they're feeling good, they don't quite trust it. They want to see what the results are before they're really going to feel confident. BLITZER: Yes, Barack Obama came in first. Senator, former Senator\n\n\n\nJohn Edwards came in second. She came in third. Brianna, thanks very much.\n\n\n\nWorkers at the Sanders headquarters got a pep talk today from the boss. Listen to this.\n\n\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nSEN. BERNIE SANDERS (VT-I), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: We will struggle tonight if the voter turnout is low. That's the fact. So what is our job today, is to make sure that we have the highest voter turnout possible. That happens, we win. Let's good get them. Thank you all.\n\n\n\n(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nBLITZER: All right, Jeff Zeleny is there for us tonight.\n\n\n\nJeff, what is the Sanders campaign telling you about how they will determine if Iowa turns out to be a success?\n\n\n\nJEFF ZELENY, CNN SENIOR WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT: Wolf, in a word, it is turnout again, which is even more important in these caucuses than the elections.\n\n\n\nEveryone who has come to see Senator Sanders in the closing days of the campaign has been contacted by text, by e-mail, by phone call. They're trying to turn out their number ones, they call them. They organize people by one, two, three. One is the most committed supporter. They believe that they have enough number ones to have a big turnout here. The number that they're eying is this. If it's more than 160,000 people who turn out tonight, they believe that they're in good shape.\n\n\n\nIf it's more than 170,000 people, the Clinton campaign, I'm told, believes that that is essentially or close to being out of reach for them. To put it in some context here, this would be in between the 2004 turnout and the 2008 turnout, when there were some 240,000 people here. But the Sanders campaign is doing something new.\n\n\n\nThey're trying something new, Wolf. And this will be a test of it tonight. Social media. Will social media through Snapchat, through Facebook, through Instagram be able to turn out supporters, rather than a brick and mortar organization that they have used so many years here?\n\n\n\nSo, in a word, it is turnout, getting these younger and newer voters out to caucus in about an hour-and-a-half's time -- Wolf.\n\n\n\nBLITZER: What else are they trying to do, Jeff, to get people mobilized and get out there and caucus?\n\n\n\nZELENY: Well, one of the things that they're trying to do is just sort of the supporter-to-supporter network. There are so many volunteers here from outside of the country for all campaigns.\n\n\n\nBut the Sanders campaign in particular is using a lot of out-of-state volunteers, as well as in-state volunteers, to go back and redouble up their effort here. The specter of 2008 is not hanging over them. A tiny specter of 2004 is hanging over them. That was Howard Dean. We famously saw him crash in the Iowa caucuses.\n\n\n\nHe won -- finished third place. He was soaring for so long and crashed. But all the Sanders advisers believe that so much is different now, because the social media, how we communicate is different now.\n\n\n\n[18:25:03]\n\n\n\nSo that is one sort of benchmark that Bernie Sanders wants to beat, that Howard Dean crash here in Iowa.\n\n\n\nBLITZER: Yes. And the Hillary Clinton campaign is doing that social media, new development as well since then. All right, Jeff, thanks very much.\n\n\n\nCOOPER: Wolf, thanks very much. I want to talk our panel.\n\n\n\nMy understanding on the Howard Dean thing is that that campaign did not sort of in the final moments continue to check in with their caucus-goers and kind of push them to go. And a lot of people they thought were going to come out to caucus actually didn't. And that lesson has been learned by all of these candidates.\n\n\n\nBORGER: Right. Absolutely. They had a lot of younger voters from out of state who came in and didn't really organize the way they needed to.\n\n\n\nI remember them walking around in their bright orange caps. Remember that? And so a lot has been learned from the mistakes of Howard Dean by the Bernie Sanders campaign. What was interesting about what Jeff was just saying is that they're figuring it's around 160,000 that they need to get out.\n\n\n\nI mean, Barack Obama had 239,000 people turn out in 2008. So they don't need anything like, they believe -- this is their analysis -- what Obama had to beat Hillary Clinton last time around.\n\n\n\nGERGEN: But that suggests it's going to be a much lower turnout overall.\n\n\n\nBORGER: Right. Well, they believe that.\n\n\n\nCOOPER: But to Bill's point earlier, the fact that if you have all these younger voters, if they're voting by their college, that's not a good thing. Or if they're caucusing by their college, that's not a great thing for Bernie Sanders. He has got to get them to go to their home districts.\n\n\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nBORGER: To spread it out.\n\n\n\nPRESS: You have got to get the right number of people in the right caucuses to really -- to get the delegates that you need and to win these caucuses.\n\n\n\nAnd in the course of the campaign, look, Tad Devine and Jeff Weaver are real pros. They know this. And the Clinton people know it too. But enthusiasm, as you said, Gloria, is great. And Bernie's got it. But that's not enough.\n\n\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nNUTTER: You have to show up.\n\n\n\nCOOPER: Mayor Nutter, you're a Clinton supporter.\n\n\n\nNUTTER: Yes.\n\n\n\nCOOPER: The Clinton campaign says they have learned the lessons of 2008. They have focused -- they have taken Iowa a lot more seriously. They have had a lot of small meetings in smaller groups where they felt she really shines as a candidate. She has said she is a different candidate.\n\n\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nCOOPER: Do you think, though, voters in Iowa see her as a different candidate or do they see the same person she was back in 2008?\n\n\n\nNUTTER: Well, as they say, you only get one time to make a first impression. They know Senator Clinton.\n\n\n\nThey know first lady Clinton. They know Secretary Clinton. She is not a new person. But you can change campaign styles, campaign tactics, and the things that you do on the ground. And, again, as has been one of the themes of this campaign, I think experience does matter. And you learn from the things that have happened in the past, and see what others have done. Secretary Clinton knows how to do that.\n\n\n\nGERGEN: She is more experienced. But there is a fascinating generational split here...\n\n\n\nCOOPER: Divide, right.\n\n\n\nGERGEN: ... in Hillary's case. It was really, really interesting, that Des Moines Register poll over the weekend, that she does so well with people -- women over 45.\n\n\n\nBut under that, Sanders beats her heavily.\n\n\n\nCOOPER: Right.\n\n\n\nGERGEN: And it does really raise questions. Will -- the Obama coalition of 2008 and 2012 depended heavily on the youth vote.\n\n\n\nCOOPER: In Iowa.\n\n\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nGERGEN: And everywhere, and in the general election. It was hugely important in both general elections. Can she bring that along, or is the generational difference such that she is going to have a harder time with that...\n\n\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nCOOPER: The thing that she has, the part of the Obama coalition she has in other states, because there is not as big an African-American population, is African-Americans in South Carolina and elsewhere, as we have talked about. The question is young people.\n\n\n\nGERGEN: Absolutely. Yes.\n\n\n\nBut it's also, is age going trump -- or is it going to overtake the question of her being a woman, being the first woman? And the younger voters don't seem...\n\n\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nBORGER: To Bernie?\n\n\n\nGERGEN: No, young women don't seem to -- it doesn't seem to matter to them as much.\n\n\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nPRESS: People under 45, Bernie Sanders leads her 78-21.\n\n\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nBORGER: And among young women too.\n\n\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nGERGEN: It's extraordinary.\n\n\n\nPRESS: Under 45, men and women.\n\n\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nPRESS: That's why I think, tonight, we will see what happens. But I really believe Hillary has much, much, much more at stake than Bernie does. She has to win tonight.\n\n\n\nShe lost to Barack Obama, fine. But he was a rock star. Bernie is a 74-year-old socialist from Vermont, you know, who is an outsider. And for her to -- if she were to lose to Bernie, I think it would be a real...\n\n\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nNUTTER: I love that. Great spin. (CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nNUTTER: The reality is that Senator Sanders has run a philosophical campaign. He wants an ideological debate about a lot of things.\n\n\n\nSecretary Clinton is practical, pragmatic, knows how to get stuff done. And people will make a decision about those kinds of things. But I want to go back to one of the points that David made very, very early on, about 1,680-plus caucus locations. This is Iowa. Great state, great people. And it's kicking off this incredible big night.\n\n\n\n[18:30:11] We have about 1,680-plus voting divisions in Philadelphia. It is as if the citizens of Philadelphia were kicking off the national campaign and directing the momentum for what's going to happen over the course of the next, you know, eight, nine, ten months.\n\n\n\nCOOPER: Right. That's the context.\n\n\n\nNUTTER: That's the context with which we're operating here.\n\n\n\nCOOPER: We're going to take a quick break. Before we do, a reminder. We've got something special in store Wednesday night, a 360 Democratic town hall. Clinton, Sanders, O'Malley, all will be there. I'll be moderating. Eight Eastern Time, Wednesday night in New Hampshire. No matter what the results are tonight, they will all be there. It's going to be a fascinating night. Tune in for that.\n\n\n\nComing up next, about a half hour from opening time at the caucus locations throughout Iowa. And about 90 minutes from the actual caucusing,/ We'll check back in with the Democratic and Republican caucus site for a closer look at what is about to unfold. The first real contest in this amazing presidential election. We'll be right back.\n\n\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n\n\nBLITZER: Senator Ted Cruz just wrapped up a pre-caucus rally at a Baptist church in Marion, Iowa. Earlier today he spoke with the town of Jefferson, where he explained an accomplishment that he called the full Grassley.\n\n\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nSEN. TED CRUZ (R-TX), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: We are, with this stop, completing the very last stop of the full Grassley. We have now been to all 99 counties in the great state of Iowa.\n\n\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nBLITZER: Grassley, of course, being the long-time Iowa Senator Chuck Grassley, who visits every county in the state every year.\n\n\n\nJoining us now, the full Tyler. Cruz campaign communications director Rick Tyler. Rick, thanks very much for joining us. So what's your prediction? How is the senator going to do tonight? RICK TYLER, CRUZ CAMPAIGN COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR: Well, I think\n\n\n\nhe'll do very well. We'll either win or we'll come in a close second. And I'm confident that our turnout operation is as good as it gets. We've had 12,000 volunteers working. We're making over 20,000 calls a day. I guess there have been 24,000 calls, knocking on 2,000 doors a day. That's been going on for weeks now.\n\n\n\nAnd so I feel pretty good. I feel like it's all come to this. A little nervous. But we've got about a half hour till caucus time starts. And so hoping that Iowa will bring it home for us.\n\n\n\nBLITZER: Listen to what Donald Trump says about Senator Ted Cruz's suggestion about his policies. Listen to this.\n\n\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nDONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE (via phone): Ted Cruz is a total liar. I am so against Obamacare. I've been saying it for two years in my speeches. I'm going to repeal and replace Obamacare. I don't even know where he gets this. But he is a liar.\n\n\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nBLITZER: All right. So why does the senator insist that Donald Trump would be -- supports Obamacare?\n\n\n\nTYLER: Because he has said that he would -- he would fund single- payer health care system, which is where Obamacare is leading to. And Senator Cruz didn't say he supports Obama care. He said he supports an Obamacare-like system of where Obamacare is taking us, which is single payer.\n\n\n\nWe all know what happens with single payer. You get -- you get lower quality, higher costs, less choices, less innovation; and it costs lives and money. And so that's his -- those are Donald Trump's words.\n\n\n\nYou know, it's kind of sad, really, actually, that Donald Trump, you know, wants to do name-calling and invective and insults and thinks that that's really effective. And I just don't think -- I think the voters of Iowa are just kind of sick of that behavior.\n\n\n\nAnd so their campaign attacked Congressman King today. It went over like a lead balloon. It was just not well-received by the Iowans, who were there, actually, to see Donald Trump.\n\n\n\nAnd so, you know, I just think it's sad that he's going to stoop to this level.\n\n\n\nBLITZER: So how bitter is this relationship? Now they used to have a so-called bromance. But it's really deteriorated.\n\n\n\nTYLER: Well, Ted Cruz has said over and over again he likes Donald Trump. He has not returned the invective. In fact, he never has. Lots of people called him lots of names, because he doesn't want to get along with Washington. He wants to change Washington. But he never returns it in kind. So I think that speaks to the character of Ted Cruz.\n\n\n\nSo, look, it's going to be a -- I think it's a two-person race. And I hope to come out on top tonight. We'll see how Donald Trump reacts to actually losing. We'll see what happens.\n\n\n\nBLITZER: Was that the full Tyler, Rick?\n\n\n\nTYLER: I guess so.\n\n\n\nBLITZER: All right. The full Tyler. Rick Tyler, thanks very much for joining us.\n\n\n\nTYLER: Appreciate it.\n\n\n\nCOOPER: Wolf, doors open in about 20 minutes for the Iowa caucuses. I want to check in with Jim Sciutto, who's at a Republican caucus site in greenfield, Iowa.\n\n\n\nWhat's happening there, Jim?\n\n\n\nJIM SCIUTTO, CNN NATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT: How you doing, Anderson? We're at Notaway (ph) Valley High School. This is the southwestern corner of Iowa. It is rural. It is agricultural. Corn is king, they say, here.\n\n\n\nThere's also a strong evangelical streak here, which would seem to break in favor of a Ted Cruz, perhaps a Donald Trump with a Falwell endorsement. But other candidates not leaving it to chance. Darrell Issa, who's a surrogate for Marco Rubio, he's come all the way down here to the southwestern corner of the state to speak here tonight to try to peel away some of those Cruz and Trump supporters to go the way of Marco Rubio.\n\n\n\nBLITZER: Do we know how large of a turnout they're expecting there tonight?\n\n\n\nSCIUTTO: Well, I spoke to the precinct chair, and he says they're expecting a record turnout tonight. In fact, they're prepared to accommodate as much as twice as many voters as they had just four years ago. It doesn't mean they'll get there. But they're prepared for it.\n\n\n\nBut at the same time, it's very unpredictable. They've said that here in Notaway (ph) Valley, in Springfield -- Greenfield, rather, they correctly predicted, correctly voted for the winner of the Iowa caucuses going back to 1996. Precinct chair says, though, tonight completely unpredictable. He doesn't have a real sense of who's going to come away a winner tonight.\n\n\n\n[18:40:27] COOPER: Right. A potential with a lot of new caucus goers. Jim, thanks.\n\n\n\nLet's go now to a Democratic caucus site. Pamela Brown joins us from Des Moines. So what's happening there, Pamela?\n\n\n\nPAMELA BROWN, CNN JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT: Already, people are starting to come in. They just walked into the church, Anderson. They've been registering here.\n\n\n\nAnd we've already seen both Bernie Sanders supporters as well as Hillary Clinton supporters who have arrived tonight. In fact, the Hillary camp set up shop where Barack Obama's group was eight years ago when Barack Obama won this caucus site. And Hillary obviously did not. So they're hoping that this will give them good luck, and that things will change this time around.\n\n\n\nWe're expecting a huge turnout here tonight. Eight years ago there were a little more than 100 people. There were a lot of first-time caucus goers. Tonight we're expecting even more people. There are around 600 Democrats registered here in this precinct. A little over 400 independents.\n\n\n\nAnd of course, the Bernie Sanders camp is hoping to get the young people in, those first-time caucus goers to cast their vote.\n\n\n\nThe hot commodity, of course, tonight will be those who haven't decided yet, who are coming here, floating in between candidate, and who are here to be swayed. We're told that those that have made up their minds will be swarming around those who haven't, trying to get them into their groups. We're going see a lot of action here very shortly -- Anderson.\n\n\n\nCOOPER: And the weather in that area, is that going to be a factor tonight?\n\n\n\nBROWN: Only in a good way, Anderson. And that's one of the reasons they think the turnout is going to be so high tonight. It's because it's a nice day here. It's not even that cold here in Iowa. The snowstorm hasn't set in yet. And so as one person we spoke to said, there is no excuse for people not to come out and caucus here, particularly in this precinct.\n\n\n\nCooper: All right. Good to know. Pamela Brown, thanks.\n\n\n\nComing up, the latest polls in Iowa show Bernie Sanders just barely behind Hillary Clinton. Her lead within the poll's margin of error. That's why tonight is so fascinating, so important. The question is can Sanders pull out a victory in the heartland? I'll speak with someone who wrote the book on him, next.\n\n\n\nAlso, take a look. Two GOP candidates who have already jumped ahead to New Hampshire, John Kasich and Jeb Bush.\n\n\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nJEB BUSH (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: He had written two memoirs. Because it was all about him and his ambitions. And he's, as I said, an extraordinary, extraordinary speaker. And he was there for two years as the United States senator when he lost his campaign.\n\n\n\nThere was nothing in his background about whether he could forge consensus, unite around the things that we agree on. Nothing. And the net result is we have suffered as a...\n\n\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n\n\n[18:47:25] BLITZER: The Iowa caucuses are about to get under way, the first big test for the presidential election and for Senator Bernie Sanders. The question tonight is whether he can overcome what seems to be Hillary Clinton's razor-thin lead over him in the polls in Iowa.\n\n\n\nJoining us now is political strategist Jonathan Tasini. He's the author of the book The Essential: Bernie Sanders and His Vision for America.\n\n\n\nJonathan, thanks very much for joining us.\n\n\n\nI know you're hoping for a Sanders win tonight in Iowa. But if Hillary Clinton does win and he loses, how does that affect his strategy moving towards New Hampshire and beyond?\n\n\n\nJONATHAN TASINI, POLITICAL STRATEGIST: Well, look, I think the reality is that we're sort of getting into the weeds with Iowa. There's 44 delegates at stake. We feel very confident about the work that's been done. But this fight is going all the way to the convention.\n\n\n\nWolf, if you had told me back in May that Bernie Sanders, who was at 3 percent in the polls, within seven months would essentially be tied with the presumed front-runner in Iowa and be closing fast in national polls, have raised $20 million just in January, which means he will be competitive in all the Super Tuesday states on March 1st, you would have said, you know, what are you smoking? You wouldn't have believed it.\n\n\n\nSo, this campaign is just started. We feel very, very good about the number of volunteers that are out there, the energy, the enthusiasm that's going to spread all across the country. And this will go all the way to the convention.\n\n\n\nBLITZER: I remember. I agree with you. Six, seven months ago when he announced, it would have been amazing if somebody had made those predictions. So, what do you attribute to that success?\n\n\n\nTASINI: Well, frankly, and with all due respect, the media did not catch this. It's very simple: Bernie Sanders is calling for political revolution. He is running against somebody who represents the status quo.\n\n\n\nThe status quo is something that nobody in the Democratic circles really likes, and doesn't want to embrace. The status quo represents the banks that we have to break up, the health care system that isn't working for people, and trade agreements that aren't working for people.\n\n\n\nBernie Sanders represents something completely different. And he has ignited people all across the country. I've travelled to all the early states, to Florida. The enthusiasm is just incredible. People sense a chance of supporting Bernie Sanders is changing the future of the country.\n\n\n\nBLITZER: So, Hillary Clinton says she wants to pursue the strategies laid out by President Barack Obama. Bernie Sanders, though, he has a different idea, right?\n\n\n\nTASINI: Yes, absolutely. Look, there are a lot of good things that Barack Obama has done. At every rally I've ever been to and heard Bernie Sanders speak, he said Barack Obama has done very good work and again, in the face of almost united Republican opposition.\n\n\n\n[18:50:00] But Bernie Sanders wants to expand that and essentially take apart a system that is not working for people. So, health care is a great example. He says thank God that Barack Obama got the Affordable Care Act passed. That still leaves 29 (INAUDIBLE) people not covered by that health care plan and we're still paying premiums and co-pays that are outrageous.\n\n\n\nBernie Sanders' plan will save people thousands of dollars. That's completely changing the health care system and that's just indicative of the way he looks at the economy in general and again, it's a political revolution and people are thirsty for that. They really understand that the system is corrupt and they want to change that, and Bernie Sanders represents a movement.\n\n\n\nHe says it's about a movement. It's not just about him. He will be elected, but people have to stay engaged.\n\n\n\nBLITZER: Jonathan Tasini, supporter of Bernie Sanders -- Jonathan, thanks very much for joining us.\n\n\n\nTASINI: Always a pleasure, Wolf.\n\n\n\nBLITZER: All right. Take a look at this. These are live pictures coming in. John Kasich, Jeb Bush, they're at events in New Hampshire right now. Both candidates putting in a lot of work in there.\n\n\n\nAnderson, they're already looking way beyond Iowa. They're not going to do well in Iowa, so they're looking to the next contest a week from tomorrow in New Hampshire.\n\n\n\nANDERSON COOPER, CNN ANCHOR: And it's interesting. I mean, a lot of people are saying, even at the last debate, the GOP debate on FOX, that a lot of the candidates were -- they were in Iowa, John Kasich in particular, they were focused on how they are going to do in New Hampshire and trying to appeal to a New Hampshire audience, and here on this incredibly important day in Iowa. These folks are already in New Hampshire trying to get out the vote there.\n\n\n\nBLITZER: They're trying desperately to get out the vote.\n\n\n\nAll right. We're getting closer and closer to the big moment right now.\n\n\n\nCOOPER: That's right. Caucus sites around the state of Iowa opening at the top of the hour. Coming up next, John King lays out what to look for as the night unfolds. The crucial clues that could spell victory or defeat of a candidate.\n\n\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: You and your campaign speak in general terms about how Ohio has 400 new jobs that's been created.\n\n\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n\n\n[18:56:33] COOPER: Just minutes from now, doors will open at caucus sites across Iowa. This is what it looks like. Iowa voters arriving to their designated meeting places where they'll cast the first ballots in the 2016 presidential race. Voting begins about an hour from now.\n\n\n\nNow, you've heard it before, we're going to say it again. Turnout is obviously key to who wins over the next couple of hours. We're going to start to see the first signs of how the night might end.\n\n\n\nJohn King is here to brief us for what to watch for -- John.\n\n\n\nKING: So, we watch those lines outside. Then, we get the early entrance polls, and we get a little sense of the composition of the electorate, how many young people turned out, how many evangelicals turned out. And then, Anderson, finally, after all this talking, the wall will start to fill in with the results.\n\n\n\nWhat we're looking for? On the Republican side, remember, it's complicated because we have so many candidates. We're expecting, of course, Marco Rubio to be in play tonight if you believe the polls. One of the big question is how does Donald Trump do? And obviously, Ted Cruz, they're in alphabetic order right now, the senator here.\n\n\n\nSo, let's go back to 2012 to say what are we going to look for. See all this gold? This is when Rick Santorum, remember how late that night was, Iowa 2012. Rick Santorum won very late because like Mike Huckabee in 2008, that green is Mike Huckabee, in 2012, Rick Santorum won almost all the small rural counties. That's where you find your evangelicals, your social conservatives, to a degree, the Tea Party voters.\n\n\n\nTed Cruz needs to copy the Santorum map if he is to beat Donald Trump in Iowa tonight. Then you look for Trump. Number one, can he steal some of this? Romney won a few of them, but can Ted Cruz -- Ron Paul won a few too. That's the light orange here.\n\n\n\nCan Ted Cruz essentially infiltrate the evangelical turf and take some of that -- I mean, can Donald Trump, excuse me, do that to Ted Cruz? And then the battle will be on the Romney map. The dark red is where Mitt Romney won in 2012 in the population centers, Polk County, Ames, Cedar Rapids, Davenport and Dubuque.\n\n\n\nBetween Des Moines, Cedar Rapids, Davenport and Dubuque, you have the biggest cities in Iowa, they're not huge, but they're the population centers. Can Donald Trump win those area areas? That's the fight for the suburbs or that's where Marco Rubio is organizing the hardest, along the Romney map. So, watch out and see here. And then, of course, we're going to look for surprises.\n\n\n\nCOOPER: What about on the Democratic side?\n\n\n\nKING: When you get to the Democratic side, let's start in 2008, to make it easier to go back, because if you look now, on the Democratic side now -- let's come over to D's here. Right now, of course, Hillary Clinton, Martin O'Malley, Bernie Sanders have a blank slate.\n\n\n\nFor Bernie Sanders, number one, we're going to look in the college towns. We're going to look in Iowa City. We're going to look in Ames. We know young people are for Bernie Sanders.\n\n\n\nOne of the challenges for the Sanders campaign, Anderson, though, could he get them to leave the college towns and increase his odds in other parts of the state. But let's go back in 2008 because it's instructive. The dark blue is Hillary Clinton.\n\n\n\nWhere did Obama win? Obama won big in the east. Just a little bit of Clinton over here, Dubuque, Cedar Rapids, Iowa City, Davenport. This area is critical. Can Hillary Clinton hold her own in the east, even just splitting this with Bernie Sanders?\n\n\n\nAnd then in the central part of the state, again, Obama won in Ames, which is where you fin the college towns right there. He was huge. That's about 3 percent. And you find traditional Democrats. They tend to be for Hillary Clinton, older Democrats, people involved.\n\n\n\nThis is where to the degree labor union fight will play out here in Polk County. Barack Obama won it big eight years ago, Hillary Clinton was actually third, just behind John Edwards. Hillary Clinton needs to turn the Des Moines area, the dark blue, and she needs to compete with Bernie Sanders out here in the East.\n\n\n\nOne thing I know when I was out there, Anderson, Hillary Clinton the remembers the pain of this.\n\n\n\nCOOPER: Right.\n\n\n\nKING: And they're much better organized. The question is, can organization overcome the Sanders' passion?\n\n\n\nCOOPER: We'll be watching this as the votes start to come in late into the morning. Doors are about to open at caucus sites. Again, the caucusing itself is just an hour away. And then it all becomes real, the first votes of this primary election, the first chance to see not just what people will tell pollsters but what they're willing to do about it when it actually counts. Tonight for the first time in this election, it really does count, which makes this a very big night.\n\n\n\nOur coverage continues right now.

Meadows said Tuesday night that the House Freedom Caucus either wanted to see a one-year defense funding bill attached to the short-term continuing resolution – a nonstarter when the caucus pushed for it in December – or wanted to see Republican leaders include more funding of defense anomalies.\n\nThe Freedom Caucus' tone differed greatly from the mood of the conference hours earlier. As members emerged from leadership's briefing Tuesday night, many rank-and-file members – from defense hawks to fiscal conservatives – seemed reluctant but ready to lend their support if they had to.\n\nThis is moving in the right direction. It buys us time. It presents the Democrats with some tough choices, Rep. Tom Cole, a Republican from Oklahoma, had said.\n\nMembers bemoaned the need for another stopgap measure – the fourth in just six months – but members inside the conference meeting Tuesday night described an atmosphere that was mostly supportive of Republican leaders, who many admitted had little choice than to put another short-term spending bill on the floor.\n\nI thought the reaction was pretty positive even though there were a lot of people saying – and rightfully so – 'God, here we go again,'  said Rep. Mike Simpson, a Republican from Idaho.\n\nWhile longer-term spending negotiations were still ongoing, Democrats have dug in their heels and demanded that no spending caps be agreed to until there is a deal on the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which expires on March 5. Democrats have said they want assurances that DACA recipients are protected before agreeing to an omnibus spending bill, the best leverage they believe they have. And even on the short-term continuing budget resolution, many Democrats say they want an answer on DACA before they vote again to fund the government.\n\nEarlier on Tuesday, Whip Rep. Steny Hoyer, a Democrat from Maryland, said a deal on DACA needed to be part of a funding bill in order to get Democratic support.\n\nThat puts the onus on House leaders, who have to find a way to convince both defense hawks and fiscal conservatives to go along with a short-term spending deal one more time. Republican leaders are expected to formally whip the proposal Wednesday, but the House Freedom Caucus' comments Tuesday cast doubt on the operation, after even some prominent conservatives seemed to be leaning toward supporting the continuing resolution Tuesday before the caucus met.\n\nWhat other option to we have? asked Rep. Mo Brooks, a Republican from Alabama, who said he was leaning yes.\n\nYou're going to vote 'no' and then shut down the government? asked Rep. Mark Sanford, a Republican from South Carolina, when asked if the House Freedom Caucus was doing little more than paving the way for a big increase in spending in a later deal by supporting short-term continuing resolutions.\n\nLeadership also had to convince defense hawks to back another short-term spending bill after they've said repeatedly that they have deep concerns about how that could affect the military.\n\nGOP Rep. Bradley Byrne of Alabama said he was struggling with his vote.\n\nContinuing resolutions are hurting the readiness of our troops, endangering our troops, and for those of us defense hawks, we find it very difficult to support CRs, Byrne said. The alternative is to let the Democrats crash the whole government, and that's what they are trying to do.\n\nIn the Senate, more uncertainty looms. There, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell must win Democratic votes, and many senators were still not saying Tuesday how they'd vote on a short-term continuing resolution.\n\nI'm just tired of voting for CRs, said Sen. Angus King, an independent from Maine who caucuses with the Democrats.

Listen to her plea\n\n'Realest thing I've ever seen' on 'Bachelor:' Lemon reacts to finale twist\n\n(CNN) —\n\nPresident Donald Trump complained Wednesday that he didn't receive a thank you for approving the funeral the late Sen. John McCain wanted, marking his latest grievance in his recent onslaught against the Arizona Republican.\n\nI endorsed him at his request, and I gave him the kind of funeral that he wanted, which as President I had to approve. I don't care about this. I didn't get thank you. That's OK. We sent him on the way. But I wasn't a fan of John McCain, Trump said during a speech Wednesday at a tank factory in Lima, Ohio.\n\nLast year, McCain died of brain cancer, and as part of his services, lay in state in the Capitol building in Washington.\n\nCNN previously reported that the senator, who had been held as a prisoner of war in Vietnam, did not want the President at his funeral. McCain's daughter, Meghan McCain, also revealed earlier this year that she wished Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner, Trump's daughter and son-in-law and senior advisers, had not attended the funeral.\n\nTrump's remark about the funeral came as the President has continued to denigrate the dead senator's legacy.\n\nLast weekend, Trump attacked McCain in several tweets that targeted his ties to the controversial Russia dossier and his vote against repealing Obamacare. He also referred to McCain as being last in his class at the US Naval Academy.\n\nOn Tuesday, he continued his criticism, telling reporters at the White House that I was never a fan of John McCain and I never will be.\n\nThe late senator's widow, Cindy McCain, publicized hateful messages she's been receiving since Trump's tweets, and daughter Meghan McCain has continued to respond to the President online and on ABC's The View, where she's a co-host.\n\nAll the while, a growing number Republican members of Congress have been publicly pushing back on Trump's comments, defending McCain.\n\nIn front of factory workers at the Ohio plant on Wednesday, Trump dedicated a considerable amount of time in his speech to disparaging McCain.\n\nI have to be honest, Trump said, I never liked him much. Hasn't been for me.\n\nHe said he probably never will like McCain, because John McCain received a fake and phony dossier.\n\nHe also dug into McCain's now-famous vote against a repeal of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nWhen he finally had the chance to do it, he voted against repeal and replace, the President said. Remember thumbs down?\n\nOn Tuesday, Trump falsely accused McCain of misleading the White House over how he would vote.\n\nTrump added Wednesday that veterans were on his side during the dispute, because McCain didn't get the job done with the Veterans Administration.\n\nHe also blamed McCain for wars in the Middle East.\n\nHe was calling (President George W.) Bush, President Bush all the time, 'Get into the Middle East! Get in to the Middle East,'  Trump claimed, adding we've lost tremendous health and tremendous lives in that war.\n\nCNN's Nikki Carvajal and Devan Cole contributed to this report.
Washington (CNN) Judge Justin Walker , now nominated to a powerful federal court dubbed the second highest in the nation, remains bitter that the Supreme Court upheld the Affordable Care Act eight years ago.\n\nWalker was serving as a law clerk at the time of the 2012 blockbuster ruling and was infuriated at its resolution. He has continued to reveal disdain for the decision written by Chief Justice John Roberts and offer details about his inside dealings with Justice Anthony Kennedy, one of the dissenters.\n\nThe greatest words you can hear from Justice Kennedy are: 'You're hired,' Walker said at a March 13 investiture ceremony for the district court position he currently holds. And the worst words are: 'The chief justice thinks this might be a tax.'\n\nWhen Roberts cast the decisive vote to uphold the landmark health care law in 2012, he linked its penalty for people who refused to obtain insurance to Congress' taxing power. Roberts' final decision, which came after multiple changes in his reasoning, saved Obamacare but generated intense friction inside and outside the court.\n\nThe views of Walker will be spotlighted Wednesday in the US Senate during his scheduled nomination hearing for the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.\n\nThe DC Circuit stands out among US appeals courts of because of its important regulatory caseload and that it has served as a launching pad for many Supreme Court justices, including Roberts, Kavanaugh, and current Justices Clarence Thomas and Ruth Bader Ginsburg.\n\nThe 37-year-old Walker, who was a University of Louisville law professor before becoming a US district court judge last fall, has drawn opposition because of his limited legal experience and for his firebrand conservatism even after donning the robe. The American Bar Association rated him not qualified for his current judgeship.\n\nIn a recent move, Walker issued an opinion related to drive-in church services and the Louisville mayor's social-distancing order, without hearing first from the mayor. On Holy Thursday, an American mayor criminalized the communal celebration of Easter, Walker declared as he opened his opinion.\n\nFront-row seat to the court's Obamacare drama\n\nSigned by President Barack Obama, who later embraced the Obamacare name, the Affordable Care Act required all Americans to obtain coverage and created a marketplace for purchasing insurance. It also expanded Medicaid for poor people and protected diabetics, cancer patients and other individuals with pre-existing conditions from being denied coverage.\n\nRepublicans opposed the legislation from the start, saying it infringed on individuals and businesses as it aimed to insure millions more Americans and control spiraling medical costs. Texas and other GOP states, which joined the National Federation of Independent Business in the first Obamacare suit known as NFIB v. Sebelius, have continued to challenge provisions of the law.\n\nTrump ran against it as a presidential candidate and his administration is still seeking to void the law, which after a decade has affected nearly every corner of the health care system.\n\nWalker has called Roberts' 2012 opinion indefensible. In his recent remarks at the March investiture, he further revealed an us-versus-them mindset. After thanking McConnell, Kavanaugh and other supporters, he referred to his nomination's opponents, including, he said, the American Bar Association.\n\nThank you for serving as an enduring reminder that although my legal principles are prevalent, they have not yet prevailed, Walker said. And although we are winning, we have not won, and although we celebrate today, we cannot take for granted tomorrow, or we will lose our courts and our country to critics who call us terrifying and describe us as deplorable.\n\nHis demeanor belied Roberts' constant admonition that judges are impartial and non-partisan, ruling without fear or favor.\n\nBut he has enjoyed the longtime backing of McConnell, a Louisville family friend who persuaded Trump to nominate Walker. McConnell has been an unyielding partner to Trump in stocking the federal bench with conservatives.\n\nOn April 3, three weeks after the Louisville investiture and six months after he first took the federal bench, Trump announced that he would elevate Walker, a Harvard law graduate who still serves as a part-time law professor at the University of Louisville, to a coveted seat on the DC Circuit.\n\nWalker did not respond to a CNN request for an interview.\n\nEndorsing Kavanaugh opinion as a 'roadmap'\n\nEight years ago, during the Supreme Court's heated deliberations over the constitutionality of the ACA, the five conservative justices, including Roberts and Kennedy, believed that the individual insurance mandate exceeded Congress' power to regulate interstate commerce. But Roberts thought the invalid provision could be separated from much of the sweeping law.\n\nKennedy, however, joined by fellow conservative Justices Antonin Scalia, Thomas and Samuel Alito, believed the individual mandate was interconnected to other provisions of the new law and would entirely sink it. Law clerks at the time portrayed Walker as vigorously arguing the mandate central to provisions such as those guaranteeing coverage for pre-existing conditions and expanding Medicaid coverage to needy people.\n\nWhen Kennedy and the other justices declined to sever the individual insurance requirement from the rest of the law, Roberts turned to Congress' taxing power as grounds to uphold the mandate, which carried a penalty for people who did not buy insurance. Roberts was joined by the four liberal justices to uphold the law.\n\nWalker in March remarked that it was still the worst thing he ever heard from Kennedy. It was not the first time Walker had referred to the 2012 deliberations in a highly public way. He spoke about the experience in 2018 when he was backing Kavanaugh as a successor to retiring Justice Kennedy.\n\nKavanaugh, as a DC Circuit judge in 2011, had taken up a separate Obamacare dispute that became something of a litmus test among conservatives examining Kavanaugh's record. (Walker was a law clerk to Kavanaugh 2010-2011 but had already moved to the Supreme Court when the DC Circuit issued its ACA ruling.)\n\nIn the DC Circuit case, Kavanaugh rejected a challenge to the ACA on procedural, rather than substantive, grounds. Yet Kavanaugh commented on Obamacare at length, calling it unprecedented and deeming the administration's justification for the individual insurance mandate jarring. He said it could extend to other mandatory purchases such as of college savings accounts and disaster insurance.\n\nDuring right-wing skirmishes over who might succeed Kennedy, Walker vigorously defended Kavanaugh's credentials, especially regarding his ambiguous ACA opinion. In one article, Walker referred to Kavanaugh's thorough and principled takedown of the mandate and asserted that it had even guided dissenting justices in the Supreme Court's 2012 decision.\n\nI am very familiar with that opinion, because I served as Kennedy's law clerk that term, Walker wrote. I can tell you with certainty that the only justices following a roadmap from Brett Kavanaugh were the ones who said Obamacare was unconstitutional.\n\nSome legal observers today say Walker's comments reflect a lack of judiciousness.\n\nUsually the clerks are extremely circumspect about their time working on cases, said Josh Blackman, author of the 2013 book Unprecedented: The Constitutional Challenge to Obamacare and a professor at South Texas College of Law. I was very stunned about how cavalier he was with that issue.\n\nFatima Goss Graves, president of the National Women's Law Center, said his remarks suggest a disregard for precedent. When you put on a robe, there is an expectation for people, and part of that expectation is around the rule of law and a consistency in approach, she said.\n\nDuring the Senate's consideration of Walker for the US trial court spot in 2019, he was guarded about his ACA views.\n\nSen. Dianne Feinstein, the senior Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, asked Walker in a written question about his praise of Kavanaugh for providing a roadmap to strike down the ACA's individual mandate and about Walker's own assertion in a 2018 article that the Supreme Court's ruling was an indefensible decision.\n\nWalker responded in August 2019 that he was opining as an individual outside of the judiciary.\n\nI understand that the role of an academic and a citizen engaged in the political process is different than the role of a judge or a judicial nominee, Walker wrote. The canons of judicial conduct preclude me, in my role as a judicial nominee, from going beyond what I said in the 2018 article.
In the latest blow to Obamacare, Aetna is vastly reducing its presence on the individual exchanges in 2017.\n\nThe insurer will stop offering policies on the exchanges in 11 of the 15 states where it currently operates, according to a press release it issued Monday evening. Aetna (AET) will only sell Obamacare products in Delaware, Iowa, Nebraska and Virginia.\n\nAetna said earlier this month that it was halting its exchange expansion plans for 2017 and reviewing its participation in President Obama's signature health reform program. The company noted Monday that it has lost $430 million in its individual policies unit since the exchanges opened in January 2014.\n\nAetna, which had 838,000 exchange customers at the end of June, said its policyholders are turning out to be sicker and costlier than expected. The company, along with its peers, has criticized the federal program designed to mitigate those risks.\n\nProviding affordable, high-quality health care options to consumers is not possible without a balanced risk pool, said Aetna CEO Mark Bertolini.\n\nThe company will continue to offer individual policies outside of the Obamacare exchanges in the vast majority of markets where it now does business. Off-exchange products are not eligible for federal subsidies.\n\nThe Obama administration said Monday the exchanges are serving 11 million people and have brought down the uninsured rate to the lowest on record.\n\nAetna's decision to alter its marketplace participation does not change the fundamental fact that the health insurance marketplace will continue to bring quality coverage to millions of Americans next year and every year after that, said Kevin Counihan, the exchanges CEO. It's no surprise that companies are adapting at different rates to a market where they compete for business on cost and quality rather than by denying coverage to people with preexisting conditions.\n\nAetna's announcement comes a month after the Department of Justice blocked its merger plans with Humana, as well as Anthem's (ANTX) purchase of Cigna (CI). Anthem has linked its merger with its Obamacare participation.\n\nLike Aetna, a growing number of insurers on the Obamacare exchanges are voicing concerns about the viability of the program as they run up big losses. Many say that their premiums were too low and didn't cover the cost of care because their consumers are far sicker than anticipated.\n\nRelated: Obamacare patients sicker and pricier than expected\n\nSome 11.1 million people are enrolled in Obamacare this year, according to the latest federal statistics.\n\nUnitedHealthcare (UNH), the nation's largest insurer that is expecting to lose about $1 billion on Obamacare policies in 2015 and 2016, is exiting most Obamacare exchanges in 2017. Humana (HUM) announced last month that it was pulling out of nearly 1,200 counties in eight states next year. Afterward, it will only be selling insurance on the exchanges in 156 counties in 11 states. Others, including several Blue Cross Blue Shield companies, are also scaling back.\n\nIt seems increasingly clear that big, national insurers are having trouble competing in the Obamacare marketplaces and making money, said Larry Levitt, senior vice president at the Kaiser Family Foundation. Some insurers are still doing well, particularly those that historically served Medicaid beneficiaries.\n\nRelated: UnitedHealthcare to exit most Obamacare exchanges\n\nLarge insurers aren't the only ones running into trouble. More than half of the co-op insurers, created and funded by the health reform law, have failed. This means consumers in a growing number of areas have only one or two insurers to pick from.\n\nTo cover these sicker patients, many insurers are requesting big premium hikes for 2017, some in the high double digit percentages.\n\nInsurers are requesting premium increases of 9%, on average, for the benchmark silver plan -- upon which federal subsidies are based -- in major cities in 16 states plus the District of Columbia, according to the latest review by the Kaiser Family Foundation. But this masks substantial variation, with requests ranging from a drop of 13% to an increase of 25%. States still have to review the requests and could change them.\n\nLast year, premiums for the benchmark silver plans in these areas increased 2% following the state reviews.\n\nInsurers, including Aetna, have been pressuring the federal government to make changes to the risk programs meant to help insurers that cover high-cost patients. The program requires insurers with healthier-than-average customers to fund payments to peers with sicker-than-average enrollees. Aetna had to pay into the risk adjustment program in 2014 and 2015.\n\nUnder the program, customers' health status is based on diagnoses of chronic costly conditions, such as diabetes and HIV. But insurers argue that enrollees' use of prescription drugs, particularly expensive specialty drugs, should be included in the formula.\n\nThe Department of Health & Human Services is starting to make changes, including taking drug utilization into account. Last week, it said it will propose modifying the risk adjustment program to absorb some of the cost for claims above a certain threshold, funded by payments from all insurers.\n\nObamacare's biggest problems lie in the risk mitigation efforts, said Timothy Jost, an emeritus professor at Washington and Lee University School of Law. In addition to the risk adjustment program, there were two other initiatives aimed at helping insurers cover high-cost patients. But both are ending this year.\n\nI think the market will stabilize, and perhaps Aetna and United will come back, said Jost. But the market really needs support for another few years until it does, and since the majority in Congress is rooting for [the Affordable Care Act] to fail, it seems unlikely that the support will be forthcoming.\n\nIn announcing the withdrawal, Bertolini left the door open for Aetna to return to the exchanges if the federal government makes improvements to the program.\n\n[We] remain hopeful that we can work with policymakers from both parties on a sustainable public exchange model that meets the needs of the uninsured, he said. The company may expand our footprint in the future should there be meaningful exchange-related policy improvements.
(CNN) Democrats' slim majorities in both the House and Senate are testing President Joe Biden's ability to get his priorities through Congress, as lawmakers turn their attention to legislative work beyond relief from the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nBiden's $1.9 trillion stimulus package , was voted out of the House Wednesday and onto Biden's desk, after a difficult passage in the Senate, while Democrats are also still working to confirm his nominees for key administrative posts.\n\nAs a 36-year veteran of the Senate and former vice president, Biden has maintained that he will work with both sides of the aisle. Although the President has already taken a flurry of executive actions , some priorities need to be cemented with legislation to avoid possible reversal by his successors.\n\nHere are some key legislative issues Congress and Biden are likely to confront in the days ahead:\n\nMinimum wage\n\nJUST WATCHED Top House progressive: Minimum wage must be in relief bill Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Top House progressive: Minimum wage must be in relief bill 06:20\n\nDespite some state and local governments increasing their minimum wages, the legislative drive to increase the wage has stalled in Congress, where Democrats were in the minority in either the House or Senate, or both, from 2010 until this year.\n\nNow, with narrow majorities in both chambers and Biden in the White House, Democrats are renewing the push. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders' proposal to get a federal $15 minimum wage increase from $7.25 back into Biden's Covid relief bill failed last week, with eight Democrats siding with Republicans to vote down the amendment. The Senate Parliamentarian had ruled the hike could not be included in the measure under the strict rules of budget reconciliation.\n\nArizona Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, one of the eight Democrats who voted against Sanders' amendment, said in a statement that she is open to having a separate debate in Congress over the minimum wage, just not through this reconciliation process being used to pass Covid relief.\n\nBut the defeat shed light on the hurdles progressives will face in passing a $15 minimum wage legislation and a new path forward is unclear. An unlikely option is to introduce a separate bill and try to get enough senators on board to clear the 60-vote threshold, but Democrats are not fully united behind the proposal. An even more difficult option would be to eliminate the filibuster, which would lower the 60-vote threshold, and therefore require fewer votes to pass the minimum wage legislation.\n\nWhite House Senior Adviser Cedric Richmond said during a CBSN interview on Monday that the White House will keep pushing for the $15 minimum wage increase and that Biden believes he can work with both sides to get work done, preferring not to change filibuster rules.\n\nInfrastructure\n\nTalks for bipartisan legislation on improving roads, railway systems and other infrastructure needs could be back on the table, especially due to the climate crisis and after winter storms crippled Southern states and Texas.\n\nInfrastructure has been viewed as a bipartisan opportunity by both sides, but the issue faltered during the Trump administration. Talks around an infrastructure plan with Trump and Republicans broke down in 2019 and the repeated claims by the White House that the coming week would be infrastructure week became a running joke for Democrats and Republicans alike. The former President tweeted at the beginning of the pandemic that he was open to an infrastructure package to boost the economy, but the House passed a $1.5 trillion infrastructure bill in July with only three Republicans supporting it and the measure stalled in the then-GOP controlled Senate.\n\nStill, infrastructure is widely seen as the most likely area where the two parties could strike a deal.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer told reporters Sunday that the next legislative objective would be to pass Biden's Build Back Better plan, calling it a massive infrastructure bill.\n\nRep. John Yarmuth, chairman of the House Budget Committee, said Tuesday that Democrats will use every option available to them to pass the upcoming infrastructure bill, but the hope is they will be able to build a bipartisan package that can be passed without using reconciliation. That would mean the legislation would need to garner at least 10 Republican votes in the Senate.\n\nAfter a meeting with a bipartisan group of senators and Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg last month , Sen. Jim Inhofe, an Oklahoma Republican, told reporters it was a very good meeting and that there are mutual interests among both sides as long as no one tries to take the bill hostage.\n\nImmigration\n\nBiden took sweeping executive action on immigration shortly after being sworn in, moving swiftly to undo many Trump administration policies. But he told reporters at the time, There's a long way to go on the issue, and acknowledged that legislation was needed for a lot of his priorities.\n\nImmigrant advocacy groups are urging the Biden administration to move quickly, and the White House announced last month an immigration bill that would provide an eight-year path to citizenship for millions of immigrants already in the country and provide a faster track for undocumented immigrants brought to the US as children. Biden's proposed bill, if passed, also would remove the word alien from US immigration laws, replacing it with the term noncitizen.\n\nThe legislative effort comes as there are multiple standalone bills in Congress aimed at revising smaller pieces of the country's immigration system -- and the administration has said they'd leave it up to Congress whether it passes a standalone bill or break it up into multiple pieces. Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin, an Illinois Democrat, and Sen. Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican, for example, have reintroduced their DREAM Act, which would provide a path to citizenship for immigrants who came to the country illegally as children.\n\nBiden's legislation faces an uphill climb in a narrowly divided Congress, where House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has just a small margin and Senate Democrats do not have the 60 Democratic votes needed to pass the measure with just their party's support.\n\nThe administration is also grappling with a surge of unaccompanied migrant children at the US-Mexico border that are being held in US Border Patrol facilities. Richmond said during an interview on MSNBC Tuesday that he is hopeful Republicans will work with Democrats on addressing immigration, but the administration will not let obstruction get in the way of values and progress and this is something we're going to have to work on.\n\nGun safety\n\nBiden campaigned on strengthening gun safety measures, and on the third anniversary of the deadly Parkland shooting earlier this month, Biden called on Congress to enact commonsense gun law reforms, including widespread firearm sales background checks and a ban on assault weapons.\n\nCongress has long struggled with addressing gun violence in America, even in the wake of mass shootings going back to Columbine in 1999. But Democrats reintroduced the Background Check Expansion Act, gun control legislation which would expand background checks for all firearm sales or transfers in the country. The likelihood of actually passing the bill remains small and it would need significant Republican support to overcome a legislative filibuster.\n\nDemocratic Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut, who is sponsoring the Senate version of the plan, told CNN in a phone interview last week, Obviously this isn't going to be easy and we're gonna need the White House's help to get it across the finish line, but I truly believe this is the year to get it done.\n\nAnd Democratic Rep. Mike Thompson, who reintroduced the House version of this legislation, told CNN in an interview he hopes this legislation would actually reach Biden's desk.\n\nI'm hopeful. Sen. Murphy, I'm working closely with him. He's working real hard over (in the Senate), Thompson said.\n\nOn Thursday, the House will vote on legislation aimed to expand background checks on all commercial gun sales, including the Bipartisan Background Checks Act of 2021 and the Enhanced Background Checks Act of 2021.\n\nReauthorizing the Violence Against Women Act\n\nCongress took another step on Monday toward reauthorizing the legislation Biden cosponsored as a senator in 1994 and expired in 2018.\n\nTexas Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, a Democrat, introduced the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2021 along with fellow Democratic Rep. Jerry Nadler of New York and Pennsylvania Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick, the only Republican supporting the bill so far and who also co-sponsored the House-passed bill in 2019.\n\nReauthorizing the VAWA had stalled in both chambers since it expired, with Republicans and Democrats introducing their own versions of a reauthorization bill during the previous Congress. Both sides have accused each other of playing politics with it and the sensitive issue of domestic abuse.\n\nThe new bill builds upon the previous versions of the VAWA by providing grants and support to various groups that work on issues relating to sexual assault, domestic violence and prevention, expanding protections, among other things.\n\nA provision that would close the  boyfriend loophole , prohibiting dating partners convicted of assault or stalking from purchasing firearms, has been a sticking point between Democrats and Republicans. The new bill would prohibit those convicted of misdemeanor stalking from buying a firearm and makes it illegal for a person to transfer or sell a firearm or ammunition to a person they believe has been convicted of misdemeanor stalking.\n\nBiden, who campaigned on enacting reauthorization of the VAWA, applauded reintroduction of the bill in a statement Monday night, urging Congress to come together in a bipartisan manner to ensure swift passage in both chambers. Sens. Patrick Leahy of Vermont and Dianne Feinstein of California, both members of the Judiciary Committee, said in a joint statement that they support the House version of the bill and look forward to working with Durbin to advance this important legislation.\n\nHealth care\n\nThe President pledged to make health care more affordable and available for all Americans. Last month, he signed an executive order that gives uninsured Americans who want to buy Affordable Care Act coverage another three months to do so, opening the federal Obamacare exchange for a special enrollment period, which he tied to the pandemic.\n\nBut although he can implement some of his health care plans with the stroke a pen, other issues he campaigned on -- like instituting a government-backed public option and increasing federal premium subsidies -- will take congressional action. That will be a challenge since Biden can't afford to lose a single Democrat in the Senate -- and few in the House, after his party lost seats in the chamber.\n\nBut among his top priorities is first saving the Affordable Care Act, on which his health care promises rely.
Editor's Note: Cecile Richards is president of the Planned Parenthood Action Fund. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author.\n\n(CNN) —\n\nOne year ago, I took a flight from Miami to Washington, hoping to arrive in time for the Women's March the next morning. Our flight attendant leaned over to me and asked, Do you think it's going to make any difference, this march? She wore a pin commemorating her 20 years of airline service, and I could hear the skepticism in her voice. I understood her uncertainty – was the anger and passion shared by so many women across America in the wake of the 2016 presidential election enough to inspire real change?\n\nThe truth was, I had no idea.\n\nCecile Richards\n\nAs we found out, no one could have predicted the magnitude of the next day. Marches erupted across the country and on every continent. Several reports said it was likely the largest demonstration on record in the United States, dwarfing the inaugural crowd the day before. By some estimates as many as 4 million people just felt they had to march. So they picked up their signs, left home and spoke with their feet.\n\nSo many people remember where they were that day. In Washington, marchers packed the National Mall for as far as the eye could see. And it wasn't just women, either. Folks from every walk of life came out to say, This is my issue, too. A young man carried one of my favorite posters: I'm proud to be marching with the future president of the US – I don't know who she is, but I know she is here!\n\nBeyond Washington, thousands of people held up signs in Salt Lake City, record-breaking crowds gathered in Texas, and Alaskans of all ages weathered subzero temperatures in Fairbanks to show their support. The best part is that these marches were just the beginning.\n\nIn the 12 months since January 21, 2017, women have been organizing and agitating like never before. The pussy hat has become an international symbol of the resistance. Homegrown women's groups are popping up everywhere, from Phoenix to Kenosha, Wisconsin. Tried and true political organizations such as Emily's List have seen record numbers of women expressing interest in running for office – more than 26,000 since the 2016 election, according to Emily's List President Stephanie Schriock. And women have been a driving force behind scrappy startups such as Swing Left and Run for Something, which are changing the electoral landscape by bringing in new candidates with fresh perspectives.\n\nPhotos: Women's March on Washington PHOTO: Mark Kauzlarich for CNN A large crowd walks down Pennsylvania Avenue after the start of the Women's March on Washington on Saturday, January 21, 2017. Organizers said the march is sending a message to Donald Trump that women's rights are human rights. Similar protests unfolded across the country.

Prev Next\n\nFueled by the energy of that day – and this administration's unrelenting assault on the rights of just about anyone not deemed white or male or straight enough – women are feeling their power in ways unimaginable the day before the marches.\n\nThe first test came when President Donald Trump and Congress pledged to repeal Obamacare and defund Planned Parenthood. House Speaker Paul Ryan promised it would happen by early February, just days after Trump would take office. Any other year, with Republicans controlling both chambers and the executive branch, that might have happened. But women and young people led the revolt, knowing that Trumpcare would take aim at maternity benefits, family planning and affordable health care.\n\nWomen in pink hats and T-shirts flooded town hall meetings, demanding answers. Members of Congress couldn't handle the heat and started avoiding their own constituents. An avalanche of angry callers bore down on the congressional switchboard. An analysis by Democratic pollsters Lake Research Partners examined the usage of the popular app Daily Action, which directly connects people to their representatives, and showed that 86% of calls made to lawmakers in the months immediately after the march were coming from – you guessed it – women.\n\nThe idea of defunding Planned Parenthood and repealing Obamacare was so unpopular that, just before the legislation came to a vote, a USA Today/Suffolk University poll found that only 12% of Americans supported Trumpcare.\n\nTwelve months after this fight began, not only are Planned Parenthood's doors still open across the country, but millions in America have kept their coverage. It's no coincidence that two Republican women, Sens. Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski, held strong with the entire Democratic Senate caucus (and were then joined by Sen. John McCain) to stop the legislation that would have ended affordable health care for so many.\n\nWomen aren't only affecting policy; they are determining election outcomes. In the two most closely watched races since the 2016 election, women of color turned out and made history. The Democratic sweep in Virginia and the election of Sen. Doug Jones in Alabama – after a race in which his opponent was accused of sexually abusing young women (allegations he denied) – defied what many believed was possible a year ago.\n\nDemocrats flipped 15 seats in the Virginia House of Delegates. Eleven of those races were won by women, including the first openly transgender state legislator, the first Vietnamese-American legislator, and the first two Latinas to serve in the House of Delegates.\n\nMore broadly, women are shaking the foundations of our culture. Since day one of this administration, women have been persisting, reclaiming our time and saying once and for all that #TimesUp. The radical power of the #MeToo movement has demonstrated that we are done accepting the status quo. It's time. An America where everyone has an equal shot at success means our country is more likely to live up to its promise.\n\nA year after the Women's March, I wish I could find my flight attendant friend and ask her what she thinks. I hope she's seen for herself the power of women standing up and taking charge. I hope she exercises her own power to vote. And I hope she knows that when she does, she won't be alone.\n\nToday, women are the most potent political force in this country. The Women's March sparked a movement, and an unstoppable one at that. We're changing everything: our policies, our culture and our media – and come November, we're going to change our representatives in office.
(CNN)– Hillary Clinton abrazó el legado político del presidente Barack Obama el domingo, tratando de detener una oleada de feroces ataques de su rival, Bernie Sanders, en el debate presidencial demócrata.\n\nCon Sanders amenazando con trastornar a Clinton en las dos primeras elecciones primarias del próximo mes, la ex secretaria de Estado trató de detener su impulso, mermar sus credenciales progresistas y plantear interrogantes acerca de si el autoproclamado socialista tiene las habilidades y la experiencia para ser presidente.\n\nClinton utilizó el último debate antes de las votaciones en Iowa y New Hampshire -el 1 y el 9 de febrero respectivamente- para dirigirse a los fieles partidarios de Obama, quienes según algunos aliados de Clinton podrían estar cambiando sus preferencias hacia Sanders.\n\nSanders, por su parte, estuvo mucho más cómodo en el ataque a Clinton que en sus anteriores encuentros, y la noche en Charleston, Carolina del Sur, fue notable más por sus enfrentamientos personales que por los ataques contra los republicanos. Él se defendió de Clinton insistiendo en que Obama era su amigo y le dio un golpe a la precandidata por sus relaciones con Wall Street desde que dejó el Departamento de Estado.\n\n«No recibo dinero de los grandes bancos, que no recibo pagos personales de Goldman Sachs por discursos», dijo Sanders.\n\nChoques sobre programa de salud y armas\n\npublicidad\n\nClinton advirtió que el plan de Sanders de un Medicare para la atención universal aumentaría los impuestos a la clase media, reabriría el amargo debate con los republicanos y podría poner en peligro el Obamacare.\n\nSanders respondió furioso, ya que después de luchar por la atención sanitaria universal durante décadas, ahora estaba siendo acusado de sabotear el Obamacare.\n\n«Nadie está destruyendo esto, vamos a seguir adelante», dijo Sanders, quejándose de que 29 millones de estadounidenses todavía carecen de atención sanitaria.\n\nClinton también atacó a su rival por votar «con la NRA –la Asociación Nacional del Rifle-, con el lobby de las armas, en numerosas ocasiones», y desgranó una lista de ocasiones en las que dijo que el senador de Vermont se puso del lado de los fabricantes de armas.\n\nSanders rechazó su lista de cargos. «Creo que la secretaria Clinton sabe que lo que dice es muy falso», dijo.\n\nEl intercambio fue un momento de gran tensión, en un escenario ubicado muy cerca de la iglesia en Charleston donde un autoproclamado supremacista blanco mató a nueve afroamericanos en un tiroteo el año pasado.\n\nLa carrera\n\nLa estrategia de Clinton de aproximarse al legado de Obama se dio, irónicamente, en un estado donde ambos se enfrentaron amargamente durante la campaña de 2008. Ocho años más tarde, los votantes afroamericanos en el estado podrían proporcionarle un cortafuegos contra la subida de Sanders en las encuestas.\n\nRecientes encuestas en Iowa y New Hampshire muestran a Clinton en una posición cada vez más precaria. Una encuesta de Des Moines Register / Bloomberg Política colocó a Clinton a solo dos puntos en Iowa la semana pasada. Una encuesta realizada por la Universidad de Monmouth en New Hampshire puso a Sanders por delante con una ventaja de 14 puntos.\n\nSanders intentó desbalancear a Clinton sobre su rápido aumento en las encuestas en el último mes, desatando los temores entre algunos partidarios de Clinton de que la historia se repita, después de que su campaña de 2008 fracasó cuando el entonces senador Obama ganó en Iowa.\n\nEl senador señaló que cuando comenzó la campaña, «ella estaba 50 puntos por delante.\n\nClinton aún mantiene una amplia ventaja sobre Sanders a nivel nacional. Una nueva encuesta nacional de NBC / Wall Street Journal el domingo mostró Clinton sobre Sanders con el 59% y el 34% de las preferencias respectivamente, y con el tercer candidato en la carrera, el exgobernador de Maryland, Martin O'Malley, con el 2%.\n\nLa decisión de Clinton de unirse tan estrechamente a Obama podría ser arriesgada si Clinton gana la nominación y llega a enfrentarse a los republicanos. Mientras que los índices de aprobación del presidente son muy altos entre los demócratas, la mayoría de los estadounidenses todavía desaprueba el trabajo que está haciendo, por lo que los acontecimientos en la economía y en todo el mundo podrían dejar a Clinton vulnerable por la asociación con su legado.

Jeb Bush said the Senate did not give President Barack Obama the authorization he asked for to use military force against ISIS.\n\nWe shouldn't have the warfighters have their arms tied behind their back as President Obama wanted to do, but they had a chance to show support and it wasn't popular at the time, Bush said.\n\nLast February, the White House proposed a resolution which asked Congress to authorize the limited use of the United States Armed Forces to fight ISIS alongside the anti-ISIS coalition, but did not go so far as to authorize putting American soldiers on the ground.\n\nNeither the Senate nor the House brought the resolution up for a vote – and it is still sitting on Capitol Hill.\n\nLast month, the President once again called upon Congress to vote on his resolution.\n\nIf Congress believes, as I do, that we are at war with ISIL, it should go ahead and vote to authorize the continued use of military force against these terrorists, he said, using an another term for ISIS.\n\nIt should be noted that the actions that the President's resolution would legalize were already underway and will continue whether or not Congress votes on this draft.\n\nWe rate Bush's claim as true because Congress did not bring the resolution up for a vote.\n\nFlorida Sen. Marco Rubio then pushed back against Bush, saying, The authorization that Barack Obama asked for was not against ISIS, it was against (Syrian President Bashar al-) Assad. John Kerry described it as attacks that would be unbelievably small. I don't think the United States should be engaged in symbolic military activity. It was not against ISIS, it was against Assad.\n\nObama did, in fact, go to Congress in August 2013 to ask for authorization to strike the government of Assad in retaliation for a chemical weapons attack. That resolution was never passed by either chamber but was presented to the Senate after passing through a Senate committee.\n\nWe rate Rubio's claim that Obama's resolution was not about targeting ISIS as false, but we also rate his claim that Obama also asked Congress to authorize the use of force against Assad as true.\n\nReality Check: Bush says you can buy his book for $2.99 on Amazon\n\nBy Gisela Crespo, CNN\n\nA quick look on Amazon shows the Kindle version of Bush's 2013 book, Immigration Wars: Forging an American Solution, goes for $11.99. The hardcover is priced at $18.78 and the paperback is $13.17. However, you can get a used copy for as little as 50 cents.\n\nWhen it comes to the price of his book, at least used, we rate Bush's statement as true.\n\nAs for Immigration Wars not being a bestseller, it's true: it ranks #346,025 on the Amazon bestsellers list.\n\nRand Paul\n\nReality Check: Paul on bulk data intelligence program not stopping terrorism\n\nBy Ryan Browne, CNN\n\nKentucky Sen. Rand Paul said, The bulk collection of your phone data, the invasion of your privacy, did not stop one terrorist attack. I don't think you have to give up your liberty for a false sense of security. When we look at this bulk collection – the court has looked at this – even the court declared it to be illegal. If we want to collect the records of terrorists, let's do it the old fashioned way. Let's use the Fourth Amendment.\n\nThe National Security Agency's bulk collection of American telephone metadata, which included the telephone numbers that originate and receive calls, as well as the time and date of those calls but not their content, has proven controversial. There has been robust debate as to whether it has actually contributed to the prevention of terrorist attacks.\n\nObama had strongly defended the Internet and phone data collections, saying in 2013 the programs have saved lives and thwarted at least 50 terror threats. However, in testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee, former NSA Deputy Director John Inglis admitted that the number of cases where the program was used was actually 13. The program was terminated last year.\n\nGeoffrey Stone, a member of the review committee appointed by the White House to examine the program, said in an interview with NBC News that the committee found that the bulk data collection program by itself could not be credited with stopping any really big attacks.\n\nThe New America Foundation conducted an in-depth analysis of 225 terrorists that had been apprehended since 9/11, and the study found that the contribution of NSA's bulk surveillance programs to these cases was minimal.\n\nBut experts caution that that's the way intelligence works: many intelligence collection operations operate with multiple intelligence techniques that serve as redundancies.\n\nNo one program is typically responsible for stopping an attack, so it is impossible to say with certainty that the program by itself stopped an attack that could not have been prevented with more conventional methods.\n\nVerdict: True.\n\nChris Christie\n\nReality Check: Christie on New Jersey job growth\n\nBy Tami Luhby, CNNMoney\n\nNew Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who has been attacked on his stewardship of the Garden State, bragged that in 2015, New Jersey has had the best year of job growth that our state has ever had in the last 15 years.\n\nHe's correct. The Garden State added 65,200 jobs last year, according to federal Bureau of Labor Statistics data. The next best performance was in 2012, when New Jersey employers added 44,000 jobs.\n\nStill, New Jersey's job growth was rather mediocre when compared to other states. In December, the state ranked 24th in year-over-year job growth, according to Arizona State University's School of Business.\n\nVerdict: True.\n\nBen Carson\n\nReality Check: Carson on absurd government regulations\n\nBy Marshall Cohen, CNN\n\nRetired neurosurgeon Ben Carson had a lot to say about the far-flung reach of the federal government.\n\nWell, as anyone knows who's been listening to me, I'm very much against the government being involved in every aspect of our lives, Carson said. Last year, there was an additional 81,000 pages of government regulations. If you stack that up, it would be a three-story building. This is absolutely absurd.\n\nAccording to the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a libertarian-leaning think tank, there were in fact 81,611 pages of new government rules, proposed rules, regulatory notices and executive orders in 2015. The group, which says it opposes onerous government regulation, notes that 2015 set a record for pages of new federal regulations.\n\nSo, would all those pages really stack up as tall as a three-story building?\n\nWe borrowed a ream of paper from the newsroom copier (500 sheets) and measured it to be two inches thick. The average building story height is 10 feet. So, if you do the math, a three-story building would be about as tall as 90,000 sheets of paper. That's pretty close to the height of an imaginary stack of new regulations.\n\nVerdict: True.\n\nMarco Rubio\n\nReality Check: Rubio on Cruz's budget votes\n\nBy Kevin Liptak, CNN\n\nRubio sought to discredit the national security record of his Republican colleague Sen. Ted Cruz by claiming the only budget that Ted has voted for is a budget that Rand Paul sponsored that brags about cutting defense spending.\n\nRubio's claim harkens back to a 2013 amendment introduced by Paul that would have set defense spending levels at what, on paper, was a lower level than in previous years.\n\nPaul, who has warned against big government and overspending, did tout the measure as a way to shrink the military.\n\nThe budget seeks to reduce the size and scope of the military complex, including its global footprint to one that is more in line with a policy of containment, he wrote at the time.\n\nBut the bill came after mandatory across-the-board cuts, known as sequestration, were enacted that slashed defense spending. Taking into account the lower levels under the sequester, Paul's plan actually increased spending on the military.\n\nRubio's claim that the 2013 vote is the only budget Cruz has supported also begs scrutiny. When Rubio made a similar claim in a Fox Business debate, Cruz fired back that he supported one of Rubio's own budget amendments that increased military spending to $697 billion.\n\nCruz was right: he voted for the measure in March 2015, though it ultimately failed to garner enough support for passage.\n\nRubio's claim that Cruz supported Paul's budget – which was advertised as reducing the size of the military, but which actually increased defense spending – is true. But his assertion that Cruz hasn't supported other measures is false, since he supported Rubio's own bill that increased spending.\n\nReality Check: Rubio claims he never supported cap-and-trade\n\nBy Marshall Cohen, CNN\n\nAsked about environmental policy, Rubio said he has never supported cap-and-trade, a policy designed to drive down pollution by creating a regulated market for carbon emissions.\n\nIf they're going to impose this on us, we better prepare to protect the state from it, Rubio said, referring to efforts in Florida to create a cap-and-trade program. I have never supported cap-and-trade, and I never thought it was a good idea, and I was clear about that at the time.\n\nHis record at the time is clear – but it's not what he claimed Thursday night at the debate.\n\nIn March 2008, Rubio told a local TV station that he believed cap-and-trade was inevitable on the federal level, and therefore, Florida should act quickly to become an early complier so it can help influence what that cap-and-trade looks like.\n\nHe went on to propose giving the Florida Department of Environmental Protection a mandate to design a cap-and-trade, or a carbon tax program, and bring it back to the legislature for ratification. Months later, Rubio presided over a unanimous vote in the Florida House to do just that, according to the Tampa Bay Times.\n\nSo, Rubio's claim at the debate that he never supported cap-and-trade is false. He might not support the idea now, but he helped pave the way for Florida to create a cap-and-trade system when he was a state lawmaker.\n\nTed Cruz\n\nReality Check: Cruz on Obamacare as a job-killer\n\nBy Tami Luhby, CNNMoney\n\nBlasting Obamacare fell to Texas Sen. Ted Cruz on Thursday night.\n\nIt is the biggest job-killer in this country, Cruz said. Millions of Americans have lost their jobs, have been forced into part-time work.\n\nIn fact, Obamacare is not a job-killer, according to the 2015 Kaiser Family Founation/Health Research and Education Trust survey released in September 2015.\n\nThe report showed that only 4% of employers with at least 50 employees said they shifted some staffers to part-time hours so they wouldn't qualify for health care, and another 4% said they were reducing the number of full-time employees they planned to hire because of the cost of health benefits. Kaiser found that 10% of employers reported that they were changing workers from part-time to full-time status to enable them to obtain coverage.\n\nAn ADP Research Institute study had similar findings. One reason may be that the economy has been improving. Some companies interviewed by ADP said they may increase their part-timers' hours to retain talent and reduce training costs.\n\nAs to whether employers are cutting jobs because of Obamacare, it's nearly impossible to determine from Labor Department data since the economy is recovering and adding jobs. The number of people who can only find part-time jobs has declined in recent years, signifying companies are hiring more full-time workers.\n\nVerdict: False.\n\nReality Check: Cruz on naval power\n\nBy Jamie Crawford, CNN\n\nClaiming that the United States military has been dramatically downgraded during the Obama administration, Cruz said that when the first Gulf War began in 1991, the United States had 529 ships. Today, we have 272.\n\nThat figure appears to be correct, according to the Navy's Naval History and Heritage Command website, which tracks the size of the navy going back to the 19th century.\n\nUnder the section U.S. Navy Active Ship Force Levels, the site says there were 529 active ships in the Navy as of September 30, 1991. The Gulf War took place in January 1991. For the record, the site claims there were 570 active ships as of September 30, 1990, less than two months after Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait and launched the international crisis that eventually led to the war.\n\nThe Navy's website keeps tabs on the current force structure and says there are currently 273 deployable ships in the U.S. arsenal.\n\nAccording to the Navy, the Navy decommissioned many older ships after the end of the Cold War in 1991, a decision that led to a smaller overall fleet. Ship levels also were not greatly increased in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks as older surface warships have been replaced at a less than one-to-one ratio.\n\nWhile the numbers Cruz cited of naval power are correct, the decline of ship power took place over the course of two decades and multiple presidential administrations, and not just the past seven years, as Cruz posited.\n\nVerdict: True, but misleading.\n\nReality Check: Cruz on carpet bombing\n\nBy Lisa Rose, CNN\n\nDuring a discussion of ISIS, Cruz offered a military history lesson: You want to know what carpet bombing is? It's what we did in the first Persian Gulf War. One thousand, one hundred air attacks a day, saturation bombing that utterly destroyed the enemy.\n\nCruz is wrong in his characterization of the Gulf War bombing campaign. The air attacks conducted during the Gulf War were precision-targeted, with laser-guided bombs designed to hit enemy fighters and minimize collateral damage. That is the mirror opposite of carpet bombing, which is an indiscriminate attack blanketing an area with explosives. The United States hasn't engaged in attacks that could be described as carpet bombing since the Vietnam War. In 1977, the Geneva Conventions adopted a protocol that banned indiscriminate air attacks of cities and towns with large concentrations of civilians.\n\nThe term carpet bombing dates back to World War II, when the Allies bombarded broad swaths of Nazi Germany and Japan, killing thousands of civilians. As technology advanced, enabling the military to conduct more precise airstrikes, the United States shifted towards narrowly targeted attacks. During the Gulf War, the United States used smart weapons systems designed to carry out attacks with surgical accuracy.\n\nThe Texas senator, who has never served in the military, has used the carpet bombing line several times over the course of the campaign. During the CNN GOP debate in December, moderator Wolf Blitzer asked Cruz if he would carpet bomb the ISIS-held city of Raqqa.\n\nCruz said, You would carpet bomb where ISIS is, not a city, but the location of the troops. You use air power directed and you have embedded special forces to direct the air power. But the object isn't to level a city. The object is to kill the ISIS terrorists.\n\nCruz is wrong that the U.S. used carpet bombing in the first Persian Gulf War. To do so would have been a war crime.\n\nVerdict: False.\n\nMike Huckabee\n\nReality Check: Huckabee on manufacturing jobs\n\nBy Tami Luhby, CNNMoney\n\nFormer Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee said the nation has lost 5 million manufacturing jobs just since the year 2000.\n\nThat's true. There were 12.3 million manufacturing workers in the U.S. last month, down from 17.3 million at the start of 2000, according to the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nHuckabee went on to say he visited Newton, Iowa, where workers lost their jobs in 2007 after Maytag's washer-dryer facility went out of business. All those jobs went to Mexico, he said.\n\nThat's not so true. Maytag, which was headquartered in Newton, was bought by Whirlpool in 2006. Whirlpool shuttered the Maytag factory and shifted production to Whirlpool's existing factories in Mexico and Ohio, according to a 2007 New York Times story.\n\nVerdict: True on the loss of manufacturing jobs, but false on all of Newton's Maytag jobs going to Mexico.\n\nCarly Fiorina\n\nReality Check: Fiorina on Planned Parenthood\n\nBy Sonam Vashi, CNN\n\nPlanned Parenthood engages in partial-birth abortion, in late term abortion, former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina said. They alter those abortion techniques to harvest and sell body parts, they have admitted that they are not going to accept compensation for this anymore.\n\nOver the summer, a conservative group called the Center for Medical Progress released undercover videos and accused Planned Parenthood of performing partial birth abortions and selling fetal tissue.\n\nPartial birth abortions are illegal, and Planned Parenthood has repeatedly denied that it performs partial birth abortions, or that it has participated in any illegal activity. On Monday, a Texas grand jury investigation into Planned Parenthood cleared the group, instead indicting two members of the Center for Medical Progress who secretly recorded Planned Parenthood members.\n\nOfficials in 11 states have cleared Planned Parenthood of wrongdoing, according to the organization. Officials in another eight states declined to even investigate the accusations made by the Center for Medical Progress.\n\nPlanned Parenthood has said that money it accepts for fetal tissue is used to cover costs, not to generate profit. In October, the group announced that it would no longer accept any reimbursements for fetal tissue used for research.\n\nPlanned Parenthood does not engage in partial birth abortions, and they do not sell tissue for any profit (although they have now said they will not accept any reimbursement whatsoever).\n\nVerdict: False.\n\nReality Check: Fiorina on the Department of Veterans Affairs\n\nBy Sonam Vashi, CNN\n\nFiorina said, The American people got a bill passed through Congress that said we could fire the top 400 senior executives at the V.A. For dereliction of duty, when we know that 307,000 veterans have died waiting for health care and the V.A. Handed out $142 million worth of bonuses for superb performances.\n\nLet's unpack her statements:\n\nThe bill to which Fiorina is referring, the Veterans Affairs Management Accountability Act of 2014, would give authority to the secretary of the VA to fire about 400 senior executives for poor performance. The bill passed the House in May 2014 but has since been sitting in the Senate.\n\nSo Fiorina's claim that the bill has passed through Congress is false.\n\nThe 307,000 number comes from a Veterans Affairs report released last September and it represents the number of pending records that belonged to veterans who had died in previous months. However, that number does not necessarily represent veterans who were actively seeking treatment in VA health care, according to the VA's inspector general.\n\nDue to problems with the VA database, some of those records include people who died before the VA had even started its health care enrollment system, or people who did not apply for health care benefits specifically. To say definitively that 307,000 people have died waiting for health care may be a stretch, so we rate her claim as it's complicated.\n\nAnd in November 2015, USA Today reported that the VA had given out $142 million in bonuses to employees in 2014, as incentives or tied to performance reviews. That claim is true.\n\nRick Santorum\n\nReality Check: Santorum on Americans without college degrees\n\nBy Lisa Rose, CNN\n\nPresenting himself as a working class advocate, former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum said the other candidates are ignoring a large swath of the populace. He declared that 74% of Americans don't have college degrees.\n\nSantorum, who has two postgraduate degrees, mentioned the same stat during the last debate two weeks ago, and our verdict was false.\n\nBut let's check our numbers again. There are 209.3 million Americans aged 25 and older, according to the 2014 Census, and 142.4 million of them have not attained a bachelor's degree or higher. That's 68% of Americans, not 74%.\n\nDuring an appearance on Face the Nation in April, Santorum said that he would champion the 70% of Americans who don't have a college degree. That was close enough to the Census figure to earn Santorum a true rating from Politifact.\n\nUnfortunately, the Penn State graduate changed his calculation to 74% and has repeated the same incorrect stat at two debates in a row. Perhaps it's a Pennsylvania hat tip to Groundhog Day or maybe he needs a math refresher. Our verdict was and remains false.
1. Health care bill vote: The House will vote on a bill to repeal and replace Obamacare on Thursday.\n\nIf the measure is approved, it would be a big win for President Trump, who made repealing Obamacare one of the central promises of his campaign.\n\nThe bill would also need to be approved by the Senate before becoming law.\n\nAs originally introduced, the legislation would leave 24 million fewer people insured by 2026 than under Obamacare, the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office said.\n\nThere will not be a new CBO report before Thursday's vote on the legislation.\n\n2. French election finale: Far-right candidate Marine Le Pen and independent centrist Emmanuel Macron went head-to-head in a televised debate on Wednesday.\n\nA snap poll conducted for CNN affiliate BFMTV said 63% of respondents found Macron more convincing than Le Pen.\n\nA surprise win for Le Pen in the final vote on Sunday would likely produce a strong market response. Le Pen wants to bring back the French franc and possibly pull France out of the European Union.\n\nThe difference in yields on French and German government bonds has narrowed in recent days, suggesting investors are confident of a Macron win.\n\n3.

Apache (APA), Occidental Petroleum (OXY) and Chesapeake Energy (CHK) are all scheduled to report before the opening bell.\n\nOil prices have dipped below $50 per barrel in recent days as optimism over a production cut strategy agreed between major producers has faded. The idea was that production cuts would get rid of excess supply and help support prices.

(CNN) —\n\nPresident Donald Trump's relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin is remarkable on a number of levels but none more so than this one: For a man who is ready, willing and able to attack anyone, Trump never has a bad word to say about Putin. And for a man who appears to have the attention span and message discipline of a toddler, Trump is somehow able to stick to his say-nothing-bad-about-Putin strategy.\n\nIt's actually somewhat amazing when you think about it. Which is what this tweet from David Gelles, executive producer of CNN's political programming, got me to do over the weekend:\n\nThings Trump Has Insulted on Twitter more than Putin (a partial list):\n\nAmazon\n\nNFL players who kneel\n\nJudges\n\nRobert De Niro\n\nHarley Davidson\n\nMitch McConnell\n\nThe Red Hen\n\nJeff Sessions\n\nUCLA basketball players\n\nOprah\n\nMaxine Waters\n\nStunning, no? And as Gelles notes, this is far from a complete list of Twitter attacks from Trump. To expand on Gelles' list, here's some of what Trump has recently tweeted about the 11 people, places or things listed above.\n\n1. Amazon: The Amazon Washington Post has gone crazy against me ever since they lost the Internet Tax Case in the U.S. Supreme Court two months ago. Next up is the U.S. Post Office which they use, at a fraction of real cost, as their delivery boy for a BIG percentage of their packages….In my opinion the Washington Post is nothing more than an expensive (the paper loses a fortune) lobbyist for Amazon. Is it used as protection against antitrust claims which many feel should be brought? (7/23/18)\n\n2. NFL players who kneel: The NFL National Anthem Debate is alive and well again - can't believe it! Isn't it in contract that players must stand at attention, hand on heart? The $40,000,000 Commissioner must now make a stand. First time kneeling, out for game. Second time kneeling, out for season/no pay! (7/20/18)\n\n3. Judges: Hiring many thousands of judges, and going through a long and complicated legal process, is not the way to go - will always be disfunctional. People must simply be stopped at the Border and told they cannot come into the U.S. illegally. Children brought back to their country. (6/25/18)\n\n4. Robert De Niro: Robert De Niro, a very Low IQ individual, has received too many shots to the head by real boxers in movies. I watched him last night and truly believe he may be 'punch-drunk.' (6/13/18)\n\n5. Harley Davidson:  Harley-Davidson should stay 100% in America, with the people that got you your success. I've done so much for you, and then this. Other companies are coming back where they belong! We won't forget, and neither will your customers or your now very HAPPY competitors! (6/27/18)\n\n6. Mitch McConnell: Can you believe that Mitch McConnell, who has screamed Repeal & Replace for 7 years, couldn't get it done. Must Repeal & Replace ObamaCare! (8/10/17)\n\n7. The Red Hen: The Red Hen Restaurant should focus more on cleaning its filthy canopies, doors and windows (badly needs a paint job) rather than refusing to serve a fine person like Sarah Huckabee Sanders. I always had a rule, if a restaurant is dirty on the outside, it is dirty on the inside! (6/25/18)\n\n8. Jeff Sessions: The Russian Witch Hunt Hoax continues, all because Jeff Sessions didn't tell me he was going to recuse himself…I would have quickly picked someone else. So much time and money wasted, so many lives ruined…and Sessions knew better than most that there was No Collusion! (6/5/18)\n\n9. UCLA basketball players: Do you think the three UCLA Basketball Players will say thank you President Trump? They were headed for 10 years in jail! (11/15/17)\n\n10. Oprah: Just watched a very insecure Oprah Winfrey, who at one point I knew very well, interview a panel of people on 60 Minutes. The questions were biased and slanted, the facts incorrect. Hope Oprah runs so she can be exposed and defeated just like all of the others! (2/18/2018)\n\n11. Maxine Waters: Crazy Maxine Waters, said by some to be one of the most corrupt people in politics, is rapidly becoming, together with Nancy Pelosi, the FACE of the Democrat Party. Her ranting and raving, even referring to herself as a wounded animal, will make people flee the Democrats (7/3/18)\n\nIn each of these cases, Trump would say he is responding to being attacked – whether directly (as is the case with De Niro) or indirectly (NFL players kneeling). They hit him. So he hit them back.\n\nAnd yet: The US intelligence community has unanimously concluded that Russia sought to interfere in the 2016 election – a move that seems like a direct shot at, well, democracy itself. And Trump remains silent on Putin and the country he rules. Hmmm.

(Photo by CJ Gunther-Pool/Getty Images)\n\nStory highlights This isn't the first time Barack Obama has weighed in on events during Donald Trump's presidency Obama clearly feels these are extraordinary times, Cillizza writes\n\n(CNN) —\n\nFormer President Barack Obama had a blunt message for his successor on Sunday night: I'm not letting the Affordable Care Act go down without a fight.\n\nIt is my fervent hope and the hope of millions that, regardless of party, such courage is still possible, Obama said while accepting a Profile in Courage award at the John F. Kennedy Library in Boston. That today's members of Congress, regardless of party, are willing to look at the facts and speak the truth. Even when it contradicts party positions. I hope that current members of Congress recall that it doesn't take a lot of courage to aid those who are already powerful.\n\nObama's plea comes just days after House Republicans took the first step toward dismantling the ACA – aka Obamacare – with the narrow passage of the American Health Care Act last Thursday. It also comes on the verge of the Republican-controlled Senate beginning its own consideration of a plan to repeal and replace Obamacare.\n\nAnd it sends a strong signal that the 44th president isn't going to simply sit on the sidelines as the 45th President takes apart his signature legislative accomplishment. He's going to not only defend the law but also make the affirmative case for it.\n\nThis isn't the first time Obama has weighed in on events during Donald Trump's presidency. In late January, in the wake of Trump's travel ban executive order – and the protests that almost immediately sprung up – the former president released a statement through a spokesman praising the demonstrations as what we expect to see when American values are at stake.\n\nObama's willingness to wade into the national conversation – and offer not-so-oblique criticisms of Trump – is something of a break from presidential tradition. Typically, ex-presidents largely avoid any sort of engagement on the policies of their successor. George W. Bush, for example, virtually disappeared during Obama's term. (Worth noting: Bush's vice president, Dick Cheney, was an early and active critic of Obama.)\n\nObama, however, clearly feels these are extraordinary times. While he worked hard publicly to ensure that the handoff of power to Trump was orderly and respectful, it's obvious that Obama not only disagrees deeply with his successor's worldview but that he also regards Trump's approach and actions as potentially very dangerous to the country.\n\nAnd, given those stakes, he can't sit on the sidelines. In fact, Obama said as much in the farewell address he gave in Chicago in January.\n\nDemocracy can buckle when we give in to fear, he said at one point. So just as we, as citizens, must remain vigilant against external aggression, we must guard against a weakening of the values that make us who we are.\n\nAt the end of that speech, Obama promised: I won't stop; in fact, I will be right there with you, as a citizen, for all my days that remain.\n\nHe isn't stopping – particularly with the health care system that bears his names in peril. If the Senate wants to repeal and replace Obamacare, Obama seemed to be saying Sunday night, they're going to have to go through me.
(CNN) Mike Bloomberg's rivals tore into his claim to be the best candidate to defeat Donald Trump in November by branding him as a misogynistic, Obamacare-hating, soft-on-Wall-Street bully -- basically the rough equivalent of that other New York billionaire.\n\nThe question now is whether the torching that unfolded after Bloomberg's first turn on the debate stage in Las Vegas will matter more than the billions of advertising dollars he's doling out to purchase a poll surge and saturate the airwaves with a positive image of himself.\n\nThe former New York mayor knew he'd face fierce heat Wednesday night from rivals who resent his stunning spending spree and his failure to take part in the first four nominating contests. Bloomberg tried to keep his focus on his central argument of the night: That the presidency is a management job, and he is a proven manager, unlike Trump.\n\nBut nothing could prepare him for the welcome that materialized and that left him struggling to counter attacks on his political and personal vulnerabilities.\n\nI'd like to talk about who we're running against -- a billionaire who calls women fat broads and horse-faced lesbians, Sen. Elizabeth Warren said moments into the clash.\n\nAnd no, I'm not talking about Donald Trump, I'm talking about Mayor Bloomberg, said Warren, who drew gasps from the audience and debated with the desperation of a candidate fighting to save her campaign.\n\nThe attacks often left the former New York mayor flatfooted. He struggled to parry attacks everyone knew were coming. By appearing to mock Turbo Tax online preparation kits, he looked out of touch with the modest economic circumstances of regular Americans.\n\nAnd he was unable to display empathy for women who are victims of workplace discrimination or Americans who struggle through life without his riches -- as his foes slammed him over his past opposition to the minimum wage. Still, he did point out that he was spending his money in philanthropic ventures -- and to get rid of Trump.\n\nEven Bloomberg's campaign seemed to admit he underwhelmed in the hideously tough assignment of walking into a debate cold after his rivals had been waging war for months.\n\nHe was just warming up tonight. We fully expect Mike will continue to build on tonight's performance when he appears on the stage in South Carolina next Tuesday, the campaign said.\n\nIn traditional presidential politics, Bloomberg's struggles on Wednesday night would pitch his campaign into serious trouble.\n\nBut while millions of people watched the debate on television and will see clips on social media, Bloomberg has been mounting the most concentrated cash dump in primary history.\n\nIt's possible that far more Americans will see his soaring ads presenting him as a moderate voice of common sense and a master manager than ever learn of his debate stage stumbles.\n\nHis $400 million push has already lifted him to second place in national polls. And Bloomberg has far more cash than his rivals to play across the entire national battlefield on Super Tuesday.\n\nIt may take a few days to find out whether Bloomberg's rivals managed to carve out a contrast between the sunny image in his campaign ads and the sometimes terse figure on stage.\n\nAnd then there's the question of whether debates matter that much anyway. It could be that the cacophony of multiple, fierce attacks from a presidential field piling on will only underscore Bloomberg's argument to centrist voters that he's different.\n\nSanders escapes without serious damage\n\nAnd there was another dynamic at play on Wednesday that suggests that even uninspiring debate performances will not fatally hole Bloomberg's campaign for weeks to come.\n\nBernie Sanders seemed to escape the debate without a significant blow to his now front-running campaign -- and had the advantage at least four other centrist rivals arguing he's too radical to beat Trump but who have failed to slow him down.\n\nIf Joe Biden, Amy Klobuchar, Elizabeth Warren and Pete Buttigieg don't find a way to consolidate the political middle soon, Bloomberg's massive resources could find him a path.\n\nI don't think there's any chance of the senator beating President Trump, Bloomberg said of Sanders, spelling out the best argument for his candidacy, save his massive fortune.\n\nThe financial data billionaire also drew on his own professional heritage to try to defuse the attacks and to present himself as the antidote to the chaos ripping through Washington.\n\nThis is a manager job and Donald Trump is not a manager, Bloomberg said.\n\nThis is a job where you have to build teams. He doesn't have teams so he makes decisions without knowing what's going or the implications for what he does. We cannot run the railroad this way, he said.\n\nIn effect, Bloomberg is asking Democrats to overlook the fact that he hardly touches the party's heart -- and may be an imperfect messenger for grass roots energy that is moving to the left. He's implicitly arguing that only he can beat Sanders and oust Trump from the Oval Office.\n\n'Why not chose a Democrat?'\n\nFrom left, Democratic presidential candidates, former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt.,former Vice President Joe Biden, former South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg, Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., stand on stage before a Democratic presidential primary debate\n\nThursday's debate also revealed another irony of the Democratic race that could come down to a battle between Sanders and Bloomberg.\n\nMost Americans don't see where they fit if they've got to choose between a socialist who thinks that capitalism is the root of all evil and a billionaire who thinks that money ought to be the root of all power, Buttigieg said.\n\nLet's put forward somebody who is actually a Democrat.\n\nWarren was the candidate who seemed to realize she had most to lose after poor performances in Iowa and New Hampshire and failing to oust Sanders as the champion of the left.\n\nAt times, the Massachusetts senator seemed to seize control of the night from the moderators and forensically dismantled Bloomberg's answers to her attacks.\n\nWe are not going to beat Donald Trump with a man who has who knows how many nondisclosure agreements and the drip, drip, drip of stories of women saying they have been harassed and discriminated against, Warren said.\n\nThe former New York City mayor has been beset by accusations that he made sexually suggestive comments in the 1990s, and that Bloomberg LP was a hostile workplace for women. His campaign has said that he sometimes made comments that did not reflect his values and that his company has always elevated women.\n\nBut Biden also faces an existential challenge to his candidacy from Bloomberg, who is essentially arguing that he's better placed to fulfill the mission around which the former Vice President has anchored his campaign beating Trump.\n\nBiden jabbed Bloomberg over a controversial policing tactic when he was New York mayor, for which he later apologized.\n\nHe said Bloomberg backed stop and frisk -- throwing close to five million young black men up against a wall.\n\nBoth Buttigieg and Klobuchar also lined up Bloomberg -- but also got involved in a bitter personal spat that appeared to reveal a real and growing dislike between them.

Listen to her plea\n\n'Realest thing I've ever seen' on 'Bachelor:' Lemon reacts to finale twist\n\n(CNN) —\n\nPresident Donald Trump complained Wednesday that he didn't receive a thank you for approving the funeral the late Sen. John McCain wanted, marking his latest grievance in his recent onslaught against the Arizona Republican.\n\nI endorsed him at his request, and I gave him the kind of funeral that he wanted, which as President I had to approve. I don't care about this. I didn't get thank you. That's OK. We sent him on the way. But I wasn't a fan of John McCain, Trump said during a speech Wednesday at a tank factory in Lima, Ohio.\n\nLast year, McCain died of brain cancer, and as part of his services, lay in state in the Capitol building in Washington.\n\nCNN previously reported that the senator, who had been held as a prisoner of war in Vietnam, did not want the President at his funeral. McCain's daughter, Meghan McCain, also revealed earlier this year that she wished Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner, Trump's daughter and son-in-law and senior advisers, had not attended the funeral.\n\nTrump's remark about the funeral came as the President has continued to denigrate the dead senator's legacy.\n\nLast weekend, Trump attacked McCain in several tweets that targeted his ties to the controversial Russia dossier and his vote against repealing Obamacare. He also referred to McCain as being last in his class at the US Naval Academy.\n\nOn Tuesday, he continued his criticism, telling reporters at the White House that I was never a fan of John McCain and I never will be.\n\nThe late senator's widow, Cindy McCain, publicized hateful messages she's been receiving since Trump's tweets, and daughter Meghan McCain has continued to respond to the President online and on ABC's The View, where she's a co-host.\n\nAll the while, a growing number Republican members of Congress have been publicly pushing back on Trump's comments, defending McCain.\n\nIn front of factory workers at the Ohio plant on Wednesday, Trump dedicated a considerable amount of time in his speech to disparaging McCain.\n\nI have to be honest, Trump said, I never liked him much. Hasn't been for me.\n\nHe said he probably never will like McCain, because John McCain received a fake and phony dossier.\n\nHe also dug into McCain's now-famous vote against a repeal of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nWhen he finally had the chance to do it, he voted against repeal and replace, the President said. Remember thumbs down?\n\nOn Tuesday, Trump falsely accused McCain of misleading the White House over how he would vote.\n\nTrump added Wednesday that veterans were on his side during the dispute, because McCain didn't get the job done with the Veterans Administration.\n\nHe also blamed McCain for wars in the Middle East.\n\nHe was calling (President George W.) Bush, President Bush all the time, 'Get into the Middle East! Get in to the Middle East,'  Trump claimed, adding we've lost tremendous health and tremendous lives in that war.\n\nCNN's Nikki Carvajal and Devan Cole contributed to this report.

John McCain are stupid and socially unnatural, Anthony Scaramucci said Thursday.\n\nHe's hitting something that is socially unnatural. And so what is that? You're attacking somebody that died seven months ago, Scaramucci told CNN's John Berman on New Day. Now, I understand the point and I understand the grievance that the President's bringing up, but you're not scoring any points with anybody.\n\nI think it's stupid. I'm being very declarative here. I think it's stupid, Scaramucci, whose short-lived tenure as White House communications director imploded due to his combative personality, said later. There's no strategy that you can tell – other than the fact that you're frustrated and you want to ventilate your frustrations into the international airwaves. OK. But I think it's stupid.\n\nOver the weekend, Trump revived his long-running feud against McCain – who died in August after a long battle with brain cancer – citing his ties to the controversial Russia dossier and his vote against repealing Obamacare. He said in the Oval Office on Tuesday that he was never a fan of John McCain and I never will be and complained on Wednesday that he wasn't thanked for giving McCain the kind of funeral that he wanted.\n\nScaramucci told Berman that he always got along with McCain, adding that he was a decorated Vietnam War veteran.\n\nThe President has the support of millions of veterans in the United States. I don't think those veterans are in love with the fact that he's attacking John McCain, he said.\n\nThe former aide also speculated about why only a few Republicans have criticized Trump's comments, saying that it's likely because they don't want to get in the Twitter crosshairs.\n\nCNN's Maegan Vazquez and Ted Barrett contributed to this report.
(CNN) —\n\nBeto O'Rourke says he supports universal health care, but he wants to take a different path to get there than many of his more progressive rivals for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination.\n\nThe former Texas representative is backing a little-known House Democratic proposal called Medicare for America, which calls for expanding government-run health coverage while keeping employer-sponsored insurance plans.\n\nFor O'Rourke, the proposal's appeal is that he thinks it moves the country to guaranteed health care more quickly than the alternatives, including the signature Medicare for All proposal from Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, an independent who is also vying for the Democratic nomination. That's in part because it would maintain the private insurance industry, which is a deal breaker among progressives.\n\nWhat it says is, if you like your employer-sponsored insurance, you like the network that you're in, you like the doctors that you can see, you're happy with that, you can keep it, O'Rourke said Thursday in Portsmouth, New Hampshire. in response to an audience question. If you do not like your employer-based insurance and want to enroll in Medicare, you can. If you have no insurance whatsoever or if you are under-insured today, you can enroll in Medicare as well.\n\nWhile many Americans like the idea of expanding Medicare, their support drops when they hear private insurance would be eliminated, according to polling by the Kaiser Family Foundation. Medicare for America would address those concerns, said Jen Tolbert, the foundation's director of state health reform.\n\nThe bill does try to strike a middle ground, she said.\n\nThe Medicare for America legislation was introduced last year by Reps. Rosa DeLauro, a Connecticut Democrat, and Jan Schakowsky, a Democrat from Illinois. But unlike most of the other Medicare for All-type plans, it doesn't have a Senate version that's supported by other candidates.\n\nThe gradual shift to a government-run program is very similar to a proposal from the Center for American Progress, a moderate left-leaning think tank. It provides the most politically viable path to universal coverage, while respecting those who like their employer coverage, said Topher Spiro, the center's vice president for health policy.\n\nFor those who are not satisfied with their employer coverage, it allows them the option to move over to the Medicare plan at their own pace, Spiro said. Our view is that people will vote with their feet.\n\nRetaining private insurance plans, however, is unlikely to win the plan many fans in the health care industry. It's still a stepping stone to a single payer system, which eliminates consumer choice and does little to address costs, said Lauren Crawford Shaver, executive director of the Partnership for America's Health Care Future, a coalition of insurance, pharmaceutical, hospital and doctor groups, which opposes all Medicare for All-type plans.\n\nHere's how Medicare for America would work:\n\nMedicare for America provides comprehensive benefits – including prescription drugs, dental, vision and long-term care – to those currently on Medicare, Medicaid and Obamacare plans, as well as to the uninsured. Newborns would automatically be enrolled.\n\nPrivate insurance, however, would continue to be an option. Large employers could keep providing benefits, though they can also help their workers buy Medicare for America coverage. Employees can also choose Medicare for America coverage over their work-based plan. And folks could opt to buy private policies through a Medicare Advantage-type plan or decide to keep their children on their work-based polices.\n\nThe legislation, however, isn't as generous as the Medicare for All proposals, which essentially provides all care at no cost. Enrollees would have to pay up to 9.7% of their monthly income as premiums, though the poor would pay nothing and subsidies would be available for the middle class. There would also be deductibles and co-pays, with an annual limit of $3,500, or $5,000 for families.\n\nTo finance the program, the plans calls for undoing the Republican tax bill, imposing a 5% surtax on adjusted gross income above $500,000, and increasing the Medicare payroll tax. Also, there would be levies on investment income above a certain threshold, tobacco products, beer, wine, liquor, and sugar-sweetened drinks. States would also have to contribute an amount equal to what they currently spend on Medicaid.
Washington (CNN) As senators decided Thursday whether to call witnesses in Donald Trump's impeachment trial, the President did what he usually does: say numerous things that aren't true.\n\nTrump critics have warned that he would be emboldened if he were acquitted by the Senate. In the hours before Republican Sen. Lamar Alexander announced he would vote against calling witnesses, likely ensuring a quick acquittal , it was at least clear that Trump was not at all chastened.\n\nOn Thursday, the President did a Fox News interview, delivered a speech in Michigan nominally about the new US-Mexico-Canada Agreement, and held a campaign rally in Des Moines, Iowa. He was dishonest in all three venues, repeating some of his favorite falsehoods in rapid succession.\n\nWe're not finished fact checking the transcripts, but here are the 27 false claims we've identified already:\n\nImpeachment\n\nTrump told Fox News' Peter Doocy of impeachment: It's a ridiculous, horrible partisan, situation. We won 196 to nothing in the House. At the event in Michigan, he said, We won 196 to nothing on a little vote a couple of weeks ago.\n\nTrump was referring to House impeachment votes he lost -- but where 196 or more Republicans voted in his favor, with none against. He lost an October vote to set the rules of the impeachment inquiry 232-196 , then the December votes on the two articles of impeachment, 230-197 and 229-198\n\nAccomplishments\n\nMan of the Year in Michigan\n\nTrump said in Michigan : In fact, I was honored, believe it or not. About 10 years ago, I came to Michigan. I was honored by a wonderful group. I was the 'Man of the Year.'\n\nThere is no evidence Trump ever got a Man of the Year award in Michigan. You can read a full fact check here\n\nEstate tax\n\nTrump claimed in Michigan and at the Iowa rally to have eliminated the estate tax, saying at the rally of his 2017 tax law: Because of that, there is no death tax or inheritance tax.\n\nThe law doubled the amount of estate value that is exempt from the estate tax, but the law did not eliminate the tax entirely. And there is no basis for his suggestion at both events that small farmers and small businesspeople would especially benefit from his changes; few paid the tax even before. You can read a full fact check here\n\nHousehold income\n\nTrump claimed in Michigan that real median household income had increased by $10,000 during his presidency.\n\nTrump was taking a private firm's estimate of about $5,000 in pre-tax household income gains and doubling it for reasons that do not make sense. You can read a full fact check here\n\nVeterans Choice\n\nTrump said at the Iowa rally: I took care of the vets. We got Choice. He added that people had unsuccessfully tried to get this veterans health care program approved for 52 years, claiming: What I am good at is getting things approved, and I got it approved.\n\nTrump did not get the Veterans Choice program passed, nor had there been an unsuccessful 52-year effort to get it passed. The program was signed into law by President Barack Obama in 2014 . In 2018, Trump signed the VA MISSION Act, which expanded and changed the Choice program.\n\nBurden-sharing with South Korea\n\nTrump said at the Iowa rally that, under a deal with South Korea about sharing the cost of the US troops in the country, They gave us $500 million a year more.\n\nAs the New York Times reported in February when debunking an earlier version of Trump's $500 million claim: Under the one-year deal, this year South Korea will pay 1.04 trillion won, or $925 million, an increase of $70 million from last year's $855 million.\n\nThe USMCA\n\nTrump said at the Iowa rally: USMCA: the biggest trade deal ever signed in the history of the world. OK, it is.\n\nExcept that it's not. The Trans-Pacific Partnership included all three of the countries in the USMCA -- the US, Mexico and Canada -- plus nine others. Also, it's worth noting that the USMCA mostly makes incremental tweaks to the previous North American Free Trade Agreement. You can read a full fact check here\n\nEnergy production\n\nTrump said at the Iowa rally: We've ended the war on American energy. The United States is now the number one producer of oil and natural gas anywhere on Earth, by far.\n\nThe US has not just now become the world's top energy producer: it took the top spot in 2012, according to the US government's Energy Information Administration -- under the very Obama administration Trump is accusing of perpetrating a war on the industry.\n\nYou can read a full fact check here\n\nMexican border\n\nTrump said of Mexico at the Iowa rally: They put up 27,000 soldiers on our southern border.\n\nMexico has deployed around 27,000 troops, but Trump exaggerated how many are being stationed near the US border in particular. CNN reported on November 2 that the Mexican government had reported the following: Nearly 15,000 troops are deployed to Mexico's northern border, where they've set up 20 checkpoints. ... At the southern border, 12,000 troops are deployed and have set up 21 checkpoints. You can read a full fact check here\n\nIndividual mandate\n\nTrump said at the Iowa rally: We got rid of the individual mandate, the most unpopular thing, which essentially killed Obamacare.\n\nThe individual mandate, which required Americans to obtain health insurance, was indeed a key part of Obamacare -- but Trump hasn't killed Obamacare, essentially or otherwise. He has not eliminated Obamacare's expansion of the Medicaid insurance program for low-income people, the federal and state marketplaces that allow people to shop for coverage, or the consumer subsidies that help many of them make the purchases.\n\nPre-existing conditions\n\nTrump said at the Iowa rally: We are protecting people with pre-existing conditions, and we always will the Republican Party.\n\n\n\nFederal judges The Trump administration and congressional Republicans have repeatedly put forward bills and filed lawsuits that would weaken Obamacare's protections for people with pre-existing conditions. Trump is currently supporting a Republican lawsuit that is seeking to declare all of Obamacare void.\n\nTrump said at the Iowa rally: To uphold the rule of law, we have confirmed 191 federal judges, a record...And two great Supreme Court justices, by the way.\n\nTrump had not set a record for total judges appointed as of this point in a first presidential term; Jimmy Carter had appointed 197 judges by late January of his fourth year in office, according to data from Russell Wheeler , a visiting fellow at the Brookings Institution who tracks judicial appointments. Wheeler said Trump has appointed 187 judges by traditional counting methods -- two Supreme Court justices, 50 appeals court judges and 135 district court judges -- but that it's possible to get to a total of 191 judges by adding Trump's three appointments to the Court of Federal Claims and his designation of a sitting judge on that court as chief judge.\n\nDrug overdose deaths\n\nTrump said at the Iowa rally: Drug overdose deaths have declined for the first time in nearly 31 years.\n\nThis was one of Trump's trademark little exaggerations of accomplishments that need no exaggeration. The decline in overdose deaths in 2018 was the first since 1990 , 28 years prior.\n\nThe 2016 election\n\nThe Electoral College margin over Clinton\n\nTrump said at the Iowa rally of the Electoral College margin in the 2016 election: We got 306 to 223.\n\nHillary Clinton earned 232, not 223, electoral votes to Trump's 306. This was not a one-time slip; Trump habitually says 223.\n\nThe relative size of that Electoral College margin\n\nTrump said in Michigan: But we had a tremendous, landslide Electoral College victory, like people haven't seen in a long time.\n\nAside from Trump's dubious characterization of the result as an Electoral College landslide -- the winning candidate has earned a larger share of electoral votes in 45 of 58 presidential elections, the New York Times has noted -- it's not true that people haven't seen such a margin of victory in a long time. Obama had a bigger margin in both of the two previous elections.\n\nA Clinton crowd\n\nTrump said in Michigan that Hillary Clinton had a small gathering of about 400 people at her final Michigan rally of the 2016 election.\n\nDemocrats\n\nTrade with South Korea\n\nTrump said at the Iowa rally that Clinton had promised that a trade agreement with South Korea was going to produce 250,000 jobs.\n\nThere is no record of Clinton projecting an increase of 250,000 jobs because of the United States-Korea Free Trade Agreement (KORUS). Obama said the deal would support at least 70,000 American jobs.\n\nObama said in 2009 that increasing the US share of trade with Asia from 9% to 10% could mean 250,000, 300,000 jobs, but he was not specifically attributing that estimate to the potential effects of a trade deal with South Korea.\n\nA Biden crowd\n\nTrump said at the Iowa rally that Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden drew a speech crowd so small that the campaign turned it into a roundtable discussion, roping in unwitting attendees to answer questions like, What do you think of socialism?\n\nThere is simply no evidence this happened. Biden's campaign says it didn't, and Trump's campaign did not respond to a request to identify the event he was talking about.\n\nOpen borders\n\nTrump said at the Iowa rally that Democrats support open borders.\n\nEven prominent Democrats who advocate the decriminalization of the act of illegally entering the country, such as Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, do not support completely unrestricted migration, as Trump regularly suggests.\n\nSocial Security\n\nAsked by Doocy about allegations he wants to take away Social Security -- he vaguely told CNBC last week that entitlement programs will be on his plate at some point -- Trump said I'm the one that saved it. The Democrats wanted to do it last time.\n\nTrump wasn't clear what he meant by do it, but prominent Democrats did not want to cut Social Security, much less take it away, when Trump was running in 2016. Clinton proposed to increase Social Security benefits.\n\nGreen New Deal\n\nTrump said at the Iowa rally that Democratic Hawaii Sen. Mazie Hirono had endorsed the Green New Deal environmental proposal, then they started screaming at her in Hawaii because the proposal would mean no more airplanes, which she had not known. Trump suggested, mockingly, that she responded that we're going to build a railroad with the world's largest track.\n\nThat is not what happened; Trump was twisting an exchange Hirono had with a reporter. You can read a full fact check here\n\nChina and tariffs\n\nAgricultural purchases\n\nTrump said at the Iowa rally that the most China ever spent on US agricultural products in a year is $16 billion, claiming that Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue told him this.\n\nChina spent $25.9 billion on American agricultural products in 2012, according to figures from the Department of Agriculture. In 2017, the year before the trade war began, China spent $19.5 billion. In 2016, it was $21.4 billion. Chinese purchases plummeted to $9.1 billion in 2018.\n\nTariffs on China\n\nTrump said at the Iowa rally of his tariffs on China: We never got 10 cents from China. China took from us. We didn't take from China right.\n\nNumerous studies have shown that Americans, not China, are paying most of the cost of Trump's tariffs. In addition, it's not true the US has never received 10 cents from tariffs on China. The US has had tariffs on China for more than two centuries; FactCheck.org reported that the US generated an average of $12.3 billion in custom duties a year from 2007 to 2016, according to the U.S. International Trade Commission DataWeb.\n\nThe media\n\nCNN cameras\n\nTrump criticized CNN at the Iowa rally, then pointed at the back of the room and said, Oops, their camera just went off. Look, their camera. It just went off, CNN.\n\nCNN's photojournalists do not turn off cameras when Trump insults CNN, and Trump would not be able to notice even if they did: they do not use any light that goes on and off when they start and stop recording.\n\nTrump has repeatedly made this false claim at his rallies. You can read a full fact check here\n\nDemocrats and the Rolls-Royce\n\nAt the Iowa rally, Trump said the media humorlessly accused him of lying when he had told a joke that California Gov. Gavin Newsom wanted to give undocumented immigrants a free Rolls-Royce.
(CNN) —\n\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan announced on Wednesday morning he would be leaving Congress and it was a matter of minutes before everyone was speculating about his successor.\n\nThe speaker's decision spun the Republican conference into a frenzy Wednesday as lawmakers placed their own bets and weighed in on the palace intrigue of who would hold the gavel next.\n\nIt's will be seven months before of any leadership race. Ryan was emphatic Wednesday that he plans to remain in his job, but members say even before his formal announcement, the fight for speaker was playing out in subtle ways behind the scenes. With Ryan officially out, the race is expected to go into overdrive.\n\nThe conference's eyes are on two frontrunners at the moment: Kevin McCarthy, the amicable majority leader who has forged a close bond with President Donald Trump but was unable to clinch the speakership in 2015, and Majority Whip Steve Scalise, the third in command of the House whose conservative credentials could help him win support from the right-flank of the party.\n\nThe Louisiana Republican became a national figure after his near-death experience last June when he was shot by a gunman targeting GOP members at a morning baseball practice. His remarkable recovery was featured in a 60 Minutes story and after returning and being barely able to stand, Scalise now is walking with crutches and has hit the campaign trail to raise money for his colleagues.\n\nRELATED: There is a wave of Republicans leaving Congress, updated again\n\nScalise has said publicly he won't directly challenge McCarthy in the race, but the conference remains in a holding pattern until McCarthy makes his move. He signaled his potential interest in running for the top spot recently in an interview with Politico saying, I wouldn't rule it out, depending on the political environment.\n\nHe added, obviously, I've shown interest in the past at moving up. I've enjoyed being in leadership. I feel like I've had a strong influence on some of the things that we've done, and I've helped put together coalitions to pass a full repeal of Obamacare.\n\nA source close to Scalise pointed to those public comments, suggesting that Ryan's Wednesday decision was something people were still digesting before making any new moves.\n\nEven before today, there was speculation. Obviously there are ambitions out there, one GOP member told CNN, speaking anonymously to discuss the state of the race freely. Scalise and McCarthy had already been positioning themselves for the next leadership race. They're already doing favors for members, hosting members, doing fundraisers for members, helping members get legislation through.\n\nOne leadership source told CNN that members have been approaching the leaders about what a post-Paul Ryan world would look like for some time.\n\nBut both McCarthy and Scalise tried Wednesday to redirect the Ryan news away from them, downplaying questions about their futures and refusing to state explicitly their plans.\n\nWe have a speaker of the House, McCarthy said Wednesday when asked if he'd be running. We have a legislative agenda, lot of months still to go. And we gotta keep the majority. … There is no leadership election. Paul is speaker right now.\n\nSome Republicans suggested that to avoid a messy protracted contest there may be maneuvering between the two top camps about putting together a slate for the GOP conference to approve that would allow current leaders to ascend.\n\nWaiting for November\n\nTrump will likely loom large in the race. He has called McCarthy My Kevin and the two have developed a close relationship. If he weighs in with an endorsement that could effectively end the race. Ryan also signaled that he will talk about who he thinks should fill the post in the post, saying Wednesday, I'll share those thoughts later.\n\nDuring an interview Wednesday, Ryan said he had thoughts on who should succeed him, but he wouldn't weigh in yet.\n\nI don' think this is the time to get into it, Ryan said.\n\nPushed to answer when it would be time, he said, after November is when that gets decided.\n\nFor now, the conference will remain in a holding pattern, a kind of political purgatory that members aren't sure is sustainable long-term as they begin gearing up for the midterms and chart their agenda for a Congress after Ryan.\n\nRep. Steve Womack, the Chairman of the House Budget Committee, said he worried about a long, drawn-out leadership race.\n\nWe have an election coming up in November, the midterms so I'm not really sure you're going to see a lot of productivity from the Congress anyway, but you know lame duck speakers, that's an additional challenge to the conference, Womack said.\n\nMany were shocked by Ryan's announcement Wednesday morning. While the growing belief was that Ryan would step down after the midterms, few expected the speaker – a fundraising powerhouse – to announce he was stepping down before the midterms were over.\n\nOne GOP source involved in House races said they viewed any potential leadership race between Scalise and McCarthy as a financial windfall for their party, with the two men scrambling to see who can raise the most campaign cash in order to curry favor with their colleagues, adding to Ryan who will continue to be a presence on the fundraising circuit, the source said.\n\nAll eyes on McCarthy\n\nMcCarthy's been here before.\n\nIn the days that followed House Speaker John Boehner's retirement announcement, McCarthy, the then-majority leader, stepped up to run for Speaker, but was rebuffed by conservatives who put forth a competing candidate. In a stunning move, McCarthy withdrew his name during a conference-wide election and the leadership election was postponed.\n\nA source close to McCarthy told CNN at the time that the decision to drop out came down to numbers, pure and simple, adding that McCarthy had the votes to win the conference vote, but there just wasn't a path to 218 – the number of votes needed to lock down the speakership on the House floor.\n\nEventually, Ryan was drafted.\n\nNow, the question remains if McCarthy – who has a close relationship with Trump – would be able to overcome his past obstacles.\n\nA leadership source told CNN that that Scalise's intention is to be ready in the case that McCarthy isn't.\n\nMembers also are eager to avoid any kind of embarrassing or dramatic leadership showdown like the one that transpired in 2015.\n\nI was very concerned when Paul Ryan was drafted in because we had a serious vacuum, said Florida Republican Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart. I think Paul Ryan has really put together and has been able to lead a very solid leadership team. I think again he is a huge loss, but I think the leadership team is very solid.\n\nDiaz-Balart emphasized that McCarthy and Scalise had learned a lot since 2015. Since then, the conference has seen the election of a Republican President, passed tax reform and repealed a key piece of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nAnother question remains whether Republicans will even hold the majority in 2018 and need to draft a speaker at all.\n\nHere's the bottom line. Anybody who starts spreading ideas about a race that we have not won is bad timing, bad behavior and bad posturing, said House Rules Chairman Pete Sessions. I would encourage my team to recognize that while the Speaker has served quite admirably, we are in a very difficult position at this time.\n\nCould it be anyone's gavel?\n\nMembers are also reluctant to rule anyone out this early in the game. As the conference continues to reel from Ryan's news, members say in the GOP conference, anything's possible.\n\nWho knows. I think it could very well be wide open. Kevin and Steve are two who are looking at it very seriously … but with this conference, anything can happen, one Republican members said. I think it's totally and completely wide open.\n\nRep. Mark Walker, the chairman of the GOP Study Committee, also warned against making predictions in a Speaker's race that appears to be months away.\n\nHistorically, there have been dark horses in the past, Walker said. I don't really want to get into this the same day. The body's not even cold yet around here, which is how it works. … You have two names that are being discussed, but you have to kind of wait and see these things.\n\nOne conservative source told CNN that they viewed the seven-month window for the leadership race as a major advantage for conservatives in the House Freedom Caucus who might have time to organize and leverage themselves. The source told CNN that the right flank of the party might not put forth a candidate for speaker, but could do something like trade votes for speaker for assurances that one of their own would be placed in a leadership slot.\n\nOur friends in the Freedom Caucus recognize that they have leverage here and I think the question is not necessarily which one of them is going to run but how they can maximize that leverage, the source said.\n\nHouse Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows said Wednesday that the Freedom Caucus needed a seat in leadership.\n\nI think everyone will start jockeying for position immediately, he said. They won't wait for nine months.\n\nCNN's Manu Raju, Jeremy Herb and Phil Mattingly contributed to this report.
Washington (CNN) Lawyers for the Democratic-led House of Representatives as well as California and other Democratic-led states asked the Supreme Court Friday to immediately step in to decide the fate of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nCalling the law a fixture of the American health-care system Donald Verrilli, a lawyer for the House, urged the justices in legal briefs to review a remarkable lower court decision that threatens profound destabilization of the health care system.\n\nThe present case represents yet another effort by litigants who disagree with the policy judgments embodied in the ACA to use the courts, rather than the democratic process, to undo the work of the people's elected representatives, the filing states.\n\nLast month, a federal appeals court held that the law's individual mandate was unconstitutional , but sent the case back down to a lower court to decide whether other provisions of the sprawling law should remain in effect.\n\nThe petition filed by supporters of the law is a long shot bid because the Supreme Court does not usually like to take up an issue until it has made its way through the lower courts. But if the necessary four justices agree to hear the case and expedite it for this term -- it would mean that the justices would render a decision concerning the fate of the controversial law this spring, just as the presidential election gears up.\n\nRead More
People living in sparsely populated areas who shopped for coverage on the Obamacare exchanges in 2017 frequently had just one or two insurers from which to pick and often faced significantly higher premiums than did people in more urban areas, according to a new study.\n\nAs insurers finalize plans for participating in the 2018 exchanges, policy experts have speculated that the uncertainty surrounding the Affordable Care Act will lead insurers to continue to pull back from some markets or exit them altogether, leaving a growing number of people with fewer, pricier options.\n\nInsurers in most states have until mid-June to decide, but news has slowly trickled out. Aetna (AET) announced earlier this week that next year the company will not participate in the individual market in Delaware and Nebraska, the last two states in which it currently sells exchange plans.\n\nRelated: Aetna to Obamacare: We're outta here\n\nThis year, about a third of the country's population live in areas where just one or two insurers sold policies on these ACA marketplaces, the Urban Institute analysis found. That included four states — Alaska, Alabama, North Carolina and Oklahoma — as well as rural areas of several others.\n\nIn regions with just one insurer, monthly premiums were $451 or higher in half of the benchmark silver plans on which premium subsidies are based. In contrast, in areas where six or more insurers offered plans, monthly premiums were much lower for comparable coverage: Half were $270 or less.\n\nPremium growth from 2016 to 2017 also varied substantially based on how many insurers participated in a region: Median premium growth was 30% in areas with one insurer versus 5% in regions with six or more carriers.\n\nAll the problems seem to be very strongly correlated with the size of the population, said Linda Blumberg, a senior fellow in the Health Policy Center at the Urban Institute, who co-authored the analysis. If you've got a big population, more insurers are coming in to compete for that business.\n\nRelated: Obamacare: What's going right. What's going wrong\n\nFor the analysis, researchers analyzed the premiums for a 40-year-old nonsmoker in benchmark plans in each of the 498 rating areas in the U.S.\n\nThe rating areas with just one or two insurers were concentrated in the South.

Trump, Cruz go to war with one week until Iowa\n\nStory highlights Ted Cruz's campaign and two pro-Cruz super PACs are airing ads against Donald Trump's position on abortion from a 1999 Meet the Press interview I am pro-choice in every respect, Trump said in the interview\n\n(CNN) —\n\nTed Cruz and two allied super PACs launched a television broadside against Donald Trump on Monday, dedicating big money behind ads attacking the billionaire for New York values, particularly past support for partial-birth abortion.\n\nThe ads use identical quotes from Trump's 1999 interview on Meet the Press in which he declares I am pro-choice in every respect.\n\nCampaigns and super PACs are not allowed to coordinate on advertising, but the unified front against Trump comes just one week before the Iowa caucuses and continue Cruz's theme of painting the New York billionaire as out-of-touch with Iowa values.\n\nHey I lived in New York City and Manhattan all my life, so my views are a little bit different than if I lived in Iowa, Trump said on the Meet the Press interview, a quote spliced into the Cruz campaign ad.\n\nThe super PAC ads come from rival pro-Cruz groups Keep the Promise I and Stand for Truth.\n\nSuper PAC ads\n\nThe Cruz-endorsed Keep the Promise I group, moved Monday in two 30-second advertisements to paint Trump as politically opportunistic. The new spot, Extreme, uses the Trump interview with Meet the Press host Tim Russert. A second Keep the Promise spot, which was already being shown to voters on digital platforms, uses Trump praising Cruz as a conservative fighter.\n\nThey are part of a $2.5 million television campaign in Iowa and South Carolina by Keep the Promise I, the first negative spots from the super PAC.\n\nStand for Truth, a relatively new super PAC with as of yet unknown backers and advisers, latched on to the interview as well and shows Trump on Times Square billboards speaking about New York values – the term used by Cruz himself to attack Trump in Iowa.\n\nA Stand for Truth spokesman, Eric Lycan, did not respond to a request for comment Monday about when the ad would air or how much money was behind it. The group has pledged to spend $4 million on his behalf.\n\nAnd the torrent of new ads continued all day, with a new Keep the Promise spot Monday evening that targeted Trump on a different vulnerability: his support for Obamacare, or as the ad christened it, Trumpcare.\n\nFirst there was Hillarycare. the ad begins. Then there was Obamacare, it continues, drawing on Trump quotes in support of a coverage mandate. We can't afford Trumpcare.\n\nCNN's Dana Bash contributed to this report

Perhaps, Trump said at the annual Governors' Dinner.\n\nThe dinner was first lady Melania Trump's first time officially hosting a major social event at the White House, which Trump noted in his toast.\n\nGovernors from around the country gathered in the White House for the dinner, packing the room alongside administration figures and their families. Chief of Staff Reince Priebus could be seen seated alongside fellow Wisconsinite Gov. Scott Walker.\n\nTrump entered the room with his wife after Vice President Mike Pence and second lady Karen Pence.\n\nHe boasted of his accomplishments in the few weeks since taking office and said, It's been a lot of fun.\n\nPointing to the meetings with governors slated for the next day, Trump said Obamacare has tremendous problems and needed to be repealed and replaced, which he said would be one topic among others at the pretty big sessions they would have.\n\nI think you're going to see something very special, Trump said.\n\nHe invited governors to hit the ground running ahead of the meetings and said they could speak with Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price at the event.\n\nThe President concluded his toast by inviting Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe, a Democrat and the chairman of the National Governors Association, to give a toast. He described McAuliffe as a friend and a very good guy, but also said, I just destroyed his political career.\n\nMcAuliffe told the crowd he expected they would have the greatest NGA meeting in the history of NGA meetings and offered a toast to the President.\n\nFirst major social event of Trump White House\n\nThe President, who doesn't drink, toasted with water. Governors were spotted snapping photos on their cell phones as he gave remarks.\n\nThe first lady had made sure to note that Sunday evening's dinner in the State Dining room was a time to put politics aside.\n\nI am proud to invite all the governors to the White House for this important annual event, Melania Trump, who wore a dark sleeveless gown, said in a statement earlier Sunday. Tonight, we come together as one Nation, leaving political labels and partisan interests behind.\n\nThe black-tie dinner is the first major social event of the Trump administration, planned by the East Wing under first lady Melania Trump and a cadre of aides and advisers, including acting senior adviser Stephanie Winston Wolkoff.\n\nOne of the first lady's longtime friends and confidants, Winston Wolkoff was previously the events director at Vogue magazine, orchestrating high-wattage events like the Met Gala.\n\nThe evening's theme, per the White House, was Spring's Renewal, drawing upon nature and florals for inspiration. Tables covered in white tablecloths were adorned with white and green floral arrangements, tall white candlesticks, and White House china (it was not immediately clear which administration's table setting was used Sunday evening).\n\nThe White House has come to life, gleaming with a dazzling, sensorial experience of eternal spring, the White House said in the statement.\n\nThe scents of jasmine and roses fill the air as we give thanks for this great Nation and the glory of renewal, the first lady said.\n\nIvanka Trump, who spent the earlier part of her Sunday at a monster truck rally in Baltimore, made the quick change into a strapless black gown, posing for a photo with Jared Kushner outside their home in DC's Kalorama neighborhood.\n\nFrom the monster truck show to the Governor's Ball… she tweeted before the evening began.\n\nFrom the monster truck show to the Governor's Ball... pic.twitter.com/CIe6SKHwTN — Ivanka Trump (@IvankaTrump) February 26, 2017\n\nFor his part, tuxedo-clad President Trump seemed to enjoy his surroundings.\n\nI want to just congratulate the first lady on having done a really beautiful job.

Washington (CNN) Chief Justice John Roberts made crystal clear Friday night that he has no intention of intervening in the Senate impeachment trial of President Donald Trump by casting a tie-breaking vote.\n\nSpeculation had mounted during the trial whether Roberts would act, as Democrats hoped the chief could help them force the Republican majority to allow witnesses to be called. A chief justice had previously settled Senate ties in an impeachment trial -- back in 1868 -- Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, noted.\n\nBut when asked directly about whether he would get involved, Roberts said he would not.\n\nHere's the exchange:\n\nSchumer: Is the chief justice aware that in the impeachment trial of President Johnson, Chief Justice Chase, as presiding officer, cast tie-breaking votes on both March 31 and April 2, 1868?\n\nRead More

Four in ten voters in 2018 said health care was the most important issue facing the country, according to a CNN exit poll, as they swept a wave of Democratic lawmakers into office to give Democrats the majority in the House of Representatives.\n\nAnd now that they have lost the majority, Republicans have virtually no chance of passing any legislation that would repeal and replace President Barack Obama's signature health care law.\n\nBut Trump has been obstinate in the face of those political warning signs, instead concerned that repealing and replacing Obamacare remains the one signature 2016 campaign promise he has yet to make good on.\n\nIt's with that in mind that Trump backed his White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney's arguments that the administration should support a federal judge's ruling in Texas invalidating Obamacare in its entirety, a senior White House official and Republican close to the campaign told CNN.\n\nRight now in the Texas court – probably ends up in the Supreme Court, Trump told reporters on Friday. But we're doing something right now that will be much less expensive than Obamacare for the people.\n\nBut what exactly that is remains a work in progress.\n\nThe uncertainty hasn't stopped Trump from tying himself and his party to the issue.\n\nA week of health care moves\n\nAfter the administration kicked off the week with its surprise shift to supporting the invalidation of the Affordable Care Act in the Texas case, Trump has been beating the drum constantly, thrusting the thorny issue into the center of the political arena even as federal judges in other cases ruled against him. On Wednesday, one jettisoned the administration's approval of Medicaid work requirements in two states and another on Thursday blocked a rule that would make it easier for small businesses to band together to buy health insurance, which could undermine Obamacare.\n\nTrump's efforts have prompted grumbles – private and public – from Republican lawmakers mindful of the uphill battle Trump is setting them up for.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on Thursday sought to distance his caucus from Trump's latest venture, saying he looks forward to seeing what the President is proposing and what he can work out with the (House) speaker.\n\nThe President, they said, wants to telegraph to his political base that he is standing firm on his promise to repeal the entire law despite failing to wrangle Republicans to do just that during a drawn out legislative battle in 2017, when the party held both chambers of Congress. And he is now pinning his hopes on the courts accomplishing what he and a Republican majority in the House and Senate could not.\n\nWe have a chance of killing Obamacare. We almost did it but somebody unfortunately surprised us with thumbs down, but we'll do it a different way. You know what? We'll do it a different way, Trump told his supporters at a rally in Grand Rapids, Michigan on Thursday night. So we're going to get rid of Obamacare and I said it the other day: The Republican Party will become the party of great health care. It's good. It's important.\n\nTrump's decision to support a ruling that would fully dismantle Obamacare, even as his administration has no viable alternative, is a risky gamble. If the ruling is upheld by higher courts, about 20 million Americans could lose healthcare coverage on Trump's watch.\n\nIt was that concern – and qualms about the legal justification for the move – that drew objections from Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar, Attorney General William Barr and White House counsel Pat Cipollone as the White House debated its position on the Texas lawsuit, which was brought by a coalition of Republican-led states. The Texas ruling is being appealed by a coalition of Democratic-governed states, because the Trump administration declined to defend the law in the first place.\n\nPresidential working group\n\nThe President said Thursday he had tasked a handful of Republican senators with cobbling together an Obamacare replacement. No such working group appears to exist, however.\n\nI think the President just listed off the names of people he's spoken to on the phone about health care, one Senate Republican aide told CNN.\n\nSpokesmen for Sens. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana and Rick Scott of Florida, two of the Republican senators Trump listed as being part of the group, said the senators have continued to have conversations with the President and their colleagues about healthcare issues, but made no mention of a working group.\n\nSen. John Barrasso of Wyoming, the third senator Trump name-checked, spoke with Trump about health care on Wednesday morning, but his staff said they did not have anything to share at the moment when asked about the specific working group.\n\nThe President's comments about the senators amounted to the latest attempt by the White House to reassure the public that it will have a replacement plan ready by the time the courts render a final judgment.\n\nJust a day earlier, Marc Short, Vice President Mike Pence's chief of staff and the former White House legislative affairs director, claimed on CNN that the President will be putting forward plans this year to replace Obamacare through Congress.\n\nWhite House officials were quick to tell CNN that Short had gotten ahead of White House deliberations.\n\nThe White House has yet to decide whether it will take the lead on crafting an Obamacare replacement, they said, or whether the President will punt to Republican lawmakers.\n\nCNN's Tami Luhby, Sarah Westwood and Jeff Zeleny contributed to this report.
